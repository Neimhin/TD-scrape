RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the programme for Government, the Taoiseach committed to a shared future for all, in the aftermath of Covid. He and the Tánaiste repeatedly said that workers who have played a key role in keeping our society going during Covid should get a reward. Will the Taoiseach comment on the shocking efforts by Aer Lingus, the national flag carrier, to try to impose a pay freeze on 1,000 ground staff until 2024 and a 10% reduction in its rostered allowances, against which the workers have now voted twice? In the most recent result in the past few days, 85% of the workers voted against this shocking attempt to cut their pay. These workers are faced with inflation which is now, according to the Department of Finance, looking as though it will go up to 7% because of events in Ukraine and Aer Lingus expects them to take effective pay cuts. Will the Taoiseach join with me in commending those workers in rejecting this disgraceful pay cut from a company that got huge amounts of public money-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----from this Government during the Covid pandemic?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The same company gave a 10% pay increase to British Airways workers. I forgot to say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has rightly referred to crimes against humanity and against international law committed by Vladimir Putin. Tonight in the Dáil, we will discuss the Amnesty International report entitled, Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: A Cruel System of Domination and a Crime Against Humanity. The report asks European governments, including the Taoiseach's Government, to condemn Israel for ongoing, systematic crimes against humanity. Is the Taoiseach going to endorse that report and its recommendations regarding the referral of Israel to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, a total arms embargo against the state of Israel, and targeted sanctions against Israeli officials who perpetuate the system of apartheid, very similar to the sanctions the Government has just agreed to against members of the Kremlin and Putin's coterie for crimes against humanity? If the Government does not do those things, it will be guilty, as will the European Union, of gross double standards in supposedly opposing crimes against humanity and breaches of international law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apartheid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sanctions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Arms embargo?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There go the double standards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are just Palestinians, not Europeans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless it is Palestinian.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is also breaking news, is that the Department of Finance told me yesterday that on top of the current rate of inflation of 5.8%, the conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions relating to it are likely to increase inflation by a further 4%. As a result, we are potentially looking at an inflation rate of more than 9%. Against that background, and because I did not make this point earlier, could I ask the Taoiseach to condemn what Aer Lingus and International Airlines Group, IAG, are doing in terms of demanding pay cuts? This from an entity that we subsidised during Covid. I commend the workers on voting overwhelmingly against those pay cuts, particularly - I did not make this point earlier - because IAG, simultaneously gave British Airways workers, the same staff, a 10% pay increase as a reward for what they had done during Covid. That is shocking. What is the Taoiseach going to do to increase the minimum wage for low-paid workers? I met this week with private security workers who are on less than €12 an hour. Do they not deserve a decent pay increase?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How strange.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Wait until October.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The big question in terms of our oceans is whether the Government is going to allow the privatisation of these natural resources in the interests of big multinationals and private developers, who are literally queueing up to cash in on the natural resources of this country, which are owned by the people. It might be worth considering that more than 50% of our gas, for example, comes from Corrib and that we can produce up to 80% or 85% of our own electricity, yet the prices are going through the roof. That is because we privatised it and we gave it away to for-profit companies. There are now developers and multinational companies literally queueing up to grab sites all around the country. They have identified the sites because the Government did not protect the marine areas as it should have, or only 2% of them when it was supposed to protect 30%. They are queueing up to grab our wind energy potential and our oceans. Will he acknowledge that when they develop that renewable energy, they will charge market prices for the use of those resources to the people of this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a lot of money to be made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was good on planning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ideally, yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But you can privatise it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we be paying market prices?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is going to be like the gold rush.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That it be publicly owned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Brady and I requested at the Business Committee that we would have this debate on Amnesty International’s utterly damning report that Israel is a state that is operating a system of apartheid and that in doing so it is committing crimes against humanity. It called for sanctions to ensure that inhumane and inhuman system is dismantled. We called for this debate prior to the barbaric invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin. All of us have rightly condemned the crimes against humanity that are being committed by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. The Government moved instantly - within five days - to sanction Putin’s regime and take urgent action. The strength of language that was rightly used against Putin denounced him as a barbarian, thug and warmonger, all of which are true. All of those things apply to the state of Israel in its treatment of the Palestinians and yet the Government is concerned about its use of language and does not feel it is appropriate to use the word “apartheid” when Amnesty International, the most respected human rights organisation in the world, and Human Rights Watch, within a short period of time issued these damning reports. Those reports have said that since its foundation Israel has been built on a system of oppression, domination, apartheid and racism, involving the murder of unarmed and innocent civilians on a regular basis. It also features arbitrary detention and imprisonment; land annexation; the displacement of people; and the denial of fundamental rights to 6 million Palestinians who are displaced outside of Israel in the occupied territories, including the right to return to their homes. The illegal blockade of Gaza , as is said in the report, has left Gaza in a permanent state of humanitarian crisis. People are denied access to food and water and the Arab and Palestinian population as a whole is treated as an inferior race. Language does not get stronger than this yet the Minister wants to be careful about his language. The Minister is happy to correctly use the most strong and robust language to describe the crimes against humanity of Vladimir Putin but he will not use the same strength of language when it comes to describing Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians when it is being documented and detailed by two of the most respected human rights organisations in the world. This has been alleged by dozens of NGOs and can be seen by anybody who looks honestly at the decades of brutal and inhumane persecution of the Palestinians, the successive assaults on Gaza, the annexation of the land and territory and the systematic application of apartheid rules. The Minister does not want to even use the word “apartheid”, never mind bring in sanctions. It took five days for sanctions against Putin and his thugs but imposing sanctions for 70 years of oppression of the Palestinians would not be “helpful”. Amnesty International is calling for Israel to be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Will the Government support that? It is calling for targeted sanctions against Israeli officials who are perpetuating the system of apartheid. These are the exact same type of sanctions the Government has just initiated against Vladimir Putin. Will the Government support this? The clear answer is that the Government will not. Why is that? There is such strength of feeling about this. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Green Party Deputies stood up one after the other saying that the thuggery, warmongering and brutality of Putin are intolerable. They would not stand for it and they demanded that urgent action be taken but we have to be much more careful with the Palestinians and their treatment. I do not even have time to go into the briefing I organised this week on the people of Yemen and how Saudi Arabia, the most despotic regime in the world which has been armed to the teeth by the United States, Britain, France and others, has killed 337,000 people there in the past five years, including 10,000 children. Will there be any action against the United States, Britain or France for arming it or will there be any action against Saudi Arabia itself? No. There will be no action, sanctions or outrage, only words of concern. We will raise it and call on them to do things. If the Government is going to have moral standards then they have to be consistent. Otherwise they are not standards at all; they are just cynicism. We all know the reason the standards are not consistent. It is that to call out the apartheid state of Israel would be to run foul of the concerns of certain states that are presenting themselves as defenders of democracy and so on, such as the United States, the UK, Germany and other powers. Their relationship with and support and backing for Israel mean that the EU’s moral credentials are bankrupt.It is not willing to take the action. We go along with that. That is not acceptable. I appeal to the Minister to uphold the tradition this country has, going back its foundation, of opposing oppression of peoples and standing up against brutal powers that are willing to subjugate people such as the Palestinians or any others. Show some moral backbone. Show some consistency and support the motion we have circulated to every Deputy in this House, which Sinn Féin, a number of the left Independents and People Before Profit have now signed, calling for the adoption of the recommendations of the Amnesty International report and for the sanctions it recommends that must follow. Will the Minister support those things? If he does not, all the words of concern and raising of the issue will mean nothing to the Palestinian people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amnesty International wants apartheid brought into that - additionally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the point.
