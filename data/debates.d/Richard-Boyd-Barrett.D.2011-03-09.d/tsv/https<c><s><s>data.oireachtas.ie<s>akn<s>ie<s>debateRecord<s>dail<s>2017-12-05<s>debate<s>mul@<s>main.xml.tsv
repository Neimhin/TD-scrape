RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an absolutely scandalous suggestion. It was not agreed at the Business Committee that there would be a vote on joining the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, arrangement. This is a move to ram through a vote to move towards joining a European Union army while quadrupling military spending. It would have an effect as significant and damaging to the economy and our society as Brexit and is deeply cynical. I wonder if the quid pro quo for European Union support in the Brexit negotiations is that we sell out our military neutrality and ramp up military expenditure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read the brief and the PESCO arrangement. It is absolutely outrageous. This was not agreed to and there has been no public consultation on it, despite it having a fundamental and damaging impact on Ireland's neutrality. It drags us into massively increased military spending.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No it was not proposed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are trying to end their neutrality as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a motion on PESCO. There it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ceann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is not the debate. This is about the Taoiseach's proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So that we are clear what is being discussed, it is not just the time allowed for a debate but the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence is proposing a vote this week. That is what we object to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is massive. It is as big as Brexit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is actually. The Taoiseach does not think so because he supports it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the umpteenth time, the Taoiseach has again today referred to his commitment to social mix in terms of housing. This has been the justification for the, in effect, privatisation plans for approximately 800 publicly owned sites. Up to 60% of those sites will be, in effect, privatised. On the Part V private development requirement to give over 10% for public housing and social mix, is the Taoiseach aware that we received a report on Dún Laoghaire where only three out of eight of the Part V proposals since the legislation was brought in are actually getting that social mix. Developers do not want social housing on-site and this is being allowed. Given its much trumpeted commitment to social mix, will the Government do anything to tighten up the legislation to ensure that private developers of private developments do not get to shove social housing off-site, which completely undermines the so-called commitment to social mix, or is social mix only to be on public sites?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I again refer to the question I asked earlier about housing. It is not acceptable that, on the one hand, we are planning to have a social mix to privatise 800 publicly owned sites, with up to 60% in many of the plans being given over for some form of private housing, whereas the miserable 10% on private sites, supposedly under the guise of a social mix, now turns out to be not even 10%. The Taoiseach has said he has no plans to introduce legislation on the matter. Why is there a different set of rules for a social mix when it comes to private sites? Because private developers want more profit from the sites we are letting them shove social housing off-site or to segregate it in one part of the development, as is happening on big sites where the housing is often smaller. In one case in Dún Laoghaire reported on yesterday the reason given for social housing being off-site is the houses were too big. I know big families who have been waiting for years to get into big houses, but the council stated it did not have any big council house. However, it then refuses to meet or does not insist on meeting the Part V requirement for big houses that could be used to house these families. That is totally unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	NESC has done considerable work on housing in recent years. I can suggest one area where we need to do considerable work. The Government needs to do something on the issue of affordability and NESC could possibly be a vehicle. We still do not have any real plan for affordable housing. We have a market where prices are spiralling out of all control and where much of the funding the Government has put, wrongly, to my mind, into the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund and so on is simply money going to subsidise private developers, but with no guarantees whatsoever over the affordability of the housing that comes back. We need some actual affordability when it comes to delivering affordable housing. Otherwise, as was the case with the Celtic tiger property boom, we will have vast numbers of houses but only on offer at vastly inflated prices that no one can afford or that people are required to take on unsustainable debt if they wish to purchase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The requirement is poorly defined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach complained about constraints in terms of capacity to deliver housing but the ICTU report confirms something that most of us know anecdotally. Significant numbers of people who formerly worked in construction will not work in construction because of rampant bogus self-employment and the poor conditions and pay of employment for construction workers. If the Taoiseach wants to deal with capacity problems in housing construction, he should deal with bogus self-employment, precarious work and poor conditions of employment in construction. On the corporate tax issue, I attended yesterday an event organised by Oxfam, Trócaire, Christian Aid and other development NGOs, all of which stated categorically that we fitted - in fact we are top of the league table - the criteria of a conduit for tax havens and aggressive tax avoidance by big multinationals and had spearheaded what is now a rapid race to the bottom in terms of corporations not paying their fair share of tax across Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also wish to support Deputy Healy's amendment. The FEMPI legislation should be completely repealed. It has no justification whatsoever and it never did, by the way. It was based, in the first instance, on an enormous lie that was used to justify the austerity assault on working people after the collapse in 2008. The lie was that the reason we had a crash was that we had excessive public spending and that our public servants were paid too much. That was a total lie and utter nonsense. We had an economic collapse because of the reckless gambling by bankers and property developers, and the financial and governmental authorities which actively facilitated that with so-called light-touch regulation. This applies right from the European Cental Bank to our own Central Bank, the financial regulators and the two main political parties in this country, and all of their cronies in the banking sector and the building sector - all of the people who now are enjoying an absolute bonanza. That is the irony. They never got punished for their criminal actions in stoking up the property bubble and the crash that followed and they are now the major beneficiaries of the recovery, creaming in astronomical profits from the property sector on the back of a massive homelessness crisis. Who paid the bill, however? It was the poor public servants who bore no responsibility, except maybe a few at the very top who were part of the permanent Government. It was ordinary public and civil servants who had no responsibility for that crisis who were made to pay, and pay savagely, with this FEMPI legislation, which was the main instrument through which to impose really vicious austerity. Before getting on to the specifics of what this Bill perpetuates in that great injustice and unfairness that was inflicted on public sector workers, it is very important to set it in a wider context. The big hidden story of what is happening in this country, and has been happening for approximately the last 30 years, is a massive redistribution of wealth from working people to capital. That is not something that is only said by the left and left-wing think tanks, although they have produced multiple papers on it, including those by Paul Sweeney, TASC and so on, which have shown there has been a consistent fall in the share of national income going to labour for the last 30 years. Paul Sweeney's paper in 2013 showed how the proportion of national income that went to labour in the 1970s in this country was in excess of 60% whereas it is now approximately 40%, so there has been a massive transfer. This was confirmed earlier this year by none other than the IMF, hardly the friend of working people, but even it has been forced to admit that this transfer is taking place. In fact, some of its figures are even more shocking, suggesting that average distribution of national income between capital and labour has moved from labour in the 1970s getting 75% of national income in advanced economies and only 25% going to capital, to a dramatic reversal of that today and with labour's share falling consistently. Where this links to FEMPI is as follows. When the crash that was caused by the gambling bankers and developers and the politicians who supported them happened, rather than recognise that this was as a result of capital gone out of control and capital having too much control of our economy, the atmosphere of crisis was used to intensify an already ongoing assault on the share of national income going to working people. That is what has been done. Never waste a good crisis. Down to the letter, it was the shock doctrine that Naomi Klein had written about. My God, did Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael embrace the shock doctrine and target it at public sector workers with gusto, inflicting cuts on public sector workers they could not even have dreamt of before the crash in 2008? When we think about what they have done, even with this so-called partial restoration of public sector pay the Government is trying to trumpet, after the savage assault that has been inflicted on public sector workers over the past ten years, at the end of 2021, under this legislation, public sector workers will still be earning less than they were earning when the austerity cuts were imposed. Therefore, in 2021, that is 13 years later, public sector workers will still be earning less than they were in 2008. My God. The most savage capitalist could not have dreamt of that before 2008 but the Government has managed to get away with it and is still trying to justify it as being reasonable under the guise of an emergency that the Government declared a few years ago to be over but which apparently still applies to public sector workers. I am particularly infuriated by how, when we discuss the situation in the health services or housing, the Government mentions, to use the Taoiseach's term from today, "capacity restraints". We cannot solve the housing crisis because of "capacity constraints". The Government wants to restore the health service, but it is having difficulty recruiting nurses and so on. Why? It is because of this FEMPI stuff and because the Government turned the so-called pension levy into a permanent feature and wants to make pay apartheid permanent in terms of people who entered into the public service after 2011 or 2012 such that, even with this so-called restoration, new entrant teachers, nurses and others will, over the course of their lifetimes, earn approximately €200,000 less. It is worth considering what that means. If someone earns €200,000 less than somebody else who is doing the same job but just happened to be recruited into the public service before 2011, that is his or her ability to buy a house gone. With average house prices, a mortgage is actually in excess of that. If a worker loses €200,000, his or her capacity to purchase a home is wiped out by the pay apartheid that is imposed on post-2011 or post-2012 teachers, nurses and other public servants. How can the Government justify it? Spurious and dishonest justifications were given a few years ago, but the Government is still claiming it to be justified now when that factor, among other matters, is contributing significantly to the housing and homelessness crisis facing us to the extent that tenured lecturers who are homeless are attending my clinic. That is how bad it is because of what the Government has done to pay. Then the Government wonders why we cannot get people to return to the country and why we have a shortage of nurses, teachers and skilled workers in other areas of the economy. Unless it restores pay, we will not be able to get people to return and there will continue to be a brain drain out of the country of teachers, nurses and other educated professionals. It is shocking. Even worse, this legislation continues the punishment of those who simply voted against it. It is the sort of action expected of tyrannical governments. We will have on our books emergency legislation that punishes people who put something in their union ballot boxes to say that they would not accept this legislation or the justification for it. The Government wants to punish them by denying them their increments up to 2021. It is disgusting. There is no other word for it. That word was misapplied to Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe once upon a time in the Houses, but FEMPI is disgusting. For the Government to perpetuate this and punish people who stand up against it is unjustified. I commend the bravery of the ASTI, the TUI, the INTO, the nurses' unions and so on who have spoken out against this. I hope that the revolt against this pay apartheid and emergency legislation will escalate until we begin to reverse the injustice that has been imposed on public sector workers and, as a critical part of that, reverse the transfer of wealth from working people to the rich and capital that has been ongoing for the past 25 or 30 years and is causing significant social tension and polarisation. Albeit slightly weakly, the IMF commented on that last point when it had to admit that income inequality and the unjust distribution of income in the world was significantly contributing to social tension. That was putting it mildly. People are fed up with it and will not take it for much longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we proposed in the amendments ruled out of order, this section should include a provision to end the pay inequality imposed on new entrants to the Civil Service after 2011 or 2012. We will move on presently to a more detailed discussion of the pension levy and the punishment provisions of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. However, the pay apartheid that disadvantages new entrants, including teachers, nurses and other public servants, is one of the key concerns of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland. It is a concern that will continue to grow and give rise to increased anger. Teachers have been one of the most vocal groups in opposing this ongoing pay inequality.The moratorium on public sector recruitment was never completely imposed on education, and teachers recruited during that period are in the vanguard of those affected by this injustice, this pay inequality, to the point that those recruited between 2011 or 2012 have lost to date between €26,000 and €28,000. If they started in 2013, they have lost €25,000; in 2014, €20,000; in 2015, €13,000; and in 2016, €6,000. Those losses in earnings and income for new entrant teachers will continue and increase as the years go on as long as this pay apartheid structure, two different pay scales, persists. When the issue of pay apartheid is put to the Government and it is pointed out how wrong it is that one teacher will be working beside another teacher doing exactly the same job but on a different pay level simply because of the year he or she entered the profession, it dishonestly implies that is all to do with increments and says all teachers who enter the profession are paid differently according to the year. Yes, they are, but the issue is the pay scale. They are on different pay scales when they come in. By the way, this affects the people who work in here. The ushers and service officers who come in after 2011 or 2012 will be on a lower pay scale than people who were recruited before that, doing the same job. Is that fair? It is completely unfair. It means that over their lifetime of employment they will earn considerably less than people who happened to be recruited earlier than them. For many of them, given the amount that will accrue to them over their working lives, that makes the difference between being able to buy a house and not being able to buy one. It is absolutely wrong. The Government has never even acknowledged the injustice of it. It has never stated this is unfortunate but that at some point it will get rid of this, that there will be one pay scale. I would not accept it all, but many of those who have been campaigning against it have said if they at least had a cast iron commitment that there would be a return to a single pay scale, there would be light at the end of the tunnel. There is no commitment and that leads me and, I suspect, many new entrant teachers and public servants to believe there was never any intention to restore a single pay scale for public servants. It was a question of creating a new lower pay scale for public servants to generally reduce the levels of pay for public servants. That is absolutely wrong and the Government does not even have the honesty and bravery to admit that is what it is doing to workers. Instead, it dissembles and misleads as to the real impact and intent of this pay apartheid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very moderate it was too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have already spoken about the issue of pay inequality on the amendment that was ruled out of order. I am aware that quite a few teachers and other public servants are watching this debate and it is worth explaining to them because they probably do not know that our amendments and those of others - Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, Solidarity-People Before Profit, Deputies Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Joan Collins, Seamus Healy and others - were ruled out of order. They sought to end pay inequality. Therefore, we have been forced to table secondary amendments in an attempt to get around the provisions that allow amendments to be ruled out of order on this and many other issues dealt with in the recent Finance Act. We have had to resort to requesting reports to look at an issue because that is the only way we can have the matter discussed. Those watching must understand the ludicrous way in which Parliament works and that in many cases we cannot table amendments to legislation on the matters that really count for workers and other citizens. To put it in very simple terms - it is an indictment of the regression in society that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party which all variously supported the FEMPI legislation passed legislation that will mean that new entrants to teaching, nursing and the public service will work longer and harder for less and that they will receive pensions of less value. That is the gift Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party have bestowed on future generations, which is shocking when one thinks about it. Our bequest to future generations is that they will be worse off. They will work longer and harder and when they retire which will be later than previous generations, their pensions will be worth less. That says it all about the regressive, backward-moving direction of society. One of the things that has not been mentioned but which is worth saying, given that Deputy Jonathan O'Brien referred to how angry Deputies might be if there was to be pay apartheid for them, is that in a supreme insult to the post-2011 and 2012 generation Deputies, Ministers and Taoisigh who were elected prior to 2011 will enjoy far superior pension entitlements than those who were elected afterwards. The Minister should not get me wrong; as far as I am concerned, the pensions and pay of Deputies, Ministers and Taoisigh should be further reduced, but it is very telling that the political architects of the unprecedented crash in the economy which inflicted a decade of austerity which, in the case of pay equality, will mean that a younger generation of public servants will feel the impact of their crimes for the rest of their lives, unless pay and pension equality is restored, insulated themselves against the impact of the measures taken, which is absolutely disgusting. I have had to use that word twice in this debate, but it really is and people need to know because I suspect they do not. Some Ministers and Deputies are still sitting in this House who, because they happened to be elected before 2011, will be insulated against the pension reductions that were rightly imposed on the political class after 2011. They are the one group of people who deserved to have some cuts imposed on them after the crash, but those most responsible insulated themselves and bestowed all of this degradation in the value placed on the work of a younger generation who will work longer and harder for less and who when they retire which will be later, will receive pensions of less value. It really is utterly shameful. I will conclude as I made most of the broader points in my previous contribution. That generation should not forgive the people who have done this and are continuing to do it to them. Their lives and even the value placed on their professions have been degraded as a result of the changes made which I do not think many of them will forget. It was noticeable at the demonstration outside last week of the young teachers from the ASTI, the TUI and the INTO just how angry and politicised they were by this injustice.What is terrible is that now we are in a so-called recovery, but there is no acknowledgment or apology from the Government to the effect that what is being done to the people in question is wrong. It simply will not admit it; rather, it tries to suggest the starting salary of teachers is actually improving, that it is not bad and so on. It is trying to gloss over the fundamental injustice, that is to say, the people in question will forever and a day be on lower pay scales than those who entered before 2011. That is the position, unless it is changed, something to which the Government will not commit. At least, it could apologise and acknowledge that it is an injustice and promise that it will get rid of it. The Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, said it would cost €1.4 billion to do what some of us were proposing, that is, to get rid of pay inequality and ensure the full restoration of pay. That is less than the potential increase in expenditure if we meet the 2% requirement under the permanent structured co-operation agreement the Government is trying to ram through this week. Our current level of military expenditure is €900 million. To put it another way, military spending accounts for 0.5% of GDP. Under the deal the Government is trying to ram through this week, that figure will have to move progressively towards 2% of GDP. By the way, we cannot borrow to finance that spending. It will mean quadrupling military expenditure to a little under €4 billion. The precise figure is €3.6 billion. We can afford to support the military industrial complex and the armaments producers in Europe and sign up to it without much of a debate - the Government is trying to push it through under the radar - yet we cannot afford to provide for pay restoration for new entrant teachers. It is simply not true to say we cannot afford it; it is simply the case that the Minister's priorities are wrong. He believes building up the European military industrial complex and all of the military producers that lobbied the European Union on the PESCO arrangement are more important than restoring pay equality for young teachers, nurses and public servants. That embodies the distorted priorities of the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said I could not move the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was making a contribution at the time. Obviously, I did not say I could not make a contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a matter of record that we cannot move the amendments to provide for pay equality. That is what we said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The first thing that young teachers, nurses and other public servants should take from the Minister's response is that they should continue to campaign on this issue because their campaign is working. It is clearly the pressure of the ASTI, the TUI and the INTO, in coming together to oppose the latest deal which does not fully restore pay or deal with pay equality, that has forced the Government to acknowledge the depth of feeling and accept an amendment that at least proposes to examine the issue.Action works. That is the lesson. The fact that the unions, driven by their grassroots, have come together in a united front against this is having an impact. The lesson is also for the rest of the trade union movement, namely, that they need to stand up against this kind of stuff and not accept there is no alternative to the partial half-hearted restoration and failure to deal with these issues the Government initially proposed. The Minister should honestly answer the question I posed. I will give him a few other suggestions. If the cost of pay equalisation for new entrants into teaching, nursing and the public service generally is €200 million, how can the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, not make a commitment on €200 million when he will propose on Thursday of this week that a commitment be made to increase substantially the proportion of national income that is spent on weapons? We do not know the cost but the Government wants Members to vote through the agreement in a week. This is an issue that has been debated and is relevant. The Minister asked where can we get the money. The Government states we cannot make a commitment on getting the €200 million necessary for pay restoration but wants the Dáil to make a commitment this week to increase annually military spending in real terms towards a 2% of GDP target. That will involve substantial and dramatic increases far in excess of the €200 million it would cost to restore equality for teachers, nurses and other public servants. How can the Minister give a commitment on one when he will not give a commitment on the other? I note the issue of pay equality is a far greater priority for the people, particularly young people in those professions and in the public service, than is boosting the profits of the European arms industry. Another suggestion is a financial transaction tax. The estimated yield involved has increased because financial transactions have dramatically increased. I refer to the culprits for much of the crash that led to this pay inequality in the first place. Why will the Minister not levy a 0.1% tax on financial transactions? That would raise €500 million a year or more than twice what the Minister needs in this regard. Why will the Minister not even entertain it? The Minister could do that. The losses brought forward mean the banks are making big profits. AIB is one of the most profitable banks in Europe at present and is paying zero tax because of tax loopholes. What about closing that one down? That would give us the €200 million. What about a wealth tax on the exponential growth in the wealth of the top 5% in Irish society? Wealth taxes are not unusual across the rest of Europe but in Ireland, of all places, there has been spectacular growth in household wealth. It is has increased by 49% since 2012 and the overwhelming majority of that is concentrated in the hands of the top 5% or 10% of the population. The Minister will not even consider a wealth tax and states it is too difficult to impose. It is not difficult to cut the pay of new entrant teachers but apparently it is complex to tax the extraordinary wealth of the richest 5%. Another suggestion for the Minister is to take a little extra from the corporate profits that have more than doubled since 2008. A sum of €200 million is a drop in the ocean compared with the €70 billion plus in extra profits they are making now. There were €149 billion in aggregate profits in 2015, up from approximately €70 billion in 2008, on which they are paying on average 6% real effective tax. Could the Minister take a little bit more off them? That €200 million would be a drop in the ocean compared with that but the Minister has resolutely refused to consider that. Ultimately, €200 million is a small price to pay for pay equalisation and to provide fairness to new entrants in the public service including teachers, nurses and other public servants.
