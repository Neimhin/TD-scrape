RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance, I extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to Jo Cox’s husband, Brendan, her two children and all her family and friends.Jo's murder was an utterly vile and obnoxious act which must be condemned outright. British politics and the Labour Party in Britain have suffered the loss of a champion of progressive causes. At the time of her death, Jo was preparing a report for the British Parliament on the rise of Islamophobia and aggressive nationalist politics, and the need to challenge them. She had also produced a report on the plight of Palestinian people in Gaza and the need to lift the blockade of Gaza. From the very first day she entered the British Parliament, she spoke out about the need to oppose racism and welcome and acknowledge the contribution of refugees and immigrants in Britain, whether Irish Catholics, Muslims or any other nationality. She was clearly a subscriber to the view that I and, I hope, everybody holds, namely, that there is only one race in the world, the human race. Jo Cox clearly subscribed to that view. It is a shocking wake-up call for us about the dangers of the growth of far-right, racist and anti-immigrant sentiment right across Europe. We do not know the exact circumstances or reasons for her killing, but evidence is mounting that the person who was apprehended was associated with some of the fascist far-right in Europe. Whatever our differences on questions of the European Union or policy, in the aftermath of Jo's death we all have to show the strongest united front against racism, intolerance and prejudice in the way that Jo Cox did throughout her life. Her husband Brendan committed in the aftermath of the shooting to fighting the hatred that killed Jo, and we should all commit to that battle in the aftermath of her tragic murder.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, I brought an issue to the House with regard to St. Augustine's special school in Blackrock for children with mild intellectual disabilities. That was following a mobilisation, if one likes, by very concerned parents about the children and plans by St. John of God Community Services to cut HSE funding to vocational services. I was glad to hear that on foot of the protests and campaigning of the families, a stay, as it were, had been put on the plan to cut entirely the vocational services to St. Augustine's special school. Can we get a commitment that it will not just be a stay? According to the report I have read, while there is a stay, it will be reviewed and there will be further consultation, but these cuts in vocational services are still not absolutely off the table. I ask for a commitment that hands will be taken off any effort to take away these vocational services. In addition, the Taoiseach needs to look at some of these services that one might call preventative in nature and that are being funded by the health services generally, which seem to be being cut to move resources towards what might be considered more emergency issues. Of course we need to deal with emergencies, but that should not be at the expense of youth or preventative projects dealing with children with disabilities or, as in a case I have mentioned-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in the past, outreach projects for vulnerable young people in poorer and more disadvantaged areas. That is happening, and I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to have a close look at what is being pulled here and whether it is in line with the policy of the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We in People Before Profit want absolutely nothing to do with some of the vile and racist forces that are campaigning for an exit from the European Union in Britain, some of whom have stoked up the sort of racist conditions and sentiment that took the life of Labour MP, Jo Cox. We must all dissociate ourselves from that. Having said that, I disagree with the consensus in the House that the way to deal with the virulent rise of racism, prejudice, islamophobia and the growth of far right forces in Europe is to stay in the European Union in the hope of reforming it. Is it not the case that the European Union is the architect of its own crisis and that it has caused the problems that have now produced such widespread disaffection? This is summed up by the comments by Jean-Claude Juncker in January 2015, when the Syriza government was first elected, that, "To suggest that everything is going to change because there is a new government in Athens is to mistake dreams for reality... There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties."Is the problem not fundamentally that the leaders of the European Union are saying democracy has gone out the window with the European Union and that that has been compounded with the disgusting racist fortress-Europe policy that has led to the deaths of thousands of people trying to get into Europe? While Europe parades as a beacon of progress, in fact, its own racists policies vis-à-vis desperate people fleeing from Syria involves throwing them back to the Turkish Government, which is now shooting them. Last week, Syrian refugees were shot. Europe has signed an agreement with Turkey to allow that to happen and it is throwing those desperate people back to Turkey to allow it to shoot them. Is it those misguided undemocratic fortress-Europe policies and austerity policies that have created the crisis that is now consuming us? In that context, would we be better off supporting not Brexit but the left exit campaign of saying we want European internationalism - in fact, we want comprehensive internationalism that goes beyond the boundaries of Europe - if we are to undermine and defeat the dangerous forces of racism and the far right that the European Union itself has helped to stoke up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are now being shot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the song "Imagine", John Lennon asked us to imagine if there were no countries and a brotherhood of man. That is the view held by socialists. We do not believe in national borders or frontiers. We believe there is one race, the human race. Frankly, I find it frustrating, to put it mildly, that a previous speaker suggested that those of us who are critical of the European Union and believe that we should exit it can somehow be associated with the vile xenophobia, racism and extreme forms of nationalism promoted by the fascist far right in Europe or the vile group UKIP, which happens to lead the campaign against the European Union and for exit, but on grounds with which we would have nothing to do.We have nothing but contempt for UKIP and the far right. It is most disingenuous for some to suggest that in supporting the existing European Union and arguing for staying in it somehow what we are doing is protecting some beacon of civilised values and tolerance, decency and anti-racism when the opposite is the truth. The European Union, as Deputy Paul Murphy has alluded to, is guilty of vile policies of racism against some of the most desperate people fleeing from countries outside Europe from war, poverty and famine and has developed an enormous machine to keep people out, to deny the brotherhood of man, to say Europe is only free if a person is white and European but if that person is not, we do not want him or her. The European Union has developed a significant machine and architecture to keep people from Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere out. Between 2002 and 2013, a total of 39 research and development programmes aimed at policing borders have been implemented by the EU and its affiliate, the European Space Agency, at a cost of €250 million. The projects have been for the development of fingerprint scanners, migrant detection drones, vehicles, satellite surveillance and overground and underwater border patrols, all designed to keep people out. FRONTEX, the EU-wide project for establishing the external borders of the European Union, has spent €1 billion, four times the other amount to which I referred, keeping immigrants out, supported by all the European Governments and European policy. That figure is further dwarfed by the amount individual states have spent policing their own borders as part of fortress Europe. It is Europe itself that has given credence and opened up the ground for the far right by treating migrants, immigrants and refugees as if they are a problem, encouraging and giving solace to the more dangerous forces of the far right who then take it one step further. The EU-Turkey agreement is the absolute embodiment of that. It is a sickening agreement whereby we essentially outsource the border control of Europe to a nasty regime that is guilty of systematic, ongoing human rights abuses against its own population. Since we signed the agreement whereby we expel immigrants from Syria and elsewhere back to Turkey, Turkey has started shooting those very people. How could we be in any way surprised that it would do so? We must end the hypocrisy and the tyranny of fortress Europe and give real meaning to words such as “tolerance” and “internationalism” to which many look to the European Union to uphold but which the European Union has not matched with deeds but with the vile policies of fortress Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mass movement against water charges is set to score two victories in a week. It is forcing the Government to reverse a scandalous effort by private waste companies to hike charges to extortionate levels, and later in the week the Government will be forced to climb down in its effort to inflict water charges on people. The movement against water charges was a child of the movement against waste charges. Many of the people who formed the core of the groups in communities, towns and villages throughout the country were the very same people who fought against bin charges ten or more years ago. When we fought bin charges we said they would lead to prices going through the roof, privatisation, a deterioration in conditions for workers in waste collection and increased damage to the environment in the form of fly-tipping, and would be followed by water charges. We were right on every single count. The worst thing about the old politics is that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil knew we were right and that all these things would happen. As Deputy Coppinger has suggested, the level of dishonesty is extraordinary. I heard it echoed by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, earlier, and it was repeated endlessly by the Labour Party. The lie is that those of us who fought against bin charges were responsible for privatisation, when in fact the majority of waste collection services in this country were privatised before our campaigns against bin charges even began. Most of the waste charges in this country were privatised in the 1990s. Our campaign only began in 2000 in Dún Laoghaire and in 2001 in Dublin city. The last places in which waste collection was privatised were Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire where there were fights.They were privatised everywhere beforehand, just as we had predicted, by the racketeering bandits. What a shower of bandits these guys are. The Minister has said the Government is responding to the concerns raised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Minister does not accept is just how greedy the people concerned are and what they were willing to do. They were trying and willing to ratchet up charges by between 50% and 200%. All we are getting from the Minister is a promise that it will not happen for 12 months, but there is no promise that it will not happen in the future. We have been down this road before; it happened 15 years ago when we were given all of those promises that there would be waivers, that it would not be so bad and that it would not cost people so much, but it all turned out to be lies. That gives rise to the question of whether we believe charges will be introduced in 12 months time. Is it the case that the Government is colluding right now with the bandits in the private waste companies who wanted to rip people off to the extent I have outlined to ensure they would stay in business rather than that we would have a fair waste collection system? I do not trust the Minister. I am sorry, but I do not. The reason I do not trust him is that in 2012 the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, chose the more expensive model - he knew it was the more expensive model - because the private waste companies had told him to do so. Why did the subsequent Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, bring forward a ridiculous statutory instrument that triggered the current situation in the first place? The reason is he was lobbied by the private waste companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why will the Minister not pass the measure we propose which would cap charges and reintroduce waivers? The reason is the waste companies do not want him to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister must balance his loyalty to the profit seeking bandits with what is a jury that has come in on the private waste industry and privatisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have made a mess of private waste collection. They are racketeers and extortioners and should be put out of business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should bring waste collection services back within public ownership and have a fair way to pay for them.
