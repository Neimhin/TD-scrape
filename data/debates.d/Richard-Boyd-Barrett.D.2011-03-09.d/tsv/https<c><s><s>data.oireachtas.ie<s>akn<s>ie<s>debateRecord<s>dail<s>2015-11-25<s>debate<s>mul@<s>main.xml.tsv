RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have discussed forestry many times in this House. I was glad and, more importantly, champions of forestry were very glad to hear the Minister's recent comments to the effect that he sees afforestation as a key measure to deal with our CO2 emissions problems. In representing the view of those who champion forestry, I have emphasised the value of agroforestry as a key measure in mitigating climate change as well as all the other benefits that go with it. Does the Minister accept our afforestation targets are a little unambitious? He is talking about planting 43,000 ha by 2020 which only amounts to some 6,000 ha per year and is still well below what we would need to hit the 17% coverage target.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister and I certainly are in agreement on the principle here, which I am very glad to hear. However, we need to be more ambitious and to push this as far and as effectively as we can. The Programme of Competitive Forestry Research for Development, COFORD, estimates that to achieve our 17% forestry target by 2014, we need to be planting 15,000 ha per annum. We are still well short of that. Will the Minister expand on Coillte's change of strategy? To date, that body has failed quite spectacularly in its remit in this regard. EU rules around grants and so on have something to do with that, but the fact is Coillte has not contributed significantly to afforestation. The Minister might explain how this will change, because it needs to change.Second, the Minister might consider a dedicated unit to explain to farmers the advantages of agroforestry and how it can contribute positively towards their farming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They should not see it as being in competition with other farming activities, rather it should complement them as well as helping us to deal with the urgent climate change challenge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two aspects of this. One is trying to encourage farmers to see the benefits of forestry. I am learning as I go. We need to get the message across to farmers about how the different types of agroforestry can benefit them. They need to see it as a win-win situation rather than seeing it as a competition over land use for existing farming activities. We need to educate people and promote it in a proactive way to get farmers on board. If we do, it will be a win-win. On Coillte, we need to think about moving beyond the industrialised single-species approach to afforestation because the most effective climate-mitigating species are the native broadleaf species. They have deeper roots and are much better at all levels - better for carbon sequestration, better for the land and so on. However, Coillte has not delivered significantly in this area. Mr. Colm McCarthy estimated that Coillte has about 500,000 acres of land that it did not deem commercially viable for forestry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With a bit of imagination that land could be used for forestry if it were given to local communities, co-operatives and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What really worries me in the Minister's response and the responses of others on the Government side is that there seems to be no sense that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Deputy Twomey tries to trivialise the matter by saying we hate the multinationals. We do not hate them and are glad of any job but we do not want to blind ourselves to the problems. The problems are internationally acknowledged.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that the multinationals are engaging in aggressive tax avoidance to the point that they pay tax at pitifully low levels. In some individual cases, the tax rate is estimated to be 0%. The US congressional committee and bureau of statistics are saying the American multinationals, the big IT multinationals, operating in this country are paying at a rate of 2%. Do we consider that acceptable? Do we consider it acceptable that some of the wealthiest companies in the world, some of whose directors are multibillionaires whose personal wealth is greater than that of entire countries, pay virtually no tax when ordinary workers pay 30% or 40% of their income in tax? I do not believe it is acceptable. Our society and economy will pay a terrible price domestically and internationally if we do not address this. Arguably, the problem is now at the root of global economic and financial instability because there is such a concentration of money in the hands of these firms that they can literally destabilise entire economies. Let us consider the responses I have received from the Government on the tax loopholes associated with trade charges and intellectual property, the figure for which has jumped from €6 billion to €21 billion in Ireland in five years. This jump is a clear example how the companies are operating here and of the aggressiveness of their approach. What we are not getting from the Government are clear, detailed assurances that the knowledge box will not simply facilitate the same aggressive tax avoidance. One has every reason to believe on examining it that it is designed precisely to facilitate tax avoidance by replacing the double Irish arrangement that is being phased out. It is still going on under our noses. The substantial and detailed questions are not being addressed by the Government. This leads me to believe the Government does not want to address them and that it is just so frightened of the multinationals that it will not say boo to them, although they are essentially engaged in robbing the taxpayers of this country and the world of tax revenue we need to fund our health service, infrastructure, housing and so on. I do not agree with the knowledge box and, at the very least, we need more detailed analysis. If anything, the technical paper to which the Minister referred generates more suspicion and adds to concern rather than allaying it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment simply asks that any budgetary measures that this or any other Government adopts would be assessed for the impact or effect on the most vulnerable sectors of our society. It would ensure that no budgetary measure would contribute to greater levels of inequality. I do not really see how anybody could say "No" to that. Surely any Government, regardless of colour or stripe, should recognise that inequality is something that must be addressed and overcome. That is not just true because inequality is unfair on those who suffer inequality, although that is self-evident and has been particularly the case in recent years. It is almost a cliché now but, sadly, that is because it is true. The most vulnerable people have been hurt most by the austerity regimes. I saw one of those memes on social media yesterday, which gave the definition of austerity as being where the poor pay for the crimes of the rich. That is what happened. There are 137,000 additional children living in poverty since this Government came to office, which is a shameful indictment of its term. The children bear no responsibility at all for the crash or the policies dealing with the crash, and they should not pay the bitter price for it. Women comprise another big victim group, particularly lone parents. The number of lone parents living in positions of deprivation and consistent poverty has doubled as a result of the austerity measures introduced by this Government. Pensioners have also been hit by cuts to the telephone and fuel allowances, for example. All of these groups have been hit disproportionately by regressive measures like water charges and property tax. The list goes on. Those suffering a disability have been particularly hard-hit. In many cases, these groups overlap significantly, so it is not just one or another of the categories that is hit by austerity, as people are hit on the double and treble by the combination of various cuts and regressive measures introduced. This is a very fair and reasonable measure if the Government is concerned about inequality. A point has been made before but is worth underlining that there is a very serious strand of economic thought - it is quite mainstream - that argues that inequality is not just wrong but it is dangerous from an economic perspective.It leads to greater economic instability and arguably it is at the heart of much of the economic instability we face across the world now, such as the stunning gap between rich and poor and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few at the top. That group can, by dint of its control of vast amounts of wealth, destabilise whole economies. Inequality is bad for everybody, but most particularly for those who are at the sharp end of that inequality. The other big area where-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to condemn the petty, point-scoring approach of the Government and Fianna Fáil in dealing with this serious matter. This is not about political point-scoring. Rather, it is a serious assessment of whether the Stormont House Agreement offers a way forward and a better, more prosperous and sustainable future for the North. That being said, however, let us consider the agreement. Despite the fact that I do not like the petty politicking of the Government in attacking Sinn Féin, as Deputy Adams says, there has to be robust argument on this issue. I do not accept that this is the best we can get. Twenty thousand job losses in the public sector is a disaster. Proportionately, it is more than were cut from the public service here in terms of the population. We saw the disastrous effects that had on health, housing and education. I do not believe anybody who is opposed to austerity should stand over it. I do not accept the review of state assets involved, which is code for moving towards their privatisation. I accept that there are some concessions in the agreement, but many of the social welfare cuts will still go through. We have to fight them root and branch. We should not sign up to an agreement that involves any attacks on the vulnerable or the privatisation of or cuts to public services. We need to resist such things, but we cannot resist them if we are managing, signing up to and implementing them.  James Connolly once described Parliament as a dung heap, and said that one can stand on top of it to shout louder, but whatever one does one should not fall into it. The problem is that sometimes political institutions become that dung heap. They become a trap that people can become caught in and gag on from fighting over the issues that matter. I am afraid that is what is happening with this agreement, which is not a fresh start; rather, it is a fresh austerity offensive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before the adjournment, I was concluding my comments on this amendment. To summarise, all that is being asked for here is that our budgets should be measured by the degree to which they contribute to equality or greater inequality. It should be obvious why that is a worthy and important thing to do. Recent years, in particular, have seen some of the most vulnerable sectors of our society hurt by an economic crisis which was not of their making. Most notably, more children - 137,000 of them - have been plunged into poverty. Women, particularly lone parents, have also been plunged into poverty. The impact of austerity has contributed to rent allowance cuts resulting in a growing number of homeless persons unable to provide for a roof over their heads. One can go on through the list. This amendment says that as a standard feature of budgeting we need to have a measurement of budgets based on the degree to which they contribute to inequality or equality as the case may be. It should be done because those who suffer from inequality, deprivation and poverty need to be protected in budgets. This is particularly so when they can be hit by a multiple of different budgetary aspects or even the unintended consequences of budgetary changes. It is right and proper to have an eye to these matters as part of the budgetary process. Next year marks the 100th anniversary of 1916. If honouring the aspirations of the Proclamation, including "cherishing all the children of the nation equally", is to mean anything, one way of honouring that centenary would be to state that equality is going to be an imperative for all governments in dealing with budgets. On a macro-economic point, inequality is not just unfair, it is bad for the economy and makes for economic instability. This is increasingly the case across the world because inequality, including the gap between rich and poor, is growing internationally. Ireland is no exception to that trend which is dangerous and makes for an unstable economy and society. For that reason, it should be imperative for this Government to ensure that all future governments would see equality as an important measurement of the effectiveness of any budget. In his heyday, Michael McDowell said that inequality was good for society and created incentives. That is a load of ideological, neo-liberal claptrap and rubbish. He was, however, honest enough to admit the prejudices of what one might call the economic far-right in terms of this view of a jungle society and jungle economy. If this Government does not subscribe to this view, and I hope it does not, then it should see equality budgeting as something good that would become a baseline for budgets with which all parties would have to comply. I commend Deputy Doherty's amendment to the Government.
