RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, I have raised the issue of the connection between section 481 tax relief and rights for workers and trainees, and the condition attached to this relief to the effect that the film production companies to which it is given should provide quality employment and training. The Minister has stated, rightly in my opinion, in reply to previous questions that it should be defined, as a minimum, as compliance with the law on workers' rights and employment legislation. Will the Minister give us an update on how we will ensure this is happening and ensure compliance with the rights of employees is actually being applied the film industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely welcome the progress and the engagement but I am keen that we make this watertight. One question I want to ask is whether sanctions will be applied. I have the details of one of the cases to which the Minister's attention has been drawn. It involves a ruling on four or five items of legislation. A complaint was made by a trainee assistant film director to the Workplace Relations Commission against Christchurch Productions. In all cases, the production company was found to be in breach and a fine was imposed. I have been informed that fine has never been paid. As I understand, the producer behind the company is still getting section 481 tax relief. If this is the case, what is the point of having these rules and regulations? What is the point of having conditions attached to film relief if we continue to give it out? I know the Minister is examining this but we need to move to a situation where it is made absolutely clear to these producers that they will not get a cent more of public money unless they comply with the law. There should be a serious question over whether they get any money if they have been shown to be in breach. I do not understand why this would not happen. Something that needs to be clarified is the relationship between the producer company that gets the money and the special purpose vehicle, SPV, because often the producers will state the SPVs have nothing to do with them and they are not the employer and have no obligations. When they try this line of argument, the Minister needs to state that if they are in receipt of money from the Government, they are responsible for the employees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Construction is project to project but the law applies. The legislation relating to fixed-term work applies. Developers cannot dodge their obligations to employees on the basis that it is project to project. Animation is project to project but there is some security in it. It is also an audiovisual industry and companies are in receipt of section 481 but these problems do not arise. In the context of live action film, a plea is being made by the recipients of large amounts of public money that the industry is exceptional and that these laws cannot apply to them. They need to be told that they do apply, that the law is the law and that there is no derogation. Perhaps the Minister will confirm there is no derogation for film, as I understand it, regarding the fixed-term work legislation. It needs to be made absolutely clear to the people who receive public money this is the case, that other employment legislation applies and that the definitions of who is an employee and employer must apply to them also. They cannot state the law does not apply to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason we have a housing crisis is the Government, and the two major parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, believe that housing is a means to make money for certain people in society. The Irish rich have always got rich through property. The property owners who see property as a means to make money are disproportionately represented in this House and the Irish rich disproportionately, in international terms, get rich from property. They do not want to resolve the problem and their commitment to making money from property is the reason we have a housing crisis. Tragically, an economic crash in 2008 that was caused by the greed of people making money out of property, rather than leading to people saying we need a fundamental rethink and that housing should be seen as a human right to be provided by a decent society, has been used as an opportunity, primarily through the vehicles of the banks and NAMA, to further enrich a certain layer of people who make money from property. What I heard the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, talk about earlier is just rubbish. He said we were moving in the right direction in the same week that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which is dominated by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and assisted by the Green Party in this particular instance, flogged off land wholly owned by it in Cherrywood to - guess who - Johnny Ronan. The boys are back in town, facilitated by the State and the major political parties. When we opposed the plan to sell off that land, we were told by the council that it could not be used for council housing. Apparently, there were some problems with the land. It was too low or something like that. All of that was rubbish because it has now been sold to Johnny Ronan, one of the guys who helped crash the economy, and he will build 140 apartments there and make a lot of money from them. We are hearing a lot of nonsense from the Government while in reality the policy continues to be to see land and property as an opportunity to enrich the rich and make them richer. That is the reason the crisis continues to escalate. For the Government to say it is moving in the right direction in some sense is nonsense. Its own targets, which it has missed, were pathetic in the first instance, as we have been saying since Rebuilding Ireland was launched. To try to solve a massive social housing crisis when three quarters of social housing provision will depend on the private sector was a disastrous policy in the first instance and guaranteed to continue the housing crisis but the Government has not even met its own pathetic targets. Whatever minimal progress was made in the past year or two, it will get worse in the next few years. We had a small increase in social housing in Dún Laoghaire and other places because the pressure was on. When we look at what is in the pipeline in many areas, social housing provision will diminish in the next few years. Only 56 houses will be delivered in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in the next two years and the target is 1,500. People have to get out on the streets. As in the case of water charges, unless we have tens of thousands of people affected by this housing crisis out on the streets in Dublin on 9 March, which is the next opportunity to do it, we will not resolve this diabolical, shameful housing and homelessness crisis.
