RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms King and Dr. McDonnell for coming in. Before getting into some of the specifics, do they agree that with the threat, challenge or whatever one wants to call it of Brexit and the concerns involved, there are the immediate and challenging issues that are related and that we confront but which have served to highlight much bigger problems, both economic and political, that predate the political shock of Brexit and which we need to address? Do they agree we need to stand back a little and see the wood for the trees? Much of what we are talking about is a matter of nuts and bolts in terms of the immediate challenges, and it strikes me that we have to stand back.If we were to stand back, we could argue that the economy is vulnerable because it is not sufficiently diversified and its ability to diversify is significantly hampered by the fiscal and state aid rules we have identified. Does Ms King agree? This problem, which predates Brexit, is an accident waiting to happen. Brexit simply exposed it in stark terms because the economy is not sufficiently diversified. We must give serious consideration to ways of diversifying the economy and identify areas into which it could be diversified, for example, forestry, which I have discussed often-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am deadly serious about the forestry sector because it has significant potential, which has not been taken seriously. Despite the significant employment potential it offers, development in forestry is being hampered by European Union state aid rules. Renewable energy is another area with significant potential. I ask Ms King to comment. I fully agree with Ms King on the need for heavy investment in education. We have the potential to move ahead of the curve in a number of areas of scientific and technology development if we had such investment. Developing medicines is another area. While I acknowledge that the pharmaceutical sector is a major industry, we must increase indigenous capacity and develop new medicines through links to universities and so on. Does Ms King agree that the arts is an area in which there is substantial underinvestment? Given the large talent pool we have and the potential high return on investment in the arts, we must consider the employment this sector could generate.  On the big picture, while the nasty, dangerous right-wing manifestations of disillusionment with the European Union and globalisation we see in Trump and some of the Brexiteers are alarming, do they not also speak to something that the left, the trade unions and all of us who do not want to see this type of expression of disillusionment must address? By this, I mean the deep dissatisfaction with the inequalities created by globalisation, for which the EU bears much of the responsibility as it pushed a neoliberal globalisation agenda that has helped to produce inequality. Where this feeds into much more specific problems is the whole area of increasingly unequal distribution of wealth. We need to discuss this issue more as budgets approach because we often hear about the nuts and bolts and nothing of the overall trajectory we are trying to achieve. People like Thomas Piketty have drawn a picture of this for us. Does Ms King agree that we need to start talking about the issue? There is undoubtedly increasing inequality in the distribution of wealth and income. The left and trade union movement need to talk about closing this gap and using tax as a mechanism to redistribute wealth. We are much more vulnerable to shocks and booms and slumps because wealth is increasingly unequal in its distribution. With wealth located in fewer and fewer hands, we become increasingly vulnerable to shocks. I ask Ms King to comment.  Mr. Paul Sweeney has done a great deal of work on wage share, an area in which a consistent shift towards profits and bonuses and away from workers as a proportion of national income has been identified. Does Ms King agree that this issue is not discussed widely enough? I fully agree with Ms King's emphasis on social housing. We and others have been in despair at the failure to address the housing emergency. Much of the discussion focuses on financing housing construction and the narrative from the Government is that loads of money is available. This begs the question as to why social housing is not being delivered at a faster rate. While finance is important, the discussion needs to move on. If, as the Government claims, there is substantial money available from the European Investment Bank, credit unions and so forth, what is the problem? Does Ms King agree that a large part of the problem is that Governments have moved away from the old method of delivering public housing via direct construction by local authorities and that, in addressing a social housing problem, they insist on involving the private sector, which causes all sorts of delays, problems, trade-offs that hamper the delivery of public housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did Ms King express the view that state aid is the key to making this transition and addressing the immediate problem she identified?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everyone else got a supplementary question. Will the Chairman allow me one?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions on wage inequality. There was a report today on the gender pay gap widening. It reduced during the recession but that it has widened since is an alarming and disappointing sign. Do the witnesses have comments on that? Due to the cuts imposed during the austerity period, pay equality is at the heart of the teachersâ€™ dispute. Nurses and various other people, including the ushers in the Houses, have also been affected by this pay apartheid. People are paid different amounts depending on when they started. What do the witnesses have to say about that?
