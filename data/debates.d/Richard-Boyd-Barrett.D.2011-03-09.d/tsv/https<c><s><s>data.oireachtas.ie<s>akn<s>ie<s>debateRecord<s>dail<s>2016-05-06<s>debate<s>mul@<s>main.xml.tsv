RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite the high-flow rhetoric and noble aspirations articulated both by Fine Gael today and by Fianna Fáil in their confidence and supply document, there is no real sign of either the new politics or the new policies people so desperately want. There was no sign of it in the long protracted process that has led up to this day in which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael led us on a very merry dance. It might be understandable and justifiable if there were any substantial difference in policies between them. Then people could understand if that protracted process was going to lead us to a new departure in policies or in politics. Of course, the truth is that there is no difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They both promoted the policies and the interests of the bankers and developers who crashed the economy in 2008. They both agreed to guarantee the losses of those banks to protect those bondholders and those private interests while unloading the cost with vicious austerity on ordinary citizens. They both slashed the social housing and health budgets, which have left us with such a devastating crisis. They both cut the jobseeker’s allowance, first, for the under-20s and then the under-26s. They both cut the payments to impoverished lone parents and child benefit. They both signed up to water charges and even now refuse to abolish them when there is a clear mandate for this House to do so. They both refuse to repeal the eighth amendment, despite the deaths and suffering of women and families affected by fatal foetal abnormalities. They both refuse to increase the tax contribution of the largest and most profitable corporations in this country. All of this might just be seen to be in the past if the programme for Government had new policies. However, incredibly, we still have not seen this programme as it has only been leaked. We are expected to vote for a Taoiseach having not seen this document. Where is the new politics there? In the leaked documents we have seen, this is the no change programme for Government. There is no change in policy or politics. In the key areas of social housing, what do we have? It explicitly refers to more incentives for landlords, more incentives for developers and more outsourcing to the private sector to deliver social housing. All these are precisely the policies which have led us to the crisis today. The new programme intends to accelerate them. In the area of health, there will be an accelerated move towards an even more privatised and two-tier system where health services will be outsourced to the private sector, while the entire public health service is to be marketised. Despite all the false concern expressed by the supporters of water charges about water infrastructure, there will be no significant increase in the level of investment in it. We have had such dishonesty on this issue over the past several weeks both from politicians and the media. Let us inform the people through this House of the facts. In 2007, €900 million was spent on water and sewerage infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even under the supposed Irish Water enhanced investment plan, at its height it will only reach €600 million. That is one third less than what was spent in 2007. Where is the rest of the money going? It is going into the pockets of highly paid executives, consultants and private contractors. That is the truth. It is not going into fixing the pipes or the water infrastructure but into lining the pockets of the same old gang. There is no change and no new politics. I conclude by saying that despite all that and despite the political games, the commitment to the same failed policies, the denials by the Labour Party of its complicity in those failed policies, and the amnesia it seemed to suffer over that fact, there is great hope, because for the first time in the history of this State neither of the two parties that have dominated the politics of this State will control this Dáil fully. We saw a little sign of the impact of genuinely new politics with the effect that the mass movement against water charges has had on all of them. We still have not won, but, God, they have been forced to backtrack because of the power of ordinary people, whom those two parties, and much of the media, have vilified, disgracefully describing them in one article as being like the barbarian hordes, when in fact they are ordinary people who have been battered by unfairness, injustice and austerity for the past eight years because of the failure of the political establishment. They are close to a triumph on the issue of water charges and, as we all know, that battle was only a symptom of the much wider desire of ordinary people for fairness, equality and social solidarity. That is not something that will be delivered by this programme for Government, but it will be delivered by the movement of people power that we have seen on the streets for the past few years.
