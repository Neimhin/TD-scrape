What I heard loud and clear from all them is that we need to rid ourselves of the silos and to ensure interconnectedness between Departments on disability issues. Dr. McCarthy suggested that the Department of the Taoiseach should be the link Department, which is a straightforward request we can make. It makes sense. On the lack of personal assistant supports and mental health services, is the biggest problem in terms of getting additional personal assistant hours a resistance to allocating bigger budgets or is there also recruitment issues? I have heard through my colleague Deputy Gino Kenny that in mental health services, recruiting and retaining staff is a huge problem. What do we need to do in this space and what are the budgetary implications of trying to address the problem of recruiting staff in these areas? We hear a lot from the Government now that money is not an object yet, it appears, services remain unable to recruit staff. Something is an obstacle. Is it that the pay and conditions for the people we need to recruit in these areas are not what they should be and, consequently, people do not work in them or there is a high staff turnover? I would welcome a comment on this issue. I am struck by the comments on the housing issue. I am concerned for all sorts of reasons, as are many others, about the over dependence of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland strategy on the private sector, primarily because I do not think it is capable of delivering. It was mentioned that we also cannot depend on the private sector to provide accessible accommodation. Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that point and also on the fact that there is no requirement on private developers to ensure a percentage of its housing is accessible housing, which is clearly something we should be pushing for. It was mentioned that medical cards are granted based on people's needs and the high cost of prescriptions and so on. On transport, is free travel for people with disabilities an issue? Senator Dlolan's office recently contacted my office about a lady in my area who is non-verbal and was issued a fine for not having a valid parking ticket, which was later quashed following intervention by Senator Dolan's office. As I turned out, I knew the person. I could not believe this happened. This lady cannot get a free travel pass for public transport. Is automatic entitlement to free travel for people with disabilities an ask of the Disability Federation of Ireland?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is really unfair. As far as I am concerned, it is bonkers. Perhaps the witnesses would comment. I think the issue for this lady is that she is not eligible for a free travel pass because she is not in receipt of a disability payment, which is crazy. That she was issued with a fine is also crazy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My final question is about the lack of consistency at DART stations in terms of accessibility, advance notice of travel requirements in relation to access and the removal of personnel who assist in that regard from some of the DART stations. Perhaps the witnesses would also comment on this issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask one last question? It is very short. I forgot about it with the initial questions. When refugees come into the country, do the witnesses keep an eye on the extent to which, as part of our refugee resettlement and acceptance programmes, we try to assist people with disabilities? I ask because I am dealing with a family from Gaza who are in Turkey. Four of them are severely disabled. They cannot go back to Gaza, for obvious reasons, and are stranded in Turkey. I am trying to see if I can help them to resettle here. Is there any focus on that? I suppose the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality deal with that. Do we ensure that we help people with disabilities who are looking to come into the country through resettlement or otherwise?
