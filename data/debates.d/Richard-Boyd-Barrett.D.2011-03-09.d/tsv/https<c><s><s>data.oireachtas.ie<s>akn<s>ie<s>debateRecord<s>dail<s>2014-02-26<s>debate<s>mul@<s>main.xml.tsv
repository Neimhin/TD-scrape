RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said all along that he wanted to restore and maintain public confidence in the policing and justice system in this country. Surely it is obvious that his handling of these matters over the past two years, particularly in the past few weeks, has done the exact opposite. It has battered the credibility of the gardaí, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister. He has impugned the reputation of Maurice McCabe, somebody brave enough to speak out about what he believed to be widespread wrongdoing, malpractice and failure to investigate serious crimes. He tried to undermine the credibility of GSOC which suspected it was being bugged by the gardaí. He has sacked somebody who was involved in a conversation with the whistleblower Maurice McCabe because he refused to retract what he said in that conversation. Despite recounting his own history of wanting to bring about reform before he got into Government and of having a history of reform, he has gone native. He has closed ranks with the gardaí and tried to undermine, demonise and vilify anybody who has questioned his view of these things or who has brought serious questions about malpractice in the gardaí into the public domain, including Deputies in this House. Another example of this is the very serious case of Cynthia Owen. She alleges that as a ten year old child, she was raped and made pregnant by members of her own family and that senior gardaí were involved in that. The investigation of that case was a travesty. It was closed down after six weeks. Some of the people at the centre of the allegations were involved in the investigation. There was a review of the paperwork similar to the one the Minister is now proposing in these cases but Cynthia Owen was never interviewed about this horrendous case. The child that issued from that rape and abuse was murdered and serious allegations were made. Cynthia Owen's legal representatives have asked the Minister to open that case up as a public inquiry and have asked to meet him - just to meet him. I have asked two parliamentary questions about the mishandling of that most serious of cases involving rape and murder with a ten year old child at the centre of it and the Minister has refused even to meet the legal representatives of Cynthia Owen. Why? It is because it raises questions about the gardaí.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister include the Cynthia Owen case in an open public investigation into these matters regarding a failure in the gardaí to investigate properly serious crimes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been quite a public spat, it would appear, between the Minister's Department and the Department of Health over the possible costs of universal health insurance. There have been suggestions that the Minister's Department believes the proposal could potentially threaten the financial stability of the State. There is talk of vast costs for people who would be brought into what is, essentially, obligatory private health insurance for prescription costs and so on. Figures have been bandied around of €1,000 or more per year for what would be, essentially, extra taxes to fund this proposal. Can the Minister tell us what he knows about the proposals that are being floated and their cost implications? When will the Minister pronounce on whether this scheme is actually a disaster? Some of us, as the Minister is aware, are strongly opposed to this model and believe we should go for a national health service model, not what is essentially mandatory private health insurance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister is aware, those of us who are opposed to this way of delivering health care have made the point that universal health insurance is mandatory private health insurance organised via the State imposing the system. It is similar to the United States or the Netherlands. Things that have to be factored in to the system include profit for the private health insurance companies, billing costs, administration costs, legal costs and advertising costs. Is it the case that the leaked White Paper and the associated comments from the Minister's Department indicate an awareness on the part of the Minister's Department that when we add in all these costs, the proposal will cost us an absolute fortune and that it is a mad project to embark upon? As much as universal health sounds wonderful, when we add in the word "insurance" and we mean private health insurance companies, then the costs blow up out of all proportion. Those costs will be borne either by the services that are delivered or through extra taxes imposed on ordinary citizens who are already burdened with massive amounts of austerity taxes and cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is more to it than that. Leaked documents suggest that, even though the paper is in draft form and the details are sketchy, it could cost €5 billion. We could be talking about an annual cost of €1,672 per person. There is even talk of €700 per year in drugs costs for medical card holders. These are terrifying figures. Will the Minister comment on them? From where do they come from and what does the Minister have to say about these costs? Is this an assessment of the potential cost of the scheme the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is proposing? If so, it is terrifying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what is being reported.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So there is no substance to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the Irish Postmasters' Union and the communities throughout the country who have mobilised this week and over recent weeks and who have come to protest at the Dáil today. The main thing I would say to them is that they should not stop here because they are producing a very interesting effect in the Dáil. They know they are getting somewhere when the Government parties start to have a crack at each other and start to fall out among one another.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Their usual tactic is to divide us in order to rule us and to play us off against one another-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- but this campaign is succeeding in setting them against one another. The people can see the impact they are having and the Government does not like it. I ask them to keep up their campaign-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The important thing is that they keep up their campaign. There is something very strange indeed when speaker after speaker from the Government side says they must commit themselves to the defence of the post office network and they will do nothing to endanger rural post offices or post offices in small villages and towns, yet the Government does not commit, and presumably the very same Deputies who spoke refuse to commit, to support the motion that has been tabled calling for precisely that commitment to be written down. Instead, they call for the deletion of that motion and put forward an amendment which is absent of any serious commitment. Of course, that is the truth. We can all express concern. We can all express in the vaguest rhetorical way our commitment to the post offices and the post office network but if we do not take concrete, real action to secure that network, then the words mean absolutely nothing. What is worrying from the comments of Deputy Harrington is when he says things like, "Well, it is up to whether people come and use the post office". Sure, the people should use the post office.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is worrying about the Government amendment and about its whole approach to this issue is that, essentially, it is saying that post offices will stand or fall depending on market forces. If they can cut the mustard in the cut-throat competition with the banks and Tesco, maybe they will survive, but if they cannot, the post offices are gone. That is not good enough. What this motion says is that we want a concrete and real commitment to maintain the post office network in towns and villages throughout the country because the post office is more than just a business.Just in case Government Deputies think they have a monopoly on this, we lost a post office in Dún Laoghaire recently. Small post offices are being threatened in Dún Laoghaire and small villages and towns just like the small businesses that are being hammered in towns like Dún Laoghaire and rural areas. Obviously, the rural areas are being worst hit but the problem is general. It seems this Government will always facilitate big corporations, banks and big interests and if they swallow up, destroy and undermine small businesses and things as important as the post office, the Government will just let it happen because it is so committed to this cut-throat market ideology of profit coming first. It should put the people and communities first and support the post office network.
