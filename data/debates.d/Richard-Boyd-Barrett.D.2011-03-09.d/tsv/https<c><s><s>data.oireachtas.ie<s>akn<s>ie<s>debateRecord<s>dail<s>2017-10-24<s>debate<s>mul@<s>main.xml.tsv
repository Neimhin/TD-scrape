RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would be banjaxed then, Bernard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the main methods through which unscrupulous cowboy builders and building contractors deny construction workers proper pay and conditions and rob the taxpayer of, I would argue, tens if not hundreds of millions of euro is bogus self-employment, which is a euphemism for tax fraud. I wish to ascertain the latest net figures from the RCT1 tax head for construction workers. How many workers are employed in construction under that head? How does the net tax revenue compare with that from construction workers under the PAYE system?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that net or gross?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will study the details of the raids made by Revenue's joint investigation units afterwards. Those are interesting facts. I can tell the Minister, however, that the raid which I think was prompted by my question in July on the Dolphin's Barn refurbishment site was a joke. It took place in the canteen. People were invited to come into the canteen rather than officials from Revenue and the Workplace Relations Commission going around the site, grabbing people and asking them for their details. It was a way out of getting to the bottom of what was going on at that site.Some of the people whose details were taken on that day, who would have been identified as being employed on that site on that day, got notification from Revenue that they started their employment only a month later, even though they had been working on that site for several months, which suggests a significant problem. It is interesting that the Minister cannot tell whether these are gross or net figures. I put it to him that this is very important because the gross figure in previous years comes down to a net figure of next to nothing when offsets and repayments are taken into account. We need to get the net figure coming in under relevant contracts tax, RCT, after refunds and offsets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would welcome any action by the Government on this matter and indeed the raid on that site that followed the question I raised with the Minister. The problem is that it has not come with a proper outcome. The workers involved received notification from Revenue that they started their employment in August following the question I raised here in July, even though they were on site in July and would have got the workers' details then and the workers were employed from April or May. What was going on before August? Are the subcontractor and main contractor being held accountable for the fact that there was undoubtedly tax fraud going on prior to that? Still the record has not been rectified. The difference between net and gross is very important. In 2009, for example, there was €436 million gross tax paid under RCT. The offsets were €490 million, meaning that the revenue for RCT net was minus €53 million. Less than no tax came in from RCT. There were probably 60,000 or 70,000 workers under that heading, with no tax coming in. By comparison, under pay as you earn, PAYE, tax, there would be hundreds of millions of euro in tax. That is the comparison we need to get to because the public is losing tax revenue because of bogus self-employment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because I have another question. The Minister's answer related to other matters I had not asked about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was responding to the Minister's comment about raids.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I was responding to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not mention a name.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I lived in Granada in Spain for a year. I have great love for Spanish culture and the Spanish people. However, I can do nothing but condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrageous repression, violence and brutality being meted out by the Spanish state against an entirely peaceful movement. I find it quite extraordinary that our Government along with the main Opposition party - Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party - are giving cover to the Spanish state and are providing excuses for it by talking about the need to operate through that state's constitutional order and its government's policies, which are specifically designed to crush a peaceful movement by force and if necessary through the use of violence and repression. That is the point. All this abstract "on the one hand and on the other hand" stuff masks the silence and failure of the political establishment in Ireland and Europe to call a spade a spade. What has the Spanish state done in response to successive peaceful efforts on the part of the Catalonian people over many years to change the situation? They were not even initially about independence but were rather an effort to increase autonomy and to have a dialogue and votes to allow for self-determination. At every hand's turn, the Spanish state has sought to scupper that and to cut off any kind of peaceful approach to reform, enhanced autonomy or giving the people of Catalonia the right to democratic self-determination. Mr. Rajoy, in particular, has made his political career on trying to deny, crush, scupper and frustrate the peaceful efforts of the Catalonian people to exercise self-determination. Our Government just will not call it for what it is: sending in 6,000 paramilitary police; going without court orders to the headquarters of political parties in government and organising raids on them; arresting parliamentarians; arresting civil servants; raiding newspapers and printworks that produce newspapers; trying to scupper free debate; seizing 10 million ballot papers; seizing leaflets being produced that were pro-referendum or pro-independence; and using physical force and violence to prevent people from getting to ballot boxes. In the last couple of days there have been threats to use force to impose direct rule and disband a democratically elected government. Our Government sits by and does not condemn this. Self-determination is an elementary principle. I think it is the first article of the UN charter. It is about freely determining, without external interference, the political status and to pursue the economic, social and cultural development of a people. By any definition, the people of Catalonia at least have a case as to having a cultural history, a national history and the right to express their view on the matter. However, the Spanish state and its constitution are saying, "Never. That is not on the agenda." In the same way, Britain for a very long time would have said to Ireland, "Sorry lads, there is no peaceful way to achieve this. We are not allowing it because it is our union and we will decide." This is a Spanish state that has a history of fascism and authoritarianism. We are seeing some of that authoritarian tendency articulated against a completely peaceful movement. What is surprising, in fact, is how peaceful the Catalonian movement still manages to be given the level of provocation, repression and violence and the denial of any sort of democratic avenue to the people. The Irish Government and the Opposition should be condemning what the Spanish state is doing instead of giving cover for it. We should give a little bit of support to a peaceful movement regardless of our views on independence. We should just uphold basic principles of civil liberties, self-determination, democracy and the right of civil society actors to campaign for independence without being imprisoned for sedition. Could the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade not do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has praised the budget for what he would see as its prudence and pragmatism as against what he might imagine would be our more extreme or radical approaches to the budget. Fianna Fáil has largely supported the Minister, although it wants its cake and to be able to eat it, by taking credit for what its sees as the good measures in the budget but distancing itself from its failures. I put it to the Minister that this is a budget that simply does not address the big problems our society faces and is not what the people who needed help in the budget would have hoped for. We can talk all we like about prudence and balancing the books but what people hoped for after seven or eight years of crushing austerity - which robbed them of their incomes and, in some cases, their homes and their jobs, which saw the destruction of public services and cuts that have landed us in a diabolical housing crisis and that have landed the public health system in just about as bad as shambles as it could possibly be in - was that the budget might have substantially addressed some of those issues. They might have hoped for that in particular because the Government never stops crowing about what a success the Irish economy has become, about the recovery and about the fact that we are fastest-growing economy in Europe. Against that background, people might have expected more, but the fact of the matter is that the budget is not going to solve the problems. When we boil it all down, despite all the talk about balancing books, the reality is that 3,800 new council houses will be built next year against a background of 100,000 families who have now been waiting up to 17 or 18 years on a housing list and against a homelessness crisis that continues every week to spiral further and further out of control. There is no increase in the output of social housing next year over and above what had been promised previously; in the case of the health service, the nurses and doctors have told us - it is not the radical left saying this - that the additional allocation will just about, if at all, keep pace with the additional demands that will come on the health service next year; and for everybody else the increase is a fiver a week. That is against a background of the bills people have had to pay increasing dramatically. Rents have gone up 60% in recent years. Motor insurance premiums have gone up 60%. Bin charges are set to go up by another €30 a year next year. There are increases in the public service obligation levy, electricity and gas prices and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose the adjournment of the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it that the Government feels it is necessary and possible to introduce emergency measures and emergency legislation to cut people's pay, to bail out banks or, as Deputy Murphy, said, to show its capacity in a good sense to take emergency measures in the face of a hurricane hitting this country? Governments can take emergency measures, marshal resources in an urgent way, which they would not do in ordinary times, and solve problems but when it comes to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and, indeed, the Labour Party when it was in government, the emergency measures are always about protecting banks and other financial institutions while refusing to acknowledge the emergency in housing and homelessness even when that causes untold human hardship. My clinic is a tragic litany of cases of people in appalling situations. I had a case of young woman this week, which is heart breaking. She and her two children are in emergency accommodation. She has spent nine years on the housing list and she is close to a mental breakdown. With tears in her eyes, she said, "You know, I have been homeless all my life because before I went on the housing list and ended up in this situation with my two kids, my mother was on the housing list for the previous 15 years without ever getting a council house either and being pushed form Billy to Jack with me as a baby and then a child and now I am in the same situation". What an unbelievable failure of the main political parties in this country to do that to three generations of a family - her mother, herself and now her two young kids. Her case can be repeated again and again and still the Government will not call this an emergency and it refuses to take the emergency action it was so willing to take to ram through legislation to protect banks and financial institutions. As I said in recent weeks, the situation is getting worse and now even all the hotels and hubs are full. There is nowhere for people to go. I could raise many issues but the budget reflected the Government's continued prioritisation of private for-profit interests. Most of the housing budget allocation goes to its friends, the private developers. A total of €750 million was allocated to the Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, agency initiative which will go to private developers with an additional €75 million allocated to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, on top of the €226 million originally allocated to it, an additional €31 million for long-term leasing and an additional €149 million for HAP. All this money goes to the private sector. What will the State get back from that? The Government has no answer to this. Almost none of the housing for which we will finance the private sector, to the tune of almost €1 billion, will be affordable. The LIHAF or HBFI funding is not tied to affordability or to a proportion of affordable housing that will be built. The Government will spend €1 billion on subsidising private developers to build housing at prices that are unaffordable and they will probably pay little tax either. The Government parties are still doing the things that led us into this mess in the first place and the consequences are such that a third generation of families is left in diabolical, unacceptable and immoral housing situations.
