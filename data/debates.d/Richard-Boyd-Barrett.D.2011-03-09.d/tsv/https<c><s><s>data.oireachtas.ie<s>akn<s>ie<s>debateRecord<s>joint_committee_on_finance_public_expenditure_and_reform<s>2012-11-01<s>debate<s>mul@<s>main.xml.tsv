RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	AIB could tell us how many mortgages were in arrears and how many extra applications were coming in per month as a result of difficulties with arrears.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is Bank of Ireland different?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who recommended to the shareholders Mr. Boucher's remuneration and that of the other executives of the bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify then, Mr. Boucher recommended his own salary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Boucher is on the board of the bank.  He is the chief executive of the board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who recommended it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The board, of which Mr. Boucher is a member-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Boucher feel any discomfort whatsoever when his bank is involved in repossessing homes or putting extreme pressure on people to pay mortgage arrears that they cannot manage, many of whom are in difficulties because of the activities of banks like BOI, while he is earning in excess of half a million euro per year?  Can he understand why people are angry about that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So, it does not bother Mr. Boucher one way or the other if people are concerned about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What role did Mr. Boucher play, if any, in the Jurys Doyle deal, involving Sean Dunne?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Boucher cannot tell us if he played any role in that deal, is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  We are not getting very far here, are we?  How much would it cost to write down the mortgage accounts that are in negative equity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much would it cost to write them down to current market levels?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fine. How many mortgage accounts does Bank of Ireland have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So, in answer to the question Mr. Boucher could not answer, the bank has approximately 15,000 mortgage accounts in arrears, according to my rough calculations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Mr. Boucher to repeat that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why would Bank of Ireland not consider writing off that negative equity, which would put the vast majority of approximately 16,000 mortgage holders who are in arrears into a sustainable position?  It would also put those whose accounts have already been restructured into a more favourable position whereby they could free themselves of a huge debt burden sooner.  Why would Bank of Ireland not consider writing off the negative equity, which would help the country and the tens of thousands of distressed mortgage holders, many of whom are in distress through no fault of their own?  Indeed, some of the distress was caused by the activities of Bank of Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bank of Ireland is claiming success because it has restructured quite a lot of mortgages.  However, as Deputy Higgins has pointed out, a lot of those people are in pretty miserable circumstances, even though they may just be able to manage the restructuring arrangement the bank has agreed with them.  The bank has the whip hand, let us be honest.  However, it is not a very good situation and it means that such people are trapped in a pretty awful debt situation for a very long time to come.  In addition, if I understand correctly, there are approximately 16,000 restructured mortgages and all of those people would not be in restructured arrangements were they not in some difficulty.  Most of that difficulty arose from the bubble period and the consequences of the property crash.  In addition, approximately 9.22% of the bank's overall mortgage book is in arrears and that figure is rising, year on year.  It has risen from 5.89% in June 2011 to 9.22% this year, which is a very dramatic increase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The pace of arrears is abating?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to these figures, the number of mortgage loans in arrears in June 2011 was 5.89% of the mortgage book but one year later the number is 9.22%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That does not sound like an abating pace to me.  It has risen from 5.89% to 9.22% in one year and Mr. Boucher is saying that indicates a slow down in mortgage distress.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would put it to Mr. Boucher that it is not a situation which looks like it is improving.  There has been an increase of nearly four percentage points-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a very significant challenge.  I estimate that Bank of Ireland has 32,000 mortgage customers who are either in restructured arrangements or in arrears now and a significant number of additional customers who are getting into distress.  Mr. Boucher says that the problem is slowing but I do not see the evidence for that.  Why does the bank not consider writing off the unsustainable portions of these debts that arose during an exceptional period, namely a property bubble, which Bank of Ireland helped to stoke up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would come from the money the bank was given, namely, the recapitalisation money.
