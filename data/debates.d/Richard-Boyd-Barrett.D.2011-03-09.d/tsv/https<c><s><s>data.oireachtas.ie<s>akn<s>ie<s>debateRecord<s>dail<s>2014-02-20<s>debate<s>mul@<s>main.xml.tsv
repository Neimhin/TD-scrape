RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make some comments on the Bill but, following what Deputy Flanagan has said, we have to look at a Bill like this, the general thrust of which at least is welcome, in the context in which the Bill is put forward because the objective should be to give support and facilitate people who are blowing the whistle on wrongdoing, malpractice, corruption and other activities that could be damaging to society or to individuals involving criminal activity in corporate or State institutions. That is what it should do. We have to have a context in which the people blowing the whistle feel confident the State will back them up if they genuinely believe they have been victims of or witnesses to serious wrongdoing and abuse. If that is the objective, we must then examine from where we have come and where we are at now. It would be a fair summary to say that, historically, we have lived in a State of fear and tyranny where those who are the victims of wrongdoing, abuse or corruption are terrified to speak out and believe that if they speak out, they will suffer dire consequences - vilification, loss of job, demonisation, victimisation and so on. That has been the history of this State, whether it is at the hands of the church, powerful and wealthy elites or of the State itself in terms of the Magdalen laundries or the background to the economic crash that has destroyed this country economically. Would it not have been wonderful if this was a State in which people working in the banking industry, local authorities, Government or wherever who knew what was going on in terms of banking, developers and so on had the confidence to speak out and blow the whistle on what was going on? That did not happen. That is the environment we need to create. In that context, the events of the past few weeks would hardly give people confidence. I read the transcript of the conversation between Oliver Connolly and Maurice McCabe yesterday, and it is extraordinary. This is about a member of the Garda who took his life in his hands and spoke out about what he believes to be widespread, endemic corruption in the Garda, not just about penalty points but about murders not being investigated and people being set up for crimes they did not commit. These are the most serious allegations imaginable. He goes to someone whose job specifically is to be a point of contact for people who want to blow the whistle on wrongdoing in the Garda and, instead of getting support or being facilitated, this person who represents the Minister for Justice and Equality tells him to shut up and keep quiet, and threatens him that the Minister will go after him - will screw him - if he threatens to go public with his allegations. Thank God Maurice McCabe had the confidence to face down that sort of bullying and intimidation and continue to speak out. Sometimes political credit needs to go somewhere and the people who deserve that credit are Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly. Deputy Wallace told me he first raised the issue of Maurice McCabe more than a year ago-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and it has taken until now for the issue to be taken seriously. Yesterday, we had the sudden sacking of the confidential recipient. That is good, but major questions remain. That person had been a political donor to the Minister in his election campaign. I do not know the exact nature of their relationship with one another but on the face of it they would seem to know each other quite well. The question, therefore, is when he made those comments to Maurice McCabe, was he acting with the knowledge of the Minister or with knowledge of the Minister's general disposition when it came to the allegations Maurice McCabe was making? It is difficult to believe he pulled these threats out of the sky, given his relationship with the Minister. At the very least, those questions must be answered. I have much more to say about that issue but, on the legislation, there is a serious issue about people who are on contract employment. If their contracts are not renewed because they have been blowing the whistle, serious attention must be paid to that and to the issue of the relief they will get if they blow the whistle and lose their jobs, cannot pay their mortgages or whatever because it could be several years before they get that relief. That is a major disincentive to people blowing the whistle and therefore they need to be assured, and the legislation must pin down-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough, but we need to examine that closely to ensure people do not feel they will face a huge financial loss if they blow the whistle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate. I also appreciate that the Minister has come into the Chamber to participate. Between the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Garda whistleblowers, this week may well go down in history as one in which attempts to cover up scandals were exposed. I certainly believe that what has been going on regarding the issue of Ireland's corporate tax rate and the real amount of tax that large corporations are paying amounts to a cover-up. This has been reinforced by the paper produced by Professor James Stewart of Trinity College within the past week, which suggested the real corporate tax rate being paid by large and hugely profitable firms is nowhere near the 12.5% headline rate or any of the rates the Minister, the Taoiseach and others regularly have claimed such companies are paying but it is a tiny fraction thereof. An astonishing figure of 2.2% is being suggested. When one recalls what Mr. Nyberg said about the banking crisis, groupthink and the lack of contrarians willing to question the consensus, nowhere has this been more apparent than in the Government's attitude to questions raised about the real corporate tax rate. Essentially, a tiny number of people, including myself, who have raised this matter over the past two years have been largely ridiculed and accused of cloud-cuckoo economics and so on, because we questioned the assertions that corporations were paying the 12.5% rate and suggested the entire issue of corporation tax should be questioned and examined thoroughly. However, an eminent professor of economics has now stated the situation is actually worse than even we had thought. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister and received a reply based on Revenue statistics which showed that multinationals earned €70 billion in pre-tax profits, according to the last available figures, and paid only €4 billion. This revealed an effective rate of 6.8%, rather than the aforementioned 12.5%. I thought that was bad enough, because at stake there is approximately €4 billion of potential revenue to the State. When one considers what that would do to alleviate cuts imposed on vulnerable sectors of society or what it could be used for to develop infrastructure, invest in job creation and so on, it constitutes a great deal of money. However, there appears to be an absolute dismissal of even a serious attempt to investigate and examine this issue, given the huge divergence in figures being bandied around for corporate tax. This also has been confirmed by the academic whose surname has escaped me but who is the consultant to the finance sub-committee on global corporate taxation. He has acknowledged there is a real issue in this regard and provided five different figures on what the corporate tax rate could be, including rates of 11.9%, 12.3%, 6.9% and 14.4%, to which one can add Professor Jim Stewart's figure of 2.2%. Whatever the Minister and I might think, given the billions that are at stake, does this issue not require serious investigation?The Minister needs to give serious consideration to having a minimum effective corporation tax rate in order to clarify this matter and ensure we get a proper take from these hugely profitable corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The one aspect on which I agree with the Minister is that assessing corporation tax rates is more of an art than a science. There is plenty of artistry when it comes to covering up the reality of what firms are or are not paying in tax. I agree with the Minister that there are two separate issues involved. The first relates to the global profits of the multinational companies that are bestriding the globe. I do not accept that it is a false premise that we should assess their global profits. It seems that the problem lies in the unacceptable distinction between companies that are incorporated and taxable here and companies that are incorporated but not taxable here, despite the fact that they are all based here. The Minister may have heard on radio today Professor Jim Stewart, to whom I spoke in the debate with the PwC spokesperson who tried to claim that these companies had real operations in countries such as Bermuda. Professor Stewart pointed out that they did not and that despite the fact that their address was Clarendon Street, Bermuda, they had no employees there and that all of their accounts were and the administration of their profits, sales and so on was being done in Dublin. However, because of a loophole in our system, they are not tax liable here and are managing to use Ireland as a place in which to avoid tax and we are allowing them to do so. This issue must be addressed. Another issue concerns how the tax payable on profits of €70 billion, which becomes €40 billion following allowances and so on, amounts to only €4 billion. This raises concerns about the generous allowances which permit companies to write off huge amounts of tax. The EUROSTAT figures indicate that the implicit rates are far lower here than in any other country. I know that they all have different tax systems, but when one looks at the implicit rates, our implicit rates are far lower than anywhere else in Europe, however they are calculated. This issue needs to be addressed.
