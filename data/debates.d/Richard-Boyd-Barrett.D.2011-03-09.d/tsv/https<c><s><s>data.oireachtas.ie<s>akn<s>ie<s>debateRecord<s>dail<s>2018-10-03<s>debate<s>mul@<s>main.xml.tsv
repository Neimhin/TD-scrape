RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That Dáil Éireann:notes that:— access to secure and genuinely affordable housing is increasingly out of reach for many people;— from the locked-out generation of students and young workers or unemployed people, to older workers facing into retirement, high-cost insecure accommodation is a reality for too many people;— the failure of the Government to provide an adequate supply of good quality public housing in sustainable communities lies at the heart of the housing crisis;— the most graphic symptom of this crisis is the growing number of children living in emergency accommodation;— a new approach to housing is required to meet the housing needs of all those locked out of the private market including young people, those on modest incomes, those on low pensions, those on council waiting lists, Travellers, people with disabilities, older people and students; and— important proposals to address the housing crisis have been put forward by a wide variety of groups including the National Homeless and Housing Coalition and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; andcalls on the Government to:— declare the housing and homeless crisis an emergency;— dramatically increase the supply of social and affordable (including cost rental) housing by increasing capital spending on housing to €2.3 billion in Budget 2019, increase Part V requirements to 20 per cent in standard developments and 30 per cent in strategic development zones, prioritise the delivery of public housing on public land, and aggressively target the return of vacant houses to active use;— reduce the flow of adults and children into homelessness with emergency legislation to make it illegal for landlords, banks and investment funds to evict tenants and homeowners in mortgage distress into homelessness, provide real security of tenure and real rent certainty by linking rent reviews to an index such as the Consumer Price Index and introducing measures to reduce the cost of rent, and introduce a target for ending long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough; and— hold a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.I am sharing time with Deputies Ó Broin, Adams, Gino Kenny and Coppinger. Today, 10,000 people filled Molesworth Street. They could not all even fit on the street. There are still hundreds of students outside the Department of the Taoiseach supporting this motion, which was brought forward by the Raise the Roof campaign and supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Housing and Homelessness Coalition, the Union of Students in Ireland, the National Women's Council and dozens of housing NGOs and housing activist groups. Most important, this motion is being proposed on behalf of 130,000 families who are waiting a decade and more on housing lists, 70,000 families in serious mortgage arrears, 10,000 people, including 4,000 children, who are in emergency accommodation, a whole generation of young people and working people who are locked out of the housing market because of extortionate rents and property prices, and renters who are afraid they could be evicted this week or next by their landlord. The response of the Government to this motion is a litmus test for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as to which side they are on. Are they on the side of those hundreds of thousands who need a secure, affordable roof over their heads or are they on the side of vultures, property speculators, corporate landlords and others who are profiting obscenely from the human misery that is the housing emergency? That is the equation. The vast majority in society are losing out because of this housing crisis but a small cohort is watching the profits pile in because of the human misery caused by it. Our motion sets out an alternative set of proposals to the failed policies the Government has pursued of depending on the private sector, vulture funds and landlords to solve this crisis. It calls for a declaration of a national housing emergency, a dramatic increase in expenditure on public and affordable housing built on public land, including an extra €1 billion in the budget that will be decided next week. It calls for an end to economic evictions into homelessness. It calls for aggressive measures to take control of empty property and unused building land that is being speculated on and hoarded by landlords and vulture funds to make it usable for the housing that people need. The motion calls for rent controls that control rents and bring them to affordable levels. It calls for an increase in the portion that goes to social and affordable housing on private developments from the miserable 10% which we are not even getting up to a minimum of 20% for private developments and 30% for strategic development zones. It calls for a constitutional referendum to insert the right to housing as a basic right into our Constitution. Those alternative proposals are not just a critique of the policies of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. They are alternative proposals. How does the Minister answer them? I will put a human face on this. This is just the latest tragic story, of which we hear many. In a way, it captures a lot of the themes that have come up in public debate this week. A woman, Terry O'Reilly, in her 30s is living in her car in Shanganagh Cliffs in Shankill, a council estate where she was brought up. She is sleeping in the car and has gone there because at least in that estate she feels safe. She served eight years in the Irish Army and now she is homeless. As a result of a medical condition, she has to use Lyrica patches, which means it is dangerous for her to go into hostels where there is active drug use because that medication is sought after by active drug users. The only accommodation she is being offered is a hostel in town where there are active drug users. The council will not even give her the right to self-accommodate, which is a miserable alternative to proper, secure housing. That is what we have come to. Someone who served the Irish State in the Army for eight years is sleeping in a car in the estate where she was brought up. Behind every single one of the 130,000 families on the housing list, the 70,000 in mortgage arrears and the 10,000 who are homeless, there is the same kind of human story, misery, anxiety, and fear. Any Government that cannot deliver a secure, affordable roof over the heads of its citizens is not worth the name of "government". Is the Minister going to change tack? Fine Gael has had seven years of warnings, pleading and appeals from people on this side of the House to break its addiction to the private market and to the profiteering of the speculators and vulture funds that have swooped in on the human misery it has facilitated. We ask it to change tack for the sake of those hundreds of thousands of citizens and for the sake of the young people who are out marching now because their future is being stolen from them while the Government cannot secure an affordable roof over their heads. I appeal to the Government to support this motion and listen to the people outside.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State, Deputy English, accused some of us on this side of the House of not liking facts. We very much like facts, but the facts regarding what the Government is delivering in affordable and public housing are pretty grim. In the first six months of this year, the Government delivered 203 council houses in the four Dublin county councils, 16 of which are in Dublin city. That is a disastrous failure. If the Minister thinks it is not easy to deliver council houses, I ask him to explain to me, please, how this State built 38,450 houses in the 1930s, 52,500 in the 1950s and 61,953 in the 1970s but in the eight years that Fine Gael has been in government it has managed to build 3,148 council houses. We could do it when this was almost a Third World country but the Government cannot do it when we are one of the richest economies in the world. That is not an accident because there is another set of facts summed up by these headlines from the past year or two: "Cairn Homes profit jumps 191%"; "Cairn Homes founders receive €61.4 million in share awards"; "Profits at Ires Reit more than double during first half of 2018"; "Cerberus paid just €70,000 tax on Irish profits of €20m"; "Profits soar at one of Ireland's most well known developers". The last headline refers to Park Developments. The list could go on. Those are the facts. NAMA has flogged €30 billion worth of property and land. The Minister may state there was no money for public housing when Fine Gael came into government, but we had NAMA, which had land, building and assets. However, Fine Gael allowed it to flog that land to property developers and speculators who are now selling it back to the State at massive profits and will walk away without paying any tax. The Government cannot even tell us how much tax has been forgone through the section 110 tax relief afforded to such speculators. That is a scandal, not an accident. Those are the facts. The crisis can be resolved by building public housing on public land. Why does the Minister insist on telling fibs about Rebuilding Ireland? He stated that under Rebuilding Ireland the Government was going to add 110,000 social housing units. According to my copy of Rebuilding Ireland, 87,000 of those units will be delivered under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. That is not social housing. Rather, those are tenancies which the landlord can pull out of at a couple of months' notice and land those people back into homelessness and emergency situations. Those are the figures provided by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to, please, stop trying to deceive the public. The Government must build public housing on public land and stop relying on vulture funds, speculators and corporate landlords which are making an obscene fortune from the misery of others. It is clear the Government will not do that, which is the reason for the protests and people power of the sort exemplified by the Take Back the City campaign and the Raise the Roof demonstration today. We will see many more such protests over the coming months until we force the Government to end its support for speculators and developers and start to side with the people of this country and their right to an affordable, secure roof over their heads.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue of global multinational corporations avoiding tax by shifting profits from where they are actually generated to other jurisdictions where they can through complex means avoid paying tax is arguably the major contributory factor to staggering levels of inequality globally that are galloping away in their obscenity.Year after year, the gap between the wealth of a tiny minority and the need and often intense poverty of the huge numbers of people just grows and grows. It says everything about that process that these debates, during which the nuts and bolts of all of this are discussed, are watched by nobody, listened to by nobody, covered by no media outlets and are too obscure and complex for most people to get their heads around. Yet, in that obscure late-night detail is the real devil that is responsible for obscene and staggering levels of inequality and, ultimately, poverty and deprivation, particularly in the developing world. This multilateral treaty is, on the face of it, a good thing. It is trying to address some of the mechanisms through which these corporations shift their profits and close down those mechanisms and loopholes. However, of course, true to form, on one of the key articles of this treaty which might help to do that, the Government wants to opt out. It asks us to believe that we need clarity. On what exactly does it need clarity? Although I have not had time to look at the new nuts and bolts of all of this, I was chatting to Sorley McCaughey of Christian Aid and he was convincing in explaining how our decision to opt out of Article 12 leaves the door open to this kind of profit shifting continuing and to us essentially engaging in the sort of tax piracy we were very familiar with and that we engaged in with the double Irish and that continues with the Irish malt. This is an effort to close it down yet we decide to opt out of that article. The Minister of State asks us to believe the Government is going to seriously look into it, will consider it and perhaps ratify it down the road. I am sorry but the Government has no credibility on the issue of tackling corporate tax evasion. It was forced under pressure to get rid of the double Irish but, as soon as the pressure became irresistible, it opened up new windows, specifically on the issue of intangible assets, where it increased the tax relief to 100%. Lo and behold, all of the multinationals that had benefitted from the double Irish onshored all their intangible assets and, as a result, avoided paying hundreds of millions euro in tax, which even Mr. Seamus Coffey said should not have been done. That was deliberate. There is no doubt in my mind that was worked out between the Government and the multinationals to ensure they escaped the noose that was tightening on them and that a new loophole was created. Do I trust the Government on this? Absolutely not. In broad terms, this treaty is a good thing so we have to support it because it is pushing in the right direction. However, it says everything that the Government wants to opt out of one of the articles. While I may not have time to stick around for the debate on Ghana, it deals with the same issue. In theory, a double taxation treaty should be a good thing in that it makes sure there is not double taxation, but it also has to make sure there is not double non-taxation and, in particular, that we are not implicated in robbing tax revenue from countries like Ghana. Ghana is a poor country where there are 4 million children living in poverty, where a significant proportion of the population suffers extreme deprivation and where the collection of tax is a problem precisely because of multinationals filtering profits out and not having them taxed in that regime. We again are not putting in the provisions that would ensure this cannot be done in the taxation treaty with Ghana. Tax haven Ireland sails on, although some of us are trying to watch it and ring the alarm bells.
