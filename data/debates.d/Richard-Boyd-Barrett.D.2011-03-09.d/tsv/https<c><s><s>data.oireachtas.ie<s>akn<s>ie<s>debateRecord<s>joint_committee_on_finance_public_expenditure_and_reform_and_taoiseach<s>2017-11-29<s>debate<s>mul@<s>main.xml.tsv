RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Cody for his presentation. I wish to ask about AIB or any financial institution that is using subsidiaries or giving advice on how to use offshore structures to avoid tax. What has Revenue done or what can it do to deal with that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If they do not give the information to Revenue, what do we do then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Cody satisfied that the new arrangements will allow that to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had better move on because my time will run out. One of the things the Paradise Papers reveal is that in the case of Apple, following the moves to close down the double Irish at the end of 2013, the intangible assets allowance was increased to 100%. Then it moved some of its subsidiaries based here to Jersey or the Isle of Man. I cannot remember which but it was one of those tax havens. It had advice to the effect that this would allow it to avoid tax as the Jersey entity would sell the assets to the Irish-based company which could claim that as a cost against which it would get an allowance and would pay no tax. That was perfectly fitted. Apple engineered it in such a way that its tax liability was exactly the same as it had been when it was using the double Irish structure. It could set the price at whatever it wanted such that its tax liability did not change. That is clearly tax avoidance and Apple is clearly manipulating the price at which one subsidiary is selling an intellectual asset to another subsidiary to ensure it pays no tax. Is there anything we can do about that? It is very obviously a manipulation of the tax code.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In general, then, if it is obvious that an entity is using transfer pricing mechanisms around intellectual property to set the price at which one subsidiary sells something to another subsidiary, exploiting allowances in the tax code to do so, such that there is no additional tax liability and it is clearly a manipulation, is there anything we can do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that it is a Government decision, but the point I am making is that they can then engineer the price such that they manage the tax liability. Mr. Cody states the arm's length principle applies, but it was explained to me in an email by an anonymous guy working in one of the companies - I will not mention the name - that the company literally stated how much money it had made and turned it into a cost. That is what they do. If the profit figure is €500 million, €600 million or €700 million, what is actually a profit becomes a cost at the stroke of a pen. They use the subsidiary located in the low tax location or the location in which no tax is paid - in the particular case outlined in the Paradise Papers and our intangible assets allowance regime - which allows them to pay no additional tax. What is becoming apparent with the "single malt" is that they are also doing it in places with which we have double taxation agreements. That is the latest move in the constant innovation of their tax evasion strategy to utilise countries with which Ireland has double taxation agreements to do exactly the same thing - claiming that they are owned and controlled in one of the place in which no tax is paid and with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement, which allows them to achieve the same end. It is obvious tax evasion. I think it was Mr. Eddie Hobbs who wrote recently about many of the big consultancy and accountancy firms in the docks that were openly touting that companies moved their money to Malta as it was no problem because of the double taxation regime in place. A company can pretend it is owned and controlled in Malta and get away with tax avoidance. The firms specifically cite Ireland's double taxation agreements as the mechanism through which it is done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Revenue does not make the law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am out of time and the Chairman is pulling me up, but I wish to ask one last question.  I have heard the argument and know that there is truth to it, but I also do not completely buy the argument that there is nothing we can do here. I take the point that ultimately it is politicians, not the Revenue Commissioners, who decide, but if, for example, we had very severe penalties and were to make it a much more serious criminal offence for accountancy firms operating in Ireland to in any way advise, encourage, suggest, or facilitate offshore tax avoidance schemes and encourage people to move money offshore and consequently reduce their tax liabilities, would that not have an impact? Notwithstanding the intelligence of the people concerned to manipulate the international environment and the mismatches, if we had more severe penalties in Ireland, does Mr. Cody think we could scare some of the firms such that they would not facilitate such behaviour and advertise their ability to participate in schemes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The distinctions are lost on me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have so many questions we could talk all night. I will try to ask them quickly so I do not run out of time and perhaps Mr. Cody could do his best to be brief in his replies. I mean no disrespect to him saying that. It is just that I am anxious to get through them. The Revenue Commissioners are still down 600 staff since the cuts and the moratorium started and Mr. Cody is now seeking an extra 326. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that. I presume the case Mr. Cody would make to us, the public and the Government is that the more people the Revenue Commissioners can recruit and train, the more the Revenue Commissioners could gather-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I realise it is difficult. People have to be trained and Mr. Cody is losing experienced people, but does he believe he is still short in absolute numbers from where he should be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just asking. I get the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nonetheless, Mr. Cody appeared to be saying that if he had people to examine some of these compliance matters, whether it is transfer pricing or going around building sites to ensure there is no bogus self-employment, there would be a return from that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Cody is doing a good selling job and I do not dispute what he is saying as I am all for expanding the public sector. The recent Oxfam report states if the EU criteria applied to tax havens were applied to Ireland, we would be blacklisted, with Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. While it states we are okay when it comes to the BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting, project, compliance and tax transparency, we would be blacklisted when it came to fair taxation. One of the criteria used in judging fair taxation is the relationship between real economic activity and capital flows. That is the red flag for what we politely call tax avoidance or whatever euphemism we use for the guys who try to pay no tax. According to the Oxfam report, royalties coming out of Ireland are the equivalent of 26% of gross domestic product. That signals that there is something amiss. What does Mr. Cody think about this and intellectual property? I know that he cannot comment on the politics of the issue of intangible assets allowance. However, when one looks at the massive placing onshore of intellectual property after the change to that measure, whatever the rights and wrongs of the decision, clearly it was tax avoidance activity and should be called as such. Does Mr. Cody feel able to say placing onshore of intellectual property on such a scale is clearly tax avoidance activity? It distorts the economy to the extent that it does not bear any relationship to real economic activity which, in turn, should signal that we have got to do something about it. One point construction workers make to me is that if the same criteria were applied to the relationship between real economic activity and tax revenue under the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system, there should be a red flag there too. The latest figures I received from the Revenue Commissioners showed how the net income from 55,000 workers in the construction sector was €20 million after refunds and offsets. There was a gross figure of €200 million. The figure for offsets was €160 million. The tax revenue from 55,000 PAYE workers would be 100 times that amount. Should there not be a red flag given the mismatch between real economic activity and, in one case, tax revenue and, in another, the scale of capital flows? If the European Commission's judgment against Apple on the provision of state aid and a tax liability that flowed from it was applied to other similar firms which used the same tax structures, is it possible the European Union might believe it was owed more money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have to have a longer discussion about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will set aside that matter for now. Will Mr. Cody address my last question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not asking that. Let us set aside the politics for a minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it is politics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I really genuinely do not understand that. I know the Revenue Commissioners and the Government disagree. Set that debate aside, let us say whoever made the ruling----- This is quite an important question and I want an answer to it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is on topic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say that the people who made the decision in the European Union were in Mr Cody's job and decided to apply the same standards to other similar cases as to the ones they applied to Apple.
