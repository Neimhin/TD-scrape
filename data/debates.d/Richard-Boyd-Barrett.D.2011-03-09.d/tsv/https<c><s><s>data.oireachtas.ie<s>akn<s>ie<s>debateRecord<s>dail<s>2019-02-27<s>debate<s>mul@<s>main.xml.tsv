RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Particularly me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Tánaiste to show a bit of moral backbone and commitment to human rights and women's rights.Will the Tánaiste ask the Saudi Government to provide an all-party group from the House with access to investigate the very credible allegations of abuse, torture and unjust imprisonment of women's rights and human rights activists in Saudi prisons?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I brought two Saudi citizens who are human rights activists to Leinster House. This woman and this man cannot go back to Saudi Arabia as they would be tortured and imprisoned if they did. That is what is happening over there. Expressing words of concern and making recommendations is meaningless. It is laughable. Saudi Arabia is on the UN Human Rights Council at the same time that it is refusing access to an all-party group to investigate the imprisonment and torture of women activists in Saudi prisons. Are we going to allow this to continue or are we going to do something? The Government must not hide behind the skirts of the EU. In fact, the EU Parliament has overwhelmingly passed a strong condemnation of what Saudi Arabia is doing. Germany has imposed an arms embargo while the British Government, which, let us be honest, is compromised in relation to Saudi Arabia, has at least made the request to send an all-party group. What is the Government going to do to show some commitment to addressing the foul human rights abuses being conducted by the Saudi regime?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, the Tánaiste's methods are not working.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bin Salman says he will implement reforms for women and then simply locks up a lot of women. He tortures and abuses them and cracks down on human rights. Germany is not afraid to take unilateral action so why are we? Even Britain, which has a huge trade with Saudi Arabia, has politicians who are putting it up to the Saudi Government. We are not. Expressing concern is not enough. I ask simply that the Irish Government makes a formal request for access for an all-party group to visit the prisoners and assess the allegations of torture and abuse, ask for the prisoners to be released and, if not, say we will have to consider sanctions. That is what I want the Government to say to Saudi Arabia. If the Government does not do so, why would Saudi Arabia bother listening to any of these expressions of concern or recommendations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a request, not a threat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us ask and add some pressure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It certainly is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The double standards and hypocrisy of the Government and the EU on this are stunning. Saudi Arabia brings Yemen to the brink of famine, kills Jamal Khashoggi and tortures and abuses civil rights activists, yet they do not even ask to visit its prisons. From the moment the Chavez regime came to power in Venezuela, America and the wealthy in Venezuela were trying to sabotage it, despite its democratic mandate. President Maduro has done things that are wrong, over-centralised power and repressed legitimate opposition, and I condemn and criticise him for that. However, to say that the crimes he has committed are even close to what Saudi Arabia is doing is preposterous. To deny the fact that the US has an oil driven agenda in that country and throughout the region and has actively sought to sabotage the democratic wishes of the people of Venezuela from the outset is hypocrisy, denial and dishonesty at an enormous level. America is trying to control its backyard and, in particular, some of the largest oil reserves in the world. The Tánaiste knows that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By recognising Guaidó, who is a far right wing opponent of the government, the Venezuelan Government has essentially given the green light to civil war and to external intervention. It would not have been a problem if the Tánaiste had talked to the government there and various parties and considered assistance to Venezuela on the humanitarian front, but Europe has given legitimacy to people who are trying to organise a coup against the Venezuelan constitution and in a context where Trump - God save us, Donald Trump - is straining at the leash to send the US military in to get oil. The Tánaiste knows that. The Government has legitimised that and it will be responsible for the consequences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the truth. That is what the Government has done.
