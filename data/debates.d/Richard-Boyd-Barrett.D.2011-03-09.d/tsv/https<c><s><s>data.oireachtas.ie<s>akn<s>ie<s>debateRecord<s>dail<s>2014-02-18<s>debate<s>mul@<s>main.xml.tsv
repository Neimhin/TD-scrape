RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the meetings the Taoiseach has had or intends to have, will he offer clarification because I did not quite hear what he said? He mentioned a debate or discussion on housing. As he knows, I have called for such a debate for two years. Owing to the mortgage arrears crisis and the potential for people to lose their homes or not to sustain their mortgages, something must be done urgently to provide affordable housing. Council housing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach clarify when the discussion by the committee will happen? Will it happen in the Dáil? Has the committee discussed the potential implications of the winding up of the mortgage interest supplement scheme and how it may take more people into mortgage arrears? What will be done about it? Many people in the mortgage arrears resolution process – I received a letter about it this morning – are saying they are finding it extremely difficult to engage with the banks. One person who wrote to me had engaged an accountant to try to represent him before his bank in regard to updating his mortgage arrears resolution process agreement. He had adhered to it fully, but it was coming to the time of expiration and he was trying to renegotiate it. The accountant received a letter from the Central Bank stating it would not deal with the person's representative because he was not approved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This seems to run contrary to what the Central Bank is supposed to be doing, namely, assisting people in mortgage distress in dealing with the banks, rather than backing up the banks against mortgage holders.

All of these promises appear to be in the process of being pushed over the horizon of the next general election and disappearing into smoke. Will the Taoiseach arrange for the sub-committee on health to have a discussion on whether it is the case that all the pre-election promises to sort out our crisis-ridden health service are being shunted off until after the next general election? Following that meeting, will he clarify whether that is the case for the Irish public and this House? Are those promises now being abandoned? The Government cannot even manage to implement the free GP care for children under five years of age, not to mind provide it to everybody, or to sort out the universal health insurance, given the row that appears to be erupting between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister. After the next meeting of this sub-committee, will we get clarity on those matters? People need that clarity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will it happen before the next general election?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just seek clarity and a timeline.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has stated he discussed the issue of flags and parades with President Clinton. I suggest the New York St. Patrick's Day parade has given new meaning to what James Connolly called the carnival of reaction in its disgraceful refusal to allow people in the LGBT community to parade their identity. The Taoiseach should make some statement in response to this disgraceful decision. Will he comment on rumours that at least if he will not boycott the parade as some of us think he should, he will wear the rainbow badge to symbolise his support for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans community and make some protest over this really outrageous and homophobic decision to ban the LGBT community from the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach could wear the badge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Approximately 10% normally.
