RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the past few weeks Ms Elizabeth Arnett, spokesperson for Irish Water, has indicated that it has been cleared by the Data Protection Commissioner to seek the names of tenants from private landlords and local authorities to pursue people for the non-payment of water charges. Will the Minister confirm that this is the case and that landlords and local authorities will become debt collectors and boot boys for Irish Water? When can we expect legislation from the Government on this issue and the mooted plans to get people to pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I love all the gibberish from the Government such as “multifaceted”, “sustainable”, “front-loading”, “pent-up demands” and “modalities”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is anything but a straight answer. It is all gibberish, with no clear-cut answers. Since the Minister referred to the advertisements, will he enlighten us on how much Irish Water is spending on them? How much is it spending on public relations companies? How many public relations consultants has it employed? That is another expense leeching off the crippled taxpayer. After all the multifaceted, sustainable and front-loaded consultation, what is the Minister proposing to do about this matter? A massive demonstration will take place on 21 March which will put to bed the notion that the campaign against water charges is declining. There will be tens of thousands of people on the streets. Many of them, the ones who cannot pay, not just those who will not pay, will be council tenants and people living in private rented accommodation on low incomes who already cannot pay bills. They want to know if the Government will have landlords and local authorities acting as boot boys, demanding with the threat of pay-ins, that they pay the hated water charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are the Minister’s words. I took them from his speech. I wrote them down as he said them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wrote down the flowery words used by the Minister as he spoke them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. It is unbelievable. It is this flowery gibberish that glosses over the straight answers the people want. Of course, the local authorities do not want to act as boot boys. They were rifled for all of their assets which were then handed to Irish Water. Does the Minister intend to make the local authorities and private landlords the boot boys of Irish Water in demanding payment, possibly through increasing rents or whatever other methods they will be asked to deploy against hard-pressed tenants to collect the ill-gotten gains of Irish Water? What is the Minister’s proposal in that regard? We know that landlords and the local authorities do not want to do it. We also know that people do not want to pay these hated charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what they will be when collecting for Irish Water. What about the recent advertisements and the public relations consultants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister be straight up and give us the date when this will happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a no-pay option?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is the Minister using all of the flowery language?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, was on the airwaves this morning talking about the new health levy that will see a significant increase in private health insurance premiums for older people taking out private health insurance. It appears to be designed to scare people into taking out private health insurance.
