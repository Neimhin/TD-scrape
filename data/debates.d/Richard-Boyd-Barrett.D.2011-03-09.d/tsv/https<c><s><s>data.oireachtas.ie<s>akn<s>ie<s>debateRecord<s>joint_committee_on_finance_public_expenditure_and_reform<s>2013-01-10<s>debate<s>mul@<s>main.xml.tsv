RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the fact that we are discussing the heads of a Bill to extend freedom of information legislation to areas where it did not apply before this. That is a positive development. We must, however, take open, transparent and accountable government as far as we possibly can. We have an appalling history of secrecy and cover-up which has had devastating effects on our society. That culture must be completely demolished. It is, unfortunately, still present in many areas. Our overriding objective must be to open up government and remove any impediment to the ordinary citizen getting information about how the money he or she pays in taxes is used to administer the State, its agencies and any institution it funds.  In terms of that broad objective I ask the following questions. First, I do not see any justification for fees. I do not see any justification for exemptions. One might say this is a very radical position. There may be exceptions but they should be framed in the legislation precisely as exceptions. I ask the Minister to respond to the following point. The rule should be free and open access to all information for all public bodies, semi-State bodies and all bodies that receive substantial funding. If any of those bodies wants to make a case for information to be withheld in particular instances it should have to make that case. The case can then be subject to appeal. We start with giving information. That should be the rule. If a body wants to say information is, for example, particularly commercially sensitive and its publication would be particularly damaging to the interest of a semi-state body it should have to say that and make that case.  Currently, commercial sensitivity is a catch-all term used to block citizens from getting information about things they have a right to know about. I am at my wits' end trying to get information about DÃºn Laoghaire Harbour Company. I cannot accept that the inability to get information about that entity can be justified on the basis of so-called commercial sensitivity. There are huge questions about how public contracts are given out. Often, one cannot get this information because of commercial sensitivity. The secrecy of public private partnerships is an outrage. Significant amounts of money are being put into projects and because we are in a partnership with some private entity all information is blocked out because it is commercially sensitive. That has to stop. The public body in question, or the private body with which it is working in conjunction, should have to explain to us why they are not giving the information, or be legally enforced to give it.  Deputy McDonald has already referred to the issue of vexatious requests. We could work on a formula whereby a particular body could make the case that some requests, which will be a tiny minority, are vexatious. That could be subject to a review process. If we include exemptions or fees in the legislation they will become a more general blocker that can be used to inhibit ordinary citizens who have legitimate questions from making reasonable requests. On the question of what is substantial and significant State funding, percentages and so on, I am particularly concerned about the issue of the banks. Percentages will not work there because we put a lot of money up-front into the banks. I want the legislation to put us in a position where we can question the Bank of Ireland, which got billions, or any of the banks that got large amounts of public money in detail about what is going on, what their decision making processes are and so on. We need to think about that. We need to open the area of the asylum process, direct provision and deportations. It is a human rights issue. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I may return to the issue of the semi-state enterprises and the question of commercial sensitivity, unlike the Minister, I do not have a problem with State enterprises suffering a disadvantage because I happen to believe that open, transparent enterprise will actually triumph and beat secret, clandestine, privately owned enterprises. That is the difference between the Minister and me. That is the deep ideological divide.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the current state of private enterprise, I would not be so smug as to laugh about that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most State enterprises are still standing while many of the private ones have collapsed. Therefore, I would not be so smug. Let us not laugh.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is broadcasting now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point to the Minister is that the rule should be that nobody is exempt. The rule should be that the information is given. The burden should be shifted in favour of the citizen and away from exemptions and the whole series of categories of exemptions, whether for semi-state agencies or categories under which other bodies can block the citizen. The entity, whatever it is, should have to make a case for not providing information in exceptional circumstances. I do not think there are that many concrete instances of such information being so sensitive. That is my point. It is a catch-all argument, a label or category without much substance behind it, but it is used by these entities to shield themselves from proper scrutiny and transparency. I am not denying there are cases or instances but I do not agree with the idea that these are so widespread or all-pervasive that all the commercial semi-state enterprises should be excluded. I do not see the justification. There might be particular instances, but why, as a rule, should they be exempted, given that we fully own them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Commissioner that he is repeating the failed mantras and ideological dogma that got us into our current desperate mess. He stated that he did not wish to interfere with countries' tax sovereignty but in the same breath he expressed a preference for taxes on property and water charges. How does he expect people who have no work and are hovering at the poverty line to pay the household and water charges that the Commission is pushing on our Government? How can he claim that his preferences on tax are beneficial to growth and jobs when growth across Europe is contracting and unemployment is at a record high? The policies imposed on this country have led to record unemployment and a dramatic contraction of the domestic economy.Lastly, why does he continue to push the privatisation of our State assets when the deregulation and privatisation which the EU has been pushing for the past 25 years have failed catastrophically in Europe and everywhere they have been tried? Why does it continue to push that dogma and try to strip this country of its vital resources and State assets? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an EU Commission issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It relates to the EU Commission and he is a Commissioner.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not want taxes on-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.
