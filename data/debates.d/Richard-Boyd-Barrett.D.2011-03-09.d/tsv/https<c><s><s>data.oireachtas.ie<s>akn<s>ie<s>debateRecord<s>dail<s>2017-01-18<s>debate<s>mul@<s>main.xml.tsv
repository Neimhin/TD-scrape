RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a tragic fact, but a fact nonetheless, that this country has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in Europe and also a very high incidence of self-harm among young people. It is a complex, multifaceted problem to address. A very simple proposal has been made by supporters of Pieta House and endorsed by Pieta House itself. The proposers and people from Pieta House are here with us in the Gallery today. The proposal is that an advertisement for Pieta House's services, the helpline for young people with suicidal feelings engaged in self-harm or experiencing suicidal bereavement, would be in the journal of all school students. It is a cost free, simple, practical proposal that the Minister could implement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's positive response and the indication that he takes the proposal and this issue seriously. On another day I might debate the under-resourcing of mental health services for young people with the Minister for Health. The Minister has responded positively to this simple, practical and cost-free proposal. The Minister is probably aware that Pieta House is a fantastic charity. A total of 20,000 people have used its services in the past decade, with 5,000 using the service in 2015. Pieta House does not charge anything for its services and one does not need a doctor's referral to get through to it. This is an ideal opportunity to do something, essentially, to normalise access to services which support vulnerable young people who have suicidal feelings who are self-harming so that it just becomes part of the everyday environment that the services for Pieta House are available and young people know where to get them, and that there are no obstacles to accessing the services. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the information is made available in the way outlined in the proposal. I take the point that he cannot impose such an approach but could we issue guidelines suggesting it is done and request that schools would take up this very positive proposal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I again thank the Minister for the positive response. Several of the recommendations of the Children's Mental Health Coalition highlight this sort of thing as being critical to helping young people with those issues. They include the need for more mental health promotion, for capacity of the primary care sector to increase accessibility of child and adolescent mental health services and for local alternatives to inpatient services. Again and again the coalition underlines the need for that accessibility for young people in particular. Every schoolchild has a homework journal so if we could progress the proposal and the information was there in front of them it would be a huge contribution to supporting vulnerable young people when they get into difficulty and ensure there are no obstacles or stigma attached to accessing the services of Pieta House. I look forward to working with the Minister to progress the issue, which I hope we can do together.
