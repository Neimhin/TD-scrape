RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that the Government is seeking to extend the disastrous decision to guarantee the banks in this country is proof positive that there is not a scintilla of difference between it and the last one.  It demonstrates most graphically that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, notwithstanding the Punch and Judy show that sometimes goes on in here, are exactly the same when it comes to the core issues.  It is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledumber.The bank guarantee was a disastrous decision.  This country led the way and was the poster boy for the deranged neoliberal economic dogma that has plunged the entire European and global economies into an unprecedented crisis.  It was also the people who led the way in the disastrous response to that by being the first to initiate a blanket guarantee of private profit crazed institutions whose reckless behaviour plunged this economy towards an abyss.  Now the rest of Europe seems to be copying us in moving down the same road.The policy is to protect the banks at all costs, regardless of the consequences for society or the possibility of economic recovery.  The guarantee forced us into the clasp of the EU and IMF and the need to borrow money to pay off and recapitalise banks because of their reckless lending.  It allowed them to put us in a vice grip where they can ram brutal austerity down the throats of our citizens, crucifying them and ransoming our entire future against the interests of the bankers and bondholders.  This was not necessary and was done solely to protect the bondholders and corporate depositors.We had a guarantee for ordinary deposit holders.  What have we got for this?  For all the money we have put into the banks and back stop that our citizens have provided for them, we have received nothing.  They will not do anything for distressed mortgage holders and will not lend money into the economy.  No matter how much we bow down in front of the bondholders, they will still not lend us money at reasonable rates.The important point for people to grasp is at the beginning of 2009 the ECB demanded, in the guidelines it issued, that we had to rescue the banks but not divert them from their central goal of profit maximisation.  The ECB was explicit in its instructions that the funding should not be diverted towards social or other macro-economic goals and that the overriding priority must be profit maximisation.  That is the problem.  Balance sheets and bondholders come first for the banks and they will not lend money into the economy or invest in it.We should repudiate this guarantee, tell the bondholders to take a hike and guarantee the moneys of ordinary deposit holders.  We must then set up a State bank which would not have all these liabilities to bondholders and others and which the State would instruct to give relief to ordinary mortgage holders and to invest in our economy so that we can put our people back to work.  If the Government is worried about money flowing out of the country, we should do as the Icelandic people did and impose capital controls to prevent that.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a two-tier system.  It is an obscenity that access to decent health care is dependent on how much money a person has.  We are in a situation where, as a result of the EU-IMF arrangement, albeit under the cover of health and safety considerations, health services are being slashed across the country.  Local hospitals and accident and emergency units are being downgraded and there is a trolley catastrophe daily in many of our hospitals.  Those are the problems we have to resolve if we are to have a health system of which we will be proud, which is fair and where there is equal opportunity for access to decent health care, which is one of the most important priorities for anybody and for any decent society.This legislation proposes to extend the risk equalisation scheme.  We have a two-tier, privatised health system that many people, because of the chronic underfunding and the crisis that exists in our public system, are forced, because they do not have a choice, into taking out private health insurance.  Given this and in so far as this is a measure to try, at some level, to regulate the private health insurance system and create some sort of level playing field, we have no choice but to go along with it.  However, the problem is that it still follows the failed strategy of having competing private health insurers as the way in which to deliver health services.  In other words, it accepts and is underpinned by the notion of a two-tier system where affordability will dictate the quality of a person's health care.Those who advocate this kind of approach to delivering health care would say that its principle objective is to improve access to health services.  In that regard, it is failing completely.  Competition has not led to lower premiums and Irish health insurance companies are raising their premiums, most recently with Quinn Insurance hiking up its premiums by 12%.  Health policy expert Professor Charles Normand of Trinity College Dublin warned in the aftermath of this hike that those plans that have competing private insurers may not be a very good mechanism for keeping prices down.  If we look at the case of the United States, we find dramatic evidence of how correct that is.The health system in the United States is based on competing private insurers, and it is the most bureaucratic and the most expensive health system in the world, with US costs twice those of comparable countries.  Some 31% of health spending goes on bureaucracy, executive salaries and massive profits.  Over $600 million of the $2 trillion spent on health in the United States, which is 15% of GDP, goes on these salaries, bureaucracy and profits.  In the Irish case, the Government is proposing to continue down this road of competing private health insurers, although it is costly and does not deliver access to the health service.  The Government must abandon the universal health insurance model, which is only about profit in private health insurance companies, and instead provide a national health service that is accessible to all and is based on progressive taxation.
