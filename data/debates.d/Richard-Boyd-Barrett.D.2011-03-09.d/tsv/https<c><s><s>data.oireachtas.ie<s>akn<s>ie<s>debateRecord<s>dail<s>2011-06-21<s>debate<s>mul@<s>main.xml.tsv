RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to establish if it is a Cabinet sub-committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is about sub-committees.  Is it a sub-committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to know if it is a sub-committee.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I recently met the parents of a disabled child who is a ward of court and I was quite shocked when I was acquainted with the situation of wards of court.  They have no rights whatsoever and are governed by legislation that dates back——

The Government's legislative programme lists the mental capacity Bill but in many cases, wards of court who are quite intellectually capable have no right to vote, no right to marry and are termed in some legislation as "idiots".  This is appalling and I appeal to the Taoiseach to bring the mental capacity Bill forward as quickly as possible because the is outrageous.
