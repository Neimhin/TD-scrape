RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister may be aware that the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which I am a member of, has been examining section 481 relief, which goes to film producer companies to make films. In return, those companies are supposed to give quality employment and training and comply with all relevant legislation. The Minister may have heard Equity saying that people are being forced to waive their rights to intellectual property, royalties, the equitable remuneration they are entitled to and so on. Film crew have said that their rights under a series of employment legislation are not being vindicated. How will the Minister respond to these concerns?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, we all share in the celebration of the success of "The Banshees of Inisherin" and "An Cailín Ciúin", but that success, which results from performances, writing and directing as well as the crews who stood behind the cameras, underlines the need to guarantee, vindicate and champion the rights of performers, writers, directors and the crew who make those films and not to pass the buck, which the Minister has essentially just done. Those films and all other films in this country are funded with public money and are subject to the requirement that we get quality employment and training and that the intellectual property rights of writers, performers and so on are guaranteed. Equity has made it clear that its members are being forced to waive their intellectual property rights, which is in breach of the copyright directive and our legislation. Film crews have pointed out that, for example, their rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act are being ignored and abused by film producer companies that are in receipt of large amounts of public money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I spoke with Equity this morning. Time and again, it has made it clear that its members are being forced to waive their rights to intellectual property and to sign contracts saying they are getting equitable remuneration when they are not. When I asked the president of Equity directly what would happen if someone did not sign the contract, the answer was that the performer would not get the job. Regarding the declaration requirement that a producer company indicates to the Minister any legal or Labour Court issue that arises, has Metropolitan Films, for example, informed her that a finding was made against it in the Labour Court over a breach of a collective agreement with film crew? Have some of the other film producer companies indicated that there are cases going to the High Court arising from cases in the Labour Court where companies in receipt of section 481 relief did not even bother to turn up and where they were named as having been in breach of legislation? Is the Minister aware of this kind of stuff?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I return to the subject of my earlier questions on the film industry. I will firstly address copyright and intellectual property rights. The legislation sets out that "The right to equitable remuneration conferred by this section shall not be waived by the performer and the performer shall not assign the right to equitable remuneration except to a collecting society". However, the contracts that producers are forcing performers to sign state that the artist agrees that the consideration herein constitutes equitable remuneration for the assignment of all rights pursuant to the above and represents a full buy-out of all rights. The producer companies that the State is funding are breaching the rights of writers, performers and actors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. I will bring up the blacklisting in a second.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, although the point is, as I mentioned earlier, that if people refuse to sign those buy-out contracts and do not get a job, they are in effect blacklisted. On the specific question, in order to avail of section 481, film producer companies have to sign a declaration that they are abiding by legislation such as the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, and they are supposed to notify the Minister of cases. Did Metropolitan Films tell the Minister there was a finding against it by the Labour Court over breach of a collective agreement? Does that concern the Minister? Did it inform the Minister that there were ten different cases of unfair dismissal, with seven at the WRC and three at the Labour Court, where the producer company refused to give evidence and said it was not the employer? It could hide behind the designated activity company, DAC, and therefore refused to even engage with the court or give evidence when workers claiming unfair dismissal took those cases. Should the Government not be looking at the detail of this and examining whether there is a major problem? I believe there is a major problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just pass the parcel. I have to hand an email from someone who was not even in front of our committee. Their name could not be given. It just said that they would love to chat about the film and TV industry again and that blacklisting, bullying and poor practices are alive and well and happening now in some of the 13 productions that were under way in the country at the time. The people who say things like that are afraid to speak out publicly. Those that did have not worked in the industry since. That is what is going on. It is possible because of the DAC structure for which the Government is responsible. The Government gives the production companies money and they give an undertaking to comply with all employment legislation. Such companies go into the WRC and state they are not the employer, even though the company knows who the person is and that he or she was employed on a film production where the company set up the DAC of which it owns 100%. Yet the companies say that they have no employment relationship with that person. And the Government is letting that happen. That is a breach of the fixed-term workers Act. Will the Government show us all the notifications or lack of notifications from the film producer companies about the cases that have been taken for unfair dismissal, which is effectively blacklisting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course it does. What else is it going to say? "We blacklist people every day"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not private. It is public money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has not built a single house-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----four years later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a priority question and the senior Minister is not here, which I find unacceptable. On Friday week I will accompany to the court Jackie and her husband - he has worked all his life for a State company and they have two kids - for a case involving an enforcement order, following which they will most likely be evicted from their home having done nothing wrong. Because they are slightly over the income threshold, they are not entitled to HAP or social housing and are expected to live in their car in a couple of weeks' time. Added to that can be Tathony House, with 35 residents facing eviction, and Rathmines Road, with about a dozen facing eviction. All this is happening and the Government continues to allow families and working people - decent people who have done nothing wrong - to be evicted into homelessness. What will the Government do to stop this shameful scandal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This is the problem when the senior Minister is not here: we just get script. No disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, but that is the problem. None of what he said stops the cliff edge Jackie, her husband and their two kids face in being evicted next Friday from the home in which they have lived all their lives, and this during what is supposedly a moratorium on such evictions. That is what is happening in reality. What the Minister of State said does not stop the stress the 35 residents and families with kids and so on in Tathony House face as their landlord tries to drum them all out from the places where they have lived. All of them paid their rent and never did anything wrong and they are being chucked out on the street. Then there is Rathmines Road. The Government needs to say clearly that people who pay their rent and have done nothing wrong will not end up in homeless accommodation. That can be done by banning such evictions and by having a clear policy whereby the State will step in and buy properties where landlords are exiting the market, regardless of whether those tenants' incomes are slightly over an income threshold - an arbitrary, cliff-edge income threshold, to use the term the Minister of State has just used.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know the Minister of State is not, but the Minister is. Jackie and her husband, who, I repeat, works for a State company, with their two kids have written to the Minister, to the Taoiseach and to everybody. They have written to Frank Curran, the head of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. They are over the income threshold, so none of the things the Minister of State said will help them. Jackie and her family cry themselves to sleep every night and they are going to be living in a car because they have nowhere to go, no HAP and no support. Then there are the families in Tathony House and Rathmines Road, all facing the prospect of ending up on the street because there is nowhere to go. There needs to be a clear policy whereby people who have paid their rent and have done nothing wrong will not end up in emergency accommodation or in a car. That has to be the policy. The State must step in even if a person's income is slightly over the threshold. Cost rental is a recognition that people who are not eligible for social housing still cannot afford market prices. Therefore, the State needs to step in in those cases as well and there needs to be a clear imperative that it will do so. Why would the Government let people become homeless? It will have to pay for and deal with the consequences of that. Why would it not do everything to stop that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a member of the Business Committee, I requested this special debate on Coillte some weeks ago. Like many who were on the protest today and many of the thousands who have signed the "Save our Forest - Save our Lands" petition, I was absolutely horrified by the proposed deal between Coillte, a public forest company that is owned by the people, and a vulture fund. And Gresham House is, in my opinion, a vulture fund.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will explain why it is a vulture fund. I will set the context for this. Our forests were destroyed by colonial and imperial plunder. It was brought down to about 1% in a country that used to have 80% forest of native woodland. One of the objectives and missions of the revolutionaries who fought for the independence of this State, right back to Parnell and the revolutionaries who fought in 1916, was to recover and regenerate our native forests and woodlands. Therefore, it is absolutely appalling that anybody in Coillte, in government or in its Departments could think it is a good idea to have wealth-asset management companies come in here and buy up potentially 100,000 ha. which is what Coillte says that it is going to contribute. Yes, the first deal is 12,000 ha. but was the whistle not blown about this? We shall see what is going to happen. So it is potentially 100,000 ha., 0.25 million acres, and God knows where it could go from there, which will be bought up by profit-hungry investment funds. Are these people vulture funds?Helpfully Coillte sent us a document containing frequently asked questions on the Gresham House deal. It states:Where do the fund’s profits go?The fund is designed to generate profits from the business of forestry and timber production. These profits will be retained within the fund and from time to time be distributed to the investors in a similar way as a company distributes dividends to its shareholders.That is a corporate takeover for profit. It is very simple. Let us get a bit more specific. Olly Hughes is the forestry managing director of Gresham House. In an article he wrote recently, he explained Gresham House's interest in buying up forests. He did not mention the word "biodiversity". He did not mention the idea of supporting farmers. He did not mention protecting wildlife, public amenities or any of the things that ordinary people and Coillte should regard as the real value of our forests and our natural heritage. Instead, he mentioned carbon trading credits, which are set to multiply in value in coming years. The casino that we saw wreck this economy with vulture funds, asset funds and so on in terms of housing will now switch to the trading and speculation in carbon credits by profit-hungry international investors. That is what they are up to. Who will own these carbon credits? Perhaps the Minister of State might inform us. Whom will they benefit? This is speculation on environmental destruction because carbon credits are bought by countries that do not take real action to mitigate climate change but buy themselves out of their requirement to deal with the destruction of our environment by buying up credits. Gresham House, facilitated by public money and public premiums by the State company, will facilitate speculation on carbon credits. That is what is going on. Of course, that means it wants the fastest-growing cheapest type of forestry that gains value for its investment and gains profit for it, regardless of the consequences for environment, communities, small farmers, biodiversity or climate change mitigation. It does not have the remotest interest in those things. It will exacerbate an already failed forestry model that has been dominated by the Sitka spruce industrial monocultural model which is a blight on our landscape and has done such damage to many communities and so on. By the way, it is an accident waiting to happen. As with ash dieback what happens if anything goes wrong with these massive industrial single-species plantations? All of it can be wiped out as happened with ash. Has the Minister of State heard of the bark beetle, for example, which is running riot through spruce plantations throughout Europe? It could potentially wipe out the entire forest estate. The pine weevil is already doing damage to Sitka spruce plantations to which they are extremely vulnerable. This kind of forestry model is an accident waiting to happen. It is bad for soil, water, wildlife, farmers, biodiversity and climate change mitigation. A report for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine a few years ago suggested that our forestry model might even be a net carbon emitter. This will exacerbate this to the benefit of vulture funds. This fact has been confirmed by, of all people, the European Commission - not my favourite people. Andrew St. Ledger and I, who were involved in organising today's protest and the Save Our Forests – Save Our Lands campaign, received a leaked document, which presumably the Government has had in its possession for some time. It contains a damning critique by the European Commission of our forestry model and of the failure of the Government to carry out a proper strategic environmental assessment on its forest programme. Is that the real reason we have not got state aid approval? We provided this damning indictment to the Irish Examiner yesterday and has been published in that newspaper if the Minister of State has not read it. It slates the environmental impact assessment provided for the Government of the €1.3 billion forestry programme. It highlights failure to comply with the Aarhus Convention, failure to fully deal with the negative impacts of what it calls the dominant Sitka spruce model, failure to address the problems of planting in the wrong places on peatlands and sensitive environments, and doing planting that is damaging wildlife, aquatic life and so on. Is that the real reason? Why was that not in the public domain? When was all this signed off without the Government supposedly being aware of it? The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is a State agency. Are we really suggesting that the Ministers and the rest of it were not aware of this going on? I am not sure if this stuff has come into the public domain. Records reveal that a company called Gresham House Forestry General Partners (Ireland) Limited was established in April 2022 with Pat Cox, an ex-Fine Gael Deputy and MEP, as a non-executive director. The company also joined the Irish Association of Investment Managers, which is led by the former Fine Gael Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, who was a Minister of State in the Department of Finance which, I remind the House, is the main shareholder in Coillte. When we are talking about the failed model pursued by Coillte, who set up Coillte? It was Bertie Ahern and Ray Burke. Why does it have a mandate that is all about profit and not about biodiversity, protecting and enhancing the forest estate in the interest of the people, the public, the common good and so on? As we know, Bertie Ahern subsequently headed up the International Forestry Fund of IFS Asset Managers, based in Dún Laoghaire. We had to go marching in 2013. It was not Pat Rabbitte who stopped the plan then of the troika and the Government, signed in a memorandum of understanding, to sell of the entire harvesting rights of Coillte. One of the groups looking possibly purchasing those harvesting rights was a fund headed up at the time by Bertie Ahern. Thousands of people marched in the save our forests demonstration and the Government was forced into a humiliating, but good retreat. The numbers will swell unless the Government gets out of this deal and end such deals. Has a strategic environmental assessment even been done of this deal to see the damage it could do to the environment? The Government needs to get out of this deal and reform Coillte.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy McNamara will read it from now on.
