RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the Government's roadmap on Covid-19 to be effective and gain public support it needs to be clear, consistent, to make sense and to embrace the principle of fairness and all of us being in it together. To date, the Government's measures and proposals have failed on those counts. The signs are that today's announcements from the Government are failing in that regard.I want to focus on one key aspect, which is the fairness principle or the idea that we are all in this together. If we do not take all our society with us, and particularly those who are affected by measures and health restrictions, everything will unravel. One of the affected groups, which I have mentioned repeatedly to the Taoiseach, has come out today in record numbers in a socially distant, masked protest in individual cars. These are the taxi drivers and their protest reached from Ballyfermot to Merrion Square. It is the biggest taxi protest ever. These people used to make their livelihood on the road but there is no roadmap for them. There is no respect or fairness and the Government is ignoring them. Their incomes and livelihoods have been decimated while they accept that the restrictions have affected their industry. Whereas others have got support in order to keep them in employment, keep up incomes and keep businesses viable, taxi drivers have got nothing. They have been placed between a rock and hard place. They can stay on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which the Government is going to cut, but many of these people are vulnerable and over 66. Otherwise they can go back to work and lose all the pandemic unemployment payment when a fraction of their previous income is available. We can think about everything on which they depend and which is affected by the restrictions. They include international travel, gigs, theatres, social gatherings and taking people from pubs and nightclubs. Everything on which they rely to make an income is gone or drastically reduced, and nothing has been given back. As people on the protest today have said, they are not cars; they are mothers, fathers, sons and people with mortgages or rent to pay. They are a vital part of our public transport system, which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not seem to understand. They bring people to hospital and politicians to RTÉ. They respond where there are no bus routes and at unsocial hours. They are a vital part of our public transport system. They are asking for an income subsidy if they return to work. They are asking that no cut be made to their PUP if they feel they cannot go to work, particularly if they are over 66. They are asking for grants to cover ongoing costs, which run to approximately €11,000 per year, even if they do nothing to keep their car on the road. They are asking for the ten-year replacement rule for vehicles to go to 12 years because they do not have an income that allows them to replace their cars. They are asking the Government to stop issuing new licences when there is not enough work for the taxi drivers that are out there. They are asking that there be no question of the threat of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to remove them from quality bus corridors and bus lanes being pushed through. This would absolutely kick them when they are down. I ask the Taoiseach to respond to the requests of the taxi drivers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the withdrawal of the crazy suggestion, which seems to have come from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of removing taxi drivers from bus lanes. We need more than vague commitments. We need very specific commitments. Subsidies have gone to other industries that have lost 20% or 30% of turnover. Taxi drivers have lost 40% or 50% of turnover. The more drivers return to work, the more turnover will decrease, especially if there are more restrictions. As long as Covid-19 exists and restrictions apply, there will not be a viable living for taxi drivers by a margin of at least 50%. They also face ongoing costs of about €1,000 a month, which they cannot cover. They have been clocking up debts over the past six months. If other industries rightly received grants and income subsidies, those should be extended to taxi drivers and to another group I have mentioned repeatedly and which is also holding a protest tomorrow, namely, the live music, arts and entertainment sector. Those workers need the same thing. We need those commitments. It is madness to continue to issue taxi licences at the moment when there is not nearly enough work for the 22,000 drivers who already hold one. I ask the Taoiseach please to get a move on. Taxi drivers need help or their industry and their livelihoods will be utterly destroyed. They are desperate and they are appealing for urgent action.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This roadmap is pretty much the most-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had a very serious announcement about public health restrictions. I think it is crazy that the matter is not being debated this week in the House so that it can be explained. I wish to register the ongoing opposition of Solidarity-People Before Profit to the changed speaking arrangements which were, in our view, deliberately designed to minimise the voice of the smaller parties. We will continue to oppose those changed speaking arrangements. I point out that trying to gag and silence some voices in the House is not the way for the Government to bring everybody with it. Last week, we saw an example of what that will mean when the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, was not present for the contributions of the lead spokespeople of approximately five of the groupings in this House. That is unprecedented.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Taoiseach was leader of the Opposition, he would regularly get up and berate the then Taoiseach, who is now the Tánaiste, for excessive reliance on special advisers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He definitely did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He lambasted the Tánaiste weekly for reliance on PR and accused the then Government of being a Government of spin. It is quite extraordinary to have 21 advisers, including three press secretaries. On top of that, there was an announcement this week that a PR firm will be employed to mediate between NPHET, the public health advisers, and the Government. It will be a buffer which will dilute and finesse the message because the Government has got it so wrong and made such a mess of conveying the public health message that we now need a PR spin team to try to get it right. I put it to the Taoiseach that this is not the right way to go about things. If one wants to instil confidence, clarity and certainty about public health measures, having a load of spin doctors and advisers who specialise in giving advice but may not have any particular expertise in the areas of substance that people want to know about is not the way forward. The Government needs to listen to people on the ground who really know and engage with them more. It would not have to spend so much on advisers or PR people if it listened to the front-line healthcare workers, nurses, laboratory people, doctors or taxi drivers who are out there. It should listen to the people on the ground who actually understand how things work on the ground. Then it might gain clarity about how to convey messages that would bring the public with it. The Government is compounding the mistakes it has made over the last number of weeks by surrounding itself with buffers, PR people and specialist advisers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was at the taxi drivers' protest during Leaders' Questions, so I have not fully studied the roadmap, but I want to know what the strategy is, as do the people.Specialists in public health, immunology, infectious diseases and so on are saying that we should be pursuing a zero Covid strategy as against what appears to be, in this plan, a roller-coaster strategy, going up and down and up and down, with nobody knowing quite where it ends. Has this committee considered a zero Covid strategy, which I stress is not about a return to lockdowns but precisely a return to normality by the putting in place of resources and systems, in particular the testing and tracing regime, such that we can really chase the virus and isolate it? This is a clear objective that the people can get behind and understand in terms of where we are heading. Connected to this is the question of permanent healthcare capacity. The capacity of testing and tracing has a lot to do with permanent recruitment. Many of those engaged in testing and tracing were redeployed from elsewhere. What is the envisaged number of staff required to be recruited permanently and engaged in testing and tracing to get to the state-of-the-art testing and tracing regime? What are the plans in terms of permanent increases in capacity for ICU and the health service generally in terms of recruitment because it is trained people who are needed? In terms of public health restrictions, would it not be best to have in place a hotline for workers in employment who are worried about encroachment on health and safety guidelines and so on such that they have a means of reporting to the HSE and a system that is responsive?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have questioned the Taoiseach and appealed to him extensively, including today, on matters relating to taxi drivers and the public transport system. As we discussed earlier, there was a major protest involving taxi drivers today. The Taoiseach has expressed sympathy but has not given a clear commitment. When will he make a decision on the key demands being made by taxi drivers, because they are desperate? They are incurring debts and have virtually no income. They do not know whether to stay on the reducing pandemic unemployment payment or go back to work, where they cannot possibly make a living, and lose all that payment. Insurance costs, repayments, licence renewals fees, car maintenance, fuel and all these costs and debts meanwhile are clocking up. When will the Taoiseach make a decision on their central request, which is for an income subsidy to allow them a baseline income on top of which they can earn money, knowing that until we have health restrictions lifted, they will not have the capacity to fully make their living. The same question applies to the arts, music and live entertainment workers. They need to get an answer to this central request. With regard to the taxi drivers, there are some measures that would not even cost anything. Stopping the issuing of new taxi licences would cost the Government nothing, as would extending the ten-year replacement rule to 12 years. Getting rid of the taxi advisory committee, which is completely discredited, and replacing it with a national taxi transport forum, with proper representation for taxi drivers so that they could actually be heard from, would cost nothing. When will we get answers to such matters? The 50% capacity rule on public transport, along with the fact that many people do not want to use it because they are frightened, has led to a problem and we need to increase capacity in public transport dramatically. We have some of that capacity with private buses and our taxi friends, who have no work. What will we do to increase public transport capacity given the 50% restriction on capacity?
