RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Such was the contrast between the Taoiseach’s noble aspirations for urgent action on climate change in his UN speech and his attendance at the EU summit a month later to seek concessions to reduce Ireland’s contribution to climate change improvements, one environmentalist commentator accused him of having had the political equivalent of a lobotomy between the UN conference and the EU summit. It was suggested that the Taoiseach had “taken political recklessness and cynicism to new lows. History may judge that he [the Taoiseach] did more than any other politician of his generation to destroy the future of Irish agriculture”. The last point is important. It is not just the case that the concessions he sought were retrograde in terms of the environment, but what he and other environmentalists have been trying to point out is that the biggest cost we face if we fail to radically reduce our CO2 emissions is damage to agriculture. The cost of that would be far greater than the fines the Taoiseach has used as an excuse for seeking a reduction in the targets, because the biggest victim of the consequences of climate change is agriculture. If we do not deal with flooding in particular, the cost for agriculture will be enormous, the very thing the Taoiseach says he is protecting in seeking concessions from the European Union in terms of the targets. The Joint Research Centre’s report on climate impacts in Europe suggests that agricultural yields across Europe will drop by 11%, and in Ireland by approximately 2%, if radical action is not taken on climate change. That would be a massive hit for Irish agriculture in terms of revenue and growth. The same report indicated that Ireland and the United Kingdom would be the worst hit by the increase in flooding that has resulted from climate change. We have seen the consequences of that. The Taoiseach has justified seeking concessions on the targets in order to prevent us being levied with fines, but on the other side of the equation, if we fail to deal with the impact of climate change we will incur a far greater cost in terms of reduced agricultural output and damage to agriculture generally. That is why I and many others do not accept the rationale behind the Taoiseach seeking concessions.The Taoiseach was using quite colourful language suggesting that if we sought to meet these targets we would be completely screwed, as he said. It is interesting to note in the context of the debates about the use of colourful language these days that the Taoiseach himself is quite capable of using such colourful language. One might well say that we will be completely screwed if we do not meet the sort of targets that are being set. On the issue of forestry, which has been discussed previously in the House, I am glad to hear positive sounds from the Government in this regard but the problem is that the sounds are somewhat like the hyperbole used in the UN speeches. Are the sounds about the expansion of forestry as a carbon sink and improving forest cover being matched with action? They are not. We are spectacularly underperforming in meeting our afforestation targets. We have consistently failed to meet our afforestation targets year after year, despite the fact that we have the most favoured climate for growing trees. Our State forestry company is precluded from contributing significantly to the afforestation programme and the private sector is simply not delivering substantial afforestation. What are we going to do given that we have the perfect conditions to grow trees but we are not hitting anywhere close to our afforestation targets if we are serious about reducing CO2 and using forestry as a climate sink, not to mention the significant spin-off and employment and economic benefits that could come from afforestation? Why is there not a major public State investment in afforestation which would result in those positive spin-offs? I am unable to tally commitments to dealing with climate change and reducing CO2 emissions with increasing fare costs for those using public transport. It is a contradiction in terms. Fares are going through the roof and are becoming unaffordable for people to the point that it is becoming cheaper to use one's car than to use public transport. While this remains the case, the Taoiseach cannot be serious in talking about reducing CO2 emissions. What are we going to do to reduce public transport fares in order that we expand the use of public transport and therefore contribute to reducing climate change?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise in advance for having to leave the Chamber straight after my contribution but I have to attend a meeting. I also thank Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Finian McGrath for facilitating me in this regard. I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on bringing forward this timely motion. I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, is aware that 10 December 2014 is International Human Rights Day, which is the reason the Right2Water campaign decided on that date for the next demonstration against water charges. At the centre of that campaign is the belief, shared it is now clear by a huge number, if not the majority, of people in this country, that access to water is a human right. As indicated by the Taoiseach when he saw the scale of the recent protests, they are not only about water charges. He is right about that. In a way, this motion speaks to that fact.  For many people, water charges are the last straw. What runs behind this is the belief that this Government and the political establishment generally in this country and in Europe has lost its moral compass somewhere along the way and has forgotten the point of politics, the point of economics and the point of a society. This is not about balance sheets, deficits, debt targets and all the technocratic nonsense that is used to justify gross levels of unfairness, inequality, poverty and so on. What it should be about is what people need to exist a civil and dignified life and establishing the bottom lines for economic thinking, social policy and policy generally. The problem is that things are being done arse about face because in dictating policy and deciding economic priority, the Government starts not with what people need and what should be their basic rights, but with profit, balance sheets, debt, deficits, what the bond holders need, keeping the markets happy and keeping bond yields down, all of which does not mean anything to anybody. It is the wrong way to do things. The most basic right is access to water, which people physically need to exist. One could also say the same about housing. If people cannot have a roof over their heads, then frankly we should forget everything else. If 20% of the children in this country are living in poverty, then forget about social stability. Talk of economic recovery is utterly meaningless if 20% of our children are living in poverty and have to exist through their childhoods in poverty. We must set bottom lines, which must include the right to water, the right to housing, the right of children not to live in poverty and the right to access to education up to third level, without obstacle, for anybody who needs it.These must be basic bottom lines. Everything else should come secondary, and be surplus, to that. That is the sentiment which is driving the popular mobilisation we will see manifest itself on the streets. If the Government is not willing to find its moral compass, we will see what human rights budgeting looks like in the demonstration on 10 December. While the Government talks about its bankrupt policies in this House, there will be a popular assembly outside it where people representing communities, civil society groups and trade unions the length and breadth of the country will have their own parliament. If the Government bothers to listen to what is said on those protests, it will hear people start with the basic requirements for their children, for housing and for the right to access water without a price tag on it. Our human rights are not for sale. Access to water is not for sale and access to housing should not be for sale. That is what human rights budgeting is about and I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. Vindication of what she is trying to get across here will be seen on the streets of Dublin on 10 December and beyond.
