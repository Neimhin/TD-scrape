RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I brought to public attention the outrageous case of Patricia and Graham King and their two children, who were sleeping in a tent in Nenagh because they were over the income threshold and therefore not even entitled to emergency accommodation, never mind housing assistance payment, HAP, or social housing. There was subsequently a flurry of publicity â€“ television appearances and so on. That obviously shamed the Government and Tipperary County Council into offering them emergency accommodation, which they moved into in Cashel. I talked to Graham this morning who told me they are being told to leave by next Tuesday. A homeless family with children is being evicted from homeless accommodation because of the income threshold and the failure of the Government to raise the threshold, which the Minister is now planning to outsource to consultants for yet another review. I got a letter from the Minister.
