RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, affair raises worrying and alarming questions about the relationship between politics and big business, the trip the Taoiseach will be taking to the World Economic Forum at Davos after Leaders' Questions, where he will spend a few days swanning around with some of the world's richest people and most profitable and wealthy corporations, also raises even bigger questions on a grander scale about the relationship between politics and the gross inequalities in wealth we see in this country and across the world. Some very nasty, sinister and hateful forces on the far right want to blame the problems in our society on desperate and vulnerable refugees fleeing war and poverty. It may be better for them to focus on what is really the epitome of the problems we face in the world, that is, the world's billionaires and multinationals discussing the future of the world, particularly in light of the Oxfam report, which reveals the absolutely gross, grotesque and growing inequality that exists between the super rich in this country and across the world and the vast majority of people, who are crushed with the cost-of-living crisis and housing crisis and who are impacted by the crisis in our hospitals and in many of our public services. The facts revealed in the report are shocking. It states that the number of people in this country who have more than €50 million in personal wealth has doubled since 2012; the number of people worth nearly €5 million each has doubled in the same period and now comprises up to 20,000 people; the richest 1% of our population now have more than a quarter of all the wealth; and the richest 10% have more than 64% of all the wealth while the poorest 50% have just 1.1% of the wealth. These are grotesque and growing inequalities.  Will the Taoiseach now consider something we have called for a long time and that Oxfam is now calling for, which is the introduction of a wealth tax? Oxfam says that a modest tax on those who have wealth in excess of €4.7 million would raise more than €8 billion in extra revenue in one year.Imagine what that would do to alleviate the crushing blows of the cost-of-living crisis, to address the housing crisis-----

Will the Government now introduce a wealth tax to start to redistribute some of the huge wealth that exists in this country but which is not being shared equally with the people of the country who generated this wealth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the Taoiseach is right. There is no conspiracy; it is naked, brazen greed. The Taoiseach's answer does not explain how the number of people with more than €50 million or the number of people with up to €5 million in personal wealth has doubled. It does not explain how corporate profits have trebled in the last ten years while ordinary people are suffering. Let me give the Taoiseach an example, just one of dozens that I encountered over Christmas and the new year, of a woman and her husband with an income of €500 per week from invalidity pension and half carer's allowance. The husband has Alzheimer's disease. When they got a housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy, he was working. Five years later, the rent has increased and those people now pay €275 a week of a contribution to rent from the €500 they have in total. They cannot make ends meet. Her rent was due on 13 January and she cannot pay. She has a gas bill of €700 unpaid and a new one to arrive later this month. Apparently, when she looked for an exceptional needs payment, she was told "No" because she had received two payments last year. This is the reality that ordinary people are facing. What Oxfam pointed out was that the gross and growing inequality in wealth had a lot to do with what it called "greedflation", profiteering by big corporations-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----taking advantage of the cost-of-living crisis to enrich themselves at the expense of families like this.Would a wealth tax not be a way to address that gross inequality?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the Central Bank report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That family is not benefiting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Paying their gas bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also think there should be a question and answer session. I want to raise what I believe is a scandal. That is the planned deal between Coillte and the UK investment fund, Gresham House. It is essentially the State facilitating and financing a corporate grab by a for-profit investment fund of tens of thousands of hectares of land and forestry in this country. I asked the Chief Whip at the Business Committee last Thursday for an urgent debate in the Dáil about this plan. Small farmers, environmentalists and anybody who cares about the forestry, heritage and land of this country are horrified by this deal, which is a repeat of the disgraceful plan to try to privatise the harvesting rights of Coillte back in 2013, which we protested against and gladly overturned. This deal has to be stopped. At a minimum, I ask for a commitment to an urgent debate in the Dáil about this outrageous plan to privatise Irish forestry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach confirm he is willing to allow a debate on the Coillte issue? I asked at the Business Committee and the members of the Opposition all agreed that they want a Dáil debate next week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach confirm that he will facilitate that debate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To subsidise investors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very much to the credit of many of the tens of thousands of people who are affected by defective apartments and the consequences of cowboy builders who were allowed to run amok in this country that, finally, we have a redress scheme. I welcome that fact, that assurances are being given it will be 100% redress and that it will be retrospective. However, the devil is always in the detail in these things. I would like and, more importantly, tens of thousands affected by this would like to see the details of the new scheme and also that those responsible for these defective buildings will be chased down, held responsible and forced to contribute to the redress scheme. Also, will the State consider developing its own construction capacity so there is capacity to do the remediation of these dangerously defective buildings?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The proposed deal between Coillte, the State forestry company, and Gresham House, a UK-based investment fund, is an absolute disgrace on a par with the previous, utterly shameful plan first signed off by Fianna Fáil and the Greens in 2010, and followed through on by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte in 2013 to pay off the bankers' debts. I am thankful that shameful proposal was defeated through mass protests but now we essentially have a continuation of that attempt by the State and by the State forestry company to facilitate a corporate takeover of tens of thousands of acres of land and forestry to benefit a for-profit investment fund. The questions and answers produced by Coillte on this spell it out clearly. It states:The [Irish strategic forestry] fund is designed to generate profits from the business of forestry and timber production. These profits will be retained within the fund and from time to time be distributed to the investors in a similar way as a company distributes dividends to its shareholders.That is what this is about. It is a corporate grab of land and forestry at the expense of small farmers, biodiversity and water quality. It is absolute nonsense to suggest any of this is going to benefit the climate. As Friends of the Irish Environment pointed out when it wrote to the European Commission, a report done for the Department showed Irish forests, because they are being cut down and are based on a monocultural industrial model, are net carbon emitters because we have a totally dysfunctional for-profit forestry model. We need to reform Coillte, abandon this deal and adopt a sustainable forestry model.
