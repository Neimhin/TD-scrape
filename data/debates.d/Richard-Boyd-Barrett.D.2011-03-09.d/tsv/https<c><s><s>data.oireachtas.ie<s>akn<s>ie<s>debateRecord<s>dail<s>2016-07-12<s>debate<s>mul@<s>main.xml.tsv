RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In order to be helpful, could we suspend the sitting for ten minutes to have somebody from the Ceann Comhairle's office explain this to us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Seriously, we are making a genuine point that we do not understand the interpretation of Standing Orders. We accept that some amendments have been ruled out on the basis that they would impose a charge on the State and that this is in compliance with Standing Orders. We do not understand how some of the others have been ruled out of order. We do not understand that interpretation of Standing Orders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wonder whether there is a Standing Order about getting too close to the bone. What Standing Order is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here we go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will explain to the Minister now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, the Acting Chairman outlined that apart from the proposer of an amendment, everybody else may speak twice. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How long is allowed for the first intervention?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no limit then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a limit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where in Standing Orders is the time limit specified?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You said you were going to apply the rules. Confirm to the House that there is no time limit on the first intervention. Otherwise, you are abusing your position.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I have not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I asked a question and the Acting Chairman did not answer it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under Standing Orders, is there a time limit on the first intervention?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Somebody in the Clerk's office should inform the Acting Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you. There is no time limit. That is all the Acting Chairman had to say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the same warnings will go to all speakers in advance of their speeches.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course, they will not. It is absolute abuse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The principle behind our amendments is to vindicate the idea of democracy and the sovereignty of the House as the directly elected Chamber representing the people of the country. This is the purpose of these amendments. It is very clear. It does not, as the Minister suggested, exclude Senators. It says the composition of the committee should be decided by the D치il. This is in line with an argument which the Minister fully understands and which he should not try to misrepresent, namely, that we believe the House is mandated on the question of water charges and it is an abuse of democracy for anybody other than the directly elected representatives of the House to decide how the issue of water charges is dealt with. We think there is a clear, democratic mandate and that the Minister is trying to worm his way out of it with Fianna F치il. We do not accept that expert groups or committees, established to make recommendations to the House, should be established by any other body than the House. This is what democracy means. It is clear that the Minister and Fianna F치il do not like democracy when it does not suit them. With these amendments, we are trying to rectify an abuse of the democratic principle. Our amendments do not specify that the House cannot select Senators. The House can choose whomever it wants to put on commissions or committees. This is what we are arguing and the Minister knows damn well it is what we are arguing. We do not think it is acceptable that the Minister is establishing a process that will, over time, undermine the clear and unequivocal mandate that was given to the House because of a side deal he happens to have done with Fianna F치il. The Minister should respond to this point. The public needs to know how the game is played. It should not be a game but it is a game. When the Government cannot win a matter in open public debate, it rigs the game by way of side deals between different political parties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment is designed to prevent the rigging of the game.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. I am telling you that the purpose of the amendment is to prevent the rigging of the game. The legislation the Government has proposed is open to the game being rigged. We are attempting to insert an amendment that would prevent the game being rigged. It is entirely relevant to the purpose of the legislation unless the Government wants to tell us it would not be worried about the game being rigged. However, I am sure, in the new political landscape, the Government would be as concerned as we are about the possibility of games being rigged. As we all know, games have been rigged for a long time on many issues. Given that it would be deviating from the Bill to enumerate them, I will not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Suffice it to say that many games have been rigged in the past with devastating cost to ordinary citizens. We are asking, as part of the new politics, that this House decides in an open and transparent way. There is no need for a commission at all. We would like it to be dealt with by the House, full stop.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has set his face against this and has decided to establish a commission. We at least want the House to have a democratic say in how all of it is done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister does not want it because he does not believe in democracy or he wants to undermine a democratic decision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the 26%-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Less is more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very much subject to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are moving to the two-minute slots.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Acting Chairman might have engaged in a bit of it in his day.
