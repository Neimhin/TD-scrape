RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A guillotine is also being applied in respect of that legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to the budget overruns and the extra cuts required as a result a few months ago. They included very significant cuts to home help hours and to the provision for personal assistants for those with disabilities. We do not know the details of further cuts amounting to €780 million due to be made as part of the budget. The Government has put a spin on the fact that extra money is being provided, while covering over the fact that more than €750 million will be taken from the health budget. At the very least, given the great anxiety caused as a result of making the extra cuts amounting to €130 million, we need to scrutinise the Supplementary Estimates in order that we understand the implications they will have in the delivery of health services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier the Tánaiste rightly or wrongly ridiculed some of the Opposition for not fully scrutinising the supplementary health budget at the health committee, and I was not at the health committee, and now-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In his comments criticising the Opposition for the points they made, the Tánaiste said Deputies should do their job in scrutinising legislation and yet he is denying Deputies in this House the opportunity to scrutinise fully this legislation. That is as clear as day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With the time the Tánaiste has allowed for the debate and the guillotine that will be imposed on it, we simply will not get to discuss some of the most substantive issues-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in this Bill that will affect the lives of struggling families, families affected by disability, children and women. That is an affront to democracy. It is an affront to the Tánaiste's promises for a new type of politics. It gives an opportunity, as we saw last night, for the Minister to filibuster on less important issues, to talk down the clock in order that we do not get to the substantial issues. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, can smile-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----wryly all he likes, the truth is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----from the moment the Government imposed the guillotine on the debate it became impossible to have a serious debate on the amendments that have been put forward-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----which could obviate the need to impose these brutal cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have proposed alternative PRSI measures, fair measures, which would take the burden off people on low and middle incomes, off the unemployed and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Tánaiste to lift the guillotine on the debate and allow it to take place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ask the troika can we have time for the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points have largely been made. However, I make one last appeal to the Tánaiste not to play the political games that he accuses us of playing when, in fact, he is playing them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was the Government's decision to allocate 20 hours to the Savita Halappanavar debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not asked for on this side of the House. It is now apparent that it was a cynical manoeuvre on the Government's part to truncate the time allowed to debate the budget and the Social Welfare Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All we are asking for is for the Government to adjust the Order of Business to allow sufficient time to discuss the specific provisions included in this Bill and the amendments submitted by the Opposition in order that we have an opportunity to scrutinise all aspects of the Bill as we are supposed and obliged to do in the House. The Government is preventing us from doing this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We wanted the Government to pass legislation on the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was my point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Say nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief. The people the Minister is hitting with this measure will also be affected by cuts to the clothing and footwear allowances, child benefit and the property tax. We are talking about many hundreds of euro being taken from the income of people who are doing a service to the State by looking after their loved ones. To take this action is obnoxious and nauseating. One cannot describe it as fair; it is obscene and indecent. The Minister has claimed consistently she had no alternatives in this regard and had to make hard choices. I find the use of the word "hard" extraordinary. What carers do is hard, in fact "hard" does not even come close to describing what they have to do. They must engage intensely at an emotional, physical, economic and every imaginable level in order to care for their loved ones, thereby providing a service at a massive saving to the State. To do this to them is unconscionable. The Minister stated there were no alternatives but when alternatives are put to her and to the Government she merely reiterates that headline allowances are being maintained and sings her own praises. Will she answer us directly and simply? Why did she make the choice to do this rather than to increase, even marginally, the tax on those with incomes of more than €100,000 a year? Will she answer that simple question? This point was made by her Labour Party colleagues, and all the groups in civil society mentioned by Deputy Nulty have asked her to do this, but we still have not had a straight answer. Instead of doing this, why would the Minister not increase the PRSI levels for those earning in excess of €100,000 a year? It is a simple choice and is contained in an amendment we tabled. The Minister could do it, and save all this hardship and suffering for people who do not deserve it, those who are the most decent people and the real heroes of our society. Will the Minister not pull back from this and show them the respect they deserve?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have been cut also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies, but they have been cut also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are included in the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Lift the guillotine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Minister not answer the question we asked about alternatives?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Reverse it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tick, tock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Respite care.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tick, tock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to say the same. This has been a model exercise in how the Oireachtas should work. Organisations representing the credit union movement made their views known about the Bill initially proposed by the Government. Representatives of various parties listened to those concerns and brought them to the attention of the Government which took action to change the Bill as a result. That is how democracy should work. I would be interested to hear detailed explanations of some of the formulations proposed by the Government, as there may be some issues that we would still like to raise. In general, the Government has engaged genuinely with the Opposition on this matter and listened to the concerns of the credit union movement. The Bill has been improved substantially as a result. Like Deputy Pearse Doherty, I cannot help wishing the Government had engaged with the public and the Opposition on other matters, some of which we discussed earlier today and in the last week, in the same way. If it had done so, it would have enhanced the credibility of the House and politics generally to a great degree. I hope the manner in which the Bill has been approached will be the manner in which the Government will approach other Bills in the future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I very much welcome this amendment, which is very much in the spirit of the suggestions made by all sides of the Opposition and which were fully acknowledged by the Government both on Committee Stage and Report Stage. This satisfies the concerns raised by the credit union movement. I welcome the amendment and commend the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To echo Deputy Pearse Doherty's point, the credit union representatives to whom I spoke said they would find it very helpful if the requirements and obligations they must meet were set down in a simple and readily understandable way. The Bill has been much improved since its introduction and we have already had this particular discussion. Nevertheless, I urge the Minister to consider what is a reasonable request by the credit union sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, I commend the Government on this amendment. It is one of the most important moves to acknowledge explicitly in the Bill a very positive suggestion made by the credit unions. In these rather bleak times when we often argue with one another about what not to do, and desperately look around for positive suggestions about what we might do, this is a positive, forward-looking and imaginative proposal by the credit unions that can benefit everybody. Not only is it important to include it in the Bill but I urge the credit unions, as did the Minister of State, to come forward with their proposals so that we can look at them and thereby take this suggestion seriously. It seems as if some of the desperately needed investment funds we would all like to see made available to invest in employment-rich and socially valuable projects are being offered to us by an organisation whose members have the best interests of this country at heart. It is a very positive move and I hope we not only include it in the Bill but also that we take up this suggestion and seek to develop it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with others that the Bill has been improved substantially by meeting some of the concerns expressed. I echo the points made about the removal of the exclusion on persons in arrears. However, the democratic principle of credit unions may be somewhat undermined - the right of members to make these decisions and judgments about the people they wish to serve on the board. I welcome the improvements, but the Minister of State should keep an ear to concerns or problems that may arise as a result of the exclusions which continue to be provided for in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a sobering thought. Where will we be in 2025?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a considerable improvement in recognition of the concern raised by the credit unions. Given the Minister of State has provided for exceptional circumstances, I hope that, if everybody is being reasonable, the concerns expressed by the credit unions will be addressed adequately. However, I never really received a satisfactory answer to one question, bearing in mind the importance ascribed to the principle of rotation and the imposition of term limits. If term limits are considered so important for credit unions, why are they not imposed on banks, for example? Why does the Government attach so much importance to term lmits for credit union directors? Why do we not have a problem in this regard and with certain other conditions that applied to staff who served in our banks over the years? Will the Minister of State explain this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for accepting the amendment. It is regrettable that the constituent who raised the issue with me is not in the Visitors Gallery, as he has been here to follow some of the proceedings on the Bill. I will not say this has been a labour of love for him, but it has been an issue he has been pursuing for many years. He has specifically sought to have the word "written" inserted in the Bill. The amendment allows for a clear and transparent record to be given of the reasons provided by the board oversight committee for suspending a director of the board. It spells out the steps for proceeding with such a suspension and how the person proposed to be suspended can state his or her case. This is a good amendment and I commend the Government for taking it on board. A person raised a related issue which probably does not come under the Bill. That person believes there is not an adequate procedure in place for individuals to make a case to the regulator where there is a dispute over the rights and wrongs of a suspension and that there is a need for the Central Bank to ensure there will be a fair procedure in place all the way up the line to allow individuals to appeal a decision in a case if they are unhappy at any stage of the process. That there is now a requirement for reasons to be given in writing will at least ensure a level of transparency about decisions that might be made in this regard.I welcome the amendment. I am sorry the individual in question is not here to see a little bit of his idea being enshrined in law. I am sure he will be very pleased, however, and that it will have the desired effect.
