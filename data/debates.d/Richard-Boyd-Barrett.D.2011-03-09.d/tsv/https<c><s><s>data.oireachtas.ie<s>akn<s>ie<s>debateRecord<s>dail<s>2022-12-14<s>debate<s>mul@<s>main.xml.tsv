RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a matter of urgency and necessity that we re-nationalise our energy sector and put it back on a not-for-profit footing. I say this from the perspective of people who, when we are faced with the sort of energy crisis we are now witnessing, are being crucified by a market, for-profit system which has no capacity to control the price of heating, energy and hot water that human beings need to sustain themselves through periods like this cold snap we are experiencing. I wish to bring the argument down to the core of human reality that people are facing by referring to a couple of messages I received this week. The first asked me what the story is with the gas prices. The person who wrote it was on pre-paid power and used to top-up by €20 weekly, but the cost now is nearly €10 daily. This person, who is on invalidity pension and lives alone, then wrote, "God Almighty, it is worrying", and said that due to being sick since last Friday with flu, her gas might have been on a little more but not all the time. This is a huge concern for this woman, and for others, and I was asked to flag this situation with our Government to see what people can do to cope. She suggested that since each gas system works differently, it might be possible to get the council to get an expert to look at these systems to see how to best get the most from them at little cost. My correspondent then wrote that she would appreciate it if I could bring this issue up. This is an elderly woman on invalidity pension, with the flu, who is terrified by the cost of energy. I got a message from another woman, whose name is Deirdre. She wrote to me to raise an issue that she said had not been highlighted during this cold snap. Deirdre is living in social housing in Dún Laoghaire. Her housing association is Tuath Housing and the management company for the apartment complex is Benchmark Property and these apartments are all tied to one district heating system run by Kaizen Energy. Since the rise in heating costs and daily standard charges, Deirdre cannot keep up with the cost of heating. She works full time and is a single parent to a teenager with autism spectrum disorder, ASD. She earns an okay wage but said she was sitting there in her apartment, ill with flu, and freezing because her heating ran out again that morning and she just did not have the money to top it up. Deirdre works full time and is, therefore, not entitled to fuel allowance or any other assistance, so she said she will have to wait until 22 December to be able to top it up again. Another issue for Deirdre is that the heating system is tied to the hot water, so if she does not have credit on the heating system, then she has no access to hot water. Deirdre wishes to know why this heating company has full control and why tenants cannot shop around for a better deal, or the management company for that matter. The Minister of State will get the drift. I met another man who came into my office - I think he actually lives in the same development - a couple of months ago who told me the shocking fact, and this was an ill, elderly man, that he has not had hot water for about a year because he could not afford it. Another example, also from my area and the Minister of State's, so he should be interested, concerns a resident living in Halliday House in Cualanor in Dún Laoghaire. The people there recently received a communication from their provider, Kaizen Energy, telling them their heating prices would be going up from €0.233 per kWh to €0.56 per kWh. This is a staggering 140% increase overnight, and it comes on top of a €1.08 daily standing charge. A screenshot was attached to this message for reference. How is it expected that people will cope with this kind of situation? How is it possibly allowed? Of course, the reason this is allowed is that we deregulated and privatised the energy market. The people involved in these companies, then, can charge what they like. There is absolutely no fairness or consistency in what people are charged. It is all driven by what can make these companies a profit. As a result, elderly, sick and vulnerable people freezing in their homes in this weather are unable to even afford hot water. It is a very different situation, of course, for the energy companies. Bord Gáis Energy recorded a 74% rise in profits in the first half of this year, from €22 million to €39.5 million. Its parent company, Centrica, which also owns British Gas, made operating profits of £1.3 billion in the second quarter. We have also seen similar spectacular rises in the profits of the ESB. Deputy Paul Murphy has already highlighted what is happening with the fossil fuel companies, which have seen an unprecedented bonanza in the profits they are enjoying during the period when this cost-of-living crisis is crucifying elderly people, working people on low and middle-incomes, pensioners and so on. An absolute bonanza is being made in profits and there is nothing to stop these companies doing this because the entire system is operated for profit. As the Minister of State and the Government are wont to do, they wish to try to blame all this on the war in Ukraine, but the facts tell a different story. The rise in electricity and heating costs can be traced directly back to the deregulation and privatisation of the energy market and the removal of the not-for-profit mandate of the ESB. This happened long before the Ukraine war. From 1994, which is when deregulation started, to 2014, average consumer prices in the EU-15 increased by 40%. That was bad enough for the EU. In that period as well, however, average consumer prices increased by 267% in Ireland. This was before any of the recent crises and price hikes. Energy prices had gone up in this country by multiples, by four and five times, what they had gone up in the rest of Europe.We go from having the lowest energy prices in Europe because the ESB has a not-for-profit mandate to privatisation and deregulation where it jumps by multiples of the rest of Europe. God knows what that figure would be if we count in what has happened in the past two years. Electricity prices in this country are 49% higher than they are in France where over 90% of the market is dominated by state-owned or state-backed entities. The evidence is absolutely clear. Privatisation and deregulation, so-called competition in the market, have done the exact opposite of what the people who proposed them said they would do. I was shocked to hear the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in recent debates trotting out the same rationale, even in the face of all of the evidence that is now confronting us. The Minister and the Minister of State talked about competition benefiting the consumer in the market. Are they off their heads? Where is the evidence that competition has done anything other than fill the pockets of the energy companies with a bonanza of record profits resulting in massive hikes in the cost of energy? To conclude on the point about climate, what is the point in us developing all our own renewable energy to deal with the climate crisis if all the benefit is going to flow to private companies that wish to keep the prices up? We have not seen any benefit from the fact we are now one of the biggest producers of renewable energy, not a single benefit. Why has there not been some reduction in the price of electricity now that we are up to about 30% renewable energy? It is because private companies, linking it to the wider fossil fuel and energy profiteering, make sure there is no benefit passed on to ordinary people. Nationalisation is an absolute must and an urgent necessity.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Try growing a few trees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State. I agree with him there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Government continue to repeat the false mantra that objections by residents groups to planning applications, rather than the speculation of property investors are the cause of the housing crisis and the slow delivery of housing and residential development, particularly when a Government report says that it is speculation? The report, published in July, shows 75,000 planning permission applications for apartments, but only 5,000 apartments are being built annually. It explains that this "could indicate the speculative purchasing and holding of land with a view to greater future resale value", acquiring planning permissions to hold as an asset. It goes on to say that "acquiring permission for apartment development, rather than housing developments, could be the most attractive option for speculative land holders and thus yield the most amount of value". Why does the Government not target the speculators instead of limiting people's right to make submissions on planning applications?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no evidence in that document - not a single mention of planning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To say this is a mess would be understating the situation. It is difficult to know where to begin. I cannot really see credible justifications for some of the provisions in this Bill. It is being rammed through Second, Committee and Remaining Stages in one day, although it is dealing with such serious matters. This is being done without proper scrutiny or any real evidence or justification for what the Minister is trying to do. In the brief time allowed to me, I will summarise the rationale behind what I have just said. We all know An Bord Pleanála needs radical reform in respect of how the board is nominated, the number of people on the board, the board's quorum and so on. I would take the Minister's point on the rationale for this rush if we needed a chairperson just to make the board function briefly, but if the justification is to give the Minister power to decide on the appointment process, possibly for up to two years, we should proceed differently. If it is just a matter of keeping the thing functioning for a short while - the Minister could tell us who he is actually proposing or how he is planning to proceed - there should be no question of this power grab, which is what it is, or going back to the very situation we had to move away from because of all the scandals around political interference in the planning process. I do not accept, after all we have been through in this country, that we should effectively give total political control in respect of the board and who is to be nominated to chair it, although I do of course agree, as we have been arguing consistently, that we need a much bigger quorum. It was unbelievable that two people were effectively making planning decisions. The whole nomination process was, to put it mildly, vulnerable to corruption, massive conflicts of interest and so on. There needs to be a considerable, radical and fundamental overhaul but that should not entail centralising power in the hands of the Minister. Rather, it should be about ensuring genuine independence and genuinely having a broad spectrum of stakeholders, experts and people to protect the public interest and ensure sustainable development. It should also be about ensuring all these matters are adjudicated fairly and objectively according to the law. What the Minister is doing is without justification. On the foreshore issues, it is pretty telling that environmentalists are urging us not to proceed with this because we do not know the possible implications. They are very worried about what changes to the foreshore Act might mean. Representatives of the industrial wind energy sector are saying the same thing, but from precisely the opposite point of view. They are saying their ambitions may be inhibited. It is pretty extraordinary in and of itself that the two ends of the spectrum of concern around our maritime area, insofar as this Bill impacts upon it, have radically divergent views about what this measure actually does and what its unintended consequences, including legal consequences, might be. The occupancy rights of people such as fishermen to fish in certain areas might be affected if foreshore licences are given for certain things within the foreshore area.We are not quite sure because major debates have been going on within the Department dealing with the foreshore as to exactly what the foreshore is anyway, and where it begins and ends. That is not acceptable. All of these things need to be thoroughly scrutinised in here and cannot be rammed or rushed through. It gives huge scope for dodgy unintended consequences. The Minister should press the pause button on all of this so we can have the proper scrutiny and understand what we are doing, what the legal consequences are, and what the impact on the various stakeholders and on our environment might be. I now turn to the Part 8 planning process and the right of the public to be consulted on Part 8 planning proposals. I went to the briefing, which on Monday. We asked the Minister's officials if they had any evidence whatsoever that this is necessary. There was none. They were quite frank about not having any evidence. There is no evidence at all that Part 8 planning process and the public consultation on it has been, in any shape or form, a blockage to development on public land. Not at all. In fact, insofar as the officials were pushed they said that since the reforms in this area, it has been working very smoothly. It is certainly my experience of the Part 8 process. It is time fixed and is efficient from a time point of view. It gives people the opportunity to be consulted and it works. Why on earth is the Minister doing it? The Minister's officials could not tell us. Not a single shred of evidence was provided. We will see. To me, this smacks of something bigger, which is the myth - I am not allowed to say "lie", so I will not say "lie" - or the falsehood that the Government keeps peddling that the reason we cannot deliver social housing and housing generally is because of all these terrible objectors, and that this is the problem. In his article in the Business Post at the weekend, Killian Woods referred to various Government publications, one of which was Build 2022: Construction Sector Performance and Capacity, and fair play to him. Mel Reynolds has often pointed me to this document as well, and it is something we should all read. It is the Government's own analysis of why we are not building to a sufficient degree. Does it mention public consultation or the planning process once? Not once does it mention public consultation, objections, or times of planning. Far more telling, the article states there are 75,000 planning permissions for apartments, some 32,000 of which are in Dublin. Only 5,000 are being delivered annually. It then explains why this might be the case. It could indicate the speculative holding and purchasing of land with a view to greater future resale value - in other words, speculation. It is the acquiring of planning permissions to hold as an asset. The report states that the building up of planning permissions is largely linked to apartment schemes, which can be very valuable assets. Another report, Planning Permissions and Housing Supply, states that acquiring permission for apartment development, rather than housing developments, could be the most attractive option for speculative land holders and thus yield the most amount of value added upon resale. The same report states that one of the most significant knowledge gaps that constrains the Government from addressing land speculation with new policies is the lack of data on land transactions. This report identifies, explicitly, land speculation by private investors in land and property. The Build 2022: Construction Sector Performance and Capacity report goes on to state something interesting, which applies directly to Part 8. The report points out another problem. It states, "...one of the biggest barriers to improving productivity is the design time waste created by the lack of a collaborative approach between client, [which in this case could be the local authority] designers and the delivery team/contractor." The fragmentation of planning, construction and design is brought about by lots of multiple private operators. Rather than the State and local authorities having their own construction capacity to design, build and put the whole thing together, there is constant switching between one private operator and another, designers and contractors and so on. The report identifies this as the problem. Does the Minister propose legislation here tonight that deals with speculation? No. Does the Minister propose or support the setting up of a State construction capacity so we can overcome these problems? No. Instead, the Minister wants to blame people who put in submissions to planning applications, while there is no evidence they have any impact whatsoever on our ability to build houses or infrastructure. It smells a bit fishy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We recognise the board has to function. However, the idea that the Minister will appoint the chair and board for a year and then have the option to do so for another year is a difficulty for us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We accept there needs to be an interim process, but the period involved does not need to be a year. We want the whole thing scrutinised and discussed in detail in here in terms of how all of this will work and to ensure it is genuinely open, transparent and diverse and not subject to untoward influences from particular industry stakeholders, interests or political influence. Therefore, there should not be carte blanche for the Minister over an extended period. The matter should be discussed in detail in the House so that we have a level of transparency, given this is all being done in a rush. Our amendment is quite reasonable in that regard. The Minister should accept it.
