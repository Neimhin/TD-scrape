RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Duffy for coming before us. I agree with previous speakers that we could have done with detailed facts and figures for the mortgage resolutions that have been completed. I hope we can have this information to ensure we are not placed at a disadvantage. I will not labour the point made by Deputy Higgins, other than to add that a write-down to current market levels would not only be an advantage for those who are in distress but also for those who are pinned to the wall in meeting their payments. We must not forget the latter group. Those who are in trouble and cannot pay their mortgages and the tens of thousands who are just about managing to make payments on enormous debts are all victims. This is strangling the economy and visible on every high street.  Mr. Duffy correctly spoke about the need to stimulate small and medium enterprises. What we are seeing is small and medium enterprises being crushed and companies going out of business daily because nobody has any bloody money to spend. People are pinned to the wall in trying to pay off unsustainable mortgages. Ultimately, we will have to come to that solution and I fail to understand the reason the banks and the Government do not recognise this. Mr. Duffy has stated AIB does not have the money to write down the negative equity on the mortgages it holds. What would it cost the bank to do so? If we had that figure, we could at least examine such an option as a possible solution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be useful if we had figures. In that context, how much will Allied Irish Banks pay out to bondholders this year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Duffy have a rough idea?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not have specific details in respect of AIB. It would be useful to know how much money all the banks are paying to bondholders. In that context, it is worth noting that all of the bondholders of the banks we bailed out are getting paid and making a profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the overall picture, the figures provided for mortgage resolutions were percentages of mortgage accounts. We heard a figure of 11.6%. Can we have numbers? I am trying to make rough calculations on the basis of the information provided. If, as I believe I heard Mr. Duffy state, AIB made 12,500 offers of solutions and this amounts to 27% of the relevant mortgages, can we conclude that approximately 50,000 AIB mortgage accounts are in distress?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could it be more than 50,000 cases therefore?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very difficult for me to compute these figures as Mr. O'Connor provides them here off the top of his head. I appreciate him answering the question, but it would be very helpful to receive these numbers and figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Based on what Mr. O'Connor has said regarding the 8,600 offers AIB made in the second quarter, 5,000 of those customers have received threatening letters. Can we expect a similar ratio for all the other accounts that have not been dealt with yet, which could be based on what Mr. O'Connor has said amount to from 30,000 to 50,000 accounts? Can we expect a 60% ratio among these? Can we expect that 60% of these people will receive threatening letters?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. It would be terrifying if it was not to decline. It is at a terrifying level.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of the 5,000 in question, Mr. Duffy has said that many of those have returned and sought engagement. How many?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some 15%, but based on that quarter's group unless that improves we could be looking at 4,000 repossessions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There have been 439 voluntary disposals. Was the rest of these customers' debt written off or are they still lumbering under debt after returning their house?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My last question relates to split mortgages. Is it not obvious that the reason the bank is getting a low take up on split mortgages is because people do not see them as a solution? I heard of two such cases this week. For example, people who were working took out a mortgage for a former council house, for which they paid €400,000 and have had a split mortgage offered to them.The €200,000 has been parked. They will pay more than €200,000 for the next 20 years as well as interest on that amount, which would probably take it up close to €300,000, and at the end of 20 years they will still owe €200,000. That person told me that he has no choice but to accept it and that in 20 years' time he will owe €200,000 and will probably have to sell the house. Why would people want go into a process like that?
