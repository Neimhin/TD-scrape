RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is difficult to get my head around the answer the Minister has given.  If I understand her correctly, at the beginning of last year, there were 2,342 social workers and at the end of 2011 there were ten more.  That is a net increase of ten but 71 will retire at the end of February, representing a reduction in the number of social workers.  I am unsure whether the 60 that have been recruited and to which the Minister referred are in addition to the final 2010 figure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  If one adds the increase of ten to the 60, that makes 70.  However, with 71 to retire in February, that is a net decrease of one social worker.  How on earth can the Minister claim this is meeting the recommendations of the Ryan report?  More important, how can this possibly provide the required social work resources to meet the Children First guidelines which the Minister has committed to putting on a statutory footing?  Peter McVerry has said that to bring us up to the number of social workers in Northern Ireland, which is by no means a beacon in this regard, we would need an extra 1,200 social workers.  There seems to be no movement at all under the Minister's watch in terms of the net number of social workers available, although we need more.Is there some massaging of the figures going on in terms of moving social workers from primary care teams and community preventative programmes into child protection?  This seems utterly self-defeating and, ultimately, it will be more costly.  Preventative social work should not lose out at the expense of social work further down the line.  Clearly, prevention is even better than dealing with problems when they emerge.There has been a failure to provide extra social work resources but we do not simply need more social workers.  Once assessments are carried out we need a range of other resources which do not seem to be provided for in the budget in any way, including child care workers, family support workers, psychologists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.  Where are the budget commitments to provide these resources?  They will be necessary to put substance to the Children First guidelines and the Minister has stated she will put them on a statutory footing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister clarify that under her watch, after retirements at the end of February, we are talking about a net increase of one social worker, according to her figures?  This is against a background of children waiting 18 months for psychological assessment or six months to have hearing assessed, for example.  In order to implement the Children First guidelines, we are going to need many more resources.  Is it the case that the delay in putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing results from the Minister's awareness of "challenging circumstances" or "legacy issues" meaning that resources are not being put in?  Therefore, the Government and the Minister could end up exposed to legal action if the guidelines are put on a statutory footing but we fail to put in place the necessary resources to implement them.  Is that the reason for the delay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Based on answers to previous questions and on the Government's general commitment to a new republic, constitutional conventions and more open and accountable politics, one would imagine this means a political system that is more responsive to the popular will on key issues confronting the Government.  Given the Taoiseach has committed the Government to supporting a treaty, which is not an EU treaty but an intergovernmental treaty, which will lock this country into crippling austerity for at least ten years and which will give this intergovernmental body the right to intrude on our budgetary process and to impose conditions on the ability of governments to frame budgets which will in the words of the treaty be "permanent and binding", thereby locking governments into them, it is difficult for me to understand how that is not worthy of a referendum.  It is probably the most far-reaching treaty with the most profound impact on the citizens of the country and the Government's ability to exercise economic sovereignty in the State, so how can the Government think-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that does not require a referendum?  It is beyond me.  With all the love circulating on St. Valentine's day, does this extend to the majority of people in this country, who have indicated they want a referendum on this treaty, and will the commitment to new and open democratic politics lead the Taoiseach to conclude that we should have a referendum as a matter of priority?  If the Government or the Attorney General decides we need a referendum, will the Taoiseach indicate when that referendum might take place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I listen to the Taoiseach blather on every week.  What is the difference?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am for Connolly's Republic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach read the growth rates?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was the European constitution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is disappointing that the Taoiseach has descended to referring to views that are not in agreement with his own as "rant" and "blather".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it not be more accurate to use those words to describe the comments the Taoiseach made in Davos-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----when he said the Irish people "went mad borrowing" and blamed them for the economic crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach think the views of the majority of people in this country who want a referendum on this treaty, which will have a profound impact on our economy and on our society for years to come, are "rant" and "blather"?  Regardless of the Taoiseach's views on the matter, does he agree that is a legitimate demand for people to make?  They know we are facing a serious crisis.  They know nobody has the answers.  The public has good reason to believe our masters in Europe do not have the answers because they have not provided them so far.  I do not even know if the Government-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should the Taoiseach not respect the wishes of the majority of people who believe this treaty is so far-reaching and of such importance for them that a referendum should be held on it?  The Taoiseach referred to the need for growth.  I agree it is absolutely needed.  Can he tell me what precisely in this treaty or in the Finance Bill 2012 will promote growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Investment in the economy is needed if growth is to take place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This treaty requires precisely the opposite.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is for sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In what?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For example, a TD.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose to share time with Deputies Healy and Catherine Murphy.  This Bill and the jobs plan, which will be discussed later in the week, will do virtually nothing to achieve the Government's stated objective of creating jobs, certainly not on the enormous scale needed to deal with the massive unemployment and emigration crises blighting our society.  At best, this is a scattergun approach with paltry, technical, minor measures that purport to stimulate the economy but will make no difference.  In so far as there is any substance to it, the legislation is utterly misguided, driven by precisely the failed ideology and doctrine that got us into this mess.The Bill indicates that the addiction of the political establishment in this country has failed, neoliberal economic doctrines continue to be as strong as ever.  That we have changed from the A team of the Irish political establishment, Fianna FÃ¡il, to the B team, Fine Gael, has changed nothing.  The policies remain the same.  The context in which this Bill is published, with the Government making a song and dance about its aspirations and objectives for jobs and to stimulate the economy, is that money that could be used to stimulate the economy and create jobs is being poured into the vaults of banks, bondholders and speculators in Europe who caused the crisis, leaving us with an intolerable debt burden that is crippling the economy.  This is being paid for by vicious austerity, which is causing immense suffering for the ordinary working people in this country and which is also further damaging, crippling and suffocating the economy.I was going to say that this Bill is a classic example of whistling against the wind but it is more accurate to say it is an example of whistling in the face of a gale force storm wrecking everything in its path.  It is delusional to suggest the Bill can contribute in any significant or substantial way to creating jobs.  We do not want to be prophets of doom but we must face reality.  How many announcements of jobs initiatives, jobs proposals and jobs plans have we had over the past year?  It all sounds good and, for a day or two, maybe people think some improvement will occur.  However, the facts quickly contradict these claims.The most recent set of facts comes from the CSO for the third quarter of last year.  The Government cannot blame the previous Government for that because it took place after the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, first announced his jobs initiative.  In that quarter, 20,500 jobs net were lost, with 4,000 lost in the previous quarter.  There was an acceleration of net job destruction in the third quarter of last year after the new Government announced the first of its job initiatives.  That is indicative of the reality of its job strategy.  It is failing disastrously and the Bill does nothing to change direction.In many ways what is in this Bill is less important than what is not in it.  Deputy Doherty alluded to what should be in it when he referred to the figures published by the CSO at the weekend.  They showed who has paid the price for austerity in terms of increased taxes over the past year or two.  It is overwhelmingly low and middle-income earners who have been slaughtered unfairly while the wealthy in our society got away almost scot free.  In some cases they have done better and have been protected.  This Bill does nothing to address that injustice.  It is not just an injustice, it is damaging the economy because when ordinary people are crippled with the level of austerity and taxes being imposed on them, they have no money in their pockets to spend and the small businesses that Government claims to support and wants to promote suffer, go out of business and shed more jobs, and the downward spiral continues.If we were to ask what should have been in the Bill and what is not, it would be worth starting by trying to remind ourselves what caused the current economic crisis in the first place.  It is the worst economic crisis the State has ever seen and the worst across Europe since the 1920s or 1930s.  Nobody could dispute what caused it: at times even the Minister has acknowledged it in the House.  The economic crisis we are facing was caused by a culture of greed and speculation by financial markets, bankers and corporate elites.  That culture was incentivised by obscenely high salaries, inadequate taxes on the financial sector and markets, by allowing sectors of the economy as important as banking to become casinos where profit was the only god and property-based tax incentives in this country.One would think if that was the reason we had a crisis we would want to change all those things, end the culture of obscenely high salaries for corporate executives and impose higher taxes on the financial markets in order to rein them in, control them and ensure some benefit was derived for the economy.  One would want to make sure new sectors of the economy were not turned into casinos the way the banking sector was and do away with the property-based tax incentives that might fuel another bubble like that which ruined this economy.However, the Minister is doing the exact opposite.  His answer to the economic crisis is to give more incentives and tax breaks to corporate high-fliers and executives earning obscenely high salaries.  He is giving more tax breaks to multinational companies to lure in what is essentially tax piracy.  Losses made elsewhere can be declared by multinationals in Ireland and written off against tax.  Companies will pay less tax here and the 12.5% corporate tax rate extends to dividends made outside Europe.  It is bad enough that we have low corporate taxes here but the Minister now wants to give more tax breaks to multinationals.He wants to turn carbon trading, which is supposed to be about safeguarding our environment, into a casino and provide incentives like those provided to the banking sector by the previous Government.  He wants self-assessment of all tax by 2013, which is a recipe for more tax avoidance.  I cannot believe it.  Meanwhile, he increased VAT on goods, services and small businesses, the very sector he is supposed to be helping, by 2% which will do further damage to struggling domestic sector.It is more of the same.  It is about protecting, incentivising and rewarding the rich while attacking the poor.  It continues injustice and the downward economic spiral.  The Minister should stop it.
