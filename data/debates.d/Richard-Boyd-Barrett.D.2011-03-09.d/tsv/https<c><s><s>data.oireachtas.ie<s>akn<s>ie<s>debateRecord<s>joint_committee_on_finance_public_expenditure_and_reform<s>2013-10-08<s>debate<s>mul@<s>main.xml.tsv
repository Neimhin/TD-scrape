RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that 1.8% GDP growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are some oddities to the analysis we have heard, as referred to by other speakers. To follow on from the last point, the Fiscal Advisory Council, in its earlier reports - although, perhaps significantly, not in its most recent one - included an interesting graph which showed that if growth were to turn out 1% less or 1% greater than projected, the adjustment necessary to meet the deficit targets would be very significantly higher or lower. As I recall, the difference was in the order of €1 billion per year. We have not met the growth forecasts for this year, the difference being approximately 1%. According to those earlier tables from the Fiscal Advisory Council, this could have very serious implications for the level of adjustment that might be required in future years. Can Mr. McCarthy explain why this is not being reflected in the Department's analysis? Surely there must be an impact if the growth forecasts are not met. We used to hear a great deal of talk about jobless growth. Now it seems we have growthless jobs, which is an interesting anomaly that requires significant scrutiny. Are there issues in regard to the method of counting or defining unemployment? Are people on internships and back to work schemes, for example, counted as unemployed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is very revealing. One can conclude, therefore, that the supposed increase in employment, which, oddly, is not matched by significant increases in growth, could very well have something to do with how people are being categorised as either employed or unemployed, with people on schemes or internships putting themselves in the latter category.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not so sure. We are not talking about such a dramatic increase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are the figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many people have joined back to education schemes, back to work schemes and so on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I expect they might be very interesting, and I intend to seek them out. There is a very strange contradiction going on here, which Mr. McCarthy has acknowledged is difficult to explain, in that we have jobs but no growth. I accept that he might not have all the answers today, but the issue certainly requires further analysis. I understand the CSO has estimated that 40,000 people are leaving the country every year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Going on that estimate, if 68,000 people had not left in the past two years, what would the unemployment rate be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate if Mr. McCarthy would come back to me with that figure. We need to know what impact the enormous flood of emigration is having on the unemployment statistics. Is it fair to say that if the estimated 68,000 who have left had not done so, we would be looking at a significantly higher unemployment rate than what we have now or even what we had two years ago?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not fair to say, therefore, that if we did not have people flooding out of the country, then the story, as Mr. McCarthy described it, would not be so rosy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As regards the jobs that are being created, Mr. McCarthy indicated that they are concentrated in export services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did Mr. McCarthy point to one of the tables as showing that exports of goods were down and exports of services up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are financial services making a significant contribution to the increase in services exports?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses probably cannot answer this question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses said that they are basing their contribution on the adjustment figure of €3.1 billion originally set out for this year and they cannot tell us what adjustment would be required to meet the deficit. Can the witnesses say anything about the primary surplus or are they barred from answering that? What adjustment would be needed for us to achieve the primary surplus next year, which is an important benchmark?
