RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order before I start my questions, given there are not as many committee members here will we get a chance for a second round of questions? Now that we have our experts-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been watching the whole thing, but for public health guidelines-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is for precautions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I was just asking if we will get a second chance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to put formally on the record my request that the minutes of the expert advisory group are published up to date. I do not know how many times I have asked for this. It is boring how many times I have had to ask. It is even more important that these minutes are published and that we know what the experts are saying at a time when there is very significant pressure from industry to lift restrictions. We have heard about some of the dangers that could arise from lifting restrictions, and we do not know what the expert group thinks. There is a five-week lapse in the information available to us about what the experts are saying. I am currently limited to five minutes to ask questions of the experts. It is just preposterous, frankly. This is a formal request that we have the minutes of the expert advisory group published as soon as they are signed off, and put up on the website.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be great if we could get an answer on whether there is any difficulty with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A "Yes" or "No" would be great.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to state for the record that although the extent to which the public should be aware of the deliberations of the expert advisory group is debatable, members of this committee and other Deputies, as those who are responsible for oversight of this effort, should know the substance of those debates. I read the most recent minutes of the debate within the expert advisory group on the use of masks. I do not have time to go into detail, but it was a very interesting debate. However, it took place five weeks ago. Deputies have to make decisions now. I wish to know the most up-to-date advice on masks and face coverings and the debates that are happening within the expert advisory group. I hope my request will be taken on board. Could we have more information about who is becoming infected? We are told there is community transmission, although I acknowledge that current rate in this regard is low. Surely the committee needs to know who is becoming infected now. Do the witnesses know that? If not, why? Given that certain restrictions are to be lifted, will that be tracked in detail? Approximately two months ago I asked whether we should at least know the occupations, sectors and categories of people who are contracting the virus in order that we can understand from where outbreaks may come. Is that reasonable for Deputies to know? Do the witnesses know the position in this regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not a bit of a problem that those responsible for infection control do not know who is contracting the disease? We have heard that young people are contracting the virus. Are they young people who were drinking cans on the banks of the canal or are they young people in direct provision? There is a big difference between those things and we need to know them in order to make informed decisions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my final few seconds, I ask for more information to be provided. For example, I have been contacted by hairdressers. They are glad to be going back to work, but they are worried.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had to dig out a shaver to get this cut. My point is that people are worried about the guidelines, whether they are adequate and how they will be policed. One way to test whether the guidelines will work in various sectors is to know whether there are particular outbreaks among hairdressers, transport workers or airport workers or, if we reopen schools, among schoolchildren. Surely that kind of information is critical. Is that not a reasonable thing for us to know?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not reasonable for us to know that information?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the Chairman's question and my earlier question, I would still like more affirmative confirmation that we will get additional information about things like the occupations and workplaces of cases. That will be critical as we open up the economy. I just wish to make that point. I have two very quick questions. Did Professor Mallon say that recovery times were considerably longer for healthcare workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. Has that got something to do with the viral load they may have been exposed to because of the nature of their work? Is that a factor in how sick people get and how long they remain sick? I am just curious about that. I will move to my second question. I totally agree with what Professor Mallon said about the footprint. We will be putting a square peg into a round hole with regard to capacity come September, if not before. To what extent does he believe issues like understaffing, the consequent long hours that people may have to work and the stretching of staffing are factors in the increase in infection rates among healthcare workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Professor Mallon put a figure on the amount of additional staffing and capacity we need across the health service in order to deal with both the pressures existing before Covid and the additional need for Covid care?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their contributions. The need for the summer provision, both to have it and to expand it, is obvious. The aspiration of the Minister to reopen the special educational needs provision as best as possible in September is a noble and correct one which I am sure everybody shares. However, I wonder if there is a Walter Mitty element about some of this in terms of matching aspiration with reality. I had a few conversations before coming in here, one with Fórsa, which represents SNAs, one with an SNA and another with the parent of a child with special needs who is involved in the group of parents protesting against the cuts. Every one of them was just scathing. What Fórsa said is that the plans for the summer provision are laughable. Schools do not know about numbers in classrooms. They are not clear what to do with PPE. They are not clear what to do about feeding and washing where it is necessary to do those things for some children. They are not sure about deep cleaning, who is going to do it and whether it is going to be done. They are not sure about the type of protocols necessary in the home-provision section where SNAs, for example, would be going to people's homes. Should they be tested? Should they not be tested? Would insurance be in place for taking children out in cars? The impression given across the board is that the guidance and supports are just not there. The SNA to whom I spoke informed me that SNAs feel very badly treated. She stated that he has been 17 and a half years in the sector. She said that, first, they were told they were going to nursing homes and then, when it was realised that in many cases rather than doing nothing, they work during the summer, often with the same children, they were told they were going to support the plan for the summer provision. They were told they would get €16 an hour, which would be much less than that after tax. They are getting no supports and they are badly paid in the first place. In her case, she said she is just not doing it. How does Mr. Tattan respond to those criticisms and the level of frustration that has been expressed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The HSE put out guidelines for its staff some considerable time ago. How can the HSE give the occupational therapists and its people who are involved in the provision of these programmes clear guidance on PPE, social distancing and other matters but the Department of Education and Skills is still scrambling to do it and there is all that uncertainty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Tattan recognise that, come September, if, as Professor Paddy Mallon stated earlier, it is inevitable that we are facing a second wave, there will be a need to dramatically and quickly provide extra infrastructure, resources and staff - as we did for the health service via the Be on call for Ireland initiative - if we are to have any chance of meeting the eventualities we are likely to face, particularly in the context of special needs but also right across the education sector?
