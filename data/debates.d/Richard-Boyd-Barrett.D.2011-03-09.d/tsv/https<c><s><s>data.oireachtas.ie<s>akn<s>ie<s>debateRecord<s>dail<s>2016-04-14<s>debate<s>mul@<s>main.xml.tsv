RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are holding the country to ransom. Citizens have been left stranded and are increasingly becoming angry and frustrated as for close to 50 days Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been playing out this really cynical spectacle.This is motivated solely by the pursuit of political power, while the citizens are blighted with a diabolical housing and homelessness crisis that is worsening on a daily basis and a chronic situation in our hospitals. The blight of low pay, inflicted mostly by the last Government, but also previously by the Fianna Fáil-led Government, is now leading to workers rightly making pay claims and the possibility of very serious industrial conflicts, which we are already seeing play out at Luas, with Tesco workers also balloting for strike action. While all of that is going on, there is the scandal of the Panama papers, in which we discover firms without nameplates hidden away up residential streets facilitating hundreds of Irish companies to engage in transactions offshore in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands and almost certainly involved in tax evasion or massive tax avoidance, robbing the suffering citizens of this country of millions, tens of millions or possibly hundreds of millions of euro. We cannot discuss any of this nor do anything about it because of the spectacle of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael manoeuvring to be top dog and refusing to accept that the days when the political establishment could control both the Government and the Opposition are over. They cannot stand that history has moved on and that they cannot control both sides of the House. However, they will have to accept it. Things are changing. I heard Deputy Lisa Chambers talk about the fact that Fianna Fáil does not want to break promises and that the people demanded a change of Government. Yes, they demanded a change of Government, but not because they are interested in the personnel or the banner of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or any other political banner. It was because they want changes in policies. Their anger at political betrayal is due to the fact that people make promises about specific policies and issues that affect them and then abandon those policies and promises. That is why the Labour Party has disintegrated as the political force-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has disintegrated as the major political force on the left in this country, not because of who it talks to or who it got into bed with, but because of the policies and promises-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that they abandoned. That is what people are concerned about. What I, and I believe most of the country, would like to know is what the difference is between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I consider myself reasonably studied and knowledgeable in Irish politics, but if someone were to ask me what is the difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, I would scratch my head and say, "I haven't got a clue". I defy any member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to explain to me the difference between them. If the spectacle being played out at the moment were a debate about issues and policies, I believe the country could understand that and might even be willing to wait. However, there are no discussions about those. The only issue we have heard mentioned is water charges and the two parties have to talk about that because the people put it on the agenda. However, that is not an obstacle to forming a Government because there is a very simple arithmetic to it. The majority of Deputies in this Dáil promised, because of a mass popular movement, that they would get rid of water charges. No debate is necessary. That is not an obstacle to Deputies from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael talking to each other. All they have to do is respect the democratic wishes of the people as expressed in the election. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have fired out little jibes at "the others", who are not willing to talk and address the issues affecting the country. Au contraire. Today Deputy Bríd Smith held a meeting, to which everybody in this Dáil was invited, where the Luas workers, who have been maligned and misrepresented regarding a very serious industrial dispute affecting citizens in this country-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This briefing sought to resolve the dispute and end the industrial action on a fair basis. Interestingly, nobody from Fine Gael or the Labour Party turned up to that briefing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are interested and willing to co-operate with anybody on the issues that affect people, whether it is housing, health, industrial relations or whatever, but the fact is that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are not interested in those issues. That is not what they are debating-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are debating who will be Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  Many aspects of today's proceedings are profoundly depressing. The farce being played out by the two large parties is depressing and frustrating for Deputies and, more importantly, people outside the House who are suffering. No issue highlights this and the failure of the political establishment, including the outgoing Government and the main political parties in successive Governments, more than the disaster in housing and homelessness, which is worsening daily. I welcome the all-party agreement to establish a Dáil sub-committee on housing and I hope that it meets soon. It was a good proposal from Sinn Féin. I welcome that everyone is on board and I hope that something comes of it. However, I find it dispiriting that the Minister continues to justify-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----his actions and those of the Government over the past five years and plays with figures when the reality outside belies everything he says.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He can discuss acquisitions, targets, €35 million and so on but the facts speak for themselves. The number of people, including families and children who have been forced into homelessness is increasing weekly. The figure for families is now 1,800 and has been increasing monthly. The situation has continuously worsened since the Minister entered into government. There were 96,000 households on the housing list then. Now, there are 130,000. It is a disaster. It is heartbreaking to see families with kids coming to one's clinic on Monday mornings in dire situations and not knowing what to do, where they will sleep and whether they will ever have permanent roofs over their heads again. Yet the Minister continues to justify his actions and plans. The Minister mentioned the Social Housing Strategy 2020 again. He keeps claiming that this plan will change everything and deliver. Let me tell him how it will play out in my area of Dún Laoghaire, where 6,000 households are on the housing list compared with the approximately 3,000 who were on it when the Minister entered office. The figure has almost doubled but the strategy's target is 681 houses by 2017. That is 681 against a list-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----of nearly 6,000 households. That 2017 target will not even meet 10% of current housing demand. Does the Minister know how many people will join the list before then? There are approximately 100 new applicants per month. With the Minister's wonderful plans, we will be in a worse situation in 2017 than we are now but even these miserable targets are not being met and figures are being massaged. For example, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council tells us that it has delivered 95 RAS households. In the small print, however, one discovers that 60 of those are renewals. They are not new social housing accommodation. They are just old RAS arrangements that have been renewed by landlords. This is at the heart of the problem. Some 75,000 houses of the 110,000 that the Government is proposing to deliver will be done through the HAP and RAS with private landlords and yet there is no chance that those landlords will sign up to them, given that they are not signing up now. The proposal will not deliver. If the Government does not break with the failed approach of depending on private landlords to provide a solution, we will face a worse crisis in the years ahead. It must break with failed policies.
