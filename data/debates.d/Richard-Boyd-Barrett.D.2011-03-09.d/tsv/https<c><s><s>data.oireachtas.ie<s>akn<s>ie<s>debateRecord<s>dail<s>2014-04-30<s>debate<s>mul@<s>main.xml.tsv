RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Cynthia Owen was the victim of the most barbaric and heinous crime imaginable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Topical Issues matter is about this person.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the public domain and the issue is about this person. As a ten and 11 year old child she was ritually abused and raped by, she says, members of her own family, members of the community and, she alleges, three senior gardaí from the area. When she was 11 a child, Noleen, issued from this abuse who shortly afterwards was murdered and found in a plastic bag down a lane having been stabbed more than 40 times with knitting needles. One of the gardaí-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are facts in the public domain. I am well aware of the legal constraints.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said there were allegations but some of it is fact. I distinguished between the allegations and the facts and I will continue to do so. The Acting Chairman has completely thrown me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand why this Topical Issues matter was selected if there is a problem with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is being run down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the people accused by Cynthia Owen as being one of the abusers was one of the gardaí who arrived on the scene when her baby was found. Evidence of the murder of the baby was lost and contaminated and the investigation into this most heinous of crimes was closed down after six weeks. No one was ever brought to trial for it. Cynthia alleges the abuse continued as did the abuse of her siblings, three of whom later took their own lives. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is aware of all of this because he acted as solicitor for a period for Cynthia Owen. A coroner's inquest confirmed the baby murdered was Cynthia Owen's baby meaning, and this is beyond doubt, a crime was committed. She was raped as a child and her baby was murdered. Incredibly, no one has ever been brought to justice for this. In recent weeks I asked the Minister, on foot of representations from Cynthia and her legal representative, Gerry Dunne, whether the Minister would meet with them to discuss reopening the investigation into this case. He stated he would not do so because it might raise unrealistic expectations and he referred to the Gageby report on this matter, which was published in 2007. This response is completely unacceptable because the Gageby report was a paper review. Mr. Gageby refused to talk to Cynthia Owen even though she offered to give evidence. Her solicitor reports that only a few weeks before being appointed to this position Mr. Gageby stated publicly, at a national prosecutors' conference, that he believed cases of rape and abuse more than 15 years old should not be investigated. He stated counsellors and psychologists working in this area usually gave unreliable evidence. This was a very biased position to take on an examination of such a serious issue. The examination was a travesty. The Minister is well aware of the facts because he represented Ms Owen for a while. Cynthia Owen is asking for an independent public sworn inquiry to reopen the case and examine how the investigation was conducted and get justice. This is a very reasonable request. She has written to the Minister and the Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Acting Chairman took one minute of my time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She is asking for a sworn independent inquiry into this matter. Will the Minister positively respond to this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that some matters are simply at the level of allegations, but some aspects are not allegations but facts. The coroner's court established that the baby, Noleen, who was murdered, stabbed 44 times and left in a lane, was Cynthia Owen's. As Cynthia Owen was 11 years old, therefore it follows directly that she was raped. There is no question but that an absolutely heinous crime was committed against a child. Nobody has been prosecuted for that, even though the victim of this crime has stated who she says committed that crime. The fact she states it does not make it fact, but it certainly seems to me is the basis for requiring a proper investigation of that case. It is absolutely extraordinary that the victim was not interviewed in a review of this case carried out in 2007, despite the fact that the victim and her representative contacted the senior counsel, Mr. Gageby, and said, please interview us. How can that be constituted as a serious inquiry into this most heinous of crimes? I do not wish to cast aspersions on anyone, but I cannot fathom how in a situation such as this the victim would not have her request to be interviewed about the crimes committed against her acceded to by someone looking at the case. She therefore begs for justice and for the allegations she has made and the crimes committed against her to be investigated properly. I am glad to see that in the last few weeks there seems to have been movement on this, and if the Minister said there is confusion about publishing reports and so on, that is a reason for him to meet them to clarify these matters if it would help to move this forward. However, I do not understand why the Minister refuses to meet them. Having spoken to Ms Cynthia Owen's solicitor this morning, they wish to know what is the timescale for the Garda to report back to the Minister about its investigations bearing in mind that the only gardaí investigating this are gardaí serving in the Dún Laoghaire area where the crime was committed, albeit a new generation of gardaí. This is not to cast aspersions on them by any means, but this matter is so serious, and given that there is an allegation that gardaí were involved in the abuse and the alleged cover-up, there must be a commitment to something more serious in respect of an investigation of these matters. A sworn public inquiry is what Ms Cynthia Owen has asked for and what I believe any fair person looking at it would say she deserves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are very easy to spot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We accept that.
