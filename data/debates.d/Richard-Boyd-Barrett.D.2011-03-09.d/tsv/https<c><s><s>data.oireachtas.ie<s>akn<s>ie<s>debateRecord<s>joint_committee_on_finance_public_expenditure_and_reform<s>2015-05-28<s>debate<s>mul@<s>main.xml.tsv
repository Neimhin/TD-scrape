RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First of all, I welcome Deputy Sean Fleming to the ranks of the socialist left on banking policy. He has arguably swapped places with Deputy Rabbitte. I wish to follow up on the question because, frankly, I am perplexed at Professor Honohan's belief in and commitment to competition as the way to sort out some of the issues that confront us. He has not really made the case for it. For example, he rails against administrative control of interest rates, that is, the State setting interest rates - even though he seems to suggest that they should be reduced and that there is an element of profiteering going on. However, he says we should not really have administrative control because that would impact on competition and the reason we must not impact on competition is just that we need competition, but without any real argument to sustain that. It was precisely the dynamic of competition that led to the bubble, uncontrolled lending and the crash that followed, so I really am quite perplexed. It is not just in the area of interest rates that the argument does not stack up. Professor Honohan finished his contribution by saying that the banks have been damagingly slow in resolving the mortgage arrears crisis. That is a good case for administrative control, as are variable interest rates and what is happening in the whole property area. I would also like to hear Professor Honohan's comments on that. It is extremely worrying that property prices are going out of control, as that was such a big contributory factor to the crash. We had property prices going out of control, and people with low incomes were borrowing money they really could not afford, while chasing property whose prices were going through the roof. That also led to the crash. I do not see, therefore, how Professor Honohan can support his argument that, faced with these serious challenges and problems and the experience that we have just been through, the answer we have to get back to is competition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is precisely that. It is a completely circular argument that Professor Honohan is giving, which is that it will have a chilling effect in terms of providers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With time against us, I will agree to disagree with Professor Honohan. To be honest, however, everything he is saying points in the direction of greater administrative control and planning in the economy as a whole, rather than letting the market rip. It all points in that direction. I am not really quite sure how Professor Honohan can act or intervene. In some ways, he is saying that we are pretty powerless here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record, no matter what provisions Professor Honohan makes against it, if hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs again, they still will not be able to pay their mortgages. All the provisioning in the world will not help. Similarly, we have a major problem with access to affordable housing. I have a question about the mandates of central banks, given that Professor Honohan is coming to the end of his term. Does he not think that we should be looking, at a European level, at banks having a mandate? The European Central Bank does not have a mandate that extends to such things as access to affordable housing, as against, for example, the US Federal Reserve. What does Professor Honohan think of that? The issue of property was at the centre of the previous crisis and it is coming into view again. As time is running out, I have a final question about the issue of non-tax revenue coming in to the Government, which was in the statement that Professor Honohan put out in the last few days.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is getting a lot of unexpected money from non-tax revenue, largely to do with the previous bailout of the banks, which is being paid back. Can Professor Honohan quantify how much that is? It would be useful for people to know how much has been coming to the Government in that form. What will happen now? Will we see a big drop in that revenue as the banks move back into private ownership and we come to the end of the bailout?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked about the mandate of central banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am interested in the answer to Deputy Pat Rabbitte's question. We will obviously hear what Professor Honohan has to say, but it strikes me that we are being told the money will be given back, but only after A, B, C, D and E have been done. It is similar to the Greek situation. It seems that a great deal of pain will have to be inflicted on many people in order to ensure this money is given back. That is just a comment. I would like to ask a question about the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015, with which we dealt yesterday. Can Professor Honohan see any purpose, value or positive contribution vulture funds have in a well functioning financial sector in this or any other economy? I cannot see that there is. We are now seeking to regulate them to some extent, but there are question marks over whether we are doing it well enough. I wonder whether we should be regulating them out of business completely. I do not see what value they add to anything. We can set aside ideological differences we might have about whether banking should be public or private and so on. That is one debate. These vulture funds do not have a long-term commitment to a market, customers or anything else. Given that Professor Honohan has said his objective is to have a well functioning financial sector - that should be the objective of any central bank - does he agree that we should be regulating vulture funds completely out of business?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The vulture funds?
