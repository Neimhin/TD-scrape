RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 19 February, the Department of Education and Skills issued a circular to State second-level schools stating that they must offer alternative subject choices to students who do not want to study religion. This instruction applied to State-run non-religious schools run by local education and training boards and community schools. It was a very good instruction and was welcomed by those who want to see a separation of church and State and choice for people who do not hold certain religious views in terms of the education system and those who want to end discrimination and stigma. Incredibly, at the beginning of this month, the Department issued a new circular essentially capitulating on all this. In the intervening period, there was clearly a lot of lobbying by the Catholic Church and its representatives, and now the alternative choice subject is not to be offered to people who choose to opt out of religion. Can the Minister explain this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need clarification here. I am aware, on foot of a report by Emma O'Kelly of RTÉ and freedom of information, FOI, requests that were submitted in respect of this matter, that there was very considerable lobbying by the Catholic bishops, the Association of Trustees of Catholic Schools, former heads of County Dublin vocational education committees, VECs. These bodies were clearly unhappy with the initial circular, a positive document which stated that people have the right to opt out of religious education and have alternative subject choices.It is not clear from the Minister's reply whether that still stands. Do people have the right to opt out and have alternative subject choices in line with what was stated in the first circular? I absolutely believe that they should have such a right. People should not be forced to have religious education or instruction imposed on them. To be honest, the sort of distinction that is being drawn between religious education and religious instruction is a bit bogus. Can we get clarity on this matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will. By the way, I thank the Minister for his words. I share the sentiments he expressed about the Business Committee. I wish him good luck with his new portfolio.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had to reciprocate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, the Minister has not provided the clarity I am seeking. Do people still have the right to opt out of religious education in favour of alternative subject choices? The Minister's failure to give me a clear answer suggests they do not have that right in some instances. I was also a philosophy student. At my first philosophy lecture in UCD, a priest who was a member of Opus Dei - there were many of them in the UCD philosophy department - said that before he and his colleagues started to teach us about all the great philosophers, he wanted us to know that Karl Marx, Nietzsche and a whole load of other secular radical philosophers were not philosophers. He said that St. Thomas Aquinas was a philosopher. That was the start of our philosophical education. It was informed by the Catholic religion through and through and that is how it followed. We cannot have that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It absolutely did not work on me. That kind of approach is not acceptable. The approach we are advocating needs to be absolutely clear. This subject should be changed from religious education to philosophy and should include other world views that have nothing to do with religion. We should look at religious views in the context of all views of the world, but that is not what we are getting. People should have the right to opt out of religious education.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One can get that from Karl Marx as well, by the way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a deafening silence from the Government regarding the rogue Saudi state's murderous activities in Yemen that have brought 13 million to 14 million people to the brink of starvation, amid warnings of the worst famine in 100 years, in a war in which tens of thousands have already been killed and millions of others displaced. Virtually the entire population of Yemen is now dependent on humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia, with backing from the United States, the UK and France, is to a large extent responsible for this unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. With American-made weapons, it killed 40 children in a school bus on a school trip in August. In June, it hit a cholera treatment centre run by Doctors Without Borders when it was clearly marked as a medical facility. In April, it killed 20 members of a family at a funeral in the north west. The atrocities go on. In the past week, there was the barbaric killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist, at Saudi Arabia's embassy in Turkey. What will we do about this? Why the silence? Are we going to speak out about the incredible hypocrisy of standing by while all of this is happening when our Government is doing beef deals with Saudi Arabia and the US, the UK and France are selling the latter arms? After the Salisbury attack, our Government moved rapidly to expel Russian diplomats. Where are the expulsions of Saudi Arabia's ambassador and diplomats?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are no angels among states and governments in the Middle East but the Saudi regime is a murderous, brutal, rogue one that is the enemy of democracy. It is willing to use the most savage methods, including now bombing Yemen into a famine situation which will affect the entire population, and to do so openly and blatantly. Also, as we saw with the Khashoggi affair, a journalist who wished to speak out and call for a free press and the right of people in the Middle East to criticise regimes like this, is brutally murdered by people who have been clearly identified now as associates of Crown Prince bin Salman. What are we going to do about that? The Minister referred to talking to all parties involved, but this is a rogue regime and the United States and the United Kingdom continue to arm these people to kill people in Yemen and murder a person in an embassy in Turkey. Can the Tánaiste explain to me the reason we expelled Russian diplomats after the attack in Salisbury and we are not expelling the Saudi ambassador and Saudi diplomats after what has been done in Yemen and with Jamal Khashoggi?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But there were no sanctions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not hold back before we acted after the attack in Salisbury.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are pretty well informed on this one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Waving the red flag.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the Committee on Budgetary Oversight secretariat and the Parliamentary Budget Office for their great work on all of this and the report that was produced in May, in particular the work they have done in trying to advance the cause of equality budgeting and gender budgeting. I commend the Chairman and my fellow committee members for their work. I thank all of the people who contributed or who came in to the committee, such as the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Wheelchair Association of Ireland and the ESRI, and there are others I cannot remember, unfortunately. This is a hugely important issue. I agree with Deputy Burton that some of it is quite technical, necessarily so when it comes down to trying to disaggregate information to see how budgets and budgetary allocations impact on women, on different genders, on different groups, such as people with disability, ethnic groups, Travellers, or on any sector of society, given there are obviously different social and economic groups in society. Why is it important to do that? Probably the best case for why we need to do it was set out in the book, The Spirit Level, written a number of years ago, where the authors gathered a lot of evidence to show that societies where there is greater equality do better at every single level imaginable. Societies where there are greater levels of equality have better community and social relations, better mental health, better physical health, longer life expectancy, less obesity, less violence, less imprisonment and better economic growth. Every indicator suggests that societies that are more equal do better. That is why it is important. For many reasons, I find the budgets I have had to interact with over-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the private conversations can end now. It is a bit outrageous, to be honest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State. I appreciate that. Fair play to him. What we just saw was extremely disrespectful. Equality is good for our society. Obviously, gender equality is critical in so far as 50% of the world's population suffer systematic discrimination and oppression and are disproportionately impacted by poverty, war and all of the injustices and inequalities that exist in our world, given these disproportionately impact on women. If women do not have equality, our entire society suffers. It is imperative for the good of all that we have real equality for women, as part of a fight for greater equality in society generally, because we will live in a better world and have a better future if we achieve that. The way budgeting has been done to date is frustrating because it does not seem to have any particular objective at all, and it is only with this discussion that we are beginning to address that. For example, I do not know, going into any budget, what exactly the point is of the budget. There does not seem to be any particular point other than to play by certain fiscal rules or to balance books just for the sake of it, or for a thing called economic growth, the benefits of which are a little difficult to ascertain when we live in a country which has the highest levels of economic growth in Europe, yet has a massive housing crisis, a massive health crisis, cannot deal with climate change and has an education system in serious trouble, as our universities tumble down the international rankings and we have the most overcrowded classrooms in the Western world. It makes one wonder what exactly is the connection between the Moses and prophets of economic growth and the actual quality of life of our citizens. Equality budgeting focuses on that and says there should be a point to a budget, and that point should be to have a better society, which means a more equal society, and to address inequalities. One of the biggest inequalities of them all is gender inequality, so it is critical we go down this road. Senator Alice-Mary Higgins has been commended and I should add my voice to that commendation for her efforts in bringing this issue forward. What if we had these kinds of impact assessments on the consequences of gender inequality and other forms of inequality in our society over the last ten years?I do not know if things would have been different, but we certainly would have had greater evidence to argue against some of what happened. It is deeply ironic that the Deputy who has just left was the Minister for Social Protection when precisely the most savage attacks on women in Irish society took place, in particular in the 2012 budget. This is from the ESRI, not just us. We said it at the time the attacks were launched, in particular the attacks on single parents with the cuts to child benefit, the income disregard for single mothers, rent allowance, with disastrous consequences, and the capital housing budgets. One can go through the list. There were cuts to jobseeker's allowance for young people under 26 years of age. All of this happened in 2012. The ESRI has confirmed with the application of the newly adapted SWITCH model, which takes into account gender impacts, that single mothers suffered the worst while working mothers in couples with children were hit the second worst. These savage attacks had a huge impact on our society generally, increasing poverty and deprivation, and the worst victims were single parents and mothers generally. Where is some acknowledgement of the damage that was done? There might have been an argument about it having to be done, which I would not accept, but at least some acknowledgement of the damage done to some of the most vulnerable women by those who implemented those attacks at the time would be welcome. It is disappointing that the Government did not take on the recommendation for a gender impact statement in the budget. We need to have that. It is something that can be done in a simplified way. This is where we have to think about it. We must consider how to make it simple and digestible for people to understand the impacts on different groups. To some extent, it is already done at the back of the budget book where examples are given of the social and economic impact of different budgetary measures. For example, one sees the impact on a public sector worker earning the average industrial wage. The example is also given of the impact on a self-employed person in the private sector who earns a particular income. We need to have various metrics covering the different impacts of certain budgetary measures and to put those together in a digestible form to allow people to understand the effects on different groups, including women, about whom we are speaking today, but also persons with disabilities who constitute another group on whom the impact of budgetary measures is something we desperately need to quantify. People with disabilities are another group who suffered quite savagely as a result of the austerity cuts of the past seven or eight years. I conclude on that and within my time as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, will be glad to know. I congratulate those who produced the report. I hope the Government is taking this stuff on board and will take it seriously. It will benefit all of us. It will benefit women and groups who suffer inequality and oppression. It will benefit our entire society and make for a better future.
