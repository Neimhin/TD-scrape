RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Minister agree with me that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Minister agree with me that, when working people, people on social welfare, pensioners and some of the most vulnerable sectors of our society have been lashed with cuts, charges, levies and taxes for four years now, they would have been right to be outraged when they read in a Sunday newspaper last weekend that a Minister of the Government, Deputy Reilly, is claiming tax relief on his 13-bedroom mansion in County Offaly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister consider, when ordinary householders are being hammered with a grossly unjust household charge, when council tenants in my constituency and many other constituencies are living in dilapidated and substandard council homes and cannot get maintenance work done, it is wrong that a tax relief such as this for people with mansions to do maintenance on their homes is being provided by the State?  Is it not indicative when even the IMF, which was the purveyor of so much of the austerity being inflicted upon the people of this country, questions the fairness of the way in which the austerity measures are being disproportionately imposed on the least well off and suggests they should be imposed more fairly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I could ask several questions, actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this not another example of how there is one law for the rich in this country and one law for the poor?  Does the Minister consider it appropriate that a Minister should benefit from such a tax relief-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and that such tax reliefs should exist for some of the wealthiest people in our society, when ordinary working people are being crucified with austerity measures to pay off bankers and bondholders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, why are they allowed continually to interrupt when I am speaking?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all in favour of protecting heritage and it is entirely legitimate to give support to people when they are not in a position to maintain heritage homes or any dwelling which has a heritage value.  The Minister is right to say there are Georgian homes and so on in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere where it is reasonable to give financial support or tax breaks to people who are not in a position to maintain those homes.  That is the way it should be done.  However, it is not acceptable that tax breaks exist for people who are on salaries of €140,000 or €150,000 a year, or, in many cases, on much higher salaries-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and that multimillionaires gain these tax reliefs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not part of an architecture of tax reliefs that, as the latest revenue figures indicate, the 11,000 highest earners in this country pay an effective tax rate of only 29%?  This is simply a way of protecting the rich from taxes, while ordinary working people are being crucified with levies, charges and cuts.  Does the Minister think it is appropriate that a Minister should benefit from such reliefs when he is so well paid?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, my speaking time is directly after Deputy Halligan's.  Could I give him five minutes of my time so that he gets 20 minutes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe we will do that.
