RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday we heard the shocking news that there is an intention to impose a 10% cut on the teaching hours available for special needs, visiting more suffering on one of the most vulnerable sectors of our society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we at least expect some discussion on the matter or a debate in this House?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must make it a priority to protect the most vulnerable sectors of our society from the effects of austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a serious matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will start on a positive note by welcoming the Government's response to some of the concerns expressed by the Technical Group and others regarding its initial proposals on Dáil reform.  The Minister of State outlined substantial improvements to his initial proposals on Dáil business and there appears to be a genuine willingness on the part of the Government to take on board our suggestions.  The topical issues slots that are proposed to replace the Adjournment debate are welcome, as is the fact that they will be scheduled reasonably early in the day.  It is hoped these debates will bring more vibrancy and topicality to our business and perhaps end some of the frustration Deputies can feel when they try to raise topical issues on the Order of Business.  I also welcome the reversal of the Government's initial decision to cut back on the period of time during which the Taoiseach will be available for questions in the Dáil.  It is critical that the Taoiseach continues to be accountable to the public through this House.Question and answer sessions should be routinely included before the conclusion of debates on legislation and topical issues.  A number of Deputies have pointed out that debates often follow a model which involves set statements and a relatively small number of Members in the House at any time.  The Minister is often not present to hear the questions raised during the course of the debate.  While this is inevitable in the context of a debate that continues over several sessions, it would be useful to conclude with question and answer sessions so that Deputies could directly interact with the Minister.In the context of yesterday's debate on the Private Members' motion on political reform, I suggested that we should loosen what is allowed during the Order of Business in terms of asking about future schedules for the Dáil and requests for debates.  The rules on the Order of Business are restrictive and it becomes a circus with Deputies trying to negotiate their way around the strictures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not just me.  That frustration is felt across the House during the Order of Business.The Government's proposals represent improvements which should make this a better and more responsive Chamber for debate and allow us to raise topical issues.  Credit where credit is due for this, although the Technical Group should take some of the credit for putting forward this week's Private Members' motion on political reform.  Even though the Government chose to delete the motion and replace it with its own programme for reform, it nonetheless appears that some of the points we raised were taken on board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We also made submissions in the documents we circulated.  It does not matter, however, because the important outcome will be the genuine improvements that can be made.  A long way remains to be travelled in terms of real political and Dáil reform.Even if it would not be popular in this Chamber, an initiative to address the question of politicians' pay would receive the support of the majority of people in this country.  Much of the alienation the public feels about the political system arises from the perception that politicians live in a different world from those they purport to represent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would certainly support reducing the amount.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support reducing it and that is why I am raising the issue now.  Members of the United Left Alliance have volunteered to take only the average industrial wage and the rest of the money goes into the campaigns, issues and organisations with which we are involved.  We did not make this decision because we are saints or martyrs but because putting politicians in the same situation as the majority is the best way to make them truly representative of society.  It puts them in a position in which the decisions they make on increasing taxes or cutting pay will affect them as well as others.  Politicians would thus have a vested interest in championing the interest of the majority rather than the current situation, where their pay is closer to the wealthier sections of society and, despite the best intentions that may exist in the heads of individual public representatives, their material reality puts them out of touch with ordinary working people.This proposal is more relevant than ever at a time when savage austerity is being imposed on ordinary working families and the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.  The austerity measures mean they are struggling to make ends meet and are threatened with an impossible financial burden.  Politicians would think twice about the policies of austerity and cutbacks if they were in the same financial boat.  Although I doubt the majority of Members of this House would consider following the example of the United Left Alliance of reducing salaries to the average industrial wage, the salaries of Deputies, Ministers and the Taoiseach are high compared to our European counterparts or most other public representatives elsewhere in the world.  We should consider reducing politicians' pay by a substantial amount in order that it is more in line with that of ordinary people in our society.I would counterpose that proposal with the Government's proposal to reduce the number of Deputies.  As Deputy Pringle pointed out yesterday, parliamentary representation in Ireland is on a par other European countries.  In other words, the number of public representatives per head of population is the same as most European countries.  The notion that we have too many is not the problem and, therefore, reducing the number of Deputies is not the way forward.  It would be better to cut pay and put us in the same material position as those we represent rather than cut the number of Members.I congratulate the Government on moving to abolish the Seanad.  That would be a positive move because it is an elitist institution.  The notion that we would have a second tier of government based on an elitist electorate with the majority of our society excluded from voting is obnoxious to any democratic sentiment or impulse.  The abolition of the Seanad is welcome and long overdue.  However, while this would be a positive move, we need other democratic tiers to oversee the Dáil.  This also relates in a way to local government.  Most people accept powers must be devolved, whenever possible, to the lowest level of society in order that ordinary citizens can participate as much as possible in decisions affecting them and we can move away from a centralised political system.I propose that we seek to develop a second tier of democracy, different from the Seanad, which is genuinely representative of all sectors of society.  Groups such as We the Citizens point in this direction with its proposals for citizen assemblies.  However, we could formalise and institutionalise that notion with citizen assemblies taking place locally and having representatives from all sectors of the community, including trades unions, students, workplaces, young people, pensioners and people with disabilities.  They could, in turn, elect people to higher bodies at regional and national level.  Representatives of those assemblies would not be professional politicians but they would be directly accountable and recallable.There would not be, therefore, set terms of four or five years where they could get elected on the basis of saying one thing and then implementing or pursuing different policies once they were elected regardless of what they said to people when they were seeking their votes.  The fact that politicians will say one thing at election time to secure votes and, shortly afterwards, do things differently once they are in office is a sore point for people.  We need a mechanism of accountability and recallability for both representatives of citizen assemblies and sectoral-based assemblies at local, regional and national level and Oireachtas Members.  We should be subject to the same terms if we fail to implement the promises on which we were elected.While all the proposals made by the Government, myself and others during this week's Private Member's business and this debate could be positive, they are meaningless in the context of the bigger issue facing the country.  Shifting deck chairs on the  Titanic comes to mind.  By signing up to the IMF-EU package, we have handed over our democracy.  No matter what is debated in the House or any other institution we seek to create, it will be undermined and negated by the fact the EU and the IMF are dictating policy to the Government to pay back the bankers and speculators who caused the economy to crash.  Although I expect the call will fall on deaf ears, even at this stage I urge the Government to think again about tying us into a deal that is fundamentally undermining and destroying our democracy by handing control of policy and economic policy, in particular, over to people representing bankers and speculators rather than the ordinary citizens of this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is aware that nine activists were brutally killed in last year's flotilla by the Israeli forces in an attack that was rightly condemned by the House in an all-party motion.  It condemned the Israeli assault on the first peace flotilla and, rightly, described the blockade of Gaza by Israel as an illegal act, yet the blockade continues and continues to visit appalling suffering on the people of Gaza.The refusal of the Israeli authorities to allow water treatment plants and sewerage treatment plants to be constructed means that 80 million litres of sewage is being pumped into the Mediterranean Sea on a daily basis.  A total of 85% of the waters around Gaza which belong to the people of Gaza are restricted and Palestinians trying to enter those waters are shot at regularly, as well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the destruction of the infrastructure in that territory as a result of the previous Israeli attack.The reason I remind the House of those facts is because it is in that context that one must ask what is changing to make the situation better.  The Tánaiste and this House said it is an illegal blockade, that we want it to end, that the suffering should end, that the attack on the previous flotilla should not have happened and should not be repeated.  However, nothing happens.  Israel is not sanctioned and its behaviour does not change.  In that context is it not right and justified that people of good conscience from dozens of countries across the world would try to breach that blockade to bring aid and solidarity to the people of Gaza because it is an illegal blockade and they need that assistance?I know the Tánaiste is not doing it for the same reasons but in calling on people not to go, he is echoing what Israel is now calling for in saying it does not want the flotilla to travel.  I call on the Tánaiste to insist that the Israeli authorities allow the flotilla through the illegal blockade.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The organisers of the Irish ship to Gaza, the Irish leg of the flotilla, contacted the Minister's office a number of weeks ago and sought a meeting to discuss the departing Irish part of the flotilla, but they have received no response.  Will the Minister meet the organisers of the Irish ship to Gaza to discuss their trip?  Also, when will sanctions be imposed?  When will the call for sanctions against Israel for its refusal to lift the blockade be applied?  Israel will not change its behaviour or lift its illegal blockade unless Europe — starting with some states in Europe — stands up and says that sanctions must be applied against a state that is flouting international law and human rights.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister meet the representatives of the organisers?
