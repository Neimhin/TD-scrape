RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I too congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his election, as well as those Deputies elected for the first time and those who have been re-elected. All of us have to stand humble in the face of the judgment of the people. We spent several weeks campaigning on our different policies, priorities and political records, but now the judgment has been made. Our job is to act as swiftly as possible on that judgment and to respond to the concerns, the needs and priorities expressed by the people, both in terms of political reform and the pressing issues which face vast numbers of our citizens. The prerequisite for us moving to address those issues is the formation of a Government. Much as I would like for the parties of the left to be in a position to form a Government, we are not in a position to do so. That is a campaign which we must continue, namely to convince people of our policies and our priorities. Of course, we will continue to do that. Accordingly, the responsibility to move swiftly to form a Government lies with those in a position to do so. One judgment made by the people, which to my mind is beyond dispute, is that they have asked us to move beyond Civil War factional politics. Instead, they want issue-based politics. Those parties, whose histories lie in Civil War divisions but where no real substantial differences exist on issues or policies, have a responsibility not to allow tribal or factional differences delay the formation of a Government, so that we can move on to the issues which need to be addressed urgently. For our part, as a small part of this Dáil, the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit group is willing to talk to anybody about addressing those issues. However, realistically, we do not believe we have the same approach to addressing them as do those parties which have the numbers and are in a position to form the majority. We will do so on committees, whether it is to do with Dáil reform or elsewhere and we will work with and discuss with others ways of addressing those issues. Now, however, a Government must be formed so we can move on to that discussion. While a combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is not the Government I would want, they have a responsibility now to explain why they cannot form a Government or move on to form one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome this motion, one to which we also signed up. Again, I would ask for humility in the face of the judgment of the people. Nobody here has a monopoly on demanding or calling for political reform. That demand has come from the people through the ballot box and in many movements on different issues affecting our society, whether it is water, hospitals, disability, young people and the issues that face them, or communities which have been desperately disadvantaged and hurt over the past several years. It is the responsibility of all of us - it is why I welcome this motion - to respect the judgment made and to allow this Dáil to have a diversity of voices, as well as a parity of esteem among those different forces elected to this House. They must all have the opportunity to speak, debate, as well as put forward their ideas, policies and priorities. These should not just be noble words spoken on the first day of the Dáil, soon to be forgotten. This business has to be done and settled. Everybody has said today that they want to see it happen. Now it has to happen because we had similar promises before. I agree with the points made by Deputies Pringle, Healy and Broughan. It is an error in this motion not to have reference to the Independents, notwithstanding the need for the more detailed debate about changes to the rules of this House. The motion should be amended to include Independent Members who are not of any of those groups referred to in it. The Government must acknowledge that this amendment must be included. There will be a debate about what messages have been sent by the electorate. Several of them are incontrovertible and are not open for debate. Ninety-nine Deputies elected to this House were elected on a pledge to either abolish water charges or, at least, suspend them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does refer to the debate about what needs to be discussed as a matter of priority on 22 March. That is a challenge to those who are talking about democracy, making this House relevant to people who are alienated from politics and that they live up to their pledges. There should be no attempt to slither out of pledges made in pursuit of votes in the election that has just gone. There is an incontrovertible message which must be acted upon and that water charges have to go. An urgency was expressed about the situations in housing and homelessness and in our health service. These are challenges to which all of us must respond urgently. The situation regarding them is not acceptable. All of us have to put up our hands and say they have not been addressed over the past five years but must be addressed as a matter of urgency. I met a man I happen to know outside on the street who informed me that his daughter, who is in a wheelchair, went to accident and emergency in St. Vincent's hospital today. He was told by a consultant that she might be four days on a trolley before she gets treated there. That is not acceptable. We need a Government to be formed. We need the issue of how the business of this House will be done to be addressed as a matter of urgency, so we can move quickly to address the intolerable situation in our hospitals and the unacceptable situation of homelessness in the State.
