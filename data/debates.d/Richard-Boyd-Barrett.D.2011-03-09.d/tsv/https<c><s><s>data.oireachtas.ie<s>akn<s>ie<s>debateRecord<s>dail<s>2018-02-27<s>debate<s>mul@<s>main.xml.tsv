RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When Mr. Johnson once again confirms what a complete buffoon he is, I wonder whether-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an accurate description nonetheless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. I was curious why, in response to the much more sane and sensible comments of Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, often accused of being a radical firebrand of the left, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was less than enthusiastic about those comments but suggested words to the effect that the Labour Party in Britain had its own problems. It seemed to be an implied dig at Mr. Corbyn's left wing policies when in fact he is leading the fight against the buffoonery of Mr. Johnson and indeed the anti-immigrant sentiment the most right wing element of the Tory Brexiteers are promoting. When we talk of the political logjam in the North itself, much of the commentary on the political paralysis of the institutions does not actually delve deep into the issues at stake. It might be helpful in beginning to unlock the situation up there to talk about the actual issues at stake. Why is the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, resisting any kind of agreement to restore the institutions? It is because it does not want marriage equality or an Irish language Act, both things which people down here should support because they are about equality. The DUP also does not want things like the extension of the 1967 abortion legislation. If we get repeal, and this is a question to Sinn FÃ©in as well, which is rightly promoting Irish language rights and marriage equality as part of the discussion, although the DUP are resisting these things, should we not also be talking about a new civil rights movement to campaign for equality on those issues and on the issue of abortion rights? We may have a situation in a few months' time where we have won the right to abortion for Irish women down here but when one crosses the Border into the North that right will still be denied to women in the North and nobody is talking about it.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I echo that call. What is being done by the dictator Assad is horrific. His brutal and vicious attempt to crush what was a genuine popular uprising by the people of Syria against his dictatorship has been cruel in the extreme and backed by the military might of Russia, unleashing carnage on the people of Ghouta. Thousands of people who need to be medically evacuated cannot get out. Promises of humanitarian pauses come to nothing. The people are being pounded by Assad with the assistance of Russia. I do not believe in external military interference in this situation. That has made it worse. The Saudis and United States have also backed militias. Turkey is invading parts of northern Syria to try to crush the Kurds because of its internal politics. The Iranians, who are trying to get involved, have a major case to answer for disgracefully backing Assad in his horrific attacks. It is ironic that Iran can rightly talk about the need for solidarity with the Palestinian people and yet support the dictator Assad in the vicious assault that he is waging against the people of eastern Ghouta in a war that has led to 11 million people, half of the population of Syria, being displaced. Most of that number is the responsibility of Assad and his key ally, Russia, but plenty of others also have responsibility and blood on their hands. The least we can do is exercise moral pressure, call in the Russian ambassador and ask him to justify the horrific actions that his Government is responsible for in Syria.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I echo the Deputy's comments. What Russia is doing is horrific. At the very least, it should be forced by our Government and every other country to justify the unjustifiable publicly. What Russia is doing to kids and innocent people cannot be justified - the devastation of eastern Ghouta, the slaughter of hundreds of people, the destruction of hospitals and schools etc. Beyond that, we should continue pushing for the most generous support and acceptance of Syrian refugees fleeing from this horror into Europe. Europe's response to those refugees has not been great. It has essentially used Turkey as a buffer to keep many of these desperate Syrians out. Turkey is also implicated in this, given that it has invaded northern Syrian to serve its cynical desire to crush the Kurdish movement. We should be consistent across the entire region and call out, for example, the Saudi regime, which is backing militias in the area, and other external powers like the US that are inflaming a disaster in Syria for their own cynical interests, but let us start with the Russian ambassador by calling him in.
