RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the big fears among ordinary people is that they are going to pay for the Covid-19 crisis, as was the situation during the most recent crisis, which was not of the people's making but of the making of bankers and developers. Their actions caused an unprecedented economic crash and ordinary people paid the bill through income losses, job losses and crushing cuts to areas such as housing, health and education. The people want to know that austerity is off the table and they are not going to be asked to pay the bill this time because it would be grossly unfair and counterproductive, as clearly was the case in previous cuts to areas such as healthcare, housing and education. In the context of Covid, one thinks about the price that we are paying for the cuts and lack of investment in areas such as those. Am I hearing our guests right that the advice of the Central Bank is to the effect that austerity of the sort where ordinary people pay the bill for the Covid crisis should be off the agenda?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dr. Cassidy appears to be saying that there will be no austerity for now but the level of the debt we have taken on means the potential of some hard choices coming at a certain point. Perhaps Dr. Cassidy will think this is getting into the political area, or whatever, but does he want to comment on the Oxfam report? I know that the Central Bank produces reports on wealth and its distribution. The Oxfam report, The Inequality Virus, states that, in Ireland and globally, huge numbers of ordinary people have lost jobs and incomes and have really suffered while a significant cohort of billionaires, the super wealthy and certain industries with which they are associated have done extraordinarily well and have seen their wealth increase significantly. That is true in Ireland. The report states that the wealth of Ireland's billionaires has increased by â‚¬3.3 billion. Has Dr. Cassidy any comment on that? Do the Central Bank figures on wealth accumulation bear that out? If Dr. Cassidy is not going to comment on what we should do in the areas of wealth and redistribution, would he agree that taxing such individuals is certainly something that should be considered as an option?It is being considered as an option and, in some cases, acted on in some countries. Countries like Chile and some others have introduced Covid-related wealth taxes. Rather than debt-financing Covid expenditure, they have at least opened up the option of taxes on those who have done well from Covid, and the very wealthy, to pay for the cost of the Covid crisis.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have asked most of my questions. On wealth distribution, I take Dr. Cassidy's point about property values and so on but has he any further comment on it? The figure I am aware of is that the wealthiest 10% has approximately 58% of all the wealth. Therefore, if there is a concentration of wealth in property and other areas as a result of Covid, does it follow that there has been a growth in inequality as a result of the distribution of wealth from Covid? Is this an issue that needs to be looked at?
