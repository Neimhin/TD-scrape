RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for having had to leave to take a call.  I welcome all the witnesses to the committee and I commend them for their tremendous work and commitment over many years.  Ms D'Arcy may be doing this work for the longest time but Dr. John Lannon and Dr. Edward Horgan have gone above and beyond the call of duty in trying to safeguard, as they see it, and I agree with them, our neutrality in the very serious matter of war and military intervention.  They have made enormous sacrifices to do this work.  Very recently Ms D'Arcy was shamefully imprisoned for doing nothing more than wanting to uphold the idea of peace and neutrality.  Let me say "Well done" to all of them.  I missed some of the earlier questions, but as I understand it, and perhaps the witnesses can confirm it for me, it is not the case that we want peace or we have a certain idea of neutrality and we do not believe the Government is living up to it, but the arguments the witnesses put forward are based on international law, human rights law and the obligations of the State authorities to investigate human rights abuses and breaches of the law.  Those are very serious issues regardless of people's particular political views on American foreign policy or whatever else it might be.  We have international obligations, as we have signed up to treaties, and to international definitions of neutrality and we are flouting them.  Similarly, An Garda Síochána for reasons that are not fully explained, does not seem to be responding to complaints about very serious issues in the way it should respond to any complaint that is made to it.  Is that not the heart of the issue?  That is the reason it is relevant to bring the issue to this committee.  The job of this committee is to ensure the State complies with the law in terms of its obligations.  It is a very serious matter that has to be investigated fully to find out if there is political interference.  It seems to me that is what we are talking about.  Is there political interference with the State carrying out its legal obligations to investigate very serious complaints on breaching conventions, treaties and laws that we should comply with.  Would that be a fair summary of what the witnesses are saying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two other points I would like to make.  The motion that was passed in the Dáil at the time essentially gave a green light to Irish facilitation of the US military machine.  The arguments put forward in that regard have been absolutely exposed, because the preamble to the motion which concludes the arrangements that facilitate this should continue is all about Iraq's failure to comply properly with allegations it may have had weapons of mass destruction.  We have subsequently discovered there were no weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, it could not possibly have complied, or it had complied because it did not have those weapons.  Therefore, the entire basis on which the war was conducted has been exposed as having been flawed.  Consequently, the justification provided at the time by the Government for facilitating this war has been exposed.  There was a quasi-legal justification for what the Government did at the time.  It tried to justify it within our idea of neutrality and our commitment to the United Nations and so on.  Do the witnesses think this is an area on which we can challenge the Government - in terms of its compliance with international law - given what has happened in retrospect?  In regard to my second question, the witnesses spoke about political interference, the Garda, harassment of protesters and failure to take complaints seriously.  As events move on, things that might be said in one context gain much greater force in a new context.  The new context for what the witnesses are saying is the shock of the revelations in regard to whistleblowers, Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, and an acknowledgment by the State that there is a problem in regard to how policing was done at the top.  It is widely acknowledged there was political interference with how the Garda conducted its business in certain areas, most notably the Mick Wallace affair, where information was passed by the Commissioner to the Minister and used for political purposes.  This would seem to add strength to the witnesses' contention that there is political interference with how the Garda does its business, its priorities and so on.  Does this give the witnesses cause for optimism and confidence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one follow-up question on that.  The current claim is that these landings are authorised because these troops are not involved in any military operations.  Is that the Government's current claim?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it possible to find out if a substantial number of those planes are going to Afghanistan, for example?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If they are going to Afghanistan, that would seem to put a coach and horses through any claim they are not involved in combat operations.  Do we know for a fact they are going on to Afghanistan?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am aware that in a different area of law relating to council house repossessions cases were taken against certain policies of local authorities.  Those policies contravened the European Convention on Human Rights and legislation has recently passed through the Dáil to address the fact that the policies were in breach of our commitments under that convention.  Could we similarly prove a case in the area under discussion today alleging that Ireland is in breach of its commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights?  We must examine this because planes known to be involved in rendition are landing in this jurisdiction.  Am I correct that Ireland is in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights merely by allowing such planes to land here, regardless of whether people subject to rendition are actually on board while the planes are at Shannon Airport?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should ensure compliance with the numerous conventions and treaties already mentioned.
