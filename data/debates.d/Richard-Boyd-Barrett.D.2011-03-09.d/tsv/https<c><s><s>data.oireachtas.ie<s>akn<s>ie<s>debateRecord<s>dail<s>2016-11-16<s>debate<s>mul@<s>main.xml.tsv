RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach knows, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, is in Marrakesh today making an address to the UN summit on climate change. The major concern at that summit is around the dangerous pledges of US President-elect Trump to tear up the Paris climate change treaty, thereby threatening global action to deal with climate change. There are many reasons to be concerned about the vile, racist, sexist and militarist agenda of Trump, but his threat to global action on climate change is very serious. I want to know when we are going to get a report from the Minister on the discussions in which he is involved today regarding the action we intend to take, the discussions that took place in Marrakesh and what we are going to do to stand up to Trump's dangerous agenda. I want to know when the national mitigation plan will be published in order that this country at least might send out a message that it is not going to go along with Trump's agenda.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Discrimination in employment is illegal. There was a long struggle, going way back to the 1830s in the United States and right up to the 1970s in this country, for equality in employment and to make it unacceptable to discriminate against any category of person. In recent weeks, however, teachers angrily protested and took strike action because the Minister refused to commit to the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. It is very simple, will he commit to that principle?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not very helpful to engage in a disingenuous response to a straightforward question about increments. We all know that there are increments. There have always been increments in the public sector and people move up the pay scale. The issue is that there are two different pay scales. In fact, there are three different pay scales for people who have exactly the same training and experience. The Minister should not try to blur the issue with an untruth. The question is why teachers with the same experience and, possibly, who are the same age as their counterparts are on a different pay scale. Teachers earn different amounts for doing the same job, working in the same schools and teaching the same classes. Some teachers get between €6,000 and €8,000 less for doing the same job. That is just straightforward discrimination. Over their lifetimes, the difference could be as much as €200,000 - the cost of a house. How can the Minister stand over that discrimination? Will he commit to end the discrimination and inequality for teachers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should not give the money argument. There would be money available if some vulture funds and super-profitable corporations were made to pay their taxes. The issue at stake is discrimination. The Minister referred to negotiation. What is there to negotiate in terms of ending inequality? There is nothing to negotiate. It is fair enough for one to negotiate pay increases and other measures but why is the Minister using inequality as a bargaining chip in respect of teachers or other groups of public sector workers? It is fundamentally unfair. The Minister does not get the point. He should not be using it as a bargaining chip for future negotiation. He should acknowledge that it is pay apartheid. It should be illegal. Any other category of discrimination such as against women, LGBT people or racial minorities is illegal, yet the Minister has managed to impose arbitrary discrimination in employment - which is illegal for every other category - on the basis of whether one happened to come into a profession before or after 2010 or 2011. Is the Minister going to end the apartheid?
