RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 23 seeks to ensure any licence granted accords with the principles of sustainable forest management. We discussed at length the need to define clearly sustainable forest management and I contend that the Rio principles on this should guide and inform how we come to that definition, but the Government has rejected my contention. This is unfortunate but sustainable forest management is referred to in section 2 so it is a condition for the issuing of licences. We discussed the issue of Gougane Barra previously and I have spoken to people about this. It links to issues of public consultation and sustainable forest management. The Minister has defended the action as a preventative one to stop the spread of a disease but there was no real consultation with the public, concerned stakeholders, environmental groups, the community on which it will impact and so on. The so-called consultation process can be cursory and tokenistic but real active participation by all key stakeholders, including communities, environmental groups, heritage groups and those with an interest in our forests is necessary for big decisions such as cutting down much of a national park like Gougane Barra. It is necessary to hear all the arguments and consider all the evidence to ensure such big decisions are properly informed. This is what sustainable forest management is about, a real participation by everyone involved. However, this is not how things are done. One could argue that Coillte is something of a secret society because it is not covered by the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm that Coillte employees must sign a confidentiality clause that negates any commitment to public consultation. How can this square with real engagement with the community and stakeholders? It seems Coillte employees can say nothing publicly of Coillte's activities, and this is a real problem. The decision was made to abandon the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights and afterwards the merger with Bord na Móna was announced. This merger has potentially enormous implications for the future development of a forestry model in Ireland, and some of us are concerned that the merger may have been motivated by a narrow desire to exploit Coillte's land mass resource. Forestry, in the narrowest sense of the word, could mean the facilitation of large industrial wind farms with serious implications for forests. Huge controversies have arisen over such use of Coillte's lands. For example, there has been much controversy and conflict in north Mayo over the building of a refinery there on Coillte's lands. I am speaking of big decisions on the use of public land and forestry resources.We have to have the most stringent requirements for real engagement with the public and stakeholders when we make enormous decisions impacting on something as important as this forest and land resource. Stating that any licences granted by the Minister, to Coillte or anybody else, must be in line with sustainable forest management is a critical safeguard in the protection of our natural resources from inappropriate development, potentially environmentally-damaging development and development which could potentially damage our heritage and adversely affect other areas such as tourism, walking and mountaineering. Sustainable forest management is an holistic overall view of forestry rather than one too narrowly defined, where decisions are taken very secretively without proper consultation. This is the logic behind stating that all licences should be conditional on the notion of sustainable forest management.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State. I should take up the offer to meet Coillte. I have had some engagement in recent times with some Coillte staff. I do not want to underestimate the value of much of the work done by many of the people who work for Coillte. What I say is not in any sense across-the-board criticism of Coillte. What is important is the mandate of Coillte, and the extent to which it, and anybody engaged in forestry, is subject to proper environmental guidelines and principles which inform forestry. The Minister of State has described one aspect of forestry, as has his friend in forestry, which is forestry as a crop. This is an important aspect but it is only one aspect. What slightly worries me is that the legislation is geared primarily towards this and I fear Coillte is geared too much in this direction. I do not state it does not do other things as it does some other things very well but, let us be honest, there is a tension between the pressure to see the thing as a crop, perhaps on a short term basis, and sustainable long-term forestry with stewardship, development and expansion of the forest resource in every sense, economically, socially and environmentally. Serious questions are raised. I will be interested to hear the response of the Minister of State on why Coillte is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Is it true Coillte employees must sign a confidentiality clause? Who did Coillte consult on such a big decision to cut down huge amounts of the trees in Gougane Barra and close down a forest park? I heard there was a cursory consultation with the forest liaison group and that was it. I would like to hear more on this. We need to have broader more comprehensive principles informing the granting of licences when we deal with such an important resource.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It cannot be moved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendment is lost even though it was different?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 26:In page 10, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:“8. (1) The Minister should establish a working group based on the Forestry Liaison Group, with balanced representation for the social, environmental and economic stakeholders.(2) The working group may create sub-groups to issue advice on specific areas when required in consultation with the Minister.(3) The working group should have input in setting of agendas and work.(4) The working group should act as a link between international and national forest policies.(5) The terms of reference of the working group should be set by the stakeholders and be guided by the Rio Forest Principles.”.This moves from the general case that I have been putting for sustainable forest management and adequate public consultation to the specific, as it were. To ensure we have a sustainable approach to forest management and to ensure as part of a sustainable approach that we have a comprehensive, broad, balanced, democratic attitude and approach, the forest liaison group as it is currently constituted, which advises the Government on these matters, should be required to have a balance in terms of the social and environmental pillars, as it were, as well as maybe those connected more to the industry, farming and so on, which are also very important parts of all this. We could probably add in mountaineering groups and walking groups. We need a real balance. The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong in this. As I understand it, there is one environmental representative on the forest liaison group and it is much more industry focused. My amendment would make it a requirement whereas what the Minister of State proposes provides that the Minister basically should have the discretion to decide what experts he or she might want on this committee. I do not think that is good enough. It should not be a matter of discretion whether we have sustainable forest management. It should not be the right of any future Minister to skew forest management, which is such an important resource, in a particular direction if it threatens the integrity of this important resource. That is the logic. My amendment again refers to the Rio principles. The Minister of State has made the point that sustainable forest management is an evolving concept, which is fair enough. However, the Rio declaration is very comprehensive and allows for that flexibility. It sets out broad principles and parameters, which represent the highest expression of how we should do it right. It takes in all the aspects, including cultural, environmental, tourist and economic value. I want that approach hardwired into the structures which will work with the Government, if one likes, in terms of managing our forests in a sustainable way. I do not see why the Minister of State would not accept that. The Minister of State's amendment states there should be "an appropriate balance between members who are men and who are women". That is an interesting inclusion and a good one. He is happy to be specific on that balance. Should he not be equally happy to be specific on the other balances? It is absolutely right to specify that gender balance, but he has not included the other social, economic and environmental balances, which are equally important. At the risk of labouring a point we have discussed at length, I believe it is just a recent example of it. We could also talk about the refinery in north Mayo and the major conflict that caused. Coillte lands were used in a way that caused huge division in the community and certainly the community would maintain there was not adequate consultation with it about what was done. Equally in the more recent example of Gougane Barra, the Minister of State did not outline the consultation process.The Minister of State has justified it on the basis of urgency because of the spread of the disease. I am not an expert in this regard but the first indication of disease in Gougane Barra was in July 2013 and the announcement that 16,000 trees would be cut down was made in January. Why were the intervening six months not used for public consultation? That was plenty of time for a comprehensive public consultation to consider the entire issue. Subsequently, it was discovered that it was not just larch that was cut down, as other species were also felled. I acknowledge I do not know but I received a letter from someone who claims to be knowledgeable in this area, which showed pictures of diseased trees where the disease was active and live and those trees were completely decrepit. This person also sent me photographs of the trees that were felled in Gougane Barra, which clearly were not affected by the disease. Questions have been raised and while I do not know whether these suspicions are justified, one way in which this suspicion - or massive conflict and controversy as seen in north County Mayo - can be overcome is to have public consultation. I simply do not accept that one cannot have genuine public consultation without causing unnecessary delays, as to have a proper public consultation is not really about time but is about will. Six months was plenty of time in which to have public consultation but it simply did not happen. Moreover, this concerned a national park of huge importance and perhaps is symptomatic of a problem in respect of decisions that are made. That is the case for this amendment, which proposes that this working group should be balanced, should be informed by principles of sustainable forest management and that the Minister should not simply be allowed to do what he or she wants. It is a reasonable proposal, which I hope the Minister of State will accept, and I intend to press this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I appreciate the Minister of State has tabled an amendment to respond to the concerns raised, it is too qualified. I wish to press this matter because it relates concretely to how the Government and the Minister will be influenced by the right balance of stakeholders in forestry. The amendment tabled by the Minister of State states: "the Minister shall give due consideration to the desirability of the committee’s membership reflecting the social, economic and environmental interests". In other words, the Minister will consider whether it is desirable to have a balance. That is pretty weak, as how could it not be desirable to have a balance? The Minister should not have the discretion to decide he or she does not wish to have a balance but only wants the industry people. This is how the Minister of State's amendment is worded, whereas the amendment I tabled states there must be a balance. The Minister of State's amendment correctly provides for a balance between men and women, which is very specific, but on the issue of the balance in respect of social, economic and environmental factors, it is up to the Minister as to whether he or she will have a balance. That is a way out of having a balance and this is not simply an abstract argument because there are serious questions about the model of forestry that is being pursued and whether too often, albeit not in all circumstances, the model being pursued is one that does not really engage properly with the public and does not take on board alternative points of view. Moreover, it is overly geared, and I suspect will become ever-increasingly geared, towards the interests of big developers in industrial wind turbines, industrialised biomass or whatever it might be. While I acknowledge they also have the right to a voice, too often it is that voice which dominates and the community and environmental concerns get lost, as do the other social, cultural and heritage interests and perspectives, to the detriment of our natural resources. This is the basis on which I intend to press the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I can only come back once more, I will say my final piece in this regard. I accept the Minister of State's bona fides and that he would seek to so do. That was why he responded to the Committee Stage debate by tabling his amendment. I genuinely accept he would wish to engage in a proper way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, I believe there will be huge pressures on all Ministers, present and future, in this area. Sadly, the media are not terribly interested in this debate as it no longer is controversial because Coillte will not be sold. However, I believe that as a big milestone is the potential merger of Coillte with Bord na Móna and what this may mean.It involves substantial resources, the value and importance of which will increase at every level. The value of these resources is understood in some quarters, for example, in banks which invest heavily in forests. In the aftermath of a period of financial speculation on a virtual economy and the economic crash, there is an increasing awareness of the value of real things such as natural resources. Forestry is an extremely important resource and, as such, future Ministers will come under severe pressure from industry, multinational companies and many other sectors that wish to exploit our natural resources. Against that background, we must set in legislation a requirement to establish a consultative committee with genuinely balanced and broad representation, with which the Minister would consult in deciding how to approach this issue and deal with the pressures he or she will face. This is necessary to ensure citizens, communities, history and heritage do not lose out.  I have not taken an inflexible approach. My amendment does not specify that the committee must include a certain number of environmentalists, trade unions, members of walking groups, etc. It offers the Minister flexibility, while spelling out that he or she must establish a committee with balanced representation whose approach, broadly speaking, would be informed by the Rio principles. I will press the amendment because the decision on this issue will have significant consequences for the management of forestry. I hope the Minister of State will consider accepting it, although I am certain he will not do so. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 28:In page 11, line 11, after “law” to insert the following:“, save where such disclosures may be deemed to be in the public interest, particularly where such disclosures are made in the interests of sustainable forest management”. This amendment concerns disclosures and confidentiality. One could call it a whistle-blower's amendment. Section 9(1) states: "Save as otherwise provided by law, a person shall not, without the consent of the Minister, disclose confidential information obtained by him or her while performing, or as a result of having performed, duties as a member of a committee unless he or she is duly authorised to do so." Therefore the Minister has the right to silence or impose confidentiality on the committee. That may or may not be justified in some circumstances, but that power for the Minister to impose confidentiality has to be qualified. My amendment provides that it should be qualified "save where such disclosures may be deemed to be in the public interest, particularly where such disclosures are made in the interests of sustainable forest management". This is important because, as we know, we have had too much secrecy in State institutions in general, which has cost our society dearly in a range of institutions and sectors. They include the financial sector, schools, churches and various State institutions. The secret society approach to running an economy, a society or a state has to end.This is something the Government has indicated should happen. We need greater accountability and transparency, and to encourage whistle blowing when it is in the interest of society. It follows logically that the Minister should not have the power to unconditionally impose confidentiality clauses. If a member of the relevant committee believes it is in the public interest and in the interest of sustainable forest management to blow the whistle, he or she should not be prohibited from doing so. That is a general reason why the Government should accept this amendment. There are concerns about the decision making process in the forestry sector, particularly by the biggest owner of forests in this country, Coillte, and its impact on the national forest estate and adjoining communities. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, has pointed out that a lot of people are doing a lot of good work in Coillte. I recognise that Coillte employs a considerable number of dedicated people who love what they do and care passionately about our forests. However, one could say that about many dysfunctional institutions. There were lots of good people in the church and I am sure they did a lot of good work. There were also some not so good people who did terrible things. The culture of secrecy meant that whistles were not blown when terrible things happened. This is an important debate. I did not get an answer to my question on why Coillte is not subject to freedom of information. The Minister of State indicated that the Bill is not about Coillte but it is about forestry and Coillte owns half of our forests. It is by far the biggest owner of forests and it has a decisive influence on forestry nationally. It is odd, therefore, that it would not be subject to freedom of information. In the debate on Irish Water, the Government conceded on its initial plan to exclude that company from freedom of information. I do not see why the same argument should not apply to Coillte. Why would it not be subject to freedom of information? The Minister of State also did not respond to my point that Coillte employees have a confidentiality clause, which means that if they are concerned about certain aspects of what might be happening in the organisation, their contracts of employment precludes them from speaking about their concerns. If we want to give strength to the many good people who work in Coillte, we need to give them legal backing if they decide to speak out about what is going on in this big organisation, which controls 7% of the landmass of this State. The argument that we need greater levels of transparency and accountability is unanswerable. Any power the Minister might have to impose confidentiality has to be qualified in the way this amendment suggests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to hear other opinions on this subject. Does the Minister of State mean that if a member of a committee who advises him on forest management hears something that does not concern personal information, is in line with the law and is a cause for serious concern in the context of the public interest and the sustainable management of our forests, he or she will have the legal right to blow the whistle? I want clarity on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will press the amendment, although I will not seek a vote on it. I am not terribly happy with the Minister of State's reply because it is somewhat evasive. The Minister of State cannot speak again but perhaps his officials could just nod. If a disclosure is allowed by law and the whistleblower legislation allows for the disclosure, the Minister would not be able to override permission? I welcome that the Government is introducing legal supports for whistleblowers but I want an assurance that the Minister's power to demand confidentiality cannot override people's legal right to be whistleblowers. It is not clear to me whether that assurance for people to blow the whistle when it is in the public interest to do so is provided for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would still like that element in the legislation but I will not seek a vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is similar to having specific requirements for the Minister to explain himself or herself with regard to decisions. Amendment No. 32 would make it a requirement for proper consultation with the relevant Oireachtas committee. This is about trying to tie in specific accountability requirements in legislation for the decisions to be made. These are reasonable amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 30:In page 11, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:"(2) The detail required in a forest management plan shall be proportionate to the area of forestry.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 32:In page 12, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:"(7) Prior to the making of regulations the Minister shall consult with the relevant Oireachtas Committee.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 33:In page 12, line 11, to delete "have regard to" and substitute "ensure that".This relates to the Minister's safeguarding of the environment, the requirement that the Minister should take into account the social, economic and environmental functions of forestry and follow the best forest practice. Many points have already been made in previous discussions on other amendments but one cannot overstate the importance of this being a requirement of the Minister rather than just something he or she should consider. The value of forests is varied and often the forestry model applied here - as I and others have said - is too narrow. We need to broaden our understanding of forestry. We have discussed this and the Minister of State has indicated we should discuss it further after we finish debating this Bill. He has informally suggested that we could have statements on how to develop forestry, and no matter what occurs with this Bill and amendments, that would be a welcome development. Many people want some input into how we develop the forestry model in this country to its potential. Some feel that the current model being pursued is too narrow and does not fully realise its potential. Some people would argue there are serious threats to forestry because we are pursuing too narrow a model at times. This amendment comes from the idea that the Minister should not just have regard to this issue but it should be required that he or she would take into account the economic, environmental and social impact on forestry and follow the best forest practice rather than just good forest practice, which is not really defined.It should be defined specifically by national forest policy and by national forest standards. We are trying to be more specific about the meaning of “best forest practice”, which is not always terribly well defined. It is too vague and therefore one can define it any way one likes. Our definitions of these things need to be tighter. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The broadness and vagueness concern me. The Minister of State needs flexibility and cannot be absolutely tied down to, or hamstrung by, every last detail but if the policy and standards are good and are informed by a sustainable approach to forestry, some of the clashes and conflicts the Minister of State alludes to do not come into play. There is often a false tension between what is viewed as the economic approach to forestry and the heritage or environmental approach. I am arguing on behalf of environmental groups and people who are passionate about, and interested in, forestry, who know more than I do and who say it is possible to have the best of all possible worlds. If it is done right the unique feature of sustainable forestry is that one can achieve and maximise all of the ends, economic, social, cultural, heritage or whatever. To set them against one another is wrong. If the Minister of State has the right policies and standards and applies those, the clashes do not have to exist.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 12, to delete line 12 and substitute the following:“(b) lead with reference to all relevant national forest policy and national forest standards,”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 12, to delete line 14 and substitute the following:“(i) protected semi-natural habitats and protected species that may be impacted by forest activities, both inside and outside the forest, and whether within or outside protected areas, and”.We discussed this quite extensively. It is self-evident. I am trying to elaborate the point and emphasis on which I have just spoken at length.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 36 deals with the different activities that can combine to have an impact on, and pose dangers to, forests. This relates to my point about the areas of activity of organisations such as Coillte or the various things that can happen on lands adjoining forest, particularly following the possible merger of Coillte and Bord na Móna. The amendment tries to refer specifically to the cumulative effect of diversifying into areas such as wind energy and biomass and other activities, or products, on, or close to, forest lands.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have doubts about how well it is provided for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 36:In page 12, line 25, after “Regulations,” to insert the following:“including in each case consideration of in combination effects of afforestation and other plans or projects,”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 38:In page 13, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:"13. (1) The Minister may require the carrying out of ecological surveys of any afforestation sites to—(a) prevent damage to species and habitats that the state has responsibility to protect, or(b) prevent genetic pollution of existing and ancient woodlands, which might be adversely impacted by new plantations of native species of an exotic source.(2) The Minister will make provision for concerned citizens to petition him or her for an ecological survey to be conducted where a citizen believes the ecological integrity of a forest or protected species or habitats are endangered by activities within or outside the forest.".We discussed this on Committee Stage. I am proposing to allow the Minister to require "ecological surveys of any afforestation sites" to be carried out. I am not sure we have made the point that the cutting down of trees and the carrying out of other activities in or close to forests are not the only things that can be problematic. The wrong type of afforestation, or inappropriate afforestation, can be problematic as well. Perhaps we should require the Minister to consider the impact the particular type of trees being planted may have at all sorts of levels. It is important to reflect on the impact of certain types of trees on the local environment, wildlife, soil, local communities and the broad ecology of a locality. I have often discussed people's concern about the reasons for cutting down trees and their belief that they should not have been cut down. We should bear in mind that when forests are being developed, communities are often concerned that the wrong types of trees are being planted. Obviously, this relates to the ongoing debate about the excessive focus on sitka spruce as a single species and the impact that such a monoculture can have on ecology. That is the logic behind this amendment, which would empower citizens who are concerned about the impact of particular approaches to forestry on the local ecology, native woodlands and existing woodlands by giving them the right to petition for ecological surveys to be done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to elaborate briefly on the logic behind this amendment. I want to underline that I am by no means a scientific expert in this area. I would like to comment on the whole issue of disease without getting into the rights and wrongs of the Gougane Barra issue. There has been some speculation about certain diseases which are beginning to appear here, in England and in other parts of Europe. I refer to diseases that we did not appear to have much of before now. I was reading an article about the ramorum issue. As far as I understand it, we did not really have it here before. They did not have it in England until relatively recently. The Minister of State's officials probably know more about it. Perhaps the point is that it was limited to different species. There is speculation that it is hitting new species after being imported into Ireland and Britain because we are planting particular types of species that might not be appropriate. One of the consequences of the spread of these diseases is that we have to cut down loads of trees. This example shows why we need to be careful about the potential impact of afforestation projects on our native woodlands. That is the point of this amendment. It seems reasonable that people who are concerned about these issues should have the right to petition to ensure the possible ecological impact on native woodlands is studied properly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find Deputy McNamara’s argument quite compelling. When I think about it, it is similar to one of the amendments I had tabled, which was ruled out of order because it could involve a charge on the Exchequer, that would ensure financial recognition for forest owners who did not harvest a crop in the interest of European designations or good environmental management. It is about encouraging people to engage in forestry but also to ensure that those who the State hopes will develop forestry will have some guarantee that they will not be at a loss for doing so. I would like to see the State forestry company, Coillte, significantly contribute to afforestation. There needs to be a debate about its incapacity to do so with EU rules and so forth. Given that the Government’s focus is about encouraging private farmers to move into forestry in a larger way-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but we also have an imperative to ensure we have good, environmentally protective, best practices in forestry. Deputy McNamara has a good point about a farmer who decides to afforest marginal land but discovers 40 years later that he cannot harvest it and will not get any financial recognition for contributing to the overall environmental welfare. Farmers are right and justified in seeking the assurance that if that were to happen - as Deputy McNamara said it could for a very good reason - then they will be compensated. It is a reasonable argument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Ross, Healy, Wallace, Clare Daly and Mattie McGrath.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for submitting this Private Members' motion and for being a consistent champion on this issue.I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, well in his new job. It is an important job and I have no doubt but he will make the very best effort in it. However, Members should not underestimate the challenges the country faces and the situation in which it finds itself. Members in this Dáil have debated and argued at length about the impact of austerity on all sorts of vulnerable sectors of society that really have been affected, often cruelly, by the economic crash and the austerity that has been imposed - I will not state we had to impose it. Many sectors have suffered but there is no doubt but that those with a disability, those with special needs, those with mental health issues and so on have suffered disproportionately as a result of the austerity programme. Every indicator shows that those with disabilities are affected worst by all these cuts regardless of whether they are imposed in respect of social welfare, education or health. They hurt a lot of people in all sorts of areas but they hurt people with disabilities more. Moreover, all facts and statistics make clear that people with disabilities are more likely to be poor and are becoming even more likely to be poor than other sectors of society. They are twice as likely, if not more, to suffer from or to be at risk of poverty, are more likely to be unemployed and are less likely to get into third level education. That is discrimination and when Members talk about women being likely to be paid less or being less well represented in particular areas of society, they call it what they should, namely, oppression and discrimination, and state that something must be done about it. However, this is precisely what people with disabilities suffer. They suffer oppression and discrimination and the facts bear out this. Consequently, imposing cuts in these areas is a cruel worsening of the position of a sector of society that already is severely disadvantaged and discriminated against. At the most basic level, I think of those who attend my constituency clinic seeking stair lifts, walk-in showers or grab rails. They have suffered strokes and are physically disabled in some way or other but when they approach the local council to inform it that they need such items immediately, they are told they cannot have them for a year, because the budget has run out, as it has been cut. This simply is unacceptable. It is bad enough for people without disabilities who must try to access public services that are being cut but for those with disabilities, it is even worse. The subject of mental health was mentioned previously and something that is not being discussed enough is the fact there are no inpatient beds for young children with mental health issues. Therefore, they have been turned away when they have serious problems, sometimes when suicidal, or are being put into adult institutions, which are completely inappropriate for them. This is a breach of their human rights, is highly dangerous and is happening because of cuts that are being imposed in the area of health. Housing costs disproportionately affect the disabled and then of course there are cuts to the advocacy groups. Given that there is discrimination, disadvantage and so on for people with disability, the idea that the Government would take €1.2 million from those groups which advocate on their behalf is absolutely unacceptable and should be reversed. Consequently, it is vitally important that this Private Members' motion is accepted, that those cuts are reversed, that the Government places an absolute special priority on ensuring the discriminatory and unfair position that affects people with disabilities will be remedied urgently and that there will be absolutely no further cuts affecting those with disability in the forthcoming budget.
