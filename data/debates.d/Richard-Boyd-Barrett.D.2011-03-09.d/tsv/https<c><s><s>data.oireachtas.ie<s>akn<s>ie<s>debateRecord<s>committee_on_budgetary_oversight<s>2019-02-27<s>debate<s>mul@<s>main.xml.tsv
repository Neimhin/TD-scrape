RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can see that point. I have a question to follow on from that. What particular sectors will be hurt? Could the witnesses be a bit more specific? The chemicals industry was mentioned. The graphs showing the contribution chemical exports have made to export growth are quite stunning. The graph shows that without increased chemical exports our exports would be negative, which is a pretty stark indication of the reliance on one particular sector. I presume another sector that has contributed very significantly to our growth over recent years is the IT sector. I do not see either of those being significantly impacted by Brexit one way or another. The Central Bank's representatives' commentary suggests that most export growth goes to the United States and, interestingly, Belgium. The IT sector will not be significantly impacted. If I understood what Dr. Cassidy said about financial services, there could be a positive spin-off for us if anything. There is no particular negative impact there. Where will the negative impacts be? I presume they will be felt in agribusiness because of the huge portion of agricultural output that is exported to Britain. I imagine tourism will be hit. I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that. To what extent does the Central Bank's analysis take these swings and roundabouts into account?Does this Brexit crisis not highlight much more deep-rooted structural weaknesses in the economy that need to be addressed no matter what happens, regardless of whether there is a soft or hard Brexit? One such weakness is that we are considerably over-reliant on a few sectors. If problems emerge in any of them, the economy will be in serious trouble. If this is true, what should we be doing about it? Diversification is what is needed. Do our guests believe that Ireland is moving to take serious steps to diversify its economy or is industrial policy concentrated on growing the sectors on which we rely and potentially increasing our vulnerability in the medium to long term?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the final point, I am not so sure we are doing so well but we will leave that discussion for another day. I find the table on page 73 quite striking. It indicates that Government net financial wealth fell by â‚¬2.3 billion during quarter 2 of 2018 as the increase in liabilities outstripped the increase in financial assets. I am referring to the quarterly bulletin of the Central Bank. It is chart 32. I am curious about it. Could our guests comment on what are the liabilities? What is the significance of the fall in the Government's net financial wealth?I am connecting it, in my mind, with a policy the Government has pursued in recent years and to which I am strongly opposed. It was touched on earlier. I refer to the sale of large amounts of property-related assets to institutional investors who have moved in on Irish property. The National Asset Management Agency and the banks have sold a large number of properties to them. That makes no sense as these were assets, which generate revenue, were in State hands and could have counterbalanced this. When one looks at the extent to which-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly what I am doing. When one looks at the extent to which the Government's housing plans, particularly on social housing, are dependent on renting back property, through the housing assistance payment, rental accommodation and social leasing schemes, from the institutional investors to which NAMA sold that property-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking if it is connected. Would our financial assets be greater if we had held on to those assets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the big assets is property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am only asking a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My specific question is what was the impact on the State's assets and liabilities position of the Government's decision to sell large amounts of property assets. I would be very happy if the witnesses could come back to me with the answer. There is also the question of the cost of renting those assets back and the outgoings. Is the projected expenditure included in the liabilities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one final question. I am always interested in the table on household wealth-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I read the Central Bank's table correctly, household wealth is now as great as it has ever been. It has increased dramatically both in terms of financial and property assets. One can look at that alongside the Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions, SILC, reports on the distribution of those assets, which show a very high concentration. I believe they show that the top 10% own 58% of it. Is the over-concentration of wealth, both property and financial, in the hands of a very small number of people a vulnerability when we speak of risks and vulnerabilities in an economy?
