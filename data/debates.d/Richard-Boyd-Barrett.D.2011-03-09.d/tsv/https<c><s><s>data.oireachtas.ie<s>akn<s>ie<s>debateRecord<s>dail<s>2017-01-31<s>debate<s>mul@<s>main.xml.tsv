RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. I am fully aware the Business Committee met last week and agreed the business for today and this week, but over the weekend since the meeting a matter of extreme urgency has intervened and I ask the Government and the House to consider the need for us to change this week's order to discuss it. Obviously I am speaking about President Donald Trump's travel ban, which I and many of us believe is absolutely abhorrent. It has very serious implications for millions of people trying to enter the United States and we have the very serious implications of the possibility of a Bill which rides roughshod over human rights, possibly Irish law and certainly international law-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----at our own airports. What is happening at our airports is important. We do not even have clarity on this issue. I appeal to the Government and the House to have a debate on the implications of the travel ban for the world and specifically for this country this week as a matter of absolute urgency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An e-mail was sent to the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not on the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a point of order. On our behalf, Deputy Barry circulated an e-mail this morning to all members of the Business Committee requesting this debate, so that communication to the Business Committee has already occurred. It was suggested that we had not done that courtesy, but we did it this morning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite my very considerable disappointment that the Government failed to support Deputy Broughan's motion last week on the need for an immediate commission of investigation on the Stardust tragedy, the Government motion passed and that committed to certain things. These include the appointment of an independent judicial figure and following that, the possibility of a commission of investigation. Last night, I had a very upset Antoinette Keegan representing the Stardust families on the phone to me feeling that since the passing of that motion, the Government has pulled the wool over her eyes. She is very concerned that what she thought she understood from the Government on its plan to deal with this matter is quite different to what is now occurring.I want to ask the Taoiseach the precise steps that will be taken in terms of following up on the Stardust motion. I ask that the Minister, as a matter of urgency before those steps are taken, agrees to meet Antoinette Keegan and the Stardust committee to ensure, as the motion promises, that the families are on board with what is being done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is now clear that Donald Trump's extremist views were not some electoral ploy but that, in fact, a dangerous far-right extremist and racist is now the President of the United States. During questions to the Taoiseach a year ago, I asked was Trump dangerous and racist and the Taoiseach responded to me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I asked the Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----did he agree that he was dangerous and racist and the Taoiseach said that he was dangerous and racist.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I want to ask the Taoiseach is, when somebody shows that he is dangerous and racist and is implementing racist attacks and policies on vulnerable people, at what point do we draw the line and say it is not acceptable to shake hands with such a person, to give him PR opportunities and to give him gifts on behalf of the Irish people. The policy of appeasement in the 1930s of Hitler and the fascists was a disaster. Anybody would recognise that. He should have been recognised for the dangerous threat he was back then. Trump is echoing those far-right and extremist policies and I put it to the Taoiseach there can be no appeasement of somebody like that. Such a person has to be challenged, not have his hands shaken or be in any way legitimised or endorsed by the Taoiseach, particularly on a national day of celebration. How can the Taoiseach possibly shake hands with somebody who, the Taoiseach said, was dangerous and racist? By the way, I put that question to others in this House who may also be invited to Washington that they also give a commitment they will not shake hands with this dangerous racist.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What has hurling got to do with this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will send the Taoiseach the transcript.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And dangerous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said, "yes."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach consider the policy now racist and dangerous?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are these policies not dangerous or racist?
