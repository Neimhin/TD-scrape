RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad the Government is not opposing our Bill on ventilation and the need for clean air in workplaces, but we need more than that. We need critical urgency in taking on this issue and legislating for a proper level of ventilation, air filtration and clean air standards. There are two ways to respond to a pandemic. It is understandable when we are facing a new situation that there are many knee-jerk responses, we do not quite know what we are dealing with, and emergency measures taken at short notice are inevitable. We are two years into the pandemic and we have learned a lot. Critically, we now know that this is an airborne disease. The question of how we prevent the transmission of Covid-19 through the air is critical. To put it in stark and simple terms, unless we address that, we are not going to bring this pandemic to an end. The doom loop of restrictions, widespread illness and the threat of our hospitals being overrun will continue. The facts are stark. I commend Orla Hegarty for pulling together the facts about this and championing the arguments. She puts it starkly when she says that, given that we now know that this is an airborne disease, the way to tackle it is not about what individuals do but about what happens in buildings. There is a stark concentration of superspreading events in particular types of buildings. More than half of the people who died as a result of Covid-19 were infected in just 0.3% of buildings. That is really stark. That allows us to target our approach to dealing with the virus, if we absorb the significance of that fact. Other facts further corroborate this point. Half of workplace outbreaks have been in just 150 buildings. Infection in overcrowded private homes is twice the rate of in uncrowded homes. One in four school buildings has had a Covid-19 index case in the past four months. That nails the ridiculous lie that the Government persisted with, as Deputy Bríd Smith and others said, that schools were not a vector for Covid transmission. It was ridiculous and everybody knew it. We knew that overcrowded spaces of any kind were places where transmission was taking place, yet the Government persisted with this nonsense. There now has been a swing to the opposite end of the spectrum where all the burden of trying to address the crisis is being loaded onto the schools. It is all about the schools now. It was apparently not happening in schools at all before and now it is all about the schools. I support the idea that children should wear masks. However, I do not think it is sensible to talk about excluding kids from school, if they are distressed by that, have not been fully convinced, do not fully understand, or are caught between parents and the school when their parents are resistant. I would drop any discussion of excluding kids from school and putting that on teachers. Now we have finally admitted that schools are a setting in which the virus transmits and is likely to transmit, for the obvious reasons. There are large numbers of people in overcrowded buildings. Many of them are poor quality buildings and, disgracefully, many are prefabricated units. They are some of the most overcrowded classrooms in Europe. Is it a surprise that airborne disease is likely to transmit in those kinds of environments? Of course it is not. It happens in other similar environments, often in the face of Government denial for a long time. Deputy Bríd Smith has just given me some facts she got from Orla Hegarty last night, which underline this. There is currently a meat plant outbreak with 240 cases of infections, as there have been throughout the pandemic. They are closed, overcrowded environments with poor ventilation. There are currently 52 nursing home outbreaks. One home has 64 infections. Fifty-three children have been hospitalised in the past two weeks, a number which has more than doubled in one month. Cases among children are 20 times what they were last year. It is all happening in certain types of buildings which are overcrowded, have poor ventilation, no air filtration, and so on. Orla Hegarty points out that in 1918, during the Spanish flu, Chicago suppressed the pandemic by making ventilation a condition of trading in workplaces, during a terrible pandemic that claimed 30 million lives globally. Deputy Paul Murphy's analogy is absolutely right. He stated that addressing the lack of clean water was critical to wiping out certain types of disease. Even here in Ireland, tuberculosis was addressed by the regulation, to some degree, of overcrowded in housing. Tuberculosis was rampant in overcrowded conditions, in other words, among the poor in overcrowded, poor quality housing. Is what needs to be done, how urgent it is, and that we have the science to do it starting to get through to the Government?It is not just about what the health professionals say. If it is in certain types of buildings with poor ventilation, air filtration and so on, we need to listen to the people who know about buildings. It is about how to manage the transmission of air within buildings and there are people who know this - people like architects, people like Orla Hegarty and people who have developed air filtration systems that can filter the molecules that carry Covid-19. Against that background, what the Minister said last night on television was simply unbelievable. He was asked why HEPA filters should not be put in schools. They are not very expensive. We could put them in every single school in the country for €12 million. Germany has spent €200 million on HEPA filters. He said "No", because of what our advice is telling us. I do not know what exactly his advice is telling him but he said that we are not doing it. We will instead open the windows in the midst of winter. Some of the stuff that was sent out by the Minister for Education on ventilation and opening windows in the depths of winter is unbelievable. One piece of advice stated that if it was really cold, teachers should open the window slightly near where the radiator is. Our kids have a choice between freezing in the cold or getting Covid-19 in overcrowded situations. This is not directly to do with air filtration and ventilation, but added to this issue is the failure to maintain contact tracing in schools. That is, of course, linked to the understaffing and resourcing of public health teams to follow it up. That is why the Government did not do continue with contact tracing. It had nothing to do with any public health advice. It was because we do not have proper public health teams to follow up. We also do not have temperature checks. Why are there not temperature checks in schools? When you go to certain radio stations in this city to do interviews, there are temperature checks on the way in. Why do we not have them in schools? Critically, why do we not deal with overcrowding in schools? Healthcare and hospitals are the other big issue. One of the worst hit groups are healthcare workers, who we need to combat this pandemic, and it is precisely because many of our hospital buildings are poorly ventilated and old. They need refurbishment. Our healthcare workers do not have proper protection. I hope the Minister for Health gets the message and progresses this Bill as soon as possible because if we do not address this issue we will not get on top of Covid-19.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned that under the framework for well-being, particular groups were being looked at, and that NESC produced a report on building a new relationship between voluntary organisations and the State, including disability groups in that sector. I will repeat a point that I have made previously to the Taoiseach. In the area of disability, we are failing at many levels. Covid has highlighted further the deficit in supports and services for people with disabilities. I will cite two examples, but the issue is urgent. Accessible Community Transport Southside is a charitable, not-for-profit, voluntary group that provides 1,200 door-to-door trips for people in wheelchairs and those with mobility issues. It is threatened with closure now because of the impact of Covid on its income streams. For the lack of approximately €50,000 in funding, this critical service for people with disabilities is faced with closure in the next two months. It is going to run out of funding.Accessible Community Transport Southside, ACTS, is a door-to-door service for people who are wheelchair users and who cannot use public transport, and for those who have significant mobility problems. Autism-specific residential respite services cater to a group of people who have been particularly hit. Many of the day services were closed during Covid-19. There is a huge deficit of those services, especially in our area. This needs to be looked at in a coherent and cohesive way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It certainly does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will get there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been a lot of talk from the Government about recognising the work of essential workers during the pandemic, that things will be different and that, for those workers who carried us through the pandemic, there will be payback. One group of workers that have not been talked about enough, but who were absolutely essential and worked throughout the pandemic, are private security workers working in our hospitals, on the buses and the Luas, and in the courts, supermarkets, the ESB, Google, nightclubs, hotels - you name it. Average pay in the sector is €11.65. There have been two delays in pay increases they were supposed to get under an employment regulation order, ERO, because the Minister did not sign off on the pay increases. The Scrooge employers in this sector are now trying, through court action, to block pay increases for these workers. I ask the Taoiseach to address the low pay plight and the failure to get pay increases for these private security workers and, indeed, to talk about increasing the living wage to increase their low pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the Minister of State, Deputy English.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the risk of blowing our own trumpet on this issue, we have always said that whether it was inflation, rent freezes or anything else proposed by Government or Opposition parties, it would not work because rents were already too high. We need to set rents. The obvious gap relates to any new property. The Government said we will solve the problem by increasing supply, but any cap or freeze is meaningless because landlords can set whatever rents they like for any new properties. We need to set rents at affordable levels. Unless we do that, rent will continue to climb, even if there is new supply. I have to be honest. I will plague the Taoiseach on this issue. I have raised the income thresholds for eligibility for social housing with the Taoiseach last week and the week before. I have raised this with the Minister. There has been review after review and promise after promise but nothing has been done. I understand there are now four cases in my area alone of people in homeless accommodation who are being threatened with homelessness. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, intervened in one of the cases to stop the immediate threat of a family being put out onto the street, but the fundamental problem remains. The local authority has said the rules are such that it is required to put people out of homeless accommodation when they go above the income threshold. We need to raise the income threshold immediately.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very slow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 10:In page 29, to delete lines 20 to 28 and substitute the following: "(2) Not later than 1 month following enactment (of this legislation), the Minister shall commence and carry out a review of the existing NMPF to— (a) review its compliance with the MSP Directive, (b) provide for interim protections for the marine environment, and (c) in respect of the inclusion of relevant projects in the existing NMPF— (i) to specifically review the compatibility of the inclusion of the relevant projects in the existing NMPF with the requirements of the MSP Directive, and (ii) to address consequences arising from the delayed implementation of marine protected areas and adequate designation of sites under the Birds Directive and Habitats Directive. (3) Notwithstanding anything elsewhere in this Act no Maritime Area Consent, or Development Consent can be granted pending the conclusion of the review under subsection (2). (4) The Minister shall conduct a public consultation as part of the review and shall also 2 consult with at least with the following organisations: (a) The Marine Institute; (b) The Environmental Protection Agency; (c) The Heritage Council; (d) Fáilte Ireland; (e) An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland; (f) Sustainable Water Network Ireland. (5) The Minister shall assess the compliance of the existing NMPF including in particular how the existing NMPF complies with the following articles of the MSP Directive: (a) Article 1; (b) Article 4(4); (c) Article 4(5); (d) Article 5(1); (e) Article 5(2); (f) Article 6; (g) Article 8(1); (h) Article 8(2); (i) Article 10; (j) Article 11; (k) the requirements of recital 2 relating to the overarching constraint that development and decision making in marine environment has to be done whilst achieving good environmental status as set out in Directive 2008/56/EC. (6) The Minister shall consider the implications of at least the following assessments in reviewing the adequacy and compliance of the existing NMPF and the need to provide for interim protection areas, pending the designation of further sites as marine protected areas under Article 13(4) of Directive 2008/56/EC: (a) Art 17, 10 and 11 of the Maritime Strategy Framework Directive; (b) Article 16 and 17 of the Habitats Directive; (c) Article 10 of the Birds Directive; (d) any data gaps and deficiencies in the assessments highlighted in the consultation responses to paragraphs (a) to (c) above; (e) the latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report, and its relevance and conclusions for marine biodiversity and relevant avian species including native and migratory bird species relevant for the area of the MSP;(f) migratory and foraging pathways for marine biodiversity and relevant avian species including native and migratory bird species, to and from, and through the MSP;(g) outstanding and or inadequate designations in the marine environment or in coastal sites under both the Birds and Habitats Directive; (h) the requirements for the strict protection of species and habitats listed under Annex IV of the Habitats Directive; (i) take account of the effect of climate change on patterns of migration; and (j) take a precautionary approach to data gaps and deficiencies in respect of ecological surveys in respect of the MSP. (7) The Minister shall detail his detailed reasons and rationale for amending or not amending the existing NMPF including in light of the criteria and considerations above.".What we are trying to do with this amendment is to say that we need an urgent review of the national marine planning framework and that the review needs to ensure compliance with the maritime spatial planning directive to provide for interim protections for the marine environment and, essentially, to check compliance between the national marine planning framework and all the key EU directives relating to maritime spatial planning and the protection of the environment, the habitats directive and the birds directive. We should also ensure we have consultation with organisations that have expertise in and knowledge of the marine environment such as the Heritage Council, Fáilte Ireland, An Taisce, the Sustainable Water Network, the Marine Institute and so on. Other Deputies will elaborate further on this point because the amendment is tabled in my name as well as the names of Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Eoin Ó Broin. To summarise, our concern, a concern that was corroborated by the officials dealing with marine protected areas, whom we met yesterday, is that in an ideal world we would be doing things the other way around as to how we will manage our maritime area of 220 million acres, an enormous area multiples the size of the land area of this country. It is a hugely important resource for biodiversity and in its role as a carbon sink. In an ideal world we would have had our designated marine protected areas before talking about giving consent for human activity and major development, particularly major industrial development, in the maritime area when that human activity and industrial development could potentially do damage to our marine resources, to biodiversity and to the capacity of the marine as a key environmental protection for humanity in its capacity to absorb carbon. The officials acknowledged that we would have done that first. Ireland is at the bottom of the league table when it comes to the designation of marine protected areas, with only a little more than 2% of our huge marine area, one of the biggest marine areas of any country in Europe, protected, as against France, at over 40%, and other countries at 50% to 60%. We are behind the curve. The officials acknowledged that. We are concerned because the legacy projects that get special status in the national marine planning framework, which were sites developed for industrial offshore renewable infrastructure, were selected by the developers and the developers have said very explicitly they want "a developer-led approach" to developing offshore wind. We do not believe it is in line with sustainable planning and development or with the spirit or the word or letter of environmental protections in EU directives that we would have a developer-led approach. However, the companies that have those specially designated legacy projects have selected their own sites. We do not know whether those sites are incredibly sensitive and important to the protection of marine biodiversity and our marine environment. That is a problem and, therefore, we want the maximum protection put in place and we want the national marine planning framework to be reviewed in that context in order that we do not have inappropriate, potentially damaging development taking place before we have a plan-led approach that is fully in compliance with all the key environmental directives of the European Union to protect our precious marine resources and environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment is not in any way an attempt to diss the work that has been put in by officials to the marine planning framework or around this Bill. It is a serious piece of legislative work. However, there is a concern and the Minister of State and his officials know what that concern is. I asked one of the officials yesterday whether we are behind the curve on marine protected areas. He had to say "Yes" and that the situation we are in is not ideal. That is a blunt admission of the problem we face. Only a tiny amount of our enormous maritime area, which is precious, is protected, because successive governments - not this one, in particular, but previous governments - have failed to protect it. We are in a situation where we know corporate interests are lobbying explicitly, saying they do not want a plan-led approach to the development of our marine areas. That is what the Irish Wind Energy Association said. It does not want such an approach but, instead, a developer-led approach. Those same corporate interests have been given special status under the national marine planning framework. That is a concern. We want to know what protection there is in that respect. We do not think they should have special status, to put it bluntly, given the agenda we know they have. They do not want plan-led development. They see the EU directives and proper planning and development as a block to their ability to make profit from our marine environment. While they might say this is all being done in the name of climate action, it is worth repeating that the most important carbon sink, bar none, is the sea. If we cut off our nose to spite our face in terms of destruction of the marine environment, it will cost us in our fight against climate change and biodiversity protection. That is what this amendment is directed at.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 29, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:“(3) Within 2 months following enactment the Minister shall implement a process to provide for interim protection in the marine environment of the existing NMPF to ensure the designation of marine protected areas in accordance with Article 13(4) of Directive 2008/56/EC is not compromised and notwithstanding anything elsewhere in this Act no Maritime Area Consent or Development Consent shall be granted until that process is completed.”.What we are seeking, and this follows on from the discussion we had earlier, is to establish interim protections pending the review of the national marine planning framework in accordance with Article 13(4) of the marine strategy framework directive. The relevant section states:Programmes of measures established pursuant to this Article shall include spatial protection measures, contributing to coherent and representative networks of marine protected areas, adequately covering the diversity of the constituent ecosystems, such as special areas of conservation pursuant to the Habitats Directive, special protection areas pursuant to the Birds Directive, and marine protected areas as agreed by the Community or Member States concerned in the framework of international or regional agreements to which they are parties.That is the section the amendment refers to and it is about having those interim protections, given there has been, I believe, an acknowledgement that we are behind the curve in terms of the marine protected areas we should have. That is what we are trying to achieve. We do not believe consents for major development of the marine that could damage the marine should be given until such interim protections have been established.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point. If there is an acceptance, which there certainly seems to be from some of the officials we met yesterday, that we are behind the curve in protecting areas and it is likely to be some time before they are protected, then there is a problem with these legacy projects, which will result in large numbers of giant wind turbines placed very close to the shore along the east coast and other coastal areas that will have significant impacts on fisher, and potentially on marine environment biology, biodiversity and so on. If it will be some years before we designate the marine protected areas, how do we know that these should not be marine protected areas?Yet we may issue consents for development. We are where we are, to use that horrible phrase, but can interim measures be taken to ensure these should be marine protected areas in advance of the wider requirement to do so, which we understand will take longer? That is the point. It would be a travesty if industrial development consents for these areas are given out and then we discover afterwards they should have been marine protected areas and we have done damage in the meantime. We are asking for interim measures with a focus on those particular sites to ensure they have the proper level of protection before any development consents are given.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I do not accept the Minister of State's response to our amendment and he has not addressed the substantial point, even if he does not agree technically with the amendment. He has not addressed the substantial point. It seems there is agreement that there will be an interregnum in which we will not have done what we should for marine protected areas with respect to these relevant projects. What is the answer to the question? What happens if we discover later that they should have been designated as protected areas? We are asking for interim measures to be put in place quickly. If this happened and we assessed whether sites should be protected, consents could be issued afterwards. There is an existing regime for foreshore licences and all the rest of it. I do not buy the argument that nothing else can happen. In any case, we are asking for this to be done quickly. We are not suggesting this should go on and on for ages but rather that there be particular interim measures directed at those areas with legacy projects to ensure damage is not done. The Minister of State has not addressed the substantial point but is arguing on a technicality about the amendment. By the way, we are dealing with an absolute glut of legislation, so arguing on a technicality is not really fair. We are meant to be downstairs right now in a committee room dealing with another Bill while this happens in the Dáil Chamber. That is what we are dealing with. A technical sort of argument is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 37, to delete lines 16 to 23 and substitute the following:“(3) Where the Minister ascertains an inconsistency referred to in subsection (2), he or she shall—(a) make a recommendation in writing to the competent authority (D) to amend the draft DMAP to address the inconsistency, or(b) in relation only to an inconsistency in respect of paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (2) give notice in writing to the competent authority (D) of the inconsistency and in that notice state that the draft DMAP does not need to be amended to avoid or mitigate the inconsistency,as the Minister thinks fit in all the circumstances of the case, and shall state their reasons in full for such a decision.”.Section 24(3) of the Bill allows the Minister to okay a designated marine area plan that is, potentially, inconsistent with the MSP directive. Our concern is about such a designated marine area plan, which is like the sub-plans within the wider framework. If there is an inconsistency between those sub-plans and the marine spatial planning directive, it should not be okay and the Minister should not have the power to okay it. Our amendment attempts to deal with that and ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The wording proposed in amendment No. 21 is a little bit gender-specific. There is a little bit of a problem with it. There are other gender identities which this binary gender description does not take into account when setting out the balance required on the board. I ask the Minister of State to consider that. The provision is very binary in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not sure the Minister of State has answered my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Minister of State should consider withdrawing it then because it is quite binary. Rather than having an excessively binary requirement, it may be better not to include the provision. We get the point. We want gender balance but we have to take all gender identities into account. I do not know how that issue can be resolved but, if the Minister of State recognises this as a problem, he should consider what he is going to do about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this amendment No. 21?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry; I am trying to keep up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Fair play to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle but she could not go slow enough for the amount of stuff we have to deal with here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Have we discussed this amendment? I wanted to say something about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 37a:In page 68, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:
“Activities for which an application for a MAC shall not be considered
77. A MAC shall not be granted for any development of the maritime area where such development consists of:(a) an installation for the production of energy by harnessing the power of the wind, within 12 nautical miles of the nearest point of the high water mark, that has—(i) more than 5 turbines, or(ii) a total output of more than 5 megawatts; (b) a development consisting of— (i) prospecting for—(I) minerals (within the meaning of the Minerals Development Act 1940) in accordance with a licence under section 9 or 22 of that Act, or(II) minerals (within the meaning of the Minerals Development Act 2017) in accordance with a licence under section 65 or 102 of that Act,(ii) working (within the meaning of the Minerals Development Act 1940) of such minerals in accordance with a licence under section 9 or 22 of that Act,(iii) working (within the meaning of the Minerals Development Act 2017) of such minerals in accordance with a licence under section 65 or 102 of that Act;(c) a development consisting, or for the purposes, of—(i) a terminal, building or installation ancillary to a natural gas storage facility (either above or below the surface of the water or seabed) the storage capacity of which would exceed 1mscm, or(ii) a terminal, building or installation ancillary to a terminal that is used for the liquefaction of natural gas or the importation, offloading and re-gasification of liquefied natural gas, and ancillary services.”.Our proposed amendment seeks not to allow consideration for a maritime area consent, and consequently for any development consent at all, in respect of three types of activities we think maritime area consents should not be given for. I will go in reverse order. We do not believe that liquefied natural gas, LNG, infrastructure of any description should get maritime area consents because we are supposed to be tackling climate change. We know we must reduce fossil fuel use, and it runs counter to that requirement to entertain the possibility of building new infrastructure to bring liquefied natural gas into this country. We still rely on natural gas, obviously, but to build new infrastructure to import LNG would run counter to the stated commitment of the Government, and indeed of all parties, to reduce fossil fuel use and to combat climate change. Therefore, we think such proposals should simply not be considered for maritime area consents. Similarly, anything to do with the extraction of fossil fuels should not be considered for maritime consents. One of the issues that concerned my community in recent years was the move by Providence Resources to try to drill for oil and gas close to the shore, on the Kish Bank, which is only 6 km to 10 km offshore. There were huge concerns about that potential development on many levels. In addition to local environmental and community concerns, there was also the major issue of the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. In that regard, we should not in any way be facilitating further exploration for or extraction of fossil fuels which damage the environment. We do not believe that any such developments should be considered for maritime area consents. Finally, and perhaps more controversially, but we believe this is in line with the practice in rest of Europe, we are proposing not to consider major industrial offshore wind developments closer to the shore than 12 nautical miles, the traditional foreshore distance, on the grounds that the undoubted general pattern across Europe is to move these big industrial wind farms off to a reasonable distance from the coast. One document I saw from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in Germany stated the average distance for a major industrial development of wind farms in Germany is about 53 km. I also read a document produced by the Crown Estate, the body which represents the British Crown. It was an interesting publication about the development of offshore wind in the UK and the plans there in this regard. The base assumption there, in respect of looking at the costs of developing offshore wind farms, was that they would be developed 60 km offshore. That was the Crown Estate central scenario for looking at costs. It is interesting information when we consider the relevant projects we are worried about getting in under the wire of the marine protected areas. I refer to those areas that should be there and where there are plans for developments, for example, on the Kish Bank in my area and for the Codling Wind Park project further down the Wicklow coast, that are only 6 km to 10 km offshore. Such projects would have a huge impact on those areas. We are talking about objects that are significantly higher than the two Poolbeg chimney stacks, and approximately 60 or 70 of these enormous things will be located in close proximity to the shore. They will impact on fishermen and on a sensitive landscape and seascape that is important on many levels for the community and for Dublin Bay generally as a tourist amenity and precious marine environment. We should be following best practice in Europe, which is to push that scale of industrial development further out to sea to ensure it does not have those negative impacts. I say that as someone who believes that we must urgently develop offshore renewable resources. We must, though, have a buffer zone in place that is similar to the sorts of distances that are now becoming the norm across Europe. I am sure the Minister of State will say that developments are allowed closer to shore in other parts of Europe, but the general pattern is they are being pushed further out to sea. As I said, the document produced by the Crown Estate in Britain used a distance of 60 km as its base assumption, which is roughly ten times further out than the sort of thing being entertained right along our east coast. Therefore, what we are seeking in this sense is a win-win situation. We need offshore wind developments, but we must also protect sensitive coastal environments and the communities, the stakeholders and the people who make a living in those areas. We must also protect the marine biology and biodiversity of those nearshore sites. That is the logic of this amendment. I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State and his officials will be familiar with the Marine Institute’s Real Map of Ireland, but I do not know whether the public is that familiar with it. It begs the point. While I realise the Minister of State said that, in the context of the NMPF, there was public consultation, this was all new to those at the public meeting held in my area, the Save Our Seafront meeting. There are still many people who have not been reached regarding significant changes, plans and objectives for the development of the marine area and how these may affect them. We still have a way to go in terms of the level of engagement with the public if they are to understand fully the issues at stake and which we are discussing here. That is not to diss the engagement the officials have had but we have a long way to go yet. The public needs to know about the Real Map of Ireland and the sheer size of Ireland’s marine area. It is enormous. The size is multiples of that of the land of this country. Therefore, we have a huge resource. That means we have a large area in which to develop offshore wind energy generation. Consequently, I just do not accept the Minister of State’s suggestion that our having a buffer zone involving a required minimum distance from the coast precludes us from developing offshore wind energy generation. I have not heard a convincing response, if any, from the Government or Minister of State as to why, increasingly, the rest of Europe is pushing industrial offshore wind facilities much greater distances out. Judging from the Crown document to which I referred, the central scenario in respect of cost involved a distance of 60 km. In other words, the authors did not see any major difference between 60 km and closer in terms of the cost of development. There is no major cost implication to pushing the industrial wind farms a bit further out so as to have a win–win situation. I refer to harnessing our offshore wind and protecting our coastal environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Nash asked where the threshold of more than five turbines and a total output of more than 5 MW comes from. It comes from Schedule 10 to the Bill. That is a threshold in the Government's Bill for classes of development specified for the purposes of Chapter 3 of Part XXI, the numbering of which gives you some idea of the complexity of this Bill's cross-referencing with the Planning and Development Act. The Minister of State raises interesting points, but I return to my original point, which is that there are many people who will be impacted by these things who have no clue what is going on. I consider myself somebody who keeps an eye on things, who has read into things and who knows a bit, and I do not know the answer to a lot of these questions. I do not know why they have floating wind off the coast of Scotland, for example, yet the Minister of State is telling us it is not really practical. Maybe he knows the answer; I do not, and I would like to know. I would like to know why industrial offshore wind is being moved further and further out in the rest of Europe. I want to hear that debated. The people deserve that debate but there has not been a discussion. What I do know is that corporations have self-selected sites. I repeat: they selected their own sites. We did not plan them. We did not designate them. This was not done under any planning process. They select the sites which are for convenient for them, will be cheap and very profitable for them and will have a big impact on our marine environment and communities. They have selected the sites, so I want protection until this debate is had. Maybe the Minister of State is right and maybe he is not right. I want that discussion about sea depths and the engineering questions and so on. As I said, I read a lot and I am not convinced that there are not reasons they are pushing this stuff out in other parts of Europe. That discussion has not been had, but the developers are moving ahead. What we are looking for in this amendment is some level of protection. LNG terminals and fossil fuel extraction should not be happening - that is a no-brainer. There should be no maritime area consents because you cannot do the development unless you get a MAC, if I am right. That is the point about starting at the MAC. If you do not get a MAC, you do not get the development.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an assertion; it is not an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the difference between "prescribed" and "specified"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Minister of State care to elaborate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was very enlightening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We oppose this amendment. Section 96(6)(a) of the Bill, as it stands, provides that within six months of being granted the development permission, a MAC holder must produce a rehabilitation schedule and thereby put a place a plan to restore the area when the work has finished. This amendment, as we read it, will mean that the MAC holder will only have to produce the rehabilitation schedule three months before undertaking development. This could allow for sea hoarding and sea flipping, as happens with land development. A developer could get a MAC and development permission, then do all that is allowed under the MAC but not start the development, which would allow for surveys, etc., that would increase of the value of the site. The developer could then flip it and never even have to look at restoring the area at all. That is our concern with the amendment. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response and why the Government has introduced this change to the original Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our concern is that this amendment will facilitate the practice I have just outlined. This is a loophole that could potentially be exploited by the big developers. We could get a phenomenon at sea that we see very frequently on land. In the way this amendment is framed, there is a loophole that developers could potentially exploit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not entirely happy with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 95, line 33, to delete “damages.” and substitute “damages, but such undertakings shall not be prohibitively expensive.”The Bill does not treat a maritime area consent, MAC, as being environmental in the same way as a development consent. We are concerned about that. As I said on our earlier amendment, if one does not have a MAC, one cannot do anything. One thing leads on to another. The Government and the officials will say that a MAC only gives a right to occupy. It is, however, also a first step on the road, without which one cannot do anything else that comes afterwards. We are dealing with new legislation and we are in new territory. As one thing can lead onto another, we are not convinced that the assertion that a MAC does not have an environmental impact is necessarily going to be the case. I am not saying that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is being disingenuous but we are in new territory. We are setting up a process where we do not quite know how it is going to play out. Therefore, potentially, MACs will have a significant impact and people may wish to challenge the granting of a MAC and take judicial reviews against the granting of a MAC. If they do, they will not get the protection that one would get under the Aarhus Convention for things that are deemed to have an environmental impact, because this Bill does not consider the MAC as having an environmental impact. One would not get those protections and could be screwed, to use a colloquialism, for costs and discouraged from doing it. The Aarhus Convention gives some protection when a person takes a judicial review on the grounds of environmental impact. The amendments we are putting in try to ensure that people are protected against major costs when they seek a judicial review against a decision to grant a maritime area consent, MAC. Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle please remind me of the amendments we are discussing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Trying to keep up with this is difficult, but it is important. That is the problem: there is a lot to deal with in a very short time. I particularly want to draw attention to amendment No. 44 and the application for judicial review by a body or organisation the aims or objectives of which relate to the promotion of environmental protection. Such NGOs and so on which have knowledge and expertise in that area should have locus standi or the right to take judicial review and be deemed to have sufficient interest so there would not be barriers to them seeking judicial reviews on maritime area consents. This is a further attempt to ensure that the granting of MAC's does not compromise our marine environment and allows those concerned with its protection to challenge decisions to grant maritime area consents. That is general thrust of this group of amendments. I may come back in the second round. Deputy Gould may feel free to come in on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is all about access to justice and the right of concerned parties and particularly NGOs which would have a particular concern about the potential impact of human activity or development in the marine area if consents are given and decisions are made which they think could be detrimental to that part of the marine environment. That access to justice is important. I do not really buy the narrative that we often hear, especially from the developers on land, that the big problem is all of the people who object. This is even though the developers get multiple planning permissions and in many cases they either do bad development or they do not bother developing at all.I do not buy the narrative that giving people the right to object and to go to court is a problem. It is imperative that people have access to justice in matters that have an impact on their environment, in this case the marine environment. I do not see the month issue as a problem. It is about facilitating groups of people who may come together in the context of a particular proposed development. Until something is proposed, many people do not know it is coming and may not have organised themselves, but they may have legitimate concerns about it and establish themselves in response to that. I do not have a problem with that and I do not see the concerns the Minister of State suggests. This is about trying to not have the chilling effect of costs potentially being unloaded on people who seek justice, particularly when, most of the time, they will be dealing with big corporations or big commercial interests that have plenty of money, plenty of legal wherewithal and so on. What we are trying to do is ensure they have that right of recourse. As I said, we do not accept the Bill's position on the MAC, or the right to occupy, even if it does not allow for development. We think it could have displacement effects on that particular area and, therefore, have environmental impacts. Therefore, we believe those access to justice provisions and to have no deterrence to that are legitimate and vital requests on our part.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What time do we finish?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case, we will press the amendments at this stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 44:In page 96, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:“Locus Standi in environmental MAC cases and in proceedings to which Part 2 applies110. For the avoidance of doubt where the applicant for judicial review under this Chapter, or under Part 2, is-(a) a body or organisation (other than a State authority, a public authority or governmental body or agency) the aims or objectives of which relate to the promotion of environmental protection, and(b) has, during the period of 1 month preceding the date of the application, pursued those aims or objectives,it shall have locus standi to pursue the judicial review and be deemed to have sufficient interest.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can boil down the argument of the Minister to there being one law for the rich and one law for the rest. That is actually what SARP amounts to. People who earn more than €70,000 - quite a few of these people earn millions of euro a year - get a special and very substantial tax break on their enormous earnings which ordinary workers do not get. Such people also get tax relief on sending their kids to private schools. We are doing this because if we did not these people would not come here. We will throw tax justice out of the window because of our fear, or blackmail, if we like, on the part of people who say they will not come to our country and bring investment along with them unless Ireland gives them a special tax deal which no other ordinary worker will get. We have to give into that and, essentially, have a different tax code and special tax deals for these super rich executives. What about all the nurses who leave because they cannot afford to live here? Where is the special tax break for them, given that we do not have enough of them? What about all of the other allied health professionals, including doctors, who leave because their earnings are not enough to put a roof over their heads due to sky high rents? People on very high salaries are contributing to this because we build accommodation for very wealthy, rather than ordinary, people. If we want to put this in terms of competition, we are losing out on a lot of the skills we desperately need because people feel it is not worth their while to stay here. We get high flying executives who are, let us be honest, greedy enough that, on top of their extraordinary salaries, they want additional tax relief, while a lot of our people whom we have put public money into educating and training are leaving. There are no special deals for them to keep them here. It is gross tax inequity at every level and it is literally the embodiment of there being one tax law for the super rich and one law for the rest of us.It is obnoxious. Whatever arguments the Minister might make, I do not see how one can get around that question of inequity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is fine. I have made the point and I made it extensively on Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We tabled this amendment because we believe in tax justice. We believe in an equitable distribution of wealth and income which we are a very long way from. The Minister says we would not get these people whom we need and we would not be competitive given the tax breaks that these incredibly well-paid executives can get elsewhere and therefore we need to do the same. I do not know the chronology of which of the countries the Minister mentioned introduced these tax reliefs first. However, I certainly believe we have helped spearhead where others have followed a certain model which is to attract investment on the basis of cutting taxes on the profits of corporations and now on the income of high-flying executives. To my mind that is a race to the bottom and somebody pays for it. The distribution of wealth around the world is ever-more concentrated in the hands of the CEOs and top executives of a relatively small number of corporations. I am talking about staggering wealth in the billions and tens of billions of euro. It is beyond comprehension and it gathers apace. It is because of the notion that unless we make them pay little or no tax, whether it is on their income or on their profits, we cannot have a viable economy and therefore we must do it. From the point of view of ordinary people that is a zero-sum game where we will lose. The 99% of ordinary people, the butcher, the baker, the nurse, the street cleaner and pretty much everybody, are losing out and ultimately will lose out by that approach which I fundamentally reject. In all sincerity, I ask the Minister to think about all the really special people. He can say these people are special people, have special skills or whatever it is. However, to my mind the student nurses, 70% of whom say they will leave the country after they are qualified, are just as special. The construction workers who go to Australia when we need them are just as special and they are not getting these kinds of breaks. It is fundamentally unfair.
