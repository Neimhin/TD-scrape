RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In June, NESC produced a paper called "How We Value Work: The Impact of Covid-19". One of the conclusions it drew is that Covid-19 has made good jobs better and poor jobs worse. That is an extremely interesting conclusion and the paper featured a fascinating graph, which I would be interested to know if the Taoiseach has seen. The graph shows that the people least impacted by Covid-19 tend to be the best paid people with the best ability to work remotely and so on. They are also less economically affected. The worst impacted and least remunerated are the people we have depended on most. There is a great deal to be said about this and how we have failed to reward those who have carried and will carry us through the restrictions. One of the most damning examples is that of healthcare workers. They are subject to the highest risk and many of them are among the lowest rewarded. A shocking example of this, although there are multiple examples, was the case of nurses who applied under the Be On Call for Ireland campaign being put on agency contracts, to which unfair dismissal protections and sick pay do not apply. As I revealed last week, contact tracers were placed on zero-hour contracts. A few hours after I exposed this, we were told that it was a mistake, even though it was all over their contracts. Even if it was a mistake, which it was not, unfair dismissal protections and sick pay do not apply to contact tracing workers. It is no wonder we do not have the contact tracers to get on top of the virus. Another egregious example is that of student nurses, who because of protest, were given healthcare assistant pay in March and April but who are working for nothing again. Thousands of student nurses who are effectively working as nurses and care assistants are not getting a red cent. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, suggests that, such is the exploitation of this group of student nurses, the HSE does not bother to directly recruit permanent healthcare assistants, which we desperately need. It can rely on the slave student nurses who also cannot do other work to boost their incomes because Covid-19 restrictions would mean they would be carrying infections into the hospitals, which they are effectively holding together in many cases while getting nothing. This is unacceptable. This is fighting Covid-19 on the cheap, which will not succeed. This is a big part of the reason we are in this mess, with the levels of infections we have. We have not directly recruited for proper jobs in the HSE. The nurses, healthcare assistants and other healthcare workers who are most at threat from Covid-19 are getting little financially and, in some cases, nothing. Is the Government going to do something about this? Will it make sure these student nurses are paid and rewarded? Will it deal with the issue of proper recruitment to quality jobs for the front-line workers on whom we depend?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A mortgage break has to happen. It is absolutely unacceptable that the people who will be hit hardest by the lockdown in economic terms, losing either income or employment, will then also potentially have some of the banks crawling all over their backs, adding to the pressure and stress they face. When people talk about protecting mental health, let us be clear what that means in many cases. Often mental health is about the stress of not being able to pay one's mortgage, rent or bills and the uncertainty of possibly losing one's home. There is nothing that will damage one's mental health more than that. If we are all in it together, the Taoiseach has to act with might and main to ensure that the banks do not crawl all over people's backs or load up debts during the coming period. If we can bring in emergency legislation to bail out banks, as we did a few years ago, we can bring in emergency legislation or do whatever is necessary in order to tell the banks they will not load up debt or harass people during possibly one of the most difficult periods in their lives. The Government has to do this; otherwise, it will wreck the sense of social solidarity we need. Similarly, simply reimposing the ban on evictions during level 5 restrictions is not good enough because it will mean that notices to quit can be issued and then, four or five weeks before Christmas, there will be a slew of evictions. That is totally unacceptable, so the Taoiseach has to do something about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need decent contracts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is cheap labour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to NESC's report, it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government refers to the need to address the issues that arise out of cases similar to the Debenhams case and to protect workers who have been impacted during Covid. Earlier, the Taoiseach effectively refused to answer the question Deputy Barry put to him. That question, by the way, came directly from the shop stewards and they want to know his answer because it is very important facing into the next number of weeks. They want to know if the Taoiseach will state clearly that the removal of goods by KPMG from a retail outlet over the next six weeks would breach public health guidelines. The Taoiseach needs to be explicit. KPMG need to hear that that is the case so that the workers do not have to worry during the imminent period of level 5 restrictions about round the clock picketing to prevent the removal of those goods. Will the Taoiseach state that in order to be clear? To me it is obviously the case but there needs to be no ambiguity from the point of view of the workers or KPMG. Second, will the Taoiseach commit, as I, together with Deputies Barry, McDonald and so on have asked, to convene a meeting with KPMG, the shop stewards, and the unions to try to resolve this dispute and save 1,000 mostly women workers yet more hardship, uncertainty and anxiety? Will he use his offices to try to resolve this in a just way? The Taoiseach should do this for their sake. The least he could do is organise a meeting of that sort.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Get them all in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach clarify whether the removal of goods is not compliant?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is non-essential retail.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is liquidation part of level 5?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The resignation in April of the President of the European Research Council, Professor Mauro Ferrari, over what he deemed to be the really desperate failure of the EU, of which he was a big fan before taking the job, to respond effectively to Covid-19 was a pretty damning move that should raise questions. I have not heard a lot in the Taoiseach's contribution or more generally about the EU's response to Covid-19. If we consider a variety of countries around the world with a variety of regimes, including Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Iceland, we realise the failure of the Union to act both collectively and as individual member states in any sort of cohesive, focused, effective way regarding Covid-19 is quite telling. Professor Ferrari hoped the European Research Council would set up a body specifically to address Covid-19 and research all sorts of areas, including strategy, the development of a vaccine and therapies, but this was essentially shot down. It is quite telling. After the budget announcement, I mentioned an extraordinary point that may have been lost, which is that the health research budget for 2021 is not a single cent greater than that for 2020. It is an extraordinary fact but it bears out Professor Ferrari's point on the complete lack of a strategy. We have argued for a zero-Covid strategy. Although the Government disagrees with that, should these matters not be debated in a serious way and should scientists not be given the resources to develop their understanding, data and information so we can make informed choices about how to deal with this pandemic? That does not seem to be happening, which is quite a damning indictment of the failure of the EU.
