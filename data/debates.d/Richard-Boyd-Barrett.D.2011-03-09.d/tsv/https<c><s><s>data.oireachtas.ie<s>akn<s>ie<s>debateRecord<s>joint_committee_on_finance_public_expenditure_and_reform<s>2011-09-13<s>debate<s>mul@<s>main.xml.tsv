RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to put my questions and points in the order in which the Minister introduced his statement.  For clarification on the role of the Minister, it was recently reported in newspapers that he had urged Ministers to do better in identifying €11 billion in cuts, not just the €3.6 billion that was initially indicated would be required in the budget for the programme for Government.  This was possibly with a view to ramping up or front loading the austerity, fiscal rectitude and so on.  There has been much speculation about this, as I am sure the Minister is aware.Is that what we understand the job of the Minister to be?  Is he the whip hand or the Minister for austerity for imposing the cuts?  Is he the guy who goes to the Minister for Health if he is not cutting the health budget enough and tells him he has to cut more, as well as social welfare, and so on?  I want to understand his role clearly.  Could he comment on the suggestion that he wants front loading of austerity to ramp up from €3.6 billion to a higher amount for the current budget?  Has consideration been given to increasing the amount of austerity to be imposed in this budget?  Can he explain the logic behind considering that?It would appear that the logic which is being proposed to justify that is that it will give confidence to the markets about our fiscal responsibility and so on, help us get back into the private bond markets and is why we might consider imposing even more austerity in the budget.  Is that the logic which is operating or being considered by the Minister and Government?  It is utterly misguided to consider having more austerity to assuage the feelings of the markets who caused this problem in the first place.On the macroeconomic picture to which the Minister referred and his commitment to fiscal austerity, setting aside the slightly childish comments about Trotsky and so on-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could point out that the leader of the Minister's party swanned around with Stalinist dictators in eastern Europe and expounded them as a model we should follow in this country-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	------but most of the time we do not.  Whatever failings Deputy Higgins and I have, at least we were always opposed to those brutal dictatorships.On a more serious note, could the Minister comment on the growing challenge being put to the austerity consensus from mainstream institutions and commentators across the globe as well as in this country?  I ask him to comment in particular on the report of the UN Conference on Trade and Development which has lambasted the policy of austerity being imposed by this Government and other governments in developed countries.  Has the Minister read the report or does he intend to?  It would make for sobering reading and would be something this Government should at least consider because it is categoric and not ambiguous in what it says about the policies the Government, the EU and the IMF are pursuing.  It says fiscal tightening is self-defeating, especially in the most developed economies which were severely hit by the financial crisis, and that fiscal imbalances were not a driving factor of the crisis but were rather a result of the crisis and, consequently, focusing on fiscal imbalances is getting things the wrong way round.The report also says that public bailouts of financial institutions accounted for a large portion of the deficit, reflecting a conversion from private debt to public.  In other words, the fiscal imbalances result from the bank bailout and it is those things that have to be addressed.I ask the Minister to consider what the report says.  It says that public opinion and policymakers should not trust again those institutions - it refers to the markets - including ratings agencies, to judge what constitutes sound macroeconomic policies and management of the public finances.  It goes on to say we should have stimulus and growth focused policies, not austerity.  Will the Minister read that report?  Could we get some feedback over the coming days?  There is no serious discussion of the alternative economic strategy for dealing with the current economic crisis.  We seem to be blindly following an austerity consensus, like lemmings charging over a cliff.  The public at least deserves a proper debate on it and serious comment on the alternative analysis that is now being put forward by the UN, among others.To what extent is the Minister responsible for ensuring State assets are sold?  Has the EU and IMF, at any stage in discussing the need for the sale of State assets in this country and elsewhere as part of imposing fiscal rectitude and so on, explained precisely the logic behind it?  I and, I suspect, most of the public, would like to know what it is.  Some of us might like or dislike it but I would like somebody to explain why it is a good idea.  Naive and simplistic as I am, I do not understand how selling a successful company such as the ESB, the possibility of which is being discussed, can be a good thing in terms of gearing our economy up for possible future economic recovery.  It is at least arguable that companies like the ESB and Bord na Móna might be things we should hold onto and invest in because they could be key drivers of economic growth rather than selling them off.  How does this benefit us?  Even the amount of money we would get from the sale of some or part of them is derisory in the context of the debt.  What precisely is the purpose?  Some of us suspect it is just asset stripping and using the current financial difficulties of the State to grab the most lucrative parts of natural resources and State assets.  Could the Minister comment on that?  It is a real concern.I want clarity from the Minister on public service numbers.  Until the beginning of the first quarter of this year, approximately the same time the Minister's party came into Government, 16,000 public sector workers had left, mostly through the public sector recruitment embargo.  Can the Minister clarify whether the 25,000 figure he mentioned involves 9,000 or 25,000 more?  Does the total of 25,000 include the 16,000 or will 41,000 public sector workers leave?  There is a large difference between those figures.  Can the Minister explain, if it is the latter, as I fear it is, how on earth he can talk about better public services for less if such high numbers are being taken out of our public services?Focusing in particular on the health area, 6,000 public sector health workers have left.  There is an obvious equation between this and the fact that the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and senior consultants said this week that hospital and health services simply cannot take any more cuts and are crumbling as a result of the lack of staff and personnel.  Apart from anywhere else, imposing further cuts in numbers in the health service is guaranteed to cause a catastrophe there.The Minister talked about value for money.  My experience is anecdotal based on my experience in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, but I expect it is repeated throughout the country.  As the number of directly employed public service workers declines because of the recruitment embargo and so on, local authorities and Departments need to take on contractors and consultants to fill the gap.  I was shocked to discover that in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council out of a total budget of €220 million for 2010, €140 million was going to consultants and private contractors.  It puts into some context waste in the public sector when so much public spending is going directly into the private sector into the pockets of consultants and contractors.  Are we considering whether we are getting value for money for this?When I asked my local authority for an evaluation of these people, what work they did for the local authority and if any assessment was done of whether the local authority could have done it better if it had done it directly, it could not give the answer because it did not have the resources to do so.  There seems to be a consensus acceptance that somehow private is better.  While that may sometimes be the case, there is considerable anecdotal evidence that in areas like the health service the replacement of directly employed workers by contractors is not better.  One might say that the incidence of MRSA in our hospitals might have something to do with the fact that in recent years directly employed cleaners have been progressively replaced by private contractors with no loyalty to the hospitals.  As they are just brought in and out they are not as concerned as directly employed employees would be about the hygiene and health standards in hospitals.May I also ask-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is definitely my last point.  One issue is really irking me and I wish to know whether the Minister has any role in it.  The new housing policy being initiated by a Labour Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, is that we will now end direct social housing provision and replace it with leasing arrangements.  We will engage in long-term leasing arrangements, presumably with NAMA or NAMA developers, to provide social housing.  I would like somebody to explain how this is good value for money.  At the very least I ask the Minister to seriously examine whether it is a good value for money exercise.  When we already pour €500,000 in rent allowance payments into the pockets of private landlords - revenue that would be coming back to the State if they were in council-provided houses - how can it possibly be good value for money for the State to pour even more money under these new arrangements into the pockets of bankrupt developers when we will not even own the housing at the end of these leasing arrangements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform if it is his job-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not go longer than Deputy Fleming did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am on my last point.  Is it not the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to assess whether this is good value for money because it seems to me to be clearly bad value for money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should increase taxes on the wealthy and not pay off the bondholders.  It should put the people, who are currently doing nothing and are on social welfare, back to work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are paying them to do nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should top it up a little with the money-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should not pay the bondholders.
