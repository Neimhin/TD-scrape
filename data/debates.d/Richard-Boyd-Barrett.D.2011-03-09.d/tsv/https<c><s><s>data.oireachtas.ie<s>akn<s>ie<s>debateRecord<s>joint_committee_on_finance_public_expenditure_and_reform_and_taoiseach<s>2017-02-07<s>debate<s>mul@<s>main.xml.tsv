RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is absolutely right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nobody here is casting any aspersions on the 150,000 workers who work in the multinationals that operate here. Nobody has suggested that any such aspersions should be cast. It is a complete red herring. I would like to pick up on a line of questioning from earlier in this meeting. Apple is a member of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland. Does Mr. Redmond have any reason to believe the representatives of Apple were telling lies to the Senate congressional committee? Would it not be a serious matter if members of the chamber of commerce swore under oath and lied to a Senate congressional committee? Would Mr. Redmond's assumption be that his members told the truth at the Senate congressional hearing when they said they believed there was a special tax arrangement with Ireland and when Tim Cook said there was a special tax incentive scheme? Does Mr. Redmond have any reason to believe they were stating anything other than the truth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, but how-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think that is a consistent answer because even though this issue is now the subject of legal proceedings, Mr. Redmond was quite happy a moment ago to say he believes that what Revenue told this committee was correct, while refusing to say that he believes what Apple said to the Senate congressional committee was correct. Why is he willing to quote an argument that suits Apple and to confirm his belief in the veracity of what was said by Revenue here, while at the same time being unwilling to confirm his belief in the veracity of what representatives of Apple - members of the chamber of commerce - told the Senate congressional committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Representatives of Apple told the congressional committee that there was a deal, but when they subsequently discovered that this statement might cost the company €13 billion, they suddenly concluded that there was no deal and decided to fight it in court. Could Mr. Redmond forgive a poor layperson looking at this for believing that it stretches their intelligence and their credulity? Is it not a bit hard for people to get their heads around?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I think any reasonable person looking at it would say the company has been caught with its pants down. It said something it believed to be true at the time, but it decided to backtrack on that at a later point when it discovered that it was going to cost it dearly. I think that is what any reasonable person looking at this would conclude. We will move on. I think the point has been made. Professor Stewart said that in 2011, Apple Sales International, with "no employees, no fixed assets and income of $22 billion" paid €10 million in tax. This equates to a tax rate of 0.045%, or less than half of 1%. The company cannot have many overheads if it has no employees and no office. I want to clarify that it has no legal tax residence anywhere in the world. Regardless of the merits of the current case - I am not asking about them - do Mr. Redmond and Mr. Keegan consider that the facts I have outlined are acceptable? Is it acceptable that a company could make $22 billion in revenue while having no overheads and paying less than 1% in tax? Leaving aside the issue of Ireland, do Mr. Keegan and Mr. Redmond believe that to be morally acceptable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I am asking Mr. Keegan about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With due respect, I heard Mr. Keegan's opinion on this issue very clearly earlier in this meeting. He said he believes the Commission is interfering and has made the wrong call on this matter. We get that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With due respect, the issues that Mr. Keegan is willing to address, although Mr. Redmond will not, are the subject of the legal case. Mr. Keegan has given his opinion but the issues are the subject of a legal case. Dr. Stewart has made the opposite argument that legally the profits accrue to Ireland. Opinions may differ but the matter will be adjudicated by the European Court of Justice. I did not ask Mr. Keegan about that matter and suggest we leave it to the European Court of Justice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Keegan's work involves tax matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Keegan think it is morally acceptable that a company can earn €22 billion in one year yet pay less than 1% tax, wherever that tax might be paid?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The companies that I have just referred to are legally tax resident nowhere in the world. We can debate whether they should be. I believe that if they are incorporated here then they should be taxed here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The companies are tax resident nowhere. Mr. Keegan's argument is a bit spurious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Keegan think it is acceptable-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Genuinely, I do not mean to be rude and I appreciate the answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I only have a short time to ask questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If what Mr. Keegan has said is true, does that mean he is strongly in favour of, as Dr. Stewart has rightly argued here for, a common consolidated corporate tax base? The Government is resistant to or at least suspicious of the idea. Does Mr. Keegan agree we need a method to take account of where we allocate profits?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Successive Irish Governments have resisted doing so because they know it is not in their interest-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or have perceived it as not being in their interest because they knew and know that companies have used this country as a tax haven.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the reality. It is the dirty secret that everybody knew. Successive Irish Governments knew these companies used Ireland as a tax haven but it suited them to say nothing, to resist efforts by others such as Oxfam and academics like Dr. Stewart and others who pointed out this reality and to say "nothing to see here".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is almost up so I shall ask the two Jims, that is, Mr. Clarken and Dr. Stewart, a few questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not say that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but we can continue our debate on another day. I commend Mr. Clarken and Dr. Stewart on the work of their organisations and their individual work in this whole area. Would Mr. Clarken from Oxfam agree it is fair to say that the major contributing factor to the staggering level of inequality he has identified in his recent report about eight people owning the same wealth as half the world's population is corporations that do not want to pay tax? I know there are lots of contributory factors. Would Mr. Clarken say that is the major contributing factor? What does he think we will be faced with if we do not address the problem in a serious manner in terms of redistributing the wealth that has become heavily concentrated at the top?  I shall ask Dr. Stewart a question as I am out of time. Perhaps both witnesses can answer together. I have read the TASC seminar report put together by Dr. Stewart and Mr. Cillian Doyle on the section 110 issue to which Dr. Stewart alluded earlier. The report is brilliant and quite shocking. Dr. Stewart has said that 2,500 financial vehicle corporations, FVCs, could be benefitting from the provisions of section 110, which essentially is a scheme whereby no tax is paid on assets worth hundreds of billions of euro. If I have understood correctly what Dr. Stewart said - I ask him to confirm and elaborate slightly - there is little or no regulation on this area and there is not even joined-up thinking between the Central Bank and Revenue in terms of getting information on these firms. Dr. Stewart cited a range of stockbrokers, financial organisations, etc. that tout Ireland as a country without financial regulation and in which virtually no tax is paid on assets worth hundreds of billions of euro. I ask him to comment further on that point. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Clarken.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I thank Dr. Stewart.
