RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will be dealing with them later, but we have proposed amendments, apropos some of the discussion we are having, to the effect that if even 1% of an investment is in Irish property, it should be subject to this tax and, we argue, more. The rate of withholding tax should be in the region of 90%, not 20%. The logic behind it is that there has been a really disastrous error on the part of the Government which encouraged speculation in property with the consequences it is belatedly and rather tokenistically trying to address with this amendment. Why should there be tax breaks or exemptions from capital gains tax other than active discouragement of speculation in property? Is the fact that the Government has had to bring forward this amendment not a belated acknowledgment of the disastrous mistake it made? Surely we should be trying to do absolutely everything to turn back the clock, to scotch completely and in every way possible the impact of speculation of a very conscious decision on the part of Government to inflate property values in order to get the banks back into business and NAMA to wash its face. Can the Minister of State tell me if that is the case? Was that the thinking behind it?  I remember when the issue of REITs first came up. I was a member of the finance committee when the various QIAIFs, ICAVs and so on were included in the Finance Bill. As a new Deputy, it was difficult to trawl through this stuff that really only a tax lawyer could understand. Frankly, anyone watching this will not have the foggiest notion what we are talking about. That was the problem in 2013. Were the REITs brought forward in 2013? The ICAVs were brought forward in 2014. In both cases I did not fully understand the details. In the case of the REITs, I was the first and only one to say it because no one even knew what they were. We had spent about ten hours talking about the Finance Bill. That was part of the problem. My head was fried and then the issue of the tax break for REITs came up. I asked the Minister what they were. I asked: "What the hell is this?" It was a tax break for real estate investment and I cannot remember what the Minister said to justify it at the time. I think he used words to the effect that there would not be much money involved and not much tax would be forgone. I must look back at the transcript to see exactly what he said at the time. The country needs to know how much tax has been forgone as a result. Is there an acknowledgement on the part of Government that the introduction of these measures was an utterly disastrous mistake that led to the unbelievable escalation in property prices and rents and, as a consequence, an unprecedented homelessness crisis? Is the amendment not good enough because it is closing the door after the horse has bolted and when there is actually an opportunity to do something? We should try to grab as much of the profits from the speculators as we possibly can before they make off with all of the money. The Chairman did not interrupt anybody else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman was shaking his head as if he was-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not a problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had more or less concluded. Why were these tax breaks introduced for property investors and speculators in the first place? I still do not understand why it was done. Is there a recognition at this point that it was a mistake? I may have asked this through tabling parliamentary questions, as has Deputy Donnelly. Do we have any idea of how much tax was forgone as a result of the tax breaks in capital gains and in tax on profits and so on that these property investors made since they were introduced? It is criminal if we do not know. On the 25% threshold, why do we need a threshold? The Minister of State has said that the majority of these property investment entities or vehicles will have more than 25% and so most of them will be captured. Will the Minister of State supply the evidence to back that up? What will be captured? What assets do they have? What proportion of this sector do they represent? What will not be captured? This would give us some sense of what we might be gaining or losing as a consequence of the 25% threshold. Does the Minister of State have any comment on our view that we should just capture? Given that property values have gone through the roof, should we not try to recoup as much of the increase in value of these property assets that they will walk away with? If they hold on for five years, they could all sell at the end of the five years, which as Deputy Pearse Doherty has suggested, in some cases is now about six months away. They will walk away with 80% of the appreciation in the value of those assets. Why should we let them do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is 100% so there is no capital gains tax. They will walk away with all of the value of that appreciation of Irish property assets that they bought worth billions of euro, and we are going to let them do it. I do not understand the rationale for that. Does the Minister of State not think we should not allow that to happen and rather we should grab it all, or a very big portion of it, and at least apply the normal taxes that would be paid by any other business on the profits and capital gains, if not much higher taxes given what is happening in the property sector and the disastrous situation with the affordability of property?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask one question on that. I will come back on the generality of the issue later. If one of these funds does not distribute dividends but uses any income it derives on the investment in property, could it then buy more property with that, and because it is not being distributed to the investor, it would not be taxed? As long as the extra income it is generating from rent stays within the vehicle, that money could be used to buy more property and that would not be taxed. Am I right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely shocking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anybody else who bought a property and gets rent from it pays tax on it. However, these big investment entities can come in, buy lots of property and get extortionate rents, and as long as they do not make a distribution to the investor, they can use the revenue they are generating to buy even more property and jack the rents up even more.If they hold on to it for five years, at the end of that time they can walk away with all the value of the property. Given the amount of property these vehicles own, that value is probably expanding and expanding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister of State have evidence for that statement?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point relates to what happens if they hang on to the fund for five years or for a period beyond five years. Given what is happening with rents at the moment, they must be making a fortune at present. If they are not distributing those moneys, and if they are holding on to the fund without selling it beyond the five-year period, they must be able to use those moneys to buy even more assets. Given what is happening with the inflated value of these assets, they could be using that money to increase and increase the amount of property they own and walk away with all the capital gains. That is a recipe for the complete hoovering up of property, which is what appears to be happening. They are walking away with staggering sums of money. It is just unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only at the point at which they pay-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is clear that we have differing views. To be honest, the technical sort of answer we are being given is not really getting to the heart of the point. When one looks at this stuff, one sometimes thinks that money is being made out of fresh air for guys who have to pay 20% capital gains tax, or no capital gains tax at all if they hold on to their assets for longer than five years. Where is all this money coming from? I will tell the Minister of State where it is coming from. It is coming from the extortionate rents they are charging. That is where it is coming from. It is coming from the pricing out of the market of vast numbers of our citizens and small businesses that cannot afford these rents. In light of what is happening and what has happened over the past four or five years, I cannot believe we are not realising we have made a big mistake here. We need to grab as much of it as we can back to undo some of the damage we have caused. We need to close down all the speculation in property we have incentivised through these structures, with disastrous consequences for the property and housing sector. That is my view. That is why we are trying in a limited way with these amendments to shut this thing down and grab as much as possible. Does the Minister of State not see any value in what I am saying here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Minister of State that we are not finding that balance. We have really messed up in the area of property. I put it to the Minister of State that this tokenistic measure will not undo the damage that has been done. Obviously, we disagree on this issue. I would like to ask a couple of questions about other issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They reinvest the profits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not see it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I have said, it is shocking if this is what is going on. I suspect that it is. I have another couple of questions. The withholding tax does not apply to certain other collective investment undertakings. The Minister of State has mentioned life assurance and pension funds, etc., in this context. Can he tell us what other collective investment undertakings this tax does not apply to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Wow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State saying it happens at the point when the transfer from the REIT to one of these other entities takes place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any of the entities referred to by the Minister of State could have an interest in property. I am trying to understand this. Entities might be investing in property, but the unit trusts or those bodies in the lists referred to by the Minister of State are not subject to withholding tax. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Minister of State is talking about, but I am asking which categories are not liable for withholding tax. The Minister of State has listed them. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State referring to a transfer from an IREF to one of the other entities? Is that what he means?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if these entities and unit trusts were never IREFs but were involved in property? That is my question. Is that possible?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is there an exception? I do not understand it. Why does the Minister of State's note indicate that it will not apply to them? The note in the explanatory memorandum states: "The withholding tax will not apply to certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings." What are these other collective investment undertakings? I think the Minister of State has just listed them. I want to know why withholding tax does not apply to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can agree on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think I understand, but I am not entirely sure of it. I understand that the amendment refers to any entity that has 25% invested or that could be deemed to be in some way related to property. If that is the case, then the withholding tax applies. Then we have another category to which, we are told, unless I have misunderstood what is being said, withholding tax does not apply. What the Minister of State seems to be saying is that if there were any chicanery from the IREF, as defined in the amendment, whereby it attempted to transfer to another entity, then it would be caught. Is that what the Minister of State is saying? I am asking something different. I am asking about the exempt categories.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a simple question. Does a unit trust that has interest in property pay the tax? The Minister of State listed unit trusts among the examples. Are they going to pay withholding tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think I have made all my points but I have one last question which is more generally on withholding tax on things other than property. Are there other areas in financial services generally where we should be imposing withholding tax or where similar situations could arise? We have discovered how some entities ended up paying no tax at all. Now, this has been identified in the area of property that they were paying no tax. Should the principle of withholding tax apply to all investment in financial services regardless of whether they relate to property or anything else or where there is a possibility that no tax is being paid?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or Cyprus.
