RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Ward for raising this important motion and addressing this important issue. Many have cited the enormous need, mostly unmet, for mental health services and the unacceptable circumstances in which thousands of people are waiting for assessments of need much longer than the three months within which they are supposed to be assessed by right and the three months thereafter, within which they are supposed to get services. People are waiting many months and sometimes for more than a year to get the services. Indeed, they do not get them at all in some cases. Two thousand five hundred children are waiting for CAMH services and 8,893 children are waiting for primary care psychology. As of January 2021, 3,345 adults have been waiting for counselling treatment. There is a lack of 24-7 emergency services. Reports indicate the effects of the lack of services, staff and so on. There is a report in one newspaper today — I have heard many stories of this — that refers to the overmedicating of children to compensate for the lack of psychology services, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy. These problems become worse because there is no early intervention. Without assessment and services at a young age, these problems become intractable, permanent problems that cost the individuals affected far more when they get older and cost our society in general far more. The point on eating disorders has been made by others. My office was talking to one of the young women whose story has been circulated. Her eating disorder is so severe and she is begging to get into hospital but you literally cannot do so unless you are at death's door or have the money to go private. Shockingly, millions of euro are allocated but not actually spent. The money for eating disorder services, not having been spent initially, has been suspended. The point I want to make on all this, which others have rehearsed, is that there is a desperate, urgent need for these services that has been magnified by Covid, resulting in a 66% increase in eating disorders, for example.What do we need to address these issues? We need trained professionals. One would think, given the desperate need for these services, that we would be doing everything to train professionals. I made this point to the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago in regard to psychologists in particular. Are we making it easier for people to become qualified and to get doctorates in psychology? No, quite the opposite. We are making it very difficult, with MA fees of between €8,000 and €15,000, such that many people who study for MA degrees do so in the Netherlands because it is cheaper to do it there. Then, when a student has got through that, he or she has to complete a certain number of placement hours, which is very difficult to do, and there is the cost of travelling on placement, which may be unpaid such as in the case of student nurses and midwives. If someone wants to study for a doctorate in counselling and educational psychology, there is no funding whatsoever. Students have to pay €15,000 in fees per year for three years and work an unpaid placement, which is nearly full time, as well as doing all the study, seeing clients and so on. People who are trying to study educational and counselling psychology are living in poverty and many of them drop out. About 45% of students training to be psychologists say they want to leave the country altogether, such are the horrendous conditions. In clinical psychology, there is some funding but the number of places is pathetic. In 2020, there were 52 placements for doctorates in psychology, with hundreds of students who have undergraduate degrees, MA degrees and loads of training under their belt chasing only 52 places. They cannot get on the courses because there are not enough places. Furthermore, there are 402 fewer psychologists than was recommended in A Vision for Change in 2006. We are not putting the resources into supporting young people who want to become psychologists and to help address the mental health crisis. We are making it difficult for them and we are grossly understaffed and under-resourced to meet the desperate needs that exist in this area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the sickest aspects of our economy is the fact that property speculators and vulture funds can make money and profit from putting people who have done nothing wrong on the street. The Taoiseach and his Government continue to facilitate that, despite desperate pleas from myself and others about their failure to close loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 that allow this to happen, most recently with the decision to end the Covid related eviction ban on the grounds that the 5 km rule has been lifted. Tomorrow, eight residents of the Saint Helen's Court complex in Dún Laoghaire, who have always paid their rent and who have done nothing wrong, including pensioners, workers, ordinary people and families with kids, are due to be evicted. This will happen because the Government has lifted that eviction ban and because it failed to close the loopholes that are being utilised by Mill Street Projects Ltd., a vulture fund which wants to put people on the street to maximise the value of the property. I also heard from a young woman this week whose father died in homeless services, who has herself been homeless for most of her life and whose sister's son died in homeless services. She is also due to be evicted next Monday because of the lifting of the 5 km rule. She has lived in homeless accommodation for most of her life, as has her sister. For the first time she had a housing assistance payment, HAP, property, which she was paying the rent for. She has done nothing wrong and now she will be evicted. She also informs me that two of her friends will be evicted from other HAP properties, the same HAP that is supposed to be the social housing solution. What kind of sick economy is that? Never mind the lack of human conscience of the people who would do that to other individuals but what is the Government going to do to stop these brutal and inhumane evictions that are driven by the profit greed of vulture funds and property speculators?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are going to overcome sectarianism and division and move forward to a united Ireland, which certainly is something I would like to see, we have to be an example in terms of what unification would give to people. I have talked a lot about the importance of having an all-Ireland national health service. Something else that is critical and can help us to unite people is taking a lead on the question of providing decent jobs. I want to cite a particular example of where we are not taking the lead in that regard. I have had reports recently from Dublin Port concerning certain Brexit-related operations that led to the employment of several hundred workers by Doyle Shipping Group. From what I understand, it seems that these workers are, in effect, working for Revenue, the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Office of Public Works, but have been contracted out to Doyle Shipping Group, which is treating them absolutely disgracefully. It has not paid them the hourly rates they are supposed to get, it is not giving them their proper overtime rates and it is unilaterally trying to change their contracts. When some of the workers, including one who contacted me, questioned Doyle Shipping Group about this, they were sacked unceremoniously. There was no consultation; they were just gone. I assume these workers are being paid by Departments. This does not exactly bode well in terms of how the State protects the rights of workers. I do not expect the Taoiseach to know the details of this situation here and now but I ask that he look into it. It is unacceptable that this sort of thing could be happening on what is, in effect, a Government-supported project and employment at Dublin Port.
