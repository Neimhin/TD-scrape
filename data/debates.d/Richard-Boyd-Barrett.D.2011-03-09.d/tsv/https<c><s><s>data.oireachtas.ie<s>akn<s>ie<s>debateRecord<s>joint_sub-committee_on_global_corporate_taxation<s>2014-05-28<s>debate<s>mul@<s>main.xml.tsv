RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Mr. O'Brien repeat that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Losses that have-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. O'Brien think morality and fairness should come into tax policy and corporate tax policy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does he think it is moral or fair that the cleaning lady who cleans the floors and toilets in a multinational company pays twice or possibly three times the proportion of her income in tax than the shareholder who buys shares in a multinational and does nothing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked Mr. Coffey, who is our economic expert and rapporteur, for the effective tax rate for the average worker in this country.  Most cleaning ladies would probably earn less than the average.  Let us take the average worker who pays 25% of his or her income in tax as against the effective tax rate for the corporations for whom the cleaning lady works.I would argue that the corporations that cleaning lady works for pay well below the 12.5% but even if it were 12.5%, could any fair person describe that as fair or just?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I could interrupt Mr. O'Brien, I get his point-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That interesting justification does not explain how the chief executive officers and the major shareholders in these companies are astronomically rich compared with the cleaning lady who is cleaning their toilets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I could point out that the average worker, having paid their 25% in tax, then pays double tax in the form of parking charges, water charges, property tax, VAT and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to the issue of effective tax rates and Mr. O'Brien's claim that they are higher than some are claiming.  We can see some of the figures, and they were alluded to by Mr. O'Brien in his introduction.  I got this table about a year and a half ago and tried to draw some points out of it publicly because I was quite shocked by what I consider to be the effective rate, which is the amount of tax paid by companies, particularly the very profitable multinational companies.  As the figures are broken down by the degree of profitability and size of those companies, we see that of the €73 billion in total profits, €52 billion of those profits are made by 480 companies that earn profits in excess of €10 million a year but only pay €3.3 billion in tax, which is probably about 7%.  In terms of the EUROSTAT figures, which I have also alluded to in terms of effective rates, and I got this information from the Oireachtas library and research service, it states that the effective rate in Ireland is 6.8%, 18.9% for Denmark, 18% for Finland, 23.6% for Norway and 27.2% for Sweden, for example.  What I do not understand is if the way we get from €70 billion to €4 billion is normal accountancy practice, why is our implicit rate so much lower than all of those other countries which presumably use the same accountancy practices as we do here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  It is a gross profit figure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Forget about Revenue for a minute.  I am talking about EUROSTAT.  Clearly, EUROSTAT is taking gross profit and the actual amount of tax paid as a proportion of gross profit and working out the effective rate, what it calls the implicit rate, from that.  Is that not what it is doing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not more to do with the amount that is written off taxable profit in the form of what are called trade charges?  Just €14 billion of the €73 billion pre-tax profits are royalty payments paid by a multinational to the exact same multinational.  That multinational decides how much it will charge itself for the right to use patents and intellectual property rights because that is such a huge proportion of the element of gross profits that is written down to the point where it pays tax on far less.  Is that not the real reason?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope I get the time back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to drill down into that but in the short time available we will not have enough time to do that in the detail in which it should be done.  When a multinational is selling stuff to itself, is it not the case that it can charge what it likes in reality?  It is very convenient if it charges a very high price for that because it writes down the amount of profits that are then liable for tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But it does not sell this stuff to third parties because the whole point with regard to the companies with which we are dealing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- and precisely what characterises them is they keep their stuff to themselves.  They keep their intellectual property, patents, software systems or whatever it is to themselves and sell the product precisely on the basis that one buys it uniquely from them and can get it from nobody else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To use a phrase, it strikes me that there are lies, damned lies and multinational accountancy practices and that there is enormous scope for abuse with regard to how the company quantifies the cost and value of these patents.  It strikes me that this is one of the key mechanisms that allows such companies to write down their taxable profits and that this area must be examined a hell of a lot more.  I have absolutely no doubt but that this explains why, according to European comparisons, Ireland's implicit rate is so much lower than everywhere else, because a lot of the companies engaged in this particular practice are based here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My last question is about incorporation versus management control, which is another mechanism through which another whole raft of profits - not even included in these figures - are simply not discussed or included at all.  Are the management and control criteria for tax residency completely archaic and out of date in the modern globalised economy?  Where does one define this in a multinational company that has branches and subsidiaries all over the place and has a whole series of different hubs of management, control, added value and so on?  How can one possibly state it is all managed in the United States, even though it has sizeable investments, operations and so on in Ireland and elsewhere that it somehow can evade?  I put this question to both witnesses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Taft wish to comment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask one further question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the alternative position put by Mr. Taft, he has suggested that were we to adjust the tax position, on its own it could have an impact on the levels of investment.  How does he tally that with his other argument, which is that as a result of Ireland's low tax rate, we have a low level of corporate investment when compared with our European neighbours?  I do not quite discern how these two things square.  If our tax is not a major contributor, when compared with our European neighbours, to significant levels of corporate investment, why would increasing the effective rate or the nominal rate by some degree have any particular effect on the levels of corporate investment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman gave Deputy Dara Murphy a second round.  Can I have a second?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a Second Stage speech and the Chairman allowed Deputy Dara Murphy three extra questions.  I just want one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given what Mr. Taft stated about higher effective rates elsewhere not being detrimental to the levels of corporate investment, is there any evidence to suggest that if, for example, we applied a minimum effective rate to gross profits of, say, 12.5% or increased the nominal rate to approximately 15%, which would still leave our effective and nominal rates significantly lower than everywhere else in Europe, it would have any detrimental effect on our economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mean if one applied a minimum effective rate of 12.5% on the gross profits of €70 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then one could have all of the allowances and deductions kicking in after one paid 12.5%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have it on income tax and it is not new.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have it on income tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would not make much difference if the real effective rate is 12.5%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman let Deputy Dara Murphy in three times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question was considerably shorter than even one of Deputy Dara Murphy's.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman certainly will not be doing me a favour.  That is for sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even though implicit rates are higher than that everywhere else in Europe, according to Oireachtas figures.
