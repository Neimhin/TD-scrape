RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support Deputy Howlin's amendment. First, it is reasonable to say that this is rushed legislation where there is much detail that needs to be scrutinised and fully understood. I do not accept that, because the committees were not up and running, we could not have done that. We set up the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response specifically to deal with Covid-19 matters, and I see no reason the Bill could not have been referred to that committee to undertake more detailed scrutiny on it. I am conscious that we must bring in measures quickly to respond to an unpredictable virus that we do not yet fully understand and where we do not know the trajectory of infection, sickness, hospitalisation and where it could go. There is no doubt that one of the environments in which Covid-19 almost certainly likes to transmit is where there are large numbers of people in an enclosed space drinking alcohol, with raised voices, singing etc. We know enough of the science to know that this is an environment in which Covid-19 is likely to spread and it is right that the Government and all of us would want to ensure that we do not give licence to situations which are likely to become super-spreading environments. Having said that, those who are concerned about this Bill have also made reasonable points. I took a staycation, as I suspect most in this House did, in rural counties and there is no doubt that the vast majority of licensed premises selling food and allowed to open were abiding by the restrictions and were being compliant. I have no doubt that if pubs reopen, the vast majority will do likewise. We also know that the potential is there. There have been some instances of reckless behaviour which could be extremely dangerous in terms of the transmission of the virus and it is reasonable for the Government to want to have measures in place to ensure that action can be taken swiftly to deal with that. Therefore, this is a fine balance. However, and this is the point about this amendment and my party's amendment that comes later, there is a problem with the legislation, what the Government says it is about, and what it might allow the Government to do. Deputy Howlin points out that, in line 13 on page 5, where the Bill refers to "the purposes of giving a direction under section 31A(7) of the Act of 1947", the Health Act which has been amended to give powers in relation to Covid-19, it states in line 14 "whether in relation to a relevant provision or otherwise". Therefore, it is not only the relevant provision as set out in the amended legislation but could be something else. That seems dodgy from a legal point of view. It means we do not really know what we are doing here or what the possible consequences of this might be. I will go on to explain, in terms of my party's amendment seeking to delete section 13, that similar problems exist there. The Bill says it is doing a limited set of things relating to pubs to ensure compliance and prevent the transmission of the virus, but it then possibly gives other powers or rights to the Minister to do other things under the Health Act that are not necessarily related to that at all, and potentially to do other things completely beyond the scope of the stated intention of this Bill. That is the concern. In that sense, it is sloppy or it is potentially giving the Government carte blanche to do other things that are not stated as the intention of the Bill. Deputy Howlin is right in this regard, and similarly, as I will go on to argue, in section 13, which should be deleted because it gives unspecified powers to do other things beyond what is stated as the intention of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has just pointed out that we will finish at 1.30 p.m. We have only managed to discuss one amendment and as we see when we drill down into the detail, there are many questions to be asked. My own amendment is the third. When we discussed at the Business Committee that there was limited time for this, I am pretty certain that a commitment was given that if we needed a bit more time, that time would be given. I put it to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that we need more time. There are serious amendments and serious matters. I know some of the earlier contributions were effectively Second Stage speeches but serious scrutiny of this legislation requires a little more time. I appeal, following the commitment given by the Government, for extra time for that scrutiny to be allowed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If Deputy Howlin presses this amendment to a vote, as he may well do, then all the time will be gone. I would like a second opportunity to speak before that happens. I ask the Minister to contact the Whip to ask for extra time. Unless the Government comes in, which it should, to give us extra time as the Government Chief Whip promised, then I want to speak again on this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is one more hour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is also an amendment in our names.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I raised earlier the issue of the additional time promised by the Government and I saw the Chief Whip hovering around. The Ceann Comhairle himself suggested that we were going to get additional time to deal with our and Deputy McNamara's amendments. If there is a vote called now, the time will have expired.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister says she is happy to go to 3 p.m.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe our opposition to the section is the most important proposal today, precisely because the section gives a blank cheque and carte blanche to the Minister, under the emergency amendment of the Health Act that was passed earlier this year, to make regulations which potentially go way beyond the specific scope of this Bill. We would be happy to let this Bill go through because we accept that it is necessary to have powers to prevent reckless behaviour in the context of licensed premises or places selling intoxicating liquor, which is a real threat to public health. However, the Government and everybody else accept that these are draconian powers. They are not powers that under normal circumstances one would wish the State or the Garda to have. All of us have accepted that this is an exceptional situation and have allowed power to be given to the State to do things that normally from a civil liberties point of view we would be very concerned about. We can accept that. This is exceptional and those powers need to be available, when they are clearly specified in respect of what the offence is and what the penalty is. This section means that the Minister for Health can prescribe as a criminal offence things that are not in this Bill or that are not written down anywhere else so far. That is a power too far. It is worrying. Ministers can make mistakes and wrong moves. There needs to be oversight of decisions that the Minister may make in future which we might want to question in here. We will not have the right to question or challenge them. The Minister will have a blank cheque for things that are not to do with the stated intention of this Bill or that the Government may not even have considered at this moment. That is more than unusual. For that reason, we appeal to the Government to remove this section. We would then be happy to let the Bill go through. This section should come out. It is a blank cheque and no Government or Minister should be given a blank cheque about things they could do in the future that we may not even have thought of or considered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will respond to the Minister. This section connects the provisions of this Bill to the extraordinary powers given in previous emergency Covid-19 legislation that we supported. It allows the Minister for Health to prescribe certain events and activities as offences carrying penal provisions. The problem is what has now changed. The enforcement powers that this Bill provides can now be used for regulations made under the Act, and we do not know what those could be. There is a range of new enforcement powers which could be used to bring about regulations that the Minister may decide to introduce. That is a problem. Although I accept the point that there is a need to connect one Act to the other, the consequence is that what everybody has accepted are draconian measures, although necessary in a particular context, could be applied to other contexts. Those draconian enforcement powers could be applied to other actions, which is a problem. It is the reason we oppose the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should go back to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even before Covid-19 hit, higher education in this country was in a sorry state because of the impact imposed by misguided austerity. In February, before Covid-19 arrived, further and higher education were still suffering from the cumulative impact of €550 million in cuts and were operating with less than the funding that existed in 2007. Student to academic ratios in that period went from 16:1 to 20:1. The numbers in third level went up by an incredible 50% while all of those cuts were being imposed. The pre-Covid-19 Cassells report suggested that we needed at least an extra €600 million by 2021 and €1 billion extra by 2030. That was the sorry situation. To put it dramatically, there was more investment per horse in this country than there was per student for most student categories pre-Covid-19. Now, how can a disgraceful situation like that not make our capacity to deal with Covid-19 for students and our third level sector all the more difficult, notwithstanding the positive decision to set up the new Department and some additional funding? It is not even enough to bridge the gap of the austerity cuts the Minister's Government had previously imposed or to bring us anywhere near the level of investment which now needs to dramatically increase in the light of Covid-19. Of course, one of the impacts, which is relevant to the Covid-19 situation, is that this has put pressure on third level institutions to concentrate on ratcheting up numbers to get registration fees and make money out of over-priced student accommodation on campus as well as to increase their reliance on the higher fees they receive from international students. I spoke to two people in universities today and have heard that universities are over-promising what they can deliver in terms of a face-to-face experience in the environment of Covid-19 because they are desperate to get the numbers in and because they want people to come into the student accommodation to get the revenue, even when the students are uncertain. They do not know what they are facing. They are not going to get face-to-face lectures. It is highly questionable how much face time they will get at all. Many of them are wondering whether to come. Should they pay out big deposits to get student accommodation? Will they get shafted the way they did in February, when they paid deposits and rent upfront only to be put out because of the pandemic? They are asking whether they will be in the same situation again. Against that kind of background, it seems simple. It is not as if this is an easy situation - I understand that. However, there was never justification for registration fees - they are the highest in Europe - and they should simply go now. There is no justification to charge €3,000 to students whose families may have also lost income on top of the capacity of students to gain employment while studying being significantly diminished. That is my main call. The Minister should get rid of the registration fees. He should do it now. They should not have been there in the first place but there is absolutely no justification for them in the context of Covid-19. We should get our levels of investment in higher and further education up to something like the European standards. Where could the Government find the money? A total of €700 million is going on research and development tax relief, mostly to a few big corporations. Why not redirect some of that money to our universities? I do not expect the Minister to answer my main points but I wrote to him on 13 July about psychiatric student nurses. They have been told that after they do their placements for six weeks they will have to self-isolate for two weeks but they cannot have other employment because of Covid-19. They are looking for some financial assistance because they cannot work.
