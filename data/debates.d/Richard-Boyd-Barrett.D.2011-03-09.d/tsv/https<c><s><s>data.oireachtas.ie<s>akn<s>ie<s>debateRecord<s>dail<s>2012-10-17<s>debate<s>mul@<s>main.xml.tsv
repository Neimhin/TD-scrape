RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Contrary to what the Government sometimes claims when something positive is being done we are willing to support it. The Bill deals with an important area. Given the huge levels of unemployment, the new education and training boards and the new agency, SOLAS, will have an important role to play in trying to upskill and retrain large sections of society who have been forced into unemployment as a result of the crisis and need to be facilitated to upskill and retrain in order to re-enter the workforce. It is important that we get the Bill right and that the new structures, when established, genuinely respond to the needs of people for education and retraining to return to the workforce, whether those coming through the post-primary system or adults who require retraining. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned literacy and numeracy, the importance of which is further highlighted in the context of the need to retrain and upskill. Many of those who are without work and want to find a place in the workforce have serious literacy problems. The literacy problem is a real barrier for large numbers of people to find work and contribute to a modern economy that is advancing rapidly. We must get all those issues right and do our best to provide the education and training that people need for a new economy. It is welcome that the legislation and the infrastructure are being rationalised for the VECs, now the education and training boards. The Minister for Education and Skills said this is running parallel to and matching, at some level, what is being proposed for the structures of local government reform and the rationalisation of same. That is welcome and we all understand its importance. In so far as it can deliver savings where there is unnecessary replication of administration that does not contribute to the delivery of front-line services for which the system is supposed to provide, then all of those things are welcome. However, we need to enter a caveat here in that in the current climate the terms "reform" and "rationalisation" are often used to cover over what, in many cases, are cuts. It is important that rationalisation does not become a euphemism for cuts. There is a problem if that is what is it and if we are talking about cuts. I do not have a problem with cutting unnecessary administration nor with cutting the remuneration for chief executive officers in the education and training boards. There will be cost savings at that level because there will be 16 education and training boards as opposed to 33 vocational education committees. The remuneration for the chief executive officers is generous, ranging from €103,000 up to €127,000.It seems quite high we may need to look further at that. I have no problem with making savings at that level, but not if it runs alongside cuts in the education budget generally, with the cutting of capitation grants paid to schools and further cuts imposed on primary schools as a result of the correct decision by the Government to back off on the cuts to DEIS schools. All the restructuring and rationalisation in the world does not mean very much if we are cutting funding and resources to the schools and education services and do not have adequate teacher numbers and so on to provide the education and training that is so desperately required. It is required now more than ever given that an additional 10,000 pupils are joining the education system every year and the numbers unemployed who require retraining and upskilling are significantly greater than they have been at any time in the recent past. Against that background, even holding current levels of resources would be tantamount to a cut in services. However, we have even had real cuts in addition to that. We cannot hope to deliver on what these education and training boards need to do and what the education system in general needs to do unless we stop the cutting agenda overall. Having said that, I still acknowledge the usefulness of legislation to rationalise the structures. We probably had an unnecessary number of VECs, and amalgamations can work. A number of concerns have been raised with me on the issue of workers' rights. The Bill removes a number of the protections that existed in the previous legislation dealing with VECs in the areas of suspension, dismissal, removal from office, and payment for employees, teachers and other staff. The TUI has made it very clear that it is concerned about this and that the protection for workers' rights in the sector needs to be retained. That is a matter that needs to be reviewed as we proceed with this legislation. On the more general issue of cuts and rationalisation, in a number of areas, according to the TUI, the authority that previously vested in the Minister for Education and Skills in the appointment of board members, chief executive officers, and so on is now migrating to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I share the TUI's concern, as it would indicate a cost-cutting approach to the rationalisation rather than one whose starting point is the educational needs of the pupils or service users of the new ETBs. Often the driver behind reform of the health service and in other sectors is not the best interests of the service users or the provision of services but simply the imperative to cut in line with troika targets. Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to issues of procurement, an area on which I am not an expert. A VEC staff member in my area who would probably prefer to remain anonymous recently showed me some documents indicating there is a new regime for procurement requiring everything to go a central body. All items such as stationery for the VECs must be purchased at a central level or through an approved set of providers. He pointed out that this was likely to have a very damaging effect on the local economy in that previously many of these items would have been sourced from small local businesses in the area. In addition, in many cases the prices they now have to pay for these supplies and goods are actually higher than they were when bought from local businesses. This is not true in all cases but is in certain cases. He showed me the documents - I do not know why Deputy Timmins is shaking his head.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought Fine Gael was the champion of small business, but obviously that is not the case. I have a real concern that those sorts of measures can benefit bigger suppliers of goods and services to the education system and to the education training boards at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. On the issue of membership of the boards and so on, a number of submissions have suggested that a balance should be provided in terms of staff and parental representation on the boards. In addition there may also be a requirement to have adult learners represented on the boards. I would like to see that done at the expense of politicians. I do not understand why we need so many councillors. I would favour more staff representation, parent representation, community representation and other people who can contribute to have these boards connected into labour issues in the area, the employment prospects in the area and the educational needs of people in the area rather than it being dominated by politicians. Concern has been expressed that the parents' representatives are now to be elected through national parents' organisations rather than directly at school level. I would like to hear the justification for that because it seems to threaten a level of local democracy. The TUI has expressed concerned that section 48 should specifically prevent fees from being charged for the provision of education by the education training boards, with which I agree. I wish to raise a parochial matter which is somewhat tangential. I have been trying to raise this issue for about three weeks with the Ceann Comhairle. It relates to staff in the VEC, many of whom have worked there for ten, 12 or 15 years and who do not have degrees. Even though they are very skilled at what they do in the VECs, because of the recently passed legislation requiring them to have degrees, they are now faced with the prospect of losing their jobs. The Teaching Council of Ireland will not allow them to join the council because they do not have degrees. They are asking that there would be an amnesty for people who worked for many years in the VECs but are now caught because of the new regulations.While it is reasonable for those regulations to apply going forward, there should be an amnesty for those who, having worked in the VECs for many years and with whom management has no problem as they are doing their job well, now face possible job loss because of the new regulations requiring that they have degrees in order to become members of the Teaching Council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose to share time with Deputies Thomas Pringle, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and Tom Fleming. The Government has talked continuously about health care reform and its determination to reform the public health service. Some of us believe reform is, for the most part, a euphemism for cuts and austerity. There is no clearer example of where this is the case than what the Government is doing to home helps and home care packages. It is despicable to cut more than 1 million home help hours to the elderly and the disabled, some of our most vulnerable citizens. One cannot call it reform because it is just cuts. Every one of the hours cut will degrade the quality of life of our most vulnerable citizens. It will mean more suffering, more loneliness and more isolation. For many people, it will mean an accelerated move to death. It is despicable, unacceptable and there is no justification for it. The Government should reverse the cuts. It should find the money elsewhere and leave the elderly and the disabled alone. Given the move to take personal assistants from some of our most disabled citizens, the fact I have heard from parents of some of the most severely disabled children who have had respite hours taken from them, and the cutting of home help hours, I seriously ask what the Government has against the elderly and the disabled. This is not a rhetorical point. The Government seems to be relentlessly targeting them, which is appalling and should stop. I appeal to the Government to reverse the cuts and make it clear that no further cuts will be visited upon this area. I shudder to think what €700 million of further cuts to the health service in the December budget will look like in light of what this has meant for some of our most vulnerable citizens. Apart from the awfulness of the cuts, I question the economic logic behind them. The Government seeks to outsource these services to private companies, replacing not-for-profit home help providers with for-profit home help providers. An woman in her 80s from Greystones phoned me to explain that she is on a waiting list for public home help services. She is paying €26 an hour to a private home help provider. Public home help providers receive between €12 and €14 per hour. Where is the difference going? It is going into the pockets of private companies, like Comfort Keepers. These are the subsidiaries of multinationals and they see the needs of our elderly and disabled citizens as an opportunity to make money. Setting aside ideological differences in the House, it is unacceptable that the support and health care necessary for our elderly, disabled and sick citizens should be dependent on whether someone can make money from it. It does not make sense from the point of view of the public finances. I urge the Government to lay off home help services and I urge it to protect the not-for-profit home help services and the low paid women workers who work in those services and provide community care. The Government should stop the drive to put people on the clock. The Taoiseach denied home help workers were being put on the clock but they are. It is dehumanising and is degrading the service. If the Government does not stop, there will be public outcry. The home helps who came into the Dáil and who were on the streets are not going away. They will fight and continue their campaign. The Government should lay off them and back off on these cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister reverse the cuts then?
