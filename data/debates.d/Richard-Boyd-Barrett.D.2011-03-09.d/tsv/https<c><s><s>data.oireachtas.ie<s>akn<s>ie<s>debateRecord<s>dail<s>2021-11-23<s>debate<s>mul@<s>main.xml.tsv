RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to urgently address the issue of testing and we need the Minister in here to discuss it. People cannot get a PCR test for love nor money in Dublin. People are hours and hours on the website, if they can get an appointment at all. People are talking about antigen tests being free, and they should be, but we need PCR testing and we need walk-in PCR testing to be available.The longer somebody is walking around while infectious or potentially infectious, the more the disease will spread. People have to be able to access PCR tests as soon as possible. They are suffering inordinate delays and we need a serious discussion on how we will provide walk-in PCR testing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Bríd Smith could not get tested all day yesterday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we extend it with questions? That would be helpful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach add questions to the Minister to the end of the debate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, I asked the Taoiseach to reopen applications for the PUP for those hit by the new public health measures and he declined to commit to that. Over the weekend, the work available to taxi drivers has gone over a cliff because of the night-time curfews and people pulling back and listening to the public health advice. Offices not going into work on Monday has further decimated the taxi industry. It needs access to the PUP. The same goes for those in the night-time economy and the musicians and entertainers who have been hit the worst again and again. If a bit of solidarity is being shown, they need to be given access to the PUP to sustain them through the coming period. I appeal to the Taoiseach to reopen applications for these affected cohorts for the PUP.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So what, musicians should get a job in a bar. Is that it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is those affected by the pandemic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have asked repeatedly, for about five years now, for a review of the income thresholds for eligibility for social housing. Is there any assessment being done of the effect of not raising those thresholds? As I said to the Taoiseach last week, as well as to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I am now dealing with two families in homeless accommodation who are going to be evicted from that accommodation. It is not bad enough that they are homeless; they are going to be evicted from being homeless to become roofless. One of the householders got a letter yesterday saying the family has two days to be out of the hotel in which they have been staying. Both families have been homeless for three years. What is their crime? The parents got a bit of work. For people with a council or housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy, they do not get thrown out of it because they get work. For people who are homeless, however, who get a job and whose earnings go up a bit, they will be evicted from homeless accommodation and told they will get no more housing support and they are off the housing list. They are thrown to the wolves. That is happening this week and I am hearing of similar cases. It is all because the income thresholds were not raised. I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something urgently about this. In the next two days, a family will be put out of homeless accommodation and onto the street. They cannot afford to go anywhere else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the case of another family, the mother is a care worker and cannot even take a promotion that is going in her organisation because, if she did, she would be thrown off the list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In any event, she is now being told she is off the list and may be evicted from her homeless accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over the past number of weeks, I and others have raised the designation of six human rights organisations and NGOs, including quite a number that receive funding from the EU, as terrorists by Israel. I am sure the Taoiseach has received representations from various Palestinian groups and others on this as well. This is clearly an attempt to, essentially, make illegal any organisation that utters a word of criticism of Israel or shines any spotlight on its apartheid policies, its routine denial of Palestinian rights, its persecution of Palestinians or its illegal occupation of Palestinian land. Those organisations are now designated as terrorists. The Government has expressed concern about this. It said it would be in touch with the Israeli authorities, as has the EU. What is actually happening? This is further evidence that Israel is a rogue state. I am slightly concerned about some of the responses from the Minister and from Government spokespeople, who have started to bandy around the word "antisemitism" if you question the right of Israel to be an apartheid state, which it is. That is clearly coming from the Israelis. I remind the Taoiseach that Nelson Mandela believed Israel was an apartheid state that should be boycotted. It is not an antisemitic statement to call out Israeli apartheid. What is the Government doing to sanction Israel over its designation of human rights organisations as terrorists in an attempt to suppress them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about sanctions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly agree that the commission of investigation format is not working. The delays and costs involved are inordinate and often by the end of the process, a lot of people are left wondering what it was all about in the first place. There is an air of Dickens's Jarndyce and Jarndyce about a lot of these commissions. I refer to the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes as another example of where we have got it very badly wrong. I know we will be discussing this in greater depth later this evening but a number of the survivors who were outside Leinster House today are absolutely furious at the proposed redress scheme. They are angry at arbitrary time periods and thresholds for those who were in mother and baby homes being used as some sort of meaningful guide for redress. This is just typical of the way the State gets it so badly wrong. People must have spent six months in an institution to be eligible for redress, as if the human story, tragedy, hardship and trauma can somehow be equated to a particular time period or amount of money. This is an example of how the State really get things wrong. We will debate it further this evening but I would simply say that the key in such sensitive investigations and in the production of reports is to listen to the survivors and those with first-hand experience. The establishment of schemes and the production of reports must be done in step with survivors. The failure to do so has landed this Government in a mess. The Taoiseach and the Government must consider that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nothing will turn people off the climate action agenda that we need to urgently undertake more than big corporations, wealthy individuals and political elites lecturing ordinary people about their personal culpability for the climate crisis. I warn the Government that if it does not break from that reliance, it will turn people away from the climate agenda. It will alienate people. There is evidence that that is happening around the world. On the other hand, young people understand that system change is needed. It is not a matter of individual culpability or responsibility. The system needs to be changed. At the centre of what young people talk about, when they get out on the streets, is just transition. It is not just a phrase. They actually mean it. It will make the lives of ordinary people better. It is not the coded language of Deputy Bruton, who says that people need to realise that things will be tough and difficult. That goes back to responsibility. He went on to say why we need all the support for the corporate sector and that it will make the changes. He needs to make up his mind. If that road is taken, it will alienate people and all the targets in the world will mean nothing. After looking at the targets and then our records on forestry, it makes me laugh. Ten years ago, when I came into this Dáil, there was a target of 12,000 ha of new forest every year. It was never met. There was 4,000 ha or 5,000 ha of afforestation at best in that period. We have the lowest level of forest cover of anywhere in Europe. Instead of trying to meet the targets, we revised them downwards. The targets in the climate action plan are half of what they were ten years ago when I came into the Dáil. There is climate ambition for you. Meanwhile, the State forestry company is trying to sell forests. Local communities had to fight to stop forests from being sold in my area. It also happened in Cork recently. One can look at the list of Coillte's sales or at previous attempts to sell harvesting rights. That happens because the mandate of the State forestry company is about commercial activity and making money, but it is not about protecting and expanding the forest estate. It should not have an industrial model but instead one that is about protecting the environment and guaranteeing a decent living for farmers and people who are protecting the environment through biodiversity and afforestation measures. That is just one example of many. We need to invest in public transport. It is amazing that it has not been debated since the budget. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, heads the Department of Transport, which is the only Department which had a budget cut in budget 2022. I could give many more examples. Unless there is an investment into just transition and the State taking the lead on system change, these targets are worse than useless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"acknowledges: — that the State failed the women and children who were in Ireland's Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes institutions; — that women and their children were separated through coercion and/or force, often unlawfully, during their time in these institutions; — that women and their children were separated through coercion and/or force, often unlawfully, during their time in institutions not investigated by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters; — that women and their children were separated through coercion and/or force, often unlawfully, in non-institutionalised settings, including through adoption agencies, maternity hospitals and private facilitators; — the role religious authorities, social workers and private individuals played in non-institutionalised settings, where women and their children were separated through coercion and/or force, often unlawfully; — the Taoiseach's acceptance of the lack of respect for the fundamental dignity and rights of mothers and children who spent time in these institutions and that the State did not uphold its duty of care to them; — that the Taoiseach's apology in January did not acknowledge the full extent of the human rights violations experienced by people affected by this issue, and the long-term effects of these violations on their lives;— that the Taoiseach's apology in January did not acknowledge the full extent of the human rights violations experienced by people affected by this issue;— that the State has failed to acknowledge the full extent of unlawful and forced family separation; and — that the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters, which is currently being challenged in the High Court, failed utterly to respect, acknowledge, or give adequate weight to the personal testimonies of survivors; recognises: — the personal trauma and human rights abuse of coercion of a mother to relinquish her baby and of forced family separation; — that the harms associated with forced family separation are not dependent on length of stay in a Mother and Baby Home or similar institution;— that the harms associated with forced family separation are not dependent on spending time in an institution; — that the exclusion of people who were in these institutions for a period less than six months, people who were boarded out, placed at nurse, people who were in institutions not falling under the remit of the Commission of Investigation, and people who experienced forced family separation but were not institutionalised is inequitable, unjust, and contrary to the survivor feedback received by OAK; — the primal wound of separating babies from their mothers, by coercion and/or force, often unlawfully, at any age; and— that all babies, regardless of age, experienced trauma due to being deprived of their mother's care, often being left unsupervised, neglected and/or malnourished; commends the survivors, mothers, adopted people, their families, and the families of the children who died in these institutions for sharing their lived experiences and trauma, and those who have advocated on their behalf; and calls on the Government to: — demand immediate and substantive recourse from religious authorities (both Catholic and Protestant) and pharmaceutical companies to contribute to the State's redress scheme and, if necessary, expropriate their assets to achieve this; — use OAK's 'Report of the findings of the Consultation with Survivors of Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes' as a basis for amending the proposed redress scheme;— engage immediately with the victims and survivors' organisations and those directly affected by the scandal of Mother and Baby Home and County Home institutions; — urgently review, in consultation with these groups, the following matters: — the time-based criteria; — the exclusion of children who were boarded out/placed at nurse from the redress scheme; — access to the enhanced medical card; — proposed payment rates; — the failure to include all Mother and Baby Homes, County Homes, institutions, agencies and individuals involved in forced family separation;— the legal waiver attached to the scheme; and— amend the scheme accordingly to meet the needs of those survivors; — repudiate the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters and cease contesting cases that are being taken by survivors;— ensure that applications for redress payments for older survivors, who are pensioners, be opened from next January 2022 rather than the end of 2022; — investigate records and burial sites of homes (including Tuam) where babies and children have been documented as deceased but where there are no burial records; — provide all adoptees, boarded out and placed at nurse people with their full medical history as a priority;— make a State apology to adopted, boarded out and placed at nurse people who were placed in abusive families and households; and — preserve the oral confidential committee tapes and written Commission of Investigation testimonies in consultation with the survivors." I thank Sinn Féin and the other signatories to the motion. We agree with everything that is in it and thank them for bringing it forward. It has only just become apparent to me that the changes we submitted in our amendment were purely additions. We did not propose to delete the motion. I want to make that clear. That line has been added by the Bills Office. We sent in additions, with a couple of changes, but nothing substantial. They were all additions to what was there because we agree with everything in the main motion. I just want to make that clear. The idea was it should not be a choice between the motion and the amendment. The Bills Office have done it that way and I do not understand why. I will set that aside because the more important point is the message that gets across to the Government on this matter. I am telling the Minister now that he will have to revisit this. Arbitrary time periods, or tables of compensation linked to time periods, are offensive. They completely fail to take into account the reality of coerced, forced separation of mothers from children. The trauma, suffering, impact and lifelong and varying consequences are unique to every single case. There should be no attempt to try to link those consequences to arbitrary time periods in an institution, or to a table with amounts of money linked to time periods, and it is offensive to do so.I ask the Minister to think about it. It is shocking and he will have to revisit it. I was born in a mother and baby home and from what I understand, I was in two mother and baby homes. I do not know how long I was in them and I am sure many others do not know how long they were in them either. The impact could be horrendous if you were in a home for one day and it could be somewhat less if you were in one for six months, depending on the outcome. However, in every case, the primal wound of children being separated from their mothers and mothers being separated from their children is a crime that was committed by the church and State against tens of thousands of mothers and children. To create arbitrary thresholds that you reach, where the State considers you worthy of redress, is absolutely offensive. I know the Minister did not mean to be offensive, but the problem with this whole sorry saga, which is about the crimes of the church and the State against mothers and children and their then trying to cover their backs and limit the damage, is that he has ended up compounding the hurt, insult, abuse and trauma perpetrated against mothers and children and retraumatising the victims. It is obnoxious. I know the Minister did not mean to be obnoxious, but that is the net result. This compounds what was done with the commission of investigation report in which the testimonies of the survivors were relegated to being relatively unimportant. Whether that was intended or was just a gross mistake, I do not know, but it was wrong. One of the things we have added in our amendment is to say that report must be fully repudiated in terms of its conclusions. Some of the stuff in that report was offensive. I am just telling the Minister it was offensive. There is no point in saying it was not offensive because it was. Some of what is in this scheme is offensive. I do not believe it was deliberate, but it smacks of the State covering itself and trying to limit things, instead of trying to do right by the survivors and victims of this whole horrible scandal. We have to walk in lockstep with the people at the centre of this - the mothers, children and survivors - if we are to get this right. This scheme has not done so and I ask the Minister to review it in consultation with the survivors. Our amendment also adds to the motion a demand that if the church institutions and pharmaceutical companies, which have a lot of assets, do not pay their fair share to fund redress, they must be forced to do so. We should state clearly that their assets will be expropriated if they do not do so. I do not know what half of these institutions are still doing running our hospitals and schools. Rather than us asking them nicely, they have to be told and if they will not do it, they have to be forced. I will not bother with other individual details. They are in the amendment we proposed. However, the point has already been made by Deputy Cairns and others that what the Minister has said about those who are not included in this scheme having guaranteed access to all their identity records and birth certificates in the birth information and tracing Bill and so on is not true, according to people who have looked at that legislation closely and also as I see it. We need to address that. The other changes we have proposed are to say that sometimes it is forcible separation - in fact, it is always forcible - but the way in which it is forced can be coercion or force, it can be unlawful technically or lawful technically, but it is all wrong. To create a hierarchy and distinctions that do not understand that human reality is wrong and the Minister needs to revisit it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is additional.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be absolutely clear, our amendment will now be an addition. It was not submitted as a counterproposal to the Sinn Féin motion. It is additional to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We never submitted an amendment looking to delete anything in the motion. What we did was amend it. I do not understand how it has come out with the word "delete" as part of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have often put in changes before and that did not happen. That is not at all what we intended. I do not want anything that implies we were deleting any aspect of the motion because we were not. We were adding to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no choice, but I am not very happy about it. We never put the word "delete" into the amendment. I am not happy. You sometimes add and sometimes delete all of it and we did not put the word "delete" in our amendment. That was not in anything we submitted to the Journal Office.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think I had better. I think I have no choice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does Deputy Funchion think?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the proposers accept the amendment, will the names of all the signatories from all parties, including those of the original motion, be on the amended motion or will it only be the of the signatories to the amendment? I would not want that. The whole point was that the amendment was in solidarity with the cross-party motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Acting Chair just clarify that point? If the amendment was accepted-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the amendment was accepted by the proposers, would the names of all the signatories to the original motion stay on the agreed and amended motion? That is what I want to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want it to be just our names.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the way any motion passed would be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it does not make any difference. Then I will press it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is our view the leaving certificate should go because it has outlived its usefulness. It is a gatekeeping and streaming exercise which perpetuates inequality and limits or streams access to third level education. The Minister might not agree with all of that but she has committed to some sort of review of the leaving certificate. I want to know the status of that review because, particularly after Covid, a root-and-branch review is long overdue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lecturer in UCD told me that much of the modern examination system originated with efforts to populate the civil service in British-controlled colonial China. I do not know if it is true, but it is a structure that is about enforcing certain norms and notions of hierarchy. That is still true of the leaving certificate. There are some dinosaurs in the North or in Britain who might hark back to the days of the 11 plus, when people's access to secondary education was streamed through exams. We now think that is horrible. The time has come for us to have the same attitude towards accessing third-level education. I do not see how the leaving certificate is anything other than a gatekeeping exercise, a streaming exercise and an unnecessary stress that does nothing to encourage education and has long outlived its usefulness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister be more specific about when the report will be published and when this is going to happen? This cannot be long-fingered. As she said, Covid has highlighted the inadequacies that were there, but it has shone a sharp light on the problems and the unfairness of the leaving certificate. It is unfair to put large numbers of students through the incredible and unnecessary stress it imposes on them. That is damaging to the intellectual development and confidence of many students. Given that we recognise that it has gone past its state of usefulness, as long as it is remains in use when it is outdated, it is damaging. There is a certain urgency in the root-and-branch review that is necessary to remove any barriers or hierarchies in terms of accessing the next level of education.
