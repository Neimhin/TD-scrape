RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 6 October last year, just one week before the budget, People Before Profit brought the first motion into this Dáil calling for price controls on energy and the renationalisation of the energy supply sector to run it on a not-for-profit basis, to protect people against a cost of living crisis that was only in its infancy at that point. At that stage it was being warned that people may be facing increases of about €500 per year in energy costs. Needless to say, the Government completely dismissed and voted against the proposals for price controls and the renationalisation of the energy sector. Ordinary families, working people, pensioners, people with disabilities and those on low and middle incomes have suffered the bitter fruits of the Government’s failure to support those measures one year ago. Since then, the crisis has got very much worse. We are not looking at €500 per year increases but at energy costs doubling and trebling. Some estimates suggest they will go from an average of €2,000 per year to €6,000 per year. People are being crucified. These hikes are simply not affordable for huge numbers of people and on Saturday, 24 September at 2.30 p.m. in Parnell Square, I expect there to be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of angry and frightened workers, pensioners, students, people with disabilities and ordinary people appealing to the Government once again to take decisive measures to protect them against a cost-of-living crisis that is crucifying them and against an ongoing housing crisis. It is very simple. Heating your home is not an optional extra. Having a shower and hot water are not optional extras. Having an affordable roof over your head is not an optional extra. Having the money to pay bills and put food on the table for your family are not optional extras but necessities. The Government has to guarantee that those needs of ordinary people, families and vulnerable people are met this year. The people will march for energy price controls and controls on the price of food. They will call for controls on rent, to make housing affordable and to keep incomes, whether pensions or wages, in line with inflation costs. It is long past time that we took the companies profiteering from this cost-of-living crisis back into public ownership. Nationalise the energy sector and run it on a not-for-profit basis because heating, hot water and electricity are needs and not optional extras.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course the war in Ukraine has worsened the situation but that war does not explain wind energy companies making super profits even though their costs have not changed a bit.Nor does it explain the profiteering of energy companies, which has been mentioned already, in respect of gas from the Corrib field, gas from the UK, from where we get most of it, or from Norway. It also does not explain the failure of the Taoiseach’s Government and other governments, although it is worth saying that countries like Spain have introduced price controls. France capped the level of increases that could be imposed but the Taoiseach’s Government, before the war in Ukraine started and when this cost-of-living crisis was in its infancy, refused to impose price controls when it was asked to do so in this Dáil through a motion we put forward. It also refused to extend eligibility for the fuel allowance or to take the energy sector back into public ownership. People are suffering a terrible cost while those same energy companies’ profits increase. By the way, while the war has made the situation worse, we have the highest utility costs of almost anywhere in Europe. We also have the highest childcare costs. We have seen the biggest increases in rents and house prices of anywhere in Europe. That is a specific Government failure in this country and alibis based on what is happening internationally do not justify the Government’s failure to act comprehensively to defend people against this dire crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should lead not follow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before the summer recess, I repeatedly asked the Taoiseach to facilitate a debate on the housing and homelessness crisis, particularly the review, or lack of a review, of the income thresholds for social housing, which means that thousands of families are being thrown off housing lists and denied housing assistance support. Over the last few days, there has been a drip-feed of reports that five counties will see increases in thresholds but the vast majority of the country will not. That means that tens of thousands of people in need of housing support and of social housing will be denied it. Week by week, more people will be thrown off those lists. I ask, at the very least, for the Minister to come in to give us that review, its details, and a report on Housing for All one year into the strategy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I get certainty for next week?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are considering-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not on this one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Taoiseach’s capacity as part of the Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Equality, I have raised with him on a number of occasions in the last year the issue of Accessible Community Transport Southside Ltd., ACTS, which is a door-to-door, voluntary-run, not-for-profit transport service for people with wheelchairs. It moves hundreds of people who otherwise could not get out of their homes to go to doctor appointments, to get around, to have a social existence and who cannot use the normal public transport system. I warned the Taoiseach that it was going to go out of business for the lack of approximately €250,000. Despite the suggestions that something would be done and that it would be looked at I was absolutely shocked to receive an e-mail from that service today saying that it is winding up. It is gone. We see these ACTS buses all around the city. People in wheelchairs are already obstructed from having equality of access to life, to services, to their doctors and so on and now their service is gone because of the lack of €250,000 and the refusal of the Government to give them the money to provide this service. It is gone and finished. Next week, people who have doctor appointments will have no transport to take them there. They have asked again and again for specialised transport for people with wheelchairs, with severe mobility problems, with disabilities and so on, to be seen as an integral part of our public transport system and for that to be properly funded but because of a failure to do that, that service is now gone. I ask the Taoiseach what he will do about this because many vulnerable people now have no transport service. It is shocking and it is shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we get two or three minutes extra? There are only one or two questions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach address the other couple of questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was brought up with the Taoiseach and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All agencies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They asked for the money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They asked the Department.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The service is gone now. It is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have not got the money - the €250,000. That is it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know how many schemes there are where it has been suggested that somebody needs to co-ordinate between Departments on the issue of disability. It has also been suggested that the Department of the Taoiseach should take a lead role on this. We should bear in mind that we signed up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. I find the Taoiseach's earlier response on what has happened to be shocking. This was a door-to-door transport service for people with powered wheelchairs and three or four buses used to take hundreds of people every day, for years, to medical appointments and to allow them to have a social life because they cannot use the normal public transport system. By the way, this service did not get a cent from the Department of Transport and it has been begging for a year for money to replace its buses and to deal with a financial shortfall. This company should not even have to exist because public transport should be doing its job. It is a not-for-profit involving mostly volunteers and the service is gone. Some of the most vulnerable people have no way to get to doctor's appointments and to get out of the isolation of their homes next week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thirty seconds for my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the Departments responsible for health and disability. They refused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think they got some money, but not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:To insert the following after "not made during the period of the crisis":"— examine the measures needed to develop a wholly publicly owned and not-for-profit energy system, including the nationalisation of all existing energy generation in the State in order to fully address both the current energy crisis and the climate crisis"I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion on the cost of living and for giving us an opportunity to discuss what is a really dire crisis. This People Before Profit amendment is simply an addition to the Sinn Féin motion. We agree with all the proposals Sinn Féin has put forward. We are adding an amendment suggesting that we must look as a matter of urgency at the question of taking the energy production and supply sector in this country into public ownership and running it on a not-for-profits basis to address the immediate crisis we are facing but also to have a sustainable situation in terms of providing the energy we need for our people to live, for our society and, indeed, to tackle the climate emergency we face. We think the time has come when we must look at doing that. I want people to dwell a little bit on the term "cost of living". If we think about the term "cost of living", it is an absolutely disgusting phrase. Think about it - there is a price tag attached to living. There are companies who make money by giving or not giving people the things they need to live. It is considered acceptable that private for-profit corporations control those things people need to live and have the power not to give them to people or charge so much for them that people cannot afford them. These are things that people need to live. This is not discretionary spending like popping off somewhere for a holiday or going to a very expensive restaurant, but things people need to live. There is a cost to it and a price tag and there are people who profit precisely from the fact that a person may not be able to afford those things or that there is a shortage in the supply.That is obscene, but it is the reality of the cost-of-living crisis. Hundreds of thousands of families, pensioners, students, working people and people with disabilities are fearful that they will not be able to afford the cost of those things that people need to live this winter - heating their homes, providing hot water, putting food on the table, paying their bills and paying their rent. What a terrifying prospect, yet at the same time, the companies that provide the things and own the resources that people need to live are enjoying a bonanza in profits. It is immoral and obscene that that could be the case, that the shareholders of those companies are enjoying a bonanza and people are sitting back who have done nothing yet are seeing their wealth and profits increasing while other people are scared, suffering and enduring real hardship. This is not just true of energy, but also of the housing crisis. A man in his mid-70s came to me this week. He had worked all his life in construction - he had been a project manager - and had built many of this city's large shopping centres. He broke down in tears in front of me. He is 76 years of age and he just broke down in tears because his landlady was selling the place where he had lived for years. He has never been on the housing list, so he has no chance of getting social housing. He will go on the list, but he does not have even the remotest prospect of getting somewhere to live and there is nowhere for him to rent. As he cried in my office, he told me that he had paid his taxes and worked all his life and had never asked for anything but was now facing the prospect of homelessness. He asked me what he was supposed to do. This is the type of suffering that people are enduring. It is not morally acceptable that old people, people with disabilities and families with children will turn off their heating this winter when they need it, will not have money to pay their bills and will cut back on food. The State has the resources, and the companies which are generating significant profits, have the money to sort out this crisis and shield people from it if there is a willingness on the part of the Government to use those resources and redistribute the profits that are being made in order to protect those who are suffering. It is entirely a political choice of the Government to protect either the interests of ordinary people or the interests of large corporations. I will make a brief proposal. With all the money the Government has, it should buy up some of the empty properties that are being constructed at the moment. Either investment funds buy them or we use our money to buy them in order to deliver affordable and public housing at scale quickly. If we use that extra money to do so, we will make a serious dent in the housing crisis. This is a serious proposal. The Government is saying that it has all of this extra money but that it cannot depend on that money in future years. That is a fair point, but it is worth saying that corporate tax receipts are due to increase from €15 billion to €20 billion this year. That means that there has been an increase of approximately 33% in the corporate sector's profits this year. That is staggering. We should deliver public housing by using that money to buy up all of the property that is being constructed and will otherwise be bought by international investment funds. We could deliver thousands of additional public housing units. Where anyone is threatened with eviction from a housing assistance payment, HAP, or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenancy, let us buy the house immediately, prevent people from being put on the street and save the State money in the long term.
