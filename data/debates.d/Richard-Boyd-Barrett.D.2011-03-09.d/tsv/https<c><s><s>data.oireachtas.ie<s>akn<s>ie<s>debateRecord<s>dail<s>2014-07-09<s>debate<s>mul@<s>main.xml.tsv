RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the same theme, we discussed this on Committee Stage and we have been trying to inject a sense of urgency in the Dáil on this issue over the past three years, because this crisis is getting worse. Finally, we have an opportunity to do something about it. When this issue was first raised and when we said the solution was to build council houses rather than rely on the private sector, the response of various Ministers was to throw up their hands and ask where we were to get the money to build council houses, because the Government did not have it. We do have the money. We have €6 billion. If we spent this money, or a significant portion of it, it would be money well spent, no matter what way we look at it. Spending it would have multiple benefits. First, it would benefit the 100,000 families on council housing waiting lists, some of whom have been waiting for ten to fifteen years for a council house. These people would benefit enormously by finally getting a secure roof over their heads and security for their children, with all the enormous benefits for the cohesion of society and the creation of a stable environment for children who lack that currently and are pushed from pillar to post in a private rental sector which is out of control and where rents are unaffordable for huge numbers of people. The other enormous benefit would be in terms of the revenue or finances of the State. Why do private developers get involved in housing and why was housing at the centre of the boom, not just in this country but internationally? Simply, the reason private investors are interested in this area is that they know everybody needs a house. People will always require a roof over their heads. Therefore, from the point of view of investors, housing was a sure-fire way of making money. Developers were not interested in housing people, but they knew people needed to be housed and knew they could make money. Of course, that profit-first approach to housing, regardless of the impact on the economy or housing provision based on need, had disastrous consequences for this economy and the global economy. The value for the State in taking this on would be that it could regulate a housing market that has gone out of control. That chaos in the housing market, driven by its almost complete privatisation, was what led to the collapse of our economy and the global recession. This issue was at the heart of the international crisis. This occurred because people interested in housing purely for profit completely dominated the market. If, instead, a significant proportion of housing is provided by the State on a not-for-profit basis, we can regulate the market and stop prices and rents getting out of control. Not only this; the State would save significantly in regard to all the money we are currently pouring into the pockets of private landlords. Between leasing schemes, rent allowance and so on, this probably amounts to €750 million. This is money out the door, lost for ever and of no benefit to the State. The State spends all that money but gets nothing in return. It has no assets at the end of the process. If the State built houses, it would get a return on that revenue. The private sector understands it can get such revenue, but why can the State not see that building council houses would be a secure source of revenue for it? It would save on rent allowance payments and have a regular stream of money coming into its coffers. The Minister of State has said that in so far as the State is considering using the fund in this way - I am glad it is considering this - this housing must be co-funded with the private sector. Why is this necessary? The private sector already has enough of the housing market without letting it into this area, which the Government seems to acknowledge we must return to. Why, however, must this return be dependent on the private market? Presumably, the Minister of State will have several answers to this question.I assume one of them involves a reference to EU state aid rules. If that is the case and the rules require that we cannot provide housing for our citizens unless some gombeen in the private sector can make money out of it, that is a terrible indictment of us for signing up to them in the first instance. What sort of rules are these? Let us consider to where they led in the context of the public private partnerships, PPPs, that were the flagship projects in housing provision in Dublin. I refer to the regeneration projects at O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and St. Michael's Estate. What happened at these locations was an absolute bloody disaster and it has had devastating consequences for communities that invested a great deal in trying to make the projects work. However, I think they were always sceptical about the PPPs involving Mr. McNamara. A great deal of energy, resources and work were invested over many years in trying to achieve some balance in respect of these PPPs in order to ensure people would be provided with proper housing, but what happened? All of the resources allocated were absolutely wasted, although many consultants made a hell of a lot of money out of the entire process. The process in question has been ongoing for ten or 15 years and the most recent indications are that we are going to return to the PPP model. What Mr. McNamara and the other guys involved in the PPPs to which I refer wanted was to grab some of the land attached to O'Devaney Gardens. As part of their agreement to co-invest in the regeneration project, they insisted on being allowed to grab approximately one third of the land involved when the flats were knocked down in order that they could make a pile of money. If the project had proceeded, the community at O'Devaney Gardens would have lost some of the space available for the building of council houses as a result of the condition in question. However, nothing happened and no houses were delivered. Would it not have been more sensible to do it the old-fashioned way and just build the houses ourselves? It goes on and on. There are similar examples of the same carry-on in Dún Laoghaire, including at a little Ballymun flats-style complex in a place called Mounttown. It took approximately 15 years from the time the flats were condemned as being uninhabitable for a new estate to be built due to the fact that the project was completely dependent on private developers, three of whom went bust. It was an unbelievable shambles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am discussing them. I am highlighting from the point of view of the stability of the economy, providing housing for those who need it and improving the public finances and creating a revenue stream for the State which it could use in providing public services, housing, etc. why we need to use the relevant funds to invest directly in fully public housing. That is what has been repeatedly sought from the Government. If we are hamstrung in this regard by EU rules on state aid, that is a disgrace. We should be kicking up absolute murder and refusing to comply with them. To be honest, I sometimes think what I am referring to is used as an excuse. There appears to be an almost ideological predilection to involve the private sector in these projects, even when it is self-evident that this approach has failed. I love the phrase "market failure". There has never been a more spectacular example of market failure that in this matter. That is precisely why we need a strategic investment on the part of the State to fill the gap left by the absolutely disastrous market failure we have witnessed. However, the Minister of State has indicated we can only do this on condition that we get the market on board. That is just laughable. We must do something rather than submit to this nonsense. Where there is a will, there is a way. I honestly believe a way could be found to circumvent EU state aid rules, particularly if there was a commitment on the part of the Government to do so. It would be money in the bank from the point of view of the State. I have not even mentioned the employment that would be created for building workers and the savings to which this would give rise within the social welfare system and so on. It would be a win-win if we were to decide to do as I suggest. That is what amendment No. 11 is about and some of us on this side of the House have been screaming for the Government to do it. Let us accept the amendment, establish what is suggested as a strategic priority for the State, its citizens and the economy and begin the process of investing the money directly without having to depend on cowboy private developers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Probably, but we want to hear what the Minister of State has to say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are hoping to get answers to them from the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought it was the case that he would respond and then we would do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to hear from the Minister of State about the problem the Government has with taking on board what we are asking for. I have never heard a convincing argument from that side of the House about why we should not and cannot do that. It is not that we want to take political potshots and accuse the Minister of State of ideological this, that or the other. I simply cannot get my head around how the Government does not see this. We had denial for two and half years. Then, in recent months, finally, there has been an acknowledgement that we have a major problem. Of course the problem has been absolutely staring us in the face. It is spilling out onto the streets and it is a disaster. There are 50 families in south Dublin in cars; they do not even have emergency accommodation. It is an absolute disaster. Finally there is an awareness that we must do something. Is the Minister of State seriously telling us that we simply have to wait for the market, private investors and hedge funds? That simply will not happen. The idea is that by putting the money into big public building programmes of local authority housing now we would see multiple benefits. Can the Minister of State explain why the Government has set its face against that? What is the problem? It was done before and it can be done again. No one else is going to do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did those students all have to wear Coca Cola T-shirts?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, on the regional development amendments which I believe were championed by Deputy Deasy, and which the Government appears to have taken on board, I believe he is absolutely right. Far too often in Irish politics, in my observation, there has been a city against country, or rural against urban, fake war or fake debate which is sometimes used cynically by politicians on either side of the supposed rural-urban divide to play people off against one another. Sadly, some politicians on the left - not our bit of the left but other bits - have gone along with that, rather pathetically in my opinion, in a cheap effort to buy votes in urban areas. They will point the finger at the people in the rural areas and say they are getting everything, while politicians in the rural areas point the finger point back and say they are getting it all in the cities. It is a cheap political game, but when one actually looks at the issue seriously, one can see we need balanced regional development. I have no doubt Deputy Deasy's motives are honourable ones and involve looking at the issue seriously. As a Dublin Deputy, I am deeply worried about the over-centralisation of everything in Dublin, which is not good. It is not just bad for the countryside; it is bad for Dublin. It produces a whole series of ills and evils, one of which is the craziness we are seeing in the property market again, which produces issues like the housing crisis because everything gets centralised in one place. Of course, this is the way the market works. The people with the big money, like lemmings, chase each other to where they think they can make the most money, regardless of the wider interests of society, the economy and balanced development - not just at a regional level but balanced development in every sense of the word - and regardless of the need to make sure that investment is directed and planned in such a way as to have a sustainable, cohesive and balanced economy and society. Of course, the big difference between the big money people and the lemming is that when the lemming charges over the cliff, it is the lemming that goes over the cliff, but with the big money people, it is we who go over the cliff, and the big money people win every time. I believe, therefore, that these amendments point towards the need not to have profit and the bottom line as the main, or only, criteria in deciding where investment goes. The starting point of the strategic investment fund should be a recognition of market failure and of the market's lack of concern with balanced development and with strategic priorities from the point of view of society and the economy as a whole. Whether it is in ensuring we have balanced regional development or the necessary infrastructure we need to make a society work properly, such as social housing, that is what the strategic investment fund should be about. That emphasis on regional development is critically important. It is good that the Government has acknowledged that point and added an amendment to that effect. However, what I do not understand is why, if the Government sees a need for that, it does not wish to spell out the need for balance in other areas, such as housing and critical infrastructure. I just do not understand it. Is it because the Government is sensitive to the accusation that it is deserting its rural base and, therefore, it feels it has to include this, but there is less concern when it comes to other areas where balance and planning, to use an old-fashioned word, are needed? We need planning in investment because the market is not interested in rational planning; it is only interested in charging after the dollar, with the consequence of over-investment in one area, whether geographic or sectoral, and under-investment in other areas, whether geographic or sectoral. That is the problem. I fear that while the idea behind this Bill is a very good one, and one that is to be welcomed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is. We are 150% in favour of strategic investment. Indeed, it was part of our policy platform before the last election, and we were very glad when the Government talked about it. However, the difficulty is that there seems to be a whole series of caveats and qualifications about the need, essentially, to bring in the private sector and to make its investments conditional on getting the private sector on board. I believe the Government will face two problems in that regard. First, the private sector companies do not want to get on board in regard to things that are not sure-fire profit winners for them.This will cause real difficulty in actually getting projects going or finishing them, as we have seen with public private partnerships, or where the deal we must do involves the public giving away way too much. We take all the risk and they take all the profit, as often happens with these PPPs. We do not know anything about it anyway because it is all surrounded by commercial secrecy. We cannot find any information until the whole thing goes belly-up. Those are real and serious problems and flaws at the heart of this legislation.  The section that allows the Minister to use this fund to bail out the banks is extraordinary. What was the ESM for? It is bad enough that we cannot get retrospective bank recapitalisation, but I thought the whole idea of the ESM was that we would never have to do this again because there would now be a fund across Europe that would ensure this did not have to happen. Actually, we discover that the Government is preparing again for massive bailouts. One of the things that is worth underlining when we are looking at all of this and when people mention the collapse of the National Pensions Reserve Fund from €24 billion to €6.9 billion, or whatever it is now, is that when the Government says, as it does with regard to social housing, that we cannot take on a project on a 100% basis because we can get double the amount if we get co-funding from the private sector, and that this is critical because otherwise it would be put on our balance sheet, is that the debt is the reason we are prohibited from borrowing more money to do this ourselves. We could use our money to leverage money and we would not need the private sector. The reason we cannot do it is the massive debt and the fact that we have a 120% debt-to-GDP ratio and a big deficit. We have all those things because we bailed out the banks. Otherwise, there would not be a problem. A country that does not have a massive debt on its back and a deficit, all of which were incurred because of the bank bailout, does not have those restrictions on it in terms of public investment. We have them, so we are required essentially to privatise or semi-privatise our investment programme because we bailed out the banks, incurred massive debts because of it and ran down our National Pensions Reserve Fund. That is the sort of vicious circle and vice grip the troika have got us in, which the previous and current Government have allowed them to do, such that we cannot engage in the public investment we really need in infrastructure, housing or balanced regional development. The idea that we would allow ourselves to do all that again is just crazy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We agree on the need for strategic investment, but there are serious questions about whether this fund can deliver such investment. Even if the Minister of State says he wants that to happen and acknowledges the need for regional development and the need to invest in areas such as social housing or vital infrastructure, the money people want to know the bottom line and what they will get out of the arrangement. This is also the problem with Deputy Deasy's proposal. While the Government and the Department of Finance might hopefully, because of this, say they must consider regional development in the allocation of investments and so on, the same private sector that has over-centralised in Dublin and a few urban centres will say, "Sorry, we are not interested," and the Government will be hamstrung because it has to have co-financing. That is the problem. We will still be hostages to what the private sector wants. One of the issues on which I cut my political teeth was the Dún Laoghaire baths. We had what was supposedly an ideological argument about public private partnerships. Most people just wanted something done on the site. They did not care whether the money came from private or public sources. The council at the time said it had to be done through a PPP because it was Government policy. We said that if it was a PPP, the private operator would insist on making so much money as a condition of its investment that the public would get nothing out of it, and that was exactly what happened.The private company proposed a 19-storey office block when the people wanted a swimming pool. That is the problem, and it will be the problem with this fund. Even if there are good intentions, if projects are conditional on co-financing with the private sector, nothing may happen, or what happens may not be of any use to society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely right to ring the alarm bells that there is a real and serious threat to the free travel pass given the review of the scheme, talk of there not being enough money to meet increased demand and cuts in the subsidies to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. Aside from all that, when the Government says it has completely protected the free travel scheme to date, even that is not true. Free travel passes are already being taken away from people wherever routes have been outsourced, including national routes and those in Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Operators in Cavan, Longford and other areas have stated recently that they cannot afford to run the free travel pass scheme and have withdrawn from it. The Government is planning to outsource 10% of the orbital routes in Dublin. It is already clear from the evidence coming in from private operators who were able to provide a free travel scheme that they cannot now afford to do it. This is exactly what will happen when the orbital routes are implemented. My area will be particularly badly hit with the outsourcing of the 59, 65, 75 and 111 routes to private companies which will not be able to afford to run the free travel pass scheme unless the Government gives a commitment. Such a commitment has clearly not been given to date as some of the private operators are already pulling out of the scheme. They say a cast-iron condition for the outsourcing of routes will be a requirement that tenderers operate the free travel pass scheme. I bet the Government will not demand that. If it does not, it is the stealth removal of the free travel scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:“ “ancient woodlands” means those woodlands which have had continuous tree cover since 1650 or before and which are most likely to have arisen naturally and to be descended from Ireland’s original forests;”.Some 80 to 90 amendments to this Bill have been tabled, many of which I submitted. I acknowledge the work of the Woodland League and the Environmental Pillar, whose greater knowledge and expertise than mine has informed the majority of my amendments. Amendment No. 1 is one of the most important of the amendments and seeks to include a definition of "ancient woodlands" in the definitions section and spell out what protection of the ancient woodlands as a key objective of the Bill would entail. The objectives of the Bill are set out on page 8. It is important to protect our ancient woodlands for many reasons. The thrust of many of my amendments is that we need substantially to change our forestry model away from a purely industrial, commercially focused model to one that emphasises the importance of our native species and the need to expand and regenerate our native woodlands. The importance the public places on this was evident in the movement that developed around the campaign against the planned sell-off of the harvesting rights of Coillte. People came out, marched and protested to indicate their opposition to that plan for many reasons. When people became aware of the possibility of the sale of the harvesting rights to our public forests, they were concerned because they saw forestry and our native woodlands as tied up with our identity and as a symbol of our culture. They felt it had to be protected and that failure to do so would be a terrible dereliction of our duty to defend what is unique, important and special about our culture. They felt our native forests were critical to this. We were a forest nation, as one of my environmental friends always tells me. The country was almost completely covered with oak and other native species. When the British came they destroyed our ancient woodlands. The amendment mentions the year 1650 as a benchmark date to identify the ancient woodlands because that is the year William Petty produced maps, which are the earliest recorded maps of what little was left of our ancient woodlands after their destruction by Oliver Cromwell. When this was explained to me, I did not know that William Petty gave us the word "petty". It is an interesting historical fact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is another contribution we have made to the global lexicon. It also demonstrates the historical, heritage and cultural importance of the matter and how it intersects with a defining moment in our history. Oliver Cromwell understood that as part of destroying resistance to the plantations, he had to fell the forests. This was to give the lands to the soldiers who fought with him but also as part of quelling resistance to his agenda. The imperative to protect our ancient woodlands is part of protecting what we were and are and what we hope to protect and maintain in terms of our culture and heritage. This is not just a nostalgic aspiration, although culture and heritage is not just about nostalgia but is critical. It is also very important in terms of the project of protecting, developing and improving sustainable forestry. The ancient woodlands are the seed banks of native Irish forestry species. If we do not protect these, we will lose the genetic foundations of Irish forestry. One illustration of the consequences of disease is what happened in Gougane Barra recently, where a shocking decision was taken to cut down huge numbers of trees on the grounds that it was required to protect the trees from disease. We can discuss this later when we deal with the public consultation aspects of the Bill and the lack of sufficiently robust public consultation requirements regarding felling. I am informed by people who know more about these matters than I that there was no hard scientific proof of the existence of the disease. We can discuss it later. In so far as there has been some speculation as to how these diseases reach our trees and forests, a considerable belief exists that it is due to the fact that we are planting foreign, alien species that are not appropriate and make our forests more vulnerable to disease than they would be if we concentrated on native species that are perfectly suited to our climate and environment and that were, historically the trees of this country.They are more resistant to disease and more resilient in the face of disease threats. If we fail to protect adequately the remnants and pockets of ancient woodlands, we threaten the genetic storehouse of the native species that are appropriate to Ireland and which we will need to expand if we are to move in a more sustainable direction in forestry should we become more vulnerable to diseases associated with imported species. That is another important reason we need a specific acknowledgement of the importance of ancient woodlands and specific management plans for those ancient woodlands that still exist. They exist in most other countries in Europe where there are specific management plans for them. Such plans do not exist here. We do not have specific plans to ensure the protection of our ancient woodlands. That is what these amendments call for. I do not see why it poses any problem for the Government to accept these amendments. To do so would be in line with the priorities of many people in the country on the importance of our ancient woodlands. It would be in the interests of good and sustainable forest management as we move into the future. Those are the arguments. I hope the Minister of State will consider accepting the group of amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can discuss Gougane Barra a little more as we go through the Bill, particularly having regard to the issue of public consultation. This was not ancient woodland per se although it was an ancient woodland site. I have heard an argument from an international tree pathologist who has looked at the site and had been at it before the felling. She said there was no sign of this die-back at all. Some of the questions I have asked about this have been answered with references to things like aerial flights having seen from the air scorching which was indicative of the presence of this disease. I am not a scientist or sufficiently expert to know if these are signs. However, I have reported this to people who know more than I do and they said that is not conclusive evidence of anything. I have made further inquiries about precisely what the scientific evidence and adjudication was and how it would compare with other places where the disease has been found. I asked if the extent to which it was found here justified the huge felling we saw. Before we get to discuss it in more detail as we go along, I will brief myself fully. I was not sure the issue would come up tonight. I am open minded about it. I am not an expert, but I have to take seriously concerns raised by people who are quite knowledgeable in the area and ensure we have proper justification for a very significant and, at one level, shocking act. I have been to Gougane Barra many times. It is a beautiful forest park and the fact that so much of it was cut down and is closed to the public is a very serious matter. On the more substantial matter, while all of the things the Minister of State has said are true, this is about specifically including in a Bill on forestry an acknowledgement of the critical importance of ancient woodlands and putting in place specific management plans, which we do not have at present, directed toward their protection. It is not just a general conservation Bill but a specific forestry Bill.
