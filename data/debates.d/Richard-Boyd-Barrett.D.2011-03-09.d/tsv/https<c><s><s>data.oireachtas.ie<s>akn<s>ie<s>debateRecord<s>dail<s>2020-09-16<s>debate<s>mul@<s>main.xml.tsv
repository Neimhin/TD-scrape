RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be moving my amendment to the motion. I will be sharing time with Deputy Barry. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward its motion. I agree with everything in it and I hope Sinn Féin agrees with the additions I propose to make to it. These include a very specific step-down subsidy for taxi drivers to allow them to return to work without losing their pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, if they earn more than that payment. My additions also include grants to cover the ongoing costs of insurance, car loan repayments, licence renewal and fuel, all of which drivers simply cannot cover, even as these debts and costs accumulate, given that the work now available to drivers has decreased by 60%, 70% or 80% and will remain sparse as a result of public health measures. Taxi drivers understand these measures and have supported them but they are the economic victims of them and need supports for their support for the public health measures.  I have also added that there should be a complete moratorium on the issuing of new licences during the pandemic and that there should be a scheme under which the NTA would buy back the licences of taxi drivers who may, for health or other reasons, wish to exit the industry so that they can cover the investment they made to get into the industry in the first place. These are in addition to the other demands included in the motion. Yesterday's magnificent taxi protest was the biggest such protest that has ever taken place in this State. It dwarfed the expectations of the organisers. In every sense, it was a brilliant show of solidarity. Men and women, black, white and brown, were united as taxi drivers whose livelihoods have been devastated as a result of public health measures. They are now pleading with the Government but soon they will demanding that the Government reciprocate the solidarity they have shown with real supports.  I stress to the Minister of State that the taxi drivers' first impulse was not to protest. I know this because, months ago, I met the four groups that organised it to discuss what to do about their plight. They asked us to request that they be allowed appear before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and that I bring their demands to that committee, as I had brought them to the current and past Taoiseach, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Minister for Finance. They hoped that, if they set out their plight, a reasonable Government would understand and respond.They hoped they would not need to protest and debated long and hard about doing so at all. It finally became clear that, despite a lot of tea and sympathy from the Government and the Covid-19 committee, absolutely nothing was forthcoming for them in the July stimulus package and there were no clear commitments to give them income subsidies or provide access to the grants they need to cover their costs. The Government was not going to issue a moratorium on licences, extend the ten-year rule for the replacement of their vehicles or, critically, dissolve the Taxi Advisory Committee, which has failed as a representative organisation because it had barely any taxi representatives on it in the first place. It became clear that a genuinely representative national taxi transport forum where the voices of the taxi drivers themselves can be heard and where their representatives put forward their case was not going to be established. The Government has ignored all of this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am taking seven minutes and my colleague is taking three. The Government has ignored all of these issues and the sword of Damocles now hangs over taxi drivers because of the plan to cut the pandemic unemployment payment tomorrow. That will also affect other workers. I have just come from a demonstration of events workers. Some 22,000 taxi drivers and their families and 35,000 events workers, musicians, crew and so on will feel the axe fall upon them. Their incomes are going to be slashed on top of their already devastated livelihoods. They are left between the devil and the deep blue sea. They must decide whether to stay on a reduced payment which will plunge them into poverty or return to work where only 20% or 30% of their usual work is available and be plunged into poverty in that way, while losing access to the payment. What part of "income subsidy" does the Government not understand? The Government does understand the concept for big business. Billions of euro have been thrown, in double quick time, at big, often profitable corporations with much larger capacities to absorb the costs accumulated during the pandemic because they have big cash reserves. Those sorts of companies get billions of euro but the taxi drivers, events, arts and music people, who have no shock absorbers or buffers, so to speak, get nothing. It is not good enough and I know, because I have been working closely with them, that the taxi groups will be back. This Government must respond to their just and fair demands and show them some respect for what they do. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, must learn that taxi drivers are an integral part of the public transport system; he does not seem to understand that. Taxi drivers take us home to our doors late at night. They offer the only door-to-door transport service that exists. They take people from airports, kids to school and disabled and elderly people to places where buses cannot. They work unsociable hours for very little. All they are asking is for a helping hand and some measures that would not cost the Government anything in order to help them through this time and show them a bit of respect. That is what we are asking. We do not need more sympathy or this frankly insulting Government amendment which should be withdrawn because it does not address their concerns. They will be back outside Leinster House, surrounding these buildings, in the next short while if the Government does not show them some respect, give them some support and withdraw the threat of cutting their incomes tomorrow because it will plunge them further onto their knees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies if I missed it but which Cabinet committee or group, if any, is dealing with arts and culture? I would hate to think that this area has been overlooked, particularly given the really dire plight of performers, musicians, arts workers, crews and events people. The latter group are out protesting because, as with other groups, their incomes and livelihoods have been hammered by the current crisis. Very little support has been forthcoming, especially for the events sector. Are any of the Taoiseach's committees looking at this area because it is urgent? Does the Taoiseach really think it is a good idea to have a new oversight committee chaired by Mr. Martin Fraser to finesse the public health advice received from NPHET? Is this really the way to deal with the huge inconsistencies and confusion around public health advice? We now have the expert advisory group, NPHET, this new committee and the Government involved. The roadmap says that people should not leave Dublin, the Minister for Health said that they can leave, the Taoiseach said last night that he was not sure and then the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe said this morning that they should not leave the city. Do we really need even further layers of confusion piled on top of that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To follow on from Deputy McDonald's question, there is not only the issue of pupils who may have underlying conditions but there are also parents who are worried and who have serious underlying conditions. It is not clear to me, and I have had quite a few calls about this, what those parents should do. They do not know what to do or whether there is a danger in them sending their children to school. We need support and we need advice for people about what they should do in that situation. The Department and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, have agreed a plan to monitor school compliance with Covid-19 restrictions but they do not intend to publish the outcome of those inspections or, it seems, share that information with, for example, the teachers themselves, but only with principals and the boards. This does not seem to me to be acceptable.As well as principals, and this extends to all workplaces but certainly in schools, surely there should be health and safety representatives appointed in every school among the school staff who will also receive the information if there are problems and who can represent the staff in terms of any concerns they have about failure to apply public health guidelines, restrictions, distancing and so forth properly in schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The inspections and monitoring.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit is an all-Ireland party. We believe we must move to a united Ireland and end partition. A number of groups and parties in the House would say they subscribe to that view in one way or another. This is a very opportune time in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and how it has highlighted the irrationality of partition when we need an all-Ireland approach to health and dealing with the virus.I am from the James Connolly school of fighting for a different republic. Connolly understood that if one was going to win people over to the idea of a united Ireland, it had to be a better and different island. It should not just be the pushing together of two states which have been dysfunctional in many ways for most of their history. It has to be a better place. One of the key areas the Taoiseach's unit should be looking at is an all-Ireland health service. Why would anybody in his or her right mind wish to be part of this State when he or she sees a two-tier, dysfunctional, under-resourced health system with massive waiting lists, where nobody is really in charge because half of it is privatised and another bit of it is run by this or that religious organisation? I wish to give a shout out to the all-Ireland national health service campaign that has been established. I ask the Taoiseach and his unit to examine this. Looking seriously at establishing an all-Ireland national health service that works would take us a considerable way towards convincing people of the argument for a united Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there time left?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not rehearse the despicable treatment of more than 1,000 Debenhams workers by Debenhams. It has been well rehearsed in the House. I thank the Independent Group for tabling this motion. We also put forward a motion before the summer recess. All agree that what Debenhams has done to its workers is absolutely shocking, but what we must discuss is the unwillingness of the Government to do anything to rectify that injustice. The amendment from the Government is just an insult. It uses technicalities and jargon to hide from its responsibilities. I will cut a long story short. The reason this and previous Governments did not legislate for the Duffy Cahill report and to close down the loopholes that allow Debenhams to treat workers in this despicable way is that company law is designed in such a way as to make it attractive for companies that wish to behave in this way. It is even linked to the way in which those same companies avoid paying tax. It is all about subsidiaries and hiding assets and profits so they do not have to pay tax and have no obligations to workers. That is how things are set up in this country. This and successive Governments did not want to do anything about it because, effectively, the IDA goes around the world and tells companies they should come to Ireland because they can get away with murder on tax and in how they treat workers. To cut a long story short, that is what is happening. Then the Government hides behind nonsense. It claims that this is not the same as Clerys. It is not exactly the same, but there is a similar point in that Clerys also tried to hide the asset it had. It had a trading company and a property company. It used the same technique as Debenhams is using now, by taking over bits of the assets of the company and giving them to other businesses even though the real activity is here. The Government says it only has small bits of assets, or whatever the phrase is. There are assets of approximately €25 million, for a start. That is not small. It would cost approximately €10 million to give the workers the two plus two they deserve. Then one can go after the €25 million in assets. It is not true that nothing can be done. The liquidator offered them an insulting €1 million, but the fact that the liquidator could offer them €1 million proves that it can do it. If it can offer them €1 million, it can offer them €10 million against the assets. Let us not forget that in 2018 the online trading company, all from business done here, made approximately €30 million and the estimated figure at present is approximately €40 million. There are plenty of assets if the Government is willing to do something about the accounting tricks these companies operate to hide their assets and then dump workers on the scrap heap. The Revenue Commissioners could do that. Let us also not forget an important point made by the workers. They have paid multiples of the €10 million they are seeking for justice in tax to the Revenue Commissioners over the ten, 20 or 30 years they have been working. They deserve some support from the Government now. It should step in, give them the two plus two and then chase the assets of Debenhams which we know exist.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry, unless Deputy Paul Murphy comes to the Chamber, in which case we will change it slightly. This place, I have to say, makes me laugh or cry sometimes. We have had an hour of Government speakers before we get reached, by which time the Minister - no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Troy - is gone. That is what the changes to the speaking order were designed to do. They were designed to knock down a significant section of the Opposition to the point where it is lost in the order, and to allow the Government to be both the Government and the Opposition. We have this fascinating situation where the Government refuses to give an income subsidy to taxi drivers and entertainment, music and arts workers, and intends to cut their incomes tomorrow, even though Government measures mean they cannot return to work or that if they do so, they will lose all their payment, but there is nothing even close to a viable income out there because their sectors have been impacted by Government measures.The Government is going to go ahead and do this. We then had a Government spokesperson speak after a Member of the Government and before the Opposition, and say how terrible that is. The Government is the Government and the Opposition. It is brilliant. That speech should be played out in, I think, Finglas, which was mentioned. The Deputy said that he is standing up for the taxi drivers, but he is part of a Government that is going to slash their payment tomorrow. He also said he is standing up for the arts workers, but, again, he is part of a Government that is going to slash their income tomorrow, has ignored their calls and is only now talking about them because earlier today we had the biggest ever demonstration of taxi drivers in the history of this State. I note Deputy Paul Murphy has arrived, so I will take only five minutes. This is an unbelievable example of speaking with a forked tongue. These people do not want tea and sympathy. They have stated their case. I recall raising the issue of taxi drivers and the arts and music workers during Leaders' Questions last March and the Minister at the time in the previous Government looked at me as though I had two heads, wondering why I was talking about them. I had to fight to get both groups an opportunity to present to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. I spent weeks arguing in online meetings for the taxi drivers and the events workers to be allowed to appear before that committee because they are disproportionately hit. It was a hard fight to get them in. I eventually got them in during July. There was a lot of tea and sympathy at the Covid committee but nothing was committed to. I would like to know if the Government is going to give the taxi drivers an income subsidy. I do not see what has changed. Is the Government going to give the events and arts workers and musicians an income subsidy because nothing has changed for them since it introduced the €350 payment? Nothing has changed. In fact, the situation is looking more precarious for them as we move to level 3, level 4 or God knows what. Why was it okay to give them €350 and now it is okay to cut their payment? Similarly, with the Aer Lingus workers or people in similar sectors and people working in cafés, bars and so on who are on the wage subsidy payment, the Government is going to cut their income. The companies get the money no problem. All they have to do is sign a declaration stating that their earnings are down by 30%. The arts workers' earnings are down 70% and the taxi drivers' earnings are down 70% but they get nothing. Aer Lingus declares that its revenues are down by 30% and there is no problem with giving them money. When it comes to what has happened to the workers on the ground, the Government has no idea what to do. There is no oversight of whether they get top-ups or whether on the days they are not working they actually get their social welfare forms signed. The ordinary person does not get looked after. Tea and sympathy is all they get until they take to the streets and put a bit of pressure on the Government. The only lesson one can draw from that is that taxi drivers will need to come out onto the streets until the Government does give them something, as will the arts, aviation and other sectors who clearly are not in it together with some of the others who are being cosseted by this Government.
