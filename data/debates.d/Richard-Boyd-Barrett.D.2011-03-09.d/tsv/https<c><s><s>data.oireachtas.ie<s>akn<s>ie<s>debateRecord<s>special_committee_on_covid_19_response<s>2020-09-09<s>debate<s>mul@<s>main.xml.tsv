I very much welcome the part of the Law Society's submission which suggests action should be taken to accelerate the end of direct provision and the suggestion in terms of ensuring the resources necessary for social distancing in overcrowded in housing conditions. That is very positive. Following everything that has been said about confusion over legal requirements as against guidance, about the need for proportionality, if I understand correctly, and about the need for things to be clearly communicated and so on, the witnesses may know there is a motion in the Dáil to deal with section 31A of the Health Act, which gives sweeping powers to the Minister for Health, and the statutory instrument which relates to things like limiting numbers at gatherings in homes and various other restrictions.Do the witnesses believe that those emergency amendments to the Health Act, and this statutory instrument, are problematic legally and that they sail close to the wind or beyond the boundaries they think need to be observed around legality, constitutionality and ensuring there is public trust in the laws and regulations being used to deal with Covid-19? I would also like some clarity on the next issue. I very much believe that people should adhere to rational public health guidelines. Several of the witnesses made observations about the need for the Oireachtas committees to function, the legal system to function and so on. The right to protest is also a very important part of the functioning of our democracy. People who refuse to socially distance on protests and who do not wear masks are utterly reckless but I also believe that it would be completely wrong - and I am not even sure what the legal position is at the moment - to prevent protests where people socially distance and wear masks, given the importance of the right to demonstrate and to protest in a functioning democracy. I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on that. What are the constitutional and legal powers now? Has the Garda the right to stop protests? I will give one example but will not mention the group involved. One group was planning a protest soon and were told by An Garda Síochána that if they organised a protest they would all be arrested. This was despite the fact they had made it very clear they were going to socially distance, wear masks and control numbers and regulate the protest. They were just told "No, if you go ahead we will arrest you." Has the Garda the power to do that? Do the witnesses believe this to be proportionate? Does it relate to any of the concerns the witnesses have expressed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to SI 326 of 2020, which deals with issues such as the number of people gathering in private dwellings, does the Law Society of Ireland believe there is, at least, a question mark over the legality or the constitutionally of these kinds of provisions?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My main question refers back to the issue of the right to protest. However, I wish to say in passing that we should be careful about the use of the term "common sense". The great Italian Marxist intellectual, Antonio Gramsci, pointed out that there is a big difference between good sense and common sense. It was common sense at one time that the world was flat but good sense said it was round. We should be very cautious because many common sense truths turn out to be not very good sense when one looks beneath the surface or applies scientific or intellectual rigour. In addition, while any institution, judiciary or otherwise might strive for independence, to simply assert its independence is not helping to uphold its credibility because an intellectual examination of that assertion would say no human being is fully independent or insulated from social, economic or other influences. My main question seeks clarification of what I have heard from Dr. Kenny, the Law Society or anybody else who wishes to comment. Does the Government legally have the right to prevent protests at present? I stress that any protest that occurs should be socially distant and people should wear masks. As well as the legal position on that, given the constitutional freedom of assembly and so forth and given that the witnesses say it is very important that the Dáil and its committees function and that the Judiciary functions in this situation, how important do they think it is that the right to freedom of assembly to protest and so forth be protected in this context, albeit with adherence to social distancing guidelines?
