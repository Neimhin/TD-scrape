RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Friday, in the District Court beside the Four Courts, five households - families and individuals - will taste the very bitter fruits of this Government's failure to protect tenants from ruthless vulture funds and against no-fault evictions and to offer them alternatives when they are faced with homelessness, either in terms of social housing or private rental accommodation that they could afford and is within HAP limits. The families and individuals living in St. Helen's Court will face an application by a vulture fund, Mill Street Projects, to evict them into homelessness this Friday. These are decent, ordinary working people who have done absolutely nothing wrong. They have always paid their rent. They are still paying their rent. They have never been guilty of any antisocial behaviour. They had a community, one that has been wrecked. There used to be 20 tenants in it but others have been bullied out by two successive vulture funds. The tenants have been tortured by these vulture funds over four years and now face homelessness. This is because of the Government's refusal to ban no-fault evictions. There is no justification that should allow the law to facilitate a vulture fund, for no other reason than profit, to put people on the street but our law allows it. There is absolutely no justification for the fact that in the same block there are 12 and now maybe 15 empty apartments beside the apartments from which these tenants are now to be evicted which the landlord claimed at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, it wanted to rent but, strangely enough, it will not rent to the tenants it is about to evict. Those apartments have been allowed to sit there for two years. I have flagged this again and again. Why are compulsory purchase powers not used to get hold of these empty apartments that could not only prevent people going on the street but could house 12 to 15 other families? What alternatives are available to these tenants? Under the HAP limits, the individuals in St. Helen's Court can seek a maximum rent of €990 for a one-bedroom apartment. In Dún Laoghaire today, the cheapest one-bedroom apartment is €1,300. The next one is €1,600 and the next one after that is €1,900. The maximum the families can look for is €1,900 for a three-bedroom apartment. The cheapest available in Dún Laoghaire at the moment is €2,400. All of these tenants are goosed and will be forced into homelessness because we have failed to protect not just these tenants but any other tenants faced with this situation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the tenants, I invite the Taoiseach, members of Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and anyone else who can to get down to the courts to support those tenants. There will be a solidarity rally on Friday. None of the things the Taoiseach has just mentioned would protect these tenants. The tenancies of indefinite duration still allow a vulture fund to evict tenants under these circumstances. I do not buy the constitutional obstacles to protecting tenants. During Covid the Government brought in an eviction ban under pressure. What happened? The number of people going into homelessness fell from over 10,000 to 7,000 and would have kept falling except for the fact the Government lifted that ban. It was able to do it during Covid; it can do it now. Why does it not do it? The Tyrrelstown amendment provides that if there are more than ten tenants in a multi-unit complex, they cannot be evicted. This vulture fund tried to evict ten, did not get away with it, came back and evicted fewer than ten and then bullied the rest out. If it can be done for ten tenants, it can be done for anybody. The Government must protect them from unfair evictions. It should not allow vulture funds to evict people for profit and it must control rents so that the landlords cannot charge these extortionate rents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is poor comfort for decent tenants being evicted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is poor comfort.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The north Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, scandal brought to light a much longer-term scandal of the over-medication of young people compensating for the chronic lack of staffing and resources in our mental health services. I want to ask particularly about the utter lack of community psychology and primary care psychology. One aspect of this, and I have been trying to point this out for a long time, is that CAMHS gets overrun, and often with referrals that probably should not even go to it, because of the lack of community psychology and talk, occupational, speech and language therapy. This is not just for child and adolescent community psychology, or the lack of it, but also for others. I am aware of a case at the moment of a man whose doctors referred him for psychology. He was told by community psychology in my area that he will have to wait six years for a psychologist. What happened to primary care? It does not exist in the area of psychology. As I have raised repeatedly with the Taoiseach, why do we make it difficult for young people who want to be psychologists to qualify because we do not fund educational and counselling psychology? We have massive fees of up to €15,000 and similar obstacles in the area of psychiatry for people being qualified.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach referred earlier to the pension age in the North being increased to 66, which is certainly not a good thing. I would suggest that hiding behind that fact is not an excuse for not returning the pension age to 65. This is a point I have often made to the Taoiseach. Surely if we want to encourage people to be part of a united Ireland, we need to make being part of a united Ireland a more attractive option. It should be a better and different place for ordinary people and that is a good reason for us to restore the pension age to 65. In any event, raising the pension age was simply an austerity measure that was brought in during an economic crisis precipitated by bankers and developers, an emergency which has now passed. In France, the pension age is 62, while it is 65 in Belgium, 62 in Malta and 65 in Austria. There is simply no justification for raising the pension age. We should restore it to 65 in the interests of fairness for working people.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Think about a united Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There have been many requests, including those I have made, that the Taoiseach's Department take responsibility for an area that crosses many departmental demarcations as a result of which there is no proper integrated and cohesive approach, namely, disability. The Taoiseach has to look at this again. I will give him a simple example. I have raised ACTS with him a few times, the door-to-door transport service for people in wheelchairs and with disabilities in my area. It could go under at the end of this month for the lack of €50,000 and the replacement of some of its buses. That voluntary-run, door-to-door service is advertised on Transport for Ireland as a service available for people with mobility problems who cannot use the normal transport system. It does not get one cent from the Department of Transport and is about to collapse, because it is voluntary run, for the lack of €50,000 for running costs and money to replace some of its buses for some of the most vulnerable people. Why on earth is there no joined-up thinking between transport and disability, for example, to maintain an absolutely critical service for such vulnerable people? That is an example of why we need the Taoiseach's Department to spearhead the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and a cohesive approach to disability services.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the day that is in it, it might be worth paraphrasing Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's Ulysses when he famously said, "History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake." Covid-19 was certainly a nightmare from which we are all trying to awake. One of the great things about Ulysses, of which I am a big fan, is that Joyce takes as his characters the ordinary people, whereas in all previous literature of the 19th century, in novels and so on, it was the aristocrats, elites and upper middle classes. Joyce takes a hammer to that. In the opening chapter, Joyce brilliantly describes the art he wants to make as being "the cracked lookingglass of a servant," in other words, smashing the normal mirror we put up to ourselves, which does not actually give expression to the ordinary working people and making their voices heard. Of course, the servants, downtrodden, oppressed and minorities feature as central characters in Ulysses. That is exactly what happened during Covid-19 and we need to remember the lessons. I want to shout out that we will remember those lessons for the musicians who live precarious, often impoverished lives, but who enrich our society no end. Just because Covid is over does not mean the need for a renewed support for musicians is over. They are asking that some of the supports will be maintained and that we recognise going forward that we will give them those additional supports to truly value our artists, musicians and so on. The Minister of State might take note that some individual musicians, taxi drivers and so on were refused the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, on the grounds that they had not made certain PRSI contributions. When some of them checked into that fact, they got it rectified because they were not properly awarded the PRSI contributions they should have been while they were receiving the PUP. It seems that may be quite a widespread administrative mistake. I would like the Minister of State to look into that and rectify it in order that people who should have been getting the PUP, particularly over the Christmas months and weeks, will actually be awarded the backdated PUP they deserve.
