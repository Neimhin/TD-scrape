RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I worry about the constant use of terms like "prudence", "fear of overheating", "caution" and so on. Does the Minister not believe the greatest challenges facing us now from a social and economic point of view include, at the top of the list, housing? This is now a severe crisis that is making it impossible for people to live here, especially young people. In consequence, we have to significantly ramp up from the level where we are to make it affordable and possible for people to live here. The same applies in areas like education, water infrastructure and public transport. There is talk about the fear of overheating and the need for caution but all these areas are suffering major deficits in investment. Does the Minister not believe we need radical increases in levels of investment in these areas? Otherwise, we are actually going to exacerbate the overheating measures because we will not have sufficient people here. We are now talking about labour shortages. We must ask ourselves how we are to resolve labour shortages. It seems to me we can only resolve labour shortages if we educate far more young people to do the jobs that need to be done, get people back into this country and prevent them leaving. We are in something of a vicious circle in that sense. At the heart of resolving the vicious circle is the question of housing. It is not simply a matter of absolute supply, although we must have that too, but the supply of affordable housing. Does it concern the Minister that the last time the supply of housing increased, price went up as well and it led us into a big crash? There are real signs that could be happening again. We need a far greater supply and we must have a plan for that but, crucially, that supply cannot remain unaffordable. We cannot have a situation where supply increases but price increases with it. Otherwise we will simply be doing what we did the last time. Does the Minister recognise that as a problem? Does the Minister fear that we could be about to repeat the mistakes of the past?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While keeping on the housing thread, I will speak about one other significant bugbear. Every publicly-built house that remains in public ownership requires an initial capital cost but then revenue starts to come back. In other words, that revenue replaces current expenditure, which is now going out in housing assistance payments or rental accommodation scheme payments, with a capital expenditure that is once-off and then brings back revenue. If the Minister is concerned about excessive spending, why does he not significantly ramp up in this regard, with the intention of eliminating spending on social housing that will continue to escalate as current expenditure? The majority of the Rebuilding Ireland plan, even with the somewhat increased plans for public housing, remains dependent on major levels of current expenditure going out in the form of RAS and HAP. That represents a drain on the public finances. Why does the Minister not radically shift on that? I am asking not only from a public housing or social point of view but from a financial point of view. Is it not better to start to eliminate or phase out massive annual expenditure going out to the private sector in favour of having a far greater stock of public housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair. I will continue on the housing vein. Given we all accept there may be capacity problems in ramping up the construction sector, what measures does the Minister intend to take to ensure no housing is built that is surplus to requirements and that the housing that is built is the housing we need, that is, is affordable housing? I know of a number of estates that are being built by the private sector in which the price range starts at €650,000 and goes up to €1 million. Is that not a waste of building capacity? The building that we need is public and affordable housing, namely, housing that is either built for the public sector directly or is affordable. Does the Minister intend to address that problem? Does the Minister think it is very foolish to be giving tax breaks, supports and incentives to builders who may build housing like that, when we need housing that is public and affordable? On the subject of housing assistance payments and the rental accommodation scheme, to clarify for Deputy Bailey and for the Minister my question is far from being a one-liner. The Rebuilding Ireland plan, if it succeeds in its own terms, envisages 87,000 of the 133,000 housing units being annual expenditures, with only 50,000 being capital housing stock. That, to me, is a bad plan. It is not just about this year, it is a bad plan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, I did not hear the Minister's answer. Could he repeat it, please?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even if they cost €800,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a fair point.
