RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I feel I do, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am confused by some of the things the Taoiseach has said.  The tone and attitude of the Government in its discussions with the European Union——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Am I right in saying there is a sharp difference in the attitude we are now taking in the discussions on the IMF-EU package?  We are hoping and pleading for small changes in the interest rates, possibly some time further down the road, and this contrasts sharply with the Fine Gael economic manifesto, launched in February of this year, which stated——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The manifesto promised that Fine Gael would unilaterally restructure unguaranteed senior debt if Europe did not play ball and grant a fairer package.  Is the attitude we are now taking towards our European partners and their attempt to ram this unsustainable deal down our throats not a massive backing away from what Fine Gael said before the election?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope we all agree that we should extend the maximum support and solidarity to the people of Libya who are fighting for democracy against Gadaffi's ruthless regime and to the wider democratic movements that have erupted across the Middle East and are fighting against similarly obnoxious regimes.Should we not be seriously questioning the motives and actions of those who are launching a military campaign against Libya?  I say "motives" because, for the most part, the United States of America and the large European powers were slow in giving full support to the democratic movements in Tunisia and Egypt, maintained relations with the Mubarak and Ben Ali dictatorships right up to the end and refused to support the overthrow of those regimes until that had been effected by the people of those countries, only then deciding to wade in behind the democratic movements.  A democratic movement under way in Bahrain is being dealt with ruthlessly by that country with the support of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am questioning the motives of those who are now intervening in Libya.  Does the Tánaiste not have deep concerns about the motivations behind this military action, given the record of the United States and the large European powers in their response to the other democratic movements in the region?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are there not significant double standards to which we must point?  Should we not question whether the military action is intended, as the Tánaiste stated, to halt the violence against a civilian population or whether it is a cynical calculation by those military powers as to how they can contain the democratic revolutions in the region?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the Order of Business for tomorrow, given the grave decision of the United Nations to authorise military action against Libya, and its ramifications for the unstable situation that is developing across north Africa and the Middle East, we should set aside some time to discuss that crisis in the same time allotted for statements on the earthquake and tsunami.  We should set some of that time aside to discuss the UN decision to bomb Libya.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do so.  I was within the rules earlier when I asked about the Order of Business.  I welcome what the Taoiseach said in respect of making time available on Thursday for a debate on the situation in Libya.  At what time will that debate take place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am only looking for 30 seconds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will just be a few seconds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I share time with Deputy Daly?  I believe that is all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We initially believed there would be more of us, so it might not take that long.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The central issue I wish to address is the IMF-EU deal, but the Libyan crisis was also discussed at the summit.  I would like to follow up my question to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs during Question Time earlier about the Libyan bombings.  We should be screaming from the rooftops about the inconsistencies and double standards that are being applied because we have been told the action taking place in Libya is designed to prevent violent attacks by the Gadaffi regime against Libyan civilians.  Preventing such attacks is an entirely laudable ambition and supporting the movement for democracy within Libya, which is seeking to overthrow the Gadaffi regime and establish a democracy, is also entirely laudable.  I hope Members are genuine and serious in making statements on this but one has to seriously question the bona fides of the US, France, Britain and other major powers, given they made enormous sums arming Gadaffi in recent years and providing him with the weapons he is now using against his own people.The Minster might say that is history but this cynical policy of double standards in supporting brutal regimes continues in the form of turning a blind eye to what the rulers of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates are doing to their people who, like the people of Libya, are campaigning on the streets for democracy and an end to dictatorships.  No one is screaming from the rooftops about this inconsistency.  The only way to explain this inconsistency is that the intervention of the US and the major European powers has nothing whatsoever to do with supporting the movement for democracy in Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East and has everything to do with using any means to secure control over oil supplies in the region.  If that means backing dictatorships that are crushing democratic movements, they will do so.  We in Ireland have a special responsibility to raise our voices about this.I refer to the IMF-EU deal.  Much play has been made of the attempt to renegotiate the deal, which everyone accepts is unsustainable in the context of the interest repayments on the huge loans the State must take to bail out the banks.  This amounts to shifting around the deckchairs on the Titanic.  Even if the Government manages to secure a 1% reduction in the interest rate on the repayments, that would barely address the unsustainability of this deal.  Approximately €100 billion will be borrowed but national revenue is €30 billion and economic growth is zero.  Even on the best projections, economic growth will not exceed 2% annually over the next few years and no credible projection would suggest it would exceed that.  One could credibly argue that as the Government takes money out of the economy through austerity cuts, the economy will continue to contract and it is obvious we are digging a hole for ourselves.  While the EU and the IMF are extorting us with interest rates on these loans, we are digging a worse hole for ourselves and it is unsustainable.What I find particularly galling about this is it represents a serious U-turn by the Minister and by Fine Gael in the context of what they said during the election campaign.  According to the Minister, it would be "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way" but that tough talk has been dropped.  Fine Gael was more specific when it launched its banking policy document in February.  According to The Wall Street Journal, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan said: “The next government would be forced to “unilaterally” restructure the debt of Irish banks if agreement cannot be reached with Europe on senior bond holders sharing the cost of recapitalising the country’s insolvent banks.”  He went to say, “It is neither morally right nor economically sustainable for taxpayers to be asked to beggar themselves to make massive profits for speculators”.Fine Gael said senior unguaranteed bondholders should be unilaterally burned.  The Central Bank of Ireland stated in recent days senior unguaranteed, unsecured bonds amounted to €16 billion.  Why is the Government not unilaterally restructuring that debt and saying it will not pay?  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are reneging on their policies and they are begging the Union to lower the interest rate on the loans by 1%, which will make no difference to the unsustainability of this deal.  That is a massive U-turn.  Should the Government parties not match their pre-election rhetoric by seriously standing up to Europe and saying they will not pay the gambling debts of private institutions because they will sink this economy and are unjust, and private financial institutions, the ECB and the EU have to take responsibility for their culpability in causing this crisis by promoting the policies that led to the reckless speculation in the banking and property sectors?  To do anything less would betray the aspirations of those who voted for the Government parties in the election.
