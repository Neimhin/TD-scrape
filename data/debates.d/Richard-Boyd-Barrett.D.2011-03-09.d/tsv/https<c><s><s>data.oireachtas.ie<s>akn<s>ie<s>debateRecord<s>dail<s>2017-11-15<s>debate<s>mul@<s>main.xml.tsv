RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No problem. The programme for Government contains a pledge to the effect that the Government would have full regard to any new evidence which emerged to establish the likely cause of the fire at the Stardust nightclub. The Stardust families are absolutely gutted and bewildered at the outcome of the McCartan report dealing with the review of the evidence that they brought forward and other evidence that came to light, which I understand the terms of reference did not allow the former judge, Mr. McCartan, to even consider, about possible scenarios for the ignition of the Stardust fire. Given the deep unhappiness and despair of the Stardust families regarding the outcome of this report, can the Minister commit, at the very least, that we will have a debate on that report in the Dáil in the very near future in order that we might assess it fully and be given the opportunity to raise issues that the families believe the report failed to resolve or of which it failed to take full cognisance?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every year, the Government propaganda machine states that it is spending more this year than has ever been spent before on health. Every year, the number of those on waiting lists increases and the number of those on trolleys increases or stays the same. Given that the Government is doing it again this year and spending €600 million more than we have ever spent before, I want to know whether that sum is actually going to cover the increased demographic demand for those services, produce anything like new services, or deal with the massive crisis we face in respect of waiting lists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was going to say, "Blah, blah, blah" but actually the Minister did give a bit more detail, in fairness, to back up his assertions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a credibility problem, however, with what he is saying. In 2015, we had 386,000 people on waiting lists and there was a budget increase in 2016 of about €1 billion. In that year, the highest number of people on trolleys on a single day was 330. The following year, despite the increase, we had 490,000 people on waiting lists and a high point of 470 people waiting on trolleys on a single day. We had another approximately €1 billion spent, yet in 2017, despite supposedly covering demographics, we are up to 685,000 on waiting lists, which is a spectacular increase. Today, as we speak, the figure for people waiting on trolleys happens to be 470, exactly the same as it was in November 2016.Can we believe what the Minister just said when all the indications are that the allocations he is making for health, although being flagged as big increases, are not even keeping pace with demographics, never mind actually delivering new services?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, I was contacted by a man who has been two years on a waiting list for spinal surgery and is in intense pain. He recently received a letter from St. Vincent's hospital, stating it was no longer in a position to offer appointments in the orthopaedic department for spinal review and, therefore, his referral would be returned to his referring doctor with a view to that doctor securing a spinal appointment for the man in another hospital. This is the reality of the so-called increased allocations, as against the actuality of waiting lists getting longer and being told to go back to the start while suffering chronic pain. The evidence on the ground, despite the game of statistics and so on, is that the situation gets worse because the allocations are not sufficient to meet increased demands. We get overruns, which next year's new allocation will just about cover, never mind dealing with backlogs or the need for increased services in several areas.
