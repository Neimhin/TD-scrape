RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were discussing an amendment where we propose to deal with the enormous loopholes being exploited by a small number of multinational companies to avoid tax by having a report produced on these loopholes, with the intent of closing them. That would give the people in this country billions of euro for housing, health and education, which we need so badly. The report would examine how a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5% should be imposed. It is currently not being imposed and this allows corporations like Apple to pay less than 1% in tax on billions of euro in profit. The average tax rate is not the 12.5% claimed by the Government but approximately 4%. If we had a minimum effective corporate tax rate that companies had to pay before any of these loopholes kicked in, we could raise at least another €6 billion or €7 billion in revenue, which would transform the lives of Irish citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I understand the Minister correctly, what he says is a technical amendment is actually an amendment of very serious substance because we want retrospection. The Minister does not. We know that but when it comes to the section 110 tax break we absolutely want retrospection, as much of it as we can get because the section 110 tax break has been ruthlessly exploited by vulture funds to be, as the Minister describes it, "tax neutral". I love these euphemisms. "Tax neutral" means, for the ordinary member of the public, these financial vultures which have swept in and made an absolute fortune at our expense pay no tax on their enormous profits. The Minister established structures that would allow them do so. For the layman who does not understand the technicalities of this, let us keep it really simple. No worker in this country gets tax neutral status, a special dispensation not to pay any tax. There are measures in our tax code that were designed to ensure these enormously profitable, speculative, vulture-type entities, would be "tax neutral", and would pay no tax on their income or their capital gains.  Where the Government had made some efforts to close that loophole for the future, although not completely, the Minister says he is determined that it not be retrospective. Most people would say that we should claw back as much as we possibly can from these vulture entities that have been let away with murder under section 110 tax breaks.  Will the Minister clarify that I have understood him correctly and that his fear is that unless we make this amendment, some of these section 110 companies could have a bigger tax liability, that is, the Exchequer could receive more tax revenue from these section 110 entities? If that is what he is saying, then I will certainly vote against the Government's amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That answer is in no way satisfactory. We do not have to hand the Minister's initial note in order to go through it. This is the problem which I raised yesterday and Deputy Burton has raised it again. We have amendments before us, which may be very substantial, that were not in the initial draft Bill but could have significant implications and we have not been given a proper explanatory note. The Minister referred to the tax-neutral status of these section 110 companies and his concern that if this amendment is not made, there could be retrospection. The Minister has said that he does not like retrospection but we do when it relates to section 110 companies. If the Minister is saying that by not changing it that there is a possibility of retrospectively capturing some tax from section 110 companies, which have got away with murder and have avoided tax to an extent that the Minister cannot give us figures - he has never given us figures on the amounts of tax foregone as a result of the section 110 loophole - then I say to him he should leave it as it is. Then we can see how we might use the current tax code to get some of the foregone tax lost in recent years as a result of this scandalous section 110 tax-neutral structure, which allows these vulture funds to pay no tax on enormous profits and capital gains. I refer to shares on property, income gains and the capital gains they might make on those shares on Irish property, which has shot up in value, as well as in respect of the rental income generated from it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would also be helpful if he read the original speaking note again. What I heard disturbed me but we do not have the note in front of us to examine it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 39:In page 41, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:"(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the amount of tax revenue foregone as a result of the changes to capital allowances relating to intangible assets made in budget 2014 and the re-introduction of the 80 per cent cap in such allowances in Budget 2018, the reasons for the Budget 2014 changes and the additional revenue that would be generated by applying the 80 per cent cap for the time prior to 11 October 2017 where the allowance was 100 per cent.".This is again an amendment which is of considerable importance to the people of this country. It is directly related to the scandal of the €13 billion Apple case. It turns what is already an enormous scandal around that €13 billion of tax that Apple should have paid but did not pay, which the Government still does not want to collect, but now we discover, courtesy of the so-called Paradise Papers that in regard to the double Irish tax scam which our tax code facilitated to the tune of €13 billion in lost taxes to the people of this country, the real figure of losses may be far greater.The reason for that is the phasing out of the double Irish was indicated as being likely to happen from the end of 2013 onwards because of political pressure in the House. The pressure was primarily from the left, including from ourselves and Sinn Féin, and externally from people raging about tax avoidance by multinationals as well as from growing international opprobrium about the scams of these multinationals to rob ordinary people of billions in tax revenue. That revenue could have gone into housing, health and education, especially at a time of austerity. We discovered that the so-called closing of the double Irish tax scam was simply a prelude to the opening of another tax scam to benefit Apple and a few other extraordinarily wealthy corporations. The narrative and chronology is well worth setting out. In July 2013 Joe Higgins, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I and some others were the only people who wanted Apple brought in, along with Facebook and Google, to appear before the Joint Sub-committee on Global Taxation. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and some Independents who were on the committee closed ranks. They said that the committee would not bring in representatives from those companies to ask questions about the double Irish. Not only that, incredibly they turned off the cameras when we were discussing the matter. There was an unprecedented decision to have the discussion in camera in private session to discuss whether the companies should come in and when a vote would be taken on whether they should come in. Such was the degree of servility of the entire political establishment in the face of Apple when the rumours about the scale of the double Irish were abounding and being articulated by some of us in the committee. When we roll the clock on, the scale of the double Irish tax scam becomes clear, as does the likelihood that the Government would be forced into agreeing to close down the loophole. The then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, scurried over to a private meeting with the chief executive of Apple in January 2014. He admitted on the record when questioned by us after that meeting that corporation tax was discussed. I would dearly like to see the minutes of those meetings or the recording of those meetings to learn what was discussed. We know now, thanks to the Paradise Papers, that in March, shortly after that meeting, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple started to contact Appleby. The legal firm specialises in tax avoidance for big corporations. Apple contacted the legal firm's subsidiaries in March 2014 in the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey. They are all tax havens where there is no corporate tax. Apple settled on Jersey. The legal firm acting on behalf of Apple asked whether the jurisdiction in question could confirm that an Irish company could conduct management activities without being subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Apple was busy reconfiguring the tax scam and using its Irish companies because of the possibility of the double Irish being closed down. The then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, went over and met Apple representatives later in the year. We had a debate at the committee on the 2014 budget. At the debate I suggested, to much ridicule from the Government, that the much trumpeted double Irish will, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies will be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes but in a slightly different way by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights. I did not know how right I was. The scam was already being planned. The replacement of the double Irish was already being engineered by the Government and Apple. How else can the Minister explain the extraordinary coincidence of Apple not paying a single extra cent of tax after the closing of the double Irish, the reconfiguration of its subsidiaries to Jersey and the interaction allowing them to pay no tax? That has been confirmed by Seamus Coffey. According to Seamus Coffey, raising the cap to 100% on intangible assets meant that we lost €722 million in tax revenue in 2015. Mr. Coffey went on to comment on the changes the Government brought in through a recent budget. He said they are only active from the day of the budget. He points out that they could have applied to all claims during the period when the Government had raised the allowance to 100%. He said that would have resulted in up to €1 billion of additional corporation tax being collected in 2018. In other words, this is not simply history. The Government decided not to take €1 billion from Apple under next year's budget. We can only imagine what that could have done for the housing crisis, the health crisis and the lives of people who are chronically under-resourced in areas of key public services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the things to which Seamus Coffey also alludes, which the Minister and everyone else knows, is that the value ascribed to these intangible assets, and the key is in the word "intangible", as in "we do not know", is ascribed by the company itself. That is what happens. The company gives these assets precisely the value that is necessary to ensure that it pays no tax. That is the way it works and Seamus Coffey says it very clearly. The increase in capital allowances almost exactly offsets the increase in intangible asset-related profits such that the onshoring of these assets resulted in little or no additional corporation tax being collected in 2015. That is the way it has always worked, including with the double Irish. He also pointed out that the Minister's decision to not apply the new reduced cap on the allowance for intangible assets was unprecedented in terms of the treatment of such assets because whenever changes were made previously, they applied to all claims. He points out that the specific regime for capital allowances for intangible assets was introduced in 2009. Amendments were introduced in the Finance Acts from 2010 to 2014. He goes through a number of the changes and points out that all previous changes to the regime applied to all claims for capital allowances related to expenditure on intangible assets and were applied to all claims for capital allowances under the regime. The most recent change is the first occasion on which a change was introduced to the regime that only applies to new claims. Who does that suit? It suits Apple and a few other companies. In fact, the full extent of the lost tax revenue is apparent in the Revenue tables on tax expenditures which jumped by about €9 billion or €10 billion between 2014 and 2015.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government may fall over which Ministers knew what in connection with the emails in regard to Maurice McCabe and so on. This, in my opinion, is an even bigger scandal and, at the very least, it needs to be investigated. It is inexplicable that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, in 2014 changed the tax code around intangible assets to essentially neutralise the impact of closing down the double Irish tax scam. One tax scam closed down and another one opened, directly as a result of a decision made by Deputy Noonan and the Government which has not been explained. To get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets is extraordinary, in and of itself, but to get 100%, and for the former Minister to make that decision in 2014, is unbelievable. For the current Minister, similarly, having recognised that this needs to be changed, to then make a decision not to ensure that we collect an extra €800 million a year, and to essentially exempt the claims from before budget day, is extraordinary and, again, the only beneficiary can be Apple and that small group of corporations. They designed this and the Minister has danced to their tune. Hundreds of millions are being lost which people desperately need in this country for housing and health. That is what this exposes. At the very least, we want a thorough investigation so all of the facts can be laid out before the people and they can judge what was lost, why decisions were made and whether it is, as I believe, one of the biggest scandals, if not the biggest scandal, it is possible to imagine in this country in terms of people having tax revenues stolen from them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The German playwright, Bertolt Brecht, stated that the crime of robbing a bank is absolutely nothing compared with the crime of owning one. Never was a truer word said when we consider what the banks have done and allowed to be done to the people of this country in recent years. The people of this country have paid a bitter price in the crash of the economy for the reckless gambling and greed for profit and bonuses of the bankers. They paid a further bitter price in the enormous cost of the bailout, which was paid for with cruel suffering and austerity over years. Finally, when those banks are nursed back to profitability as a result of the suffering ordinary people have endured due to the banks' activities, the Minister reprivatised them to ensure that the full fruits of the profits which they will make in future years, and not just the 12.5% tax, are given away to shareholders. They are not given to those who paid the price but to the private shareholders who can buy bank shares. That is the first crime and, even now, one that the Government should pull back from in its further plans to reprivatise the banks. As if all those crimes which were carried out for the banks and their shareholders are not bad enough, we then have the extraordinary situation of banks, which are once again fantastically profitable, for years to come paying no tax. It is absolutely true, as Deputy Wallace said, that there would be murder if the people of the country knew it. When I try to explain to people these sorts of loopholes which allow banks, vulture funds and corporations to avoid tax, most of them do not believe me. When I tell them that AIB is making profits again, repossessing homes and charging extortionate interest rates but is paying no tax at all and will not for years, they do not believe me. They think it could not be true, yet it is true. It is because it is so unbelievable that there is no revolution in the country. I am being absolutely straight with the Minister. If people really knew the extent of this carry-on, there would be a revolution. If they knew that, side by side with the homelessness crisis, the chronic situation in our hospitals, the overcrowded schools and the massive deficit in our infrastructure, billions upon billions are going out in tax expenditures for losses made by these banks every year, they would revolt. However, the Government is lucky. It is saved by the fact that very few people are really listening to the detail of the debate, and even if they did, they would hardly believe it or understand what they were hearing. It is absolutely shocking. I am not so sure about losses being brought forward. It is another example of one law for the rich and one law for the poor. What about all the people who suffered losses during the austerity period through no fault of their own? What about those who ran up personal debts and lost out in all sorts of ways? Can they carry their losses forward against their income tax next year? Will they get any allowances in their income tax next year or the year after for the losses they made? Not at all. However, the banks will pay no tax at all for years. Their shareholders will make dividends and the value of their shareholdings in those banks will appreciate. It is absolutely outrageous. Perhaps there is a case for losses being brought forward for certain genuine businesses to keep them in business. However, that these banks, in particular, can do it is shocking. It is an open goal for tax avoidance in the future and for our friends who have subsidiaries. Losses can be manufactured. We know how they manufactured and manipulated the prices of intellectual property assets, which we were discussing earlier. It is quite possible to manufacture losses when there is a network of subsidiaries. That is another problem I have with the whole principle of losses being brought forward. The idea that the banks, after all they have done to us and all we have done for them, can pay no tax beggars belief. AIB is one of the most profitable banks in Europe. The Government is lucky that it beggars belief though. It would be paying a much bigger political price if it was not so incredible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Wallace has made most of the salient points already but Christian Aid - and Gerard McSorley, in particular, who phoned me recently to brief me on this - deserves a lot of credit for a very good paper exposing this new tax avoidance structure using the double taxation treaties between ourselves and Malta. I would just add two points on that. First, Mr. Eddie Hobbs phoned me recently. I would not be on his political page on many things but he phoned me to point out that one of the things we should be doing is penalising accounting and consultancy firms that are in receipt of public contracts who are knowingly and on a very significant scale advising corporations and wealthy Irish individuals who can no longer avail of the double Irish or other tax avoidance mechanisms to go to Malta. They are advising them to set up in Malta so that they can continue to avoid tax. That is what some of these accountancy and consultancy firms are doing, firms that are in receipt of public contracts on a regular basis. Our tax code - I cannot quote the exact section but I am sure the officials will know it- states that any measure that is taken for the specific purposes of avoiding tax is not allowed. Even without specifying exactly what that is, one is not allowed to do something for the specific purposes of avoiding tax according to our tax code. We should act against firms based here that are doing this and ban them from getting public contracts. Why on earth would we give public contracts to accountancy and consultancy firms that are simultaneously advising rich corporations and individuals how to avoid paying taxes that are owed to the Irish people and the Exchequer? My second point is on the fact that we have another double taxation treaty in this Bill. We called a vote on it, much to the bewilderment I suspect, of many in this House. Deputies were asking a few weeks ago why we were opposing a motion for a double taxation treaty with Macau. Most people do not even know where Macau is located. Macau is one of the biggest tax havens in Asia and this Bill provides for a double taxation treaty with Macau. What is that about? We did not get much justification for that. Is this going to be yet another mechanism for these guys to use the relationship between our tax code and that of another tax haven like Macau to avoid paying tax? I would certainly like an explanation as to why that is contained in this Bill. Why is the Government pushing a double taxation treaty with a known tax haven? Deputies simply have to google "tax haven" and "Macau" and they will get reams of information about how Macau's main business is being a tax haven. The Bill is riddled with this kind of stuff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to correct the record. I mentioned that I was talking to Mr. Gerard McSorley, who is a fine Irish actor, but I was actually talking about Mr. Sorley McCaughey of Christian Aid, who authored that good paper. The game is up on the "race to the bottom" role that Ireland has played. The noose is tightening. Frankly, it is about time the Government got with the programme. We can argue about what happened previously, and we should when it comes to the changes made in 2014, but we must give up this stuff. It is not sustainable in the future and is robbing the majority of the world's peoples of incomes that are owed to them and that they need to make society function. I do not know which writer with Rolling Stone described Goldman Sachs as a giant squid wrapped around the face of humanity sucking it dry. These corporations are another instance of that. It is what they are doing. As Oxfam has pointed out, the consequence of that has reached the extraordinary level of the world's nine richest people, most of whom are the CEOs of these very corporations, now having more personal wealth than the poorest half of the planet. It is literally the 1% and the 99%. That is where we are going and we should play no part in it, and it is shameful that we have been. Let us do something about this. The Minister did not answer the question about Macau.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had this debate often and we will have it again. A survey was carried out recently that showed that eight people out of ten in the country want to see a wealth tax. Therefore, the Minister might consider it, even in the interest of what the majority of people want. The people want it particularly because the level of household wealth has grown by 51% since the trough in 2013. The top 10% own 53% of it. The number of millionaires has increased exponentially and it would be entirely justified to tax them. Even setting aside our differences on that, does the Minister not believe we should have a database on wealth distribution? In this sort of debate, we often end up saying a tax would not raise that much and that it is all pie in the sky. We should have a proper database on the distribution of wealth rather than just the aggregate figures that are available through the Central Bank or CSO. Would that not be a way to assess whether the proposed tax would be useful? We are convinced it would be. The tax would be a fair one the objective of which would be to share the wealth in Irish society. A database would help to provide evidence on which to base a serious discussion given that many people believe the proposed tax should be considered.Will the Minister at least consider that we should have a database on the distribution of wealth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is such a database in France, for example. The aggregate figures are collected and various bodies collect figures on wealth distribution, for example, Credit Suisse. The survey on income and living conditions, SILC, report provided by the CSO has begun to give an assessment of the distribution of wealth, hence the figure which confirmed many of the other studies that were previously rubbished by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, about the top 10% having 54% of the wealth. Of course we can find out. We do not believe in a local property tax but we have a property tax base. The Minister established a database to find out the value of property. We can easily find out the value of property wealth and we have those figures. We can find out the volume of deposits and the size of them via the banks and the Central Bank and likewise with shares and other such wealth. There are ways of doing those assessments if there is a will to do them. It is done in other countries but it seems there is no real will to do it here. The Minister referred to the progressive tax system but that simply does not acknowledge the exponential growth in the number of multimillionaires in this country, which every single report on wealth distribution shows is increasing dramatically. The overall aggregate household wealth is increasing dramatically also but most ordinary people are not feeling it. Even at an anecdotal level that would suggest there is a small group of people who are getting wealthier and in the interests of fairness it should be something the Government would examine in order to get some assessment of the wealth, where it is, how it is distributed and how we could distribute it more fairly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy will put on a few pounds drinking milk.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I predict this tax will have little or no impact on the consumption of sugary drinks. I do not believe imposing additional costs on products such as these will reduce consumption any more than I believed increasing the costs of bin collection would reduce waste output. What is needed are alternatives that enable people to recycle. If recycling is promoted and recycling infrastructure is provided, people are sensible enough to do the right thing. Much the same applies to the consumption of sugary drinks. We need to appeal to people's intelligence rather than hitting them in the pocket without explaining what we are doing. Young people these days are very intelligent but they are battered with advertising which suggests these types of drinks are fun and will enhance their quality of life. They become addicted to these products as a result of advertising. Once they are addicted, it is difficult to wean themselves off these drinks. Consequently, I do not believe this tax will make much, if any, difference. I also note there is no commitment to ring-fence the revenues from the tax for health promotion measures. I would give the measure some credence, although I would still disagree with it on the basis that a regressive tax is the wrong approach to the problem, if the Government gave a commitment to invest every single, solitary cent of revenue from the sugar tax in various forms of health promotion. This would include, as Deputy Paul Murphy stated, the banning of advertising of sugary drinks in sport, removing vending machines and ensuring sugary drinks are no longer sold in schools or where young people gather. Critically, it would involve resourcing physical education, not only in terms of hours, as Deputy Murphy suggested, but by addressing the lack of facilities for engaging in sport in schools in working-class areas. The Minister may not be aware of it but some of his colleagues are certainly aware of a battle being fought with the Christian Brothers who plan to sell the playing fields of Clonkeen College. This school, which is in my local area, has a fantastic record and history in Gaelic football, soccer and so on. The sports fields it has used for years are being taken off them and despite appeal after appeal being made by parents, teachers, students and Deputies, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, will not lift a finger because, he says, the decision has nothing to do with him. This is a publicly funded school, yet the Minister is allowing the Christian Brothers to pay off debts incurred as a result of the abuse they inflicted on previous generations of children by taking playing fields off future generations of children who need them for sport. The Government must resource and provide facilities at school level. Gyms are needed, as are education and health promotion initiatives to encourage people to engage in healthy activity and to see the folly of imagining that life would be made better by drinking sugar-filled drinks. As has been stated, these measures could be paid for by taxing some of the companies concerned but the Government never adopts that approach. Instead, it always chooses to hit people in the pocket. Any charge based on consumption inevitably hits the least well-off. The wealthy, who, incidentally, have access to playing fields and gyms and money to pay for all these types of activities, will not be hit by this tax. The Government is going about this in the wrong way and its sugar tax will not work. Notwithstanding my differences with him on this issue, if the Minister were serious about the tax, he would give a firm commitment here and now to ensure every cent generated by the tax will be used for health promotion of the type I have described.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 64:In page 57, after line 32, to insert the following:“58. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the second reduced rate of VAT of 9 per cent and additional revenue that could be raised by bringing this rate back to 13.5 per cent.”.We had quite a bit of discussion on Committee Stage about this. I will be brief. If we returned to the 13.5% VAT rate on the hospitality sector it would raise €491 million. That is a lot of money, which could be better spent elsewhere. I did not necessarily agree with the decision at the time, but there was a case for giving a tax break to the hospitality sector when we were in the depths of recession. However, it has boomed since. One only has to walk the streets of Dublin to see how well the hospitality sector is doing. I do not think we could justify using €491 million in this way. It could be spent on plenty of other things, most notably addressing the housing crisis. Many other areas could benefit from this money. We should return to the 13.5% rate. The Minister made it clear he did not agree and I do not expect he will change his mind on foot of what I have said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had the debate and there is a difference. We are in the minority. I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath and others concerned about the rural-urban divide, or the areas that have seen recovery in this sector against those which have not. Those areas need help. There is another side to the equation that can be seen with the figures we got from the Department of Finance concerning profitability in food services and accommodation. Profits have increased by a fairly extraordinary 37%, so the areas that have recovered are making extraordinary profits. Would it not be better to redirect this tax expenditure towards the areas that need help, such as the rural areas mentioned by the Deputies? That is instead of giving this big tax break to all elements of the tourism, accommodation and food sector. I know it will not happen this year but it might be worth considering for next year. We could redirect the tax expenditure to help some of the areas that clearly are struggling or where resources could better assist in sharing the recovery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bringing in an amendment of this size and significance at the last minute without Deputies having the opportunity to examine it or explanation notes or having questions answered on a range of areas is simply not on. I am inclined to oppose it. Yet again, the amendment seems to be providing some sort of tax incentive for private developers. I could be wrong because I have not had a chance to study it, but I am concerned that this is the case. To my mind, we do not need to organise more giveaways for private developers. Will the Minister explain fully what it is? At this late stage I am somewhat suspicious of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 77:In page 69, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:“73. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the revenue implications of bogus self-employment, i.e. the misclassification of PAYE workers as self-employed.”.While I realise we are approaching the end of the debate, I consider this amendment one of the most important that we have tabled. It calls on the Minister to produce, within six months, of the passing of the Bill, a report on the implications of bogus self-employment, namely, the misclassification of PAYE workers as self-employed. This is an important issue for workers and their rights, particularly in the construction sector. I put forward this amendment as a tribute to a friend, colleague and comrade who tragically lost his life on the weekend before last. His name was Bill McClurg and he was a bricklayer and trade union activist. He was somebody who acquainted me with the plight of building workers and bricklayers who were fighting for the right to have decent conditions of employment and pay on building sites in the construction sector. His loss is, obviously, first and foremost, a loss for his partner, June, his children, Emma, John and Rachel, and his many grandchildren and family and friends. They will feel the loss of him, as a father and a family man, acutely, and even more so because the particular conditions of his death were tragic in that he took his own life - something his family were happy that I would say publicly because they, like many other people, feel that the issue of suicide needs to be highlighted so that we confront it and let people know out there who have suicidal ideation that it is okay to speak out about these matters and that we should have a society that supports and helps those who face that dilemma. I knew Billy as an activist. He taught me about the continuing dilemma of thousands of building workers who want to fight - this is the irony of many of the issues we have discussed over the course of this Bill - for the right to pay tax. Is that not amazing? We have spent all of ten or 11 hours discussing how some, such as big corporations, property speculators, banks and the very wealthy, do everything in their power not to pay tax but there are thousands of workers out there in precarious situations, skilled workers in the case of the late Billy McClurg, trained, qualified and passionate about what they do. Billy, in particular, was a precision bricklayer. In and out of work, he was concerned that things were done perfectly, whether it was his garden, in respect of the state of the roads and the streets in his area, or on the building sites that he worked, and that the work was done properly to the highest standard. He spent much of his working life fighting for the right to pay tax and to be employed properly with proper pay and conditions. He and his many of his comrades - I stood with them at many building sites around this city - were forced to protest and to take strike action because they were denied the right by building contractors to be directly employed. Those contractors wanted to misclassify them as being self-employed so that they would not have to pay for their employees' benefits, such as PRSI, sick pay, holiday pay, pension entitlements and bank holidays, and would be able to dismiss them, hire them and fire them whenever they wanted - something that tens of thousands of workers are still affected by. These were workers who wanted to pay tax and they wanted to ensure that work of the best standard was done on building sites. Thirteen years ago, I stood outside a picket in Ballybrack on a public contract site where we were protesting. Billy and two of his colleagues ended up in prison for that protest because they defied an injunction telling them to stop picketing. I remember Billy pointing at the subcontractors who were inside who were supposedly self-employed and saying, "Those guys are not qualified bricklayers. These houses will fall apart in a few years". They were council houses which were being built to replace council houses that previously had fallen apart because they had also been built by cowboy builders. Ironically, 13 years on, just as Billy predicted, because the building standards were not applied and, almost certainly, the bricklayers who were working on that site were not qualified bricklayers, those houses are falling apart and will have to be paid for to be remediated with public money. Here was somebody who fought all his life and went to jail because he wanted the right to pay tax and he wanted the work done properly on building sites. What he was fighting for is still relevant today. Up to 60,000 construction workers working on building sites are being falsely classified by employers as being self-employed when they very obviously are not and, consequently, they are losing as workers, in terms of pay and conditions. We will only find out in years to come that in many cases the quality of the work from the Celtic tiger era may be substandard, but also the public purse is losing out because if they are not PAYE workers, we do not get the tax revenue in.

I ask the Minister to look seriously at cleaning up the construction sector and stop this abuse and ensure that the thousands of workers like the late Billy McClurg are treated properly and respected as skilled workers who contribute to our society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do, because this has gone on and on. Billy fought for most of working life on this but so have many thousands of building workers. Indeed, I have cited to the Minister recent examples of where this sort of practice continues to go on. Let me cite a few facts. Billy and his colleagues would always say, "It is not just that we lose out, but that the public is losing out," because if they were paying tax there would be more money available for housing, health, etc., and it is a fact. I asked the Minister about this, and there was a table he promised me on the figures relating to the tax that comes back from relevant contracts tax, RCT, as against PAYE in the construction sector, and two weeks after I asked the question I have not got the table, but I got some figures myself. In 2016, €255 million came back in tax revenue from RCT, the supposedly self-employed sector, but over €200 million of that was given back in offsets and refunds, and only a net amount of €49 million came in to the Exchequer. That covers I do not know how many workers because the Minister did not give me the figures. I would say it covers approximately 60,000 workers and all we get back is €49 million in tax whereas in the same year the Exchequer got back €536 million from approximately the same number of directly-employed workers in construction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad there is some response from the Government and the authorities in the form of these raids, which should be happening on a much bigger scale and should have been happening a long time ago. During the Celtic tiger period, they just were not happening at all and many workers lost out very bitterly as a result of that. Those who stood up for themselves, who fought and protested were often derided, blacklisted and denied the right to work. I am glad that there has been a bit of an improvement but it is still rife, if not rampant. While there are building contractors who play straight up and do things as they should be done, there are also many cowboys out there who are abusing workers and almost certainly doing shoddy work because they do not want to pay building workers properly. They think, because of the transient nature of construction work, they can get away with it. It is being done on a wide scale and the very tiny amounts of tax revenue that are coming back from the RCT sector in construction as against ten times that amount in the PAYE sector for the same amount of workers is a clear indication of the abuse that is going on. We need far more enforcement in this area. Any big contractor who is found guilty of abusing workers' rights and the tax code in this way should never again be awarded public contracts. This has to be wiped out so that people like Billy and his colleagues in the construction industry, who have had to fight week in and week out against this kind of abuse by cowboy contractors, will no longer have to do that and can just get on with their jobs.
