RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I have made clear repeatedly since I was elected to this House in 2011, I think the system of corporate tax reliefs and allowances are the dirty secret of the Irish tax code in that they bestow enormous tax breaks and big tax loopholes to the benefit of a small number of corporations. Whether it is research and development tax credits, knowledge development boxes, losses forward or intangible assets, and I have raised issues about the section 481 film relief, I can go through the list of loopholes that benefit the big multinationals. Will the Minister undertake a serious, forensic and open review of these in the context of the upcoming budget, when we could seriously do with some extra money for housing, health, infrastructure and a whole range of other pressing social needs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the Minister to describe it as a small number of targeted allowances is incredible. The latest available figures for corporate tax, which are always a few years behind, which is itself a problem, are for 2015. They show €144 billion in gross profits and tax paid of €6.2 billion, which is less than 5%, not 12.5%. Let us look at one example, the research and development tax credit. In 2015 the research and development tax credit was €708 million. Does the Minister know who actually pays for that? He has to look no further than the report about Irish universities tumbling further down the international rankings and professors from those universities saying the reason Irish universities are falling down the rankings is because the staff to student ratio is going through the roof. Money that should be going into Irish universities for teachers, lecturers and students is going to a small number of multinational corporations which are avoiding tax. If we have money for research and development, instead of it going to super-wealthy, profitable and tax-avoiding multinationals, should it not go into our universities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The facts speak for themselves. Irish universities have tumbled further down the international rankings. Why? As the professors of those universities explain, our teacher to student ratio in the universities is now rising to 1:20 as against 1:10 in China, for example.A few buildings might be built but teachers must be employed and registration fees that are blocking people from going into third level must be removed. That requires more money going in but instead, €708 million in tax loopholes is given to a small number of multinational corporations. The incredible €20 billion in losses brought forward whereby banks pay no tax and the intangible assets where the big multinational corporations essentially siphon off profits into offshore tax havens facilitated by this country can be added to that list. It is absolutely shocking. Why does the Government not have a minimum effective corporate tax rate where these corporations pay the 12.5% that would release billions to put into our universities, housing, water infrastructure and so many other things that need real investment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said that he spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker and used the phrase, "strengthening the external borders of the EU", which has been used regularly at recent meetings. I want to interrogate what he is talking about and what it means. I will put it bluntly and dramatically, and also accurately. European leaders, including the Taoiseach, unfortunately, are sleep-walking back into the nightmare years of the 1930s, with the rise of the far-right and dangerous, racist political forces. The Taoiseach was criticised over the weekend for what was described as a legitimising and normalising of the racist policies of the far-right Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, by the Helsinki committee on human rights, for his evasive and weak responses, and for legitimising the quite shocking calls by Mr. Orbán to put Hungarians first at the expense of refugees. This sort of policy has led to the deaths of 35,000 people in the Mediterranean Sea and is leading to absolute horrors in places such as Libya, where people are experiencing slave-like conditions. Is the Taoiseach worried about the rise of these far-right forces? Have he and Mr. Juncker begun to question whether giving credence to the far-right argument that asylum seekers are somehow a problem legitimises those forces and encourages them? We should face them down in the strongest terms, and point out that asylum seekers and migrants are not a burden on Europe. In Ireland we now have labour shortages. We cannot build enough houses because we have labour shortages. We should resolutely resist the racist, xenophobic, anti-migrant logic being pursued by Mr. Orbán, who is a colleague of the Taoiseach in the European People's Party, EPP.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to raise the issue of housing conditions in the inner city. Recently I was contacted by residents in the south inner city complaining about the chronic damp conditions in their flat complexes, which they have been suffering for long periods of time. There is absolutely no doubt that in areas of big disadvantage the issue of housing is desperate. It has knock-on effects for children, mothers and everybody that then spill out into the other problems we often associate with extreme disadvantage. The need to address this is of the utmost priority. My next point links to the questions on the European Union. I was reading a report that all of us should tune into, by a body backed by the European Union, FEANTSA, which monitors homelessness and exclusion from housing across Europe. Its reports are shocking. They show there has been a spectacular rise in homelessness and housing problems everywhere in Europe. I do not know whether this is on the radar of the EU, in terms of the urgency of us looking for flexibility on the fiscal rules to put major investment into the provision of social, affordable and quality housing in the many areas where it is lacking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will ask again. I have asked already about Orbán as well and about the rise of racist and far-right forces, of which he is one of the most prominent. In the same comments with regard to Orbán's racist agenda, the Taoiseach said we have to respect that other countries come from a different perspective. Does the Taoiseach regret that? The Helsinki committee said this was very disappointing, in that he was legitimising and normalising this racist far-right narrative. We should not respect the terrifying echoes of the politics of the far right from the 1930s that we are getting from Orbán and other forces like him. We need to resolutely oppose this, not respect it, because it is very dangerous. Should the EU not also do some soul-searching about how its policies have contributed to the conditions that can give rise to the far right, especially in the areas I have mentioned, including housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The report I mentioned shows it is really diabolical and worsening throughout the European Union.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not give an inch to racism – not one of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why I mentioned housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's position on this is indefensible. In putting forward this amendment she has failed to explain how she will protect workers from victimisation. If this amendment is passed there is absolutely nothing to prevent an employer from making a decision not to give additional hours that might be available to existing part-time employees if the employer is irritated by the fact that those part-time employees have asserted their rights at various points or if the employer feels that the level of seniority of an employee is such that the employee is entitled to better wages and conditions than a new entrant. The Minister will allow employers to do that. That is not to say all employers will do it, but there is no doubt that some do it. They victimise people who stand up for themselves. If the Minister gets rid of this she will have no mechanism to prevent an employer from victimising people by refusing to give them hours. The only defence the Minister has given is one that can be addressed in the Seanad, if that is a genuine concern. As everybody has said the opposition of IBEC to this is not genuine. It is about wanting to give the whip hand to employers and resenting the fact that existing workers might have certain rights in respect of their employers. The Minister should be under no illusion about that. IBEC has offered spurious justification for it, which the Minister has recycled here. However, if the Minister wishes to address the issue of people having suitable qualifications she can do that in the Seanad. The spurious argument she is offering can be addressed elsewhere. Does the Minister support the principle of existing part-time workers being offered any additional hours that are available first, which will improve the situation of people who are on low hours and are the working poor? They are the 100,000 people, many of them women, who are the working poor whom the Government claims it wishes to activate. The type of victimisation that I and others are describing happens often and it makes people very angry, bitter and resentful when employers can get away with it. The Minister needs to do better in justifying her position, although I do not believe it is possible to justify it. She should withdraw her amendment, leave the Bill as it is and protect these workers and their right to get some extra hours, which will make their low paid employment a little better from their point of view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could be done in the Seanad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know if the Minister was referring to me in terms of the personalised remarks-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but I want to stress I was not being personal. From the point of view of the issue at stake, the amendment is indefensible because it fails to identify, as did the Minister in her response, what mechanism will be in place, if this amendment is passed, to protect against an employer deciding to victimise a part-time existing employee by not giving him or her the additional hours because he or she has asserted his or her rights in some way, has been a union activist or some other reason with which an employer has taken umbrage.Alternatively, the employee may have built up seniority and have a pay level or in some cases pay agreements which apply to him or her but not to people who are employed later on - new entrants are whatever. The Minister's amendment, if passed, will not provide that protection. That protection will be gone and employers, whether there are few or many, who choose to victimise people in that way will be able to do so. The Minister has a case to answer in defending her amendment. The example Kevin Foley gave is not a good one for all the reasons already stated. However, if there is a genuine concern, everybody here has said there would be no difficulty in amending what is the fundamentally correct principle in the existing Bill with the added provision about appropriate qualifications. The onus is on the Government to do that and not to press an amendment that removes a protection from workers in a precarious position. The Minister needs to consider that. There is no need for this amendment. Whatever weakness the Minister can argue is in the existing wording, that weakness will be far bigger if the Minister's amendment passes and an important protection for workers will be removed.
