RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, following the resignation of the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach referred to the Department of Justice and Equality as dysfunctional. We are all aware of the issues to be examined by the disclosures tribunal, which we will discuss this evening. The Taoiseach promised an external review of all the matters that have arisen in recent weeks. Given those very strong statements, will he indicate the precise extent of this external review of matters related to the Department of Justice and Equality? The issues are relevant not only to the whistleblower scandal but are also evident in the discovery that 2 million false breath tests were carried out by gardaí and there were 15,000 wrongful convictions as a result. More than 100 solicitors are taking legal action of behalf of some of those who were wrongly convicted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The O'Sullivan report suggested there will be no accountability from those in top Garda management and no disciplinary action imposed on them. These are the people who were condemned in the report for the incredible level of malpractice within the force. The public does not accept a level of dysfunctionality that results in 2 million false breath tests and 15,000 wrongful convictions. We must have accountability in this regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will this issue be part of the sweep of justice-related matters the Taoiseach has promised will take place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach may have received an email from Peter McVerry today pointing out that seven individuals have died sleeping rough in the past 12 weeks, which is both unprecedented and shameful. There is the shocking fact that 3,000 children are in emergency accommodation. Peter McVerry is asking for very specific things to respond to this. Will the Taoiseach agree to what he is asking for? He wants a formal assessment of the number of people sleeping rough carried out by local authorities; local authorities to provide a dedicated phone number for members of the public who can identify people sleeping rough in their areas so that help can be given to them; each local authority to have a dedicated rough sleeper response team with transport to cover out-of-hours periods; a commitment that rough sleeping would be ended completely by 2018 which he points out that requires between 250 and 300 people to be housed through the Housing First programme; and that each local authority draw up a Housing First plan to house rapidly and offer intensive case management to recently housed former rough sleepers. Will the Taoiseach agree to that? I want the Taoiseach to reconsider the comments he made earlier about the problems of big social housing estates. This is the excuse for not delivering the scale of public housing we need on the public housing land that we have. Problems generated in social housing estates are not because of anything intrinsic to social housing estates. They are to do with the lack of infrastructure put into estates built in the past. We need large scale provision of council housing with the infrastructure and services but that cannot be an excuse for not delivering the scale of public housing we need to address this crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I was going to a summit on social issues in Europe I would certainly make the point, and I hope the Taoiseach did this, that the biggest social crisis facing this country is housing and homelessness and that it is at appalling emergency levels. A little known fact, but one noted by Mercy Law Resource Centre among others, is that, incredibly, Ireland opted out of the right to housing provisions of the European Social Charter, even though it was used to sell the Lisbon treaty to us. I presume it was Fianna Fáil that made this decision, which shows its commitment to social housing even then. Should we not opt into the provision on the right to housing in the European Social Charter? Second, to what extent does the Taoiseach think that EU state aid and competition rules are causing us a problem in delivering the social and public housing we need? Certainly in my local authority area, and I presume this happens everywhere else, the tendering processes that require us most of the time to outsource work on public housing are one of the major areas of bureaucracy and delay preventing us from delivering the public housing that is required.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our shocking failure to reduce CO2 emissions has been further exposed by the EPA's report. Is the Taoiseach willing to take the radical action necessary and end the special pleading for our pathetic performance? Both Deputy Bríd Smith and Deputy Eamon Ryan this week and last week submitted Bills proposing to grant no more licences for the exploration of oil and gas. If we were to do that, we would contribute significantly as a country. Deputy Bríd Smith reports from the Bonn summit that delegates were very excited about the prospect that if it happened in Ireland, like the fracking ban, it could have a huge impact internationally. If we were to make that decision, we could go from being the worst to being a leader. I have been banging on in the Dáil for the past six years about forests and trees. Our performance in afforestation is shockingly bad. It is one of the worst in Europe. We are missing all our targets. Our level of forest cover is pathetically low. The Larry Goodmans of this world and the big ranchers are to blame because they want the land for their businesses, but we need to increase the level of our forest cover. There are ways to do this that farmers would get behind if we were to support them and explain how increasing the level of forest cover on their land would benefit them financially and the environment without infringing on other things. We need to do something about Coillte's failure to plant trees.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was much lamenting of the fate of the Tánaiste yesterday on the Government side of the House. Do not get me wrong - I have no axe to grind with her personally, but the person who has most to lament in this sorry saga is Sergeant Maurice McCabe who first had the bravery to make a complaint in 2006 about malpractice in An Garda Síochána.It is now 2017 and we still have not got to the bottom of how the institutions that are supposed to uphold justice sought to suppress an effort by a member of the Garda Síochána to do what the Garda is supposed to do, uphold the law and justice. He has been put through the wringer. Those who have fallen victim to the scandal surrounding Maurice McCabe are the people who were responsible for upholding justice and the law and who should have protected Maurice McCabe, but failed to do so. They failed to prevent the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe which, had it succeeded and had he not had the presence of mind to have a tape recorder with him at the meeting with the senior gardaí, would have ruined his life beyond repair. That is what is at stake here. Of course, it goes beyond individuals. If they can do that to one whistleblower, how can they be trusted to uphold justice for all of society? This motion proposes, in the aftermath of the scandals and revelations, that the Dáil was misled about what Ministers and Departments knew about the campaign to smear Maurice McCabe. It was hidden and information relevant to the Charleton tribunal was not handed over to the tribunal. Mr. Justice Charleton has made clear that this is a criminal offence. That is what we are discussing. Fintan O'Toole makes a very good case today that there is nothing ambiguous or problematic about the terms of reference of the Charleton tribunal. They are very clear that everything germane to the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe should be handed over to the tribunal. That means any and all Government officials, Ministers and members of the Garda Síochána who had information germane to this should have handed it over. However, and the Minister is right to nod, they did not do that. That is a key point. It is entirely justified to suggest that we examine the terms of reference. Sinn Féin has done us a favour in making that suggestion this evening, whether it is a matter of adding a few lines or a matter of questioning whether we can trust either the politicians who are responsible for ensuring this information is provided or the officials or both to give the information which Mr. Justice Charleton needs and has insisted he must have. Then we get to the game of ping pong between the politicians and the departmental officials. The implication is that it did not happen under the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and perhaps under the current Minister - I do not know as I am not quite clear about the explanation he is giving for the failure of his Department to hand over this material when it was supposed to. However, it did not happen under his or the previous Minister's watch. The fish rots from the head, or at least the head must take responsibility. If the Minister's explanation is that it was the officials, he is saying that dysfunctional, rotten, corrupt, incompetent - I do not know what we can call them - officials are running rings around the Ministers who are supposed to run the Departments. That is what he is telling us. It is a damning indictment. Is the Minister telling us that officials are running rings around him or is it, in fact, politics at play, not incompetent officials? Is it a combination of both, with officials doing what they think the politicians want them to do or doing what politicians are giving them the nod and wink to do? I do not know. However, as Deputy O'Callaghan asked, who benefitted from the fact that the emails were suppressed? It is the Minister who is named as knowing things that she said she did not know. What is the Latin phrase for checking who benefits? I cannot remember. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle's Latin is better than mine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Cui bono, who benefits from the suppression of that information? The suppression of the information would not have come out but for the fact that Katie Hannon exposed it. We would not know and Mr. Justice Charleton would not have received it. That begs the question: even if we get commitments now that all the relevant documents are handed over, how do we know, despite all the hubbub, that they will be handed over? What the Sinn Féin Deputies suggest in their terms of reference is stated in the existing terms of reference and the interpretation that Mr. Justice Charleton has given of them. Sinn Féin's additional terms of reference refer to the Department of Justice and Equality and its officials. I would extend that to all Departments, Ministers and any other Government body that might have known. I chatted to the Taoiseach yesterday about all of this. He said, as was said in the House today, that he believed Deputy Frances Fitzgerald would not have set out to try to destroy a whistleblower. I do not know whether that is true. She appears to be a decent individual but the question is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said she seems to be a decent individual. What I cannot judge or what I find difficult to explain, and I do not know why the Minister is shaking his head, is how all this information could be in her Department and we are told it was not discussed. We are told that people forgot about it. It was so unimportant or registered so little at the time that people just forgot about it. It was the biggest political hot potato imaginable for the Government but it was just not discussed. However, was it discussed with other Ministers at the time? Other Departments and Ministers, therefore, and any communications they had relating to the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe should be also included in the information that is handed over to the Charleton tribunal.
