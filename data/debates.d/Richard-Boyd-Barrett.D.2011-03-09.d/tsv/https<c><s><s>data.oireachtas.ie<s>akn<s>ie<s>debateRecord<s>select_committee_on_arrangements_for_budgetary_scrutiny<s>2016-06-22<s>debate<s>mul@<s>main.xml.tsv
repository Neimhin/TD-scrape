RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That sounds good to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it Professor Barrett's view that in advising the committee the Government hopes to set up, the demographic pressures and the impact of inflation on the fiscal space and so on have to be spelt out clearly as a matter of course in the discussions around the budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But it should be spelt out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree completely with that. I welcome the entire process and it is good that it is being opened up. We have to figure out how best to establish that process to achieve the maximum transparency and the most comprehensive debate in the run-in to producing a budget. Professor Barrett made a point about not having ideological baggage and so on. One of the issues Nyberg pointed out in his report was that contrarian thinking was not taken seriously. That was an understatement in the context of the failure of all sorts of models and think tanks to see what was coming in 2008 and to understand how severe it could be. ESRI staff put their hands up and said they did not recognise the extent of the banking and financial crisis. How can we be sure the same is not happening again and that contrarian thinking is still not being marginalised within the ESRI or anywhere else? When I studied economics for the leaving certificate, the entire book by Noel T. Palmer was about market theory. There was one page on Marx's labour theory of value and it just said it was wrong.They just went on to enunciate the Smith and Ricardo outlook. Can Professor Barrett assure me that the contrarians get a fair shot? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was going to ask the same question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that but I want to plumb into this matter a little further. The professor has said that the institute deals with data and has certain models, which implies that there is not much in terms of subjective analysis. Is that what he is saying? Is there debate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not assume that. I want to understand the process of producing analyses and reports. Is the full spectrum of economic thought fed into the analyses? Is everything just a compromise between different people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly out of time so will ask a few bullet point questions. I am glad, and I like to think it is due to the presence of the new left joining the Irish Parliament, that the institute is working on wealth taxes. How close are we to having an analysis of the possible impact of different models of wealth tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the sense that there are certain things like-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----poverty analysis and all that kind of stuff, which were not in previous budgets. A big lacuna in the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How close is the ESRI to completing the research?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Professor Barrett to bank my question as I have another question. I am afraid that the models do not take enough account of human experience, which kind of follows Deputy Burton's comment. Should the models include surveys of target groups? The people affected should be asked how something will impact on them, rather than just use statistics and figures. I often think statistics and figures can be limited in what they say about the impact on human beings, which is after all what this is really all about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council back again. Meeting them is one of my favourite engagements of the year. I very much welcome the council's proposals for its involvement in the new budgetary process and agree with everything it has suggested. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is leaving open the possibility of having two additional engagements. It proposes a pre-budget engagement with the committee in September when it has had a chance to consider the summer economic statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It also proposes to engage with the committee at the time of the national economic dialogue to give its take, as it were, on questions of fiscal space and compatibility with fiscal rules.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not have many questions because I agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's proposals, which would be very helpful. The council suggests the model for the parliamentary budget office, PBO, should be somewhere between the current proposal and a model in which it plays an extensive role. Will Professor McHale elaborate a little on that suggestion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council proposing that it have a role in assessing these costings? Would it provide analysis, particularly of alternative budget proposals, in its engagement with us in September?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In terms of the information available to us in the context of these debates, is there a major gap in terms of whether the information provided on corporation tax is detailed and up to date? I do not know if I have ever pointed out to Professor McHale that when Deputies ask questions about corporate tax, the most recent figures supplied to us are from 2011. This is extraordinary when one considers, for example, that â‚¬2 billion in corporate tax suddenly appeared last October and nobody knows the reason this happened or whether it will happen again. These are large numbers which could have a significant impact on the revenues available to the State. When Deputies seek to get to the bottom of the issue and ask questions about whether this revenue will continue to be generated, the reason for it and how it fits into the pattern of corporate tax receipts over time, the information is either not available to us or we are provided with information from 2011. Does something need to be done to ensure Deputies have access to up-to-date information?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be possible to have provisional figures based on the tax paid, even if qualified by the fact that they could change when the final figures are processed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While it is not Mr. Coffey's fault, it is extremely unsatisfactory that we cannot show the pattern over time in the different tax categories, up to as recently as possible, and what it represents as a proportion of overall tax revenue. It would be very helpful for us to understand the pattern over time, not just what we are proposing in any given year in terms of adjusting tax and expenditure, but to see how it fits into an overall pattern. Is the information available in a digestible form and should it be included in such statements, which it is not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope that suggestion can be taken on board. While I take the point about digging, the time to dig and collate is limited, as it probably is for the witnesses too. To have this kind of information available in easily digestible tables would be extremely helpful for us.
