RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is Deputy Donnelly first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Boucher and his team for coming in. I agree with him as opposed to Deputy Ó Ríordáin that we do not really need gestures. We need real action from the bank not just in terms of hard cash, although that is one side of it. The major issue is whether we can get the tens or hundreds of thousands of people in the country as a whole and the tens of thousands with whom Bank of Ireland is dealing who are in dire distress and unable or barely able to pay their mortgages out of this hole and what Bank of Ireland is doing to help them out of a hole it helped dig for them. What I do not get from Bank of Ireland in particular or any of the banks is any sense that it has a responsibility to take a hit for what it did to put those people into a hole. What Mr. Boucher is really describing is that Bank of Ireland is seeking to squeeze every single cent it can out of every single one of its mortgage account holders. The bank will chase them for every last cent, even if they are forced to give the house back to it in a so-called voluntary surrender. The bank will hound them for every cent regardless of whether they do a so-called restructure or hand back their home. Is there any talk of write-down, which is what the bank should be doing to acknowledge its role in creating this mess in the first place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Duffy revealed yesterday that whereas AIB had written off around €475 million, only €38 million of that was write-offs for residential mortgages and the rest was for the buy-to-let sector. In other words, the developers who were most guilty of getting us into this mess were getting write-offs while for the most part, ordinary home owners were not getting any forgiveness. What is the comparable situation in Bank of Ireland? Is it giving debt write-down or forgiveness to the developers on its books?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Boucher not think it is unfair for the majority of ordinary mortgage holders under these restructuring arrangements and certainly under the forbearance, as Deputy Donnelly just outlined, which is not a long-term restructure and is just digging people further into a hole of debt? Many of the banks seem to be just playing for time in situations that are further digging people into a hole and possibly hoping the economy will bounce back or the property situation will improve. Does Mr. Boucher not think that it is also extremely damaging for the economy? Under what he and all the banks are describing, there might be up to 200,000 families who will be pinned to the wall for 20 or 30 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Boucher not think that Bank of Ireland must take some write-down? Even if, as he says, it cannot afford a full write-down of all the negative equity and arrears, does he not think it must talk about some level of write-down where it acknowledges its responsibility and gets people out of this hole both for their sake, for the sake of the economy and for the sake of fairness?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At what cost for many of them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Mr. Bell repeat those figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Eventually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to Mr. Brown that in his response to the last question there is an absolute glaring double standard and contradiction. On the one hand Mr. Brown is endorsing a global solution to the Irish economic problem when it comes to imposing austerity. That is okay for the good of the economy. However, it is not okay to have a global solution when it comes to the banks acknowledging their role in getting people into the mortgage crisis they are now in and in getting the whole economy into the mess it is now in. It is a matter of case-by-case and squeeze every cent the bank can get out of the mortgage holder. However, when it comes to what the Government should do, it should have a global solution, no case-by-case approach, no fairness and no justice. It should simply impose austerity because that is what the financial markets want. Does Mr. Brown not see a glaring gross injustice in that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then how can Mr. Brown seriously and in the same breath encourage the Government to cut people's pay, jobs and income to the extent that they are unable to pay their mortgages to the bank? That is beyond comprehension. I find it fascinating and frankly a little alarming that Mr. Brown says there is no correlation any longer between unemployment and mortgage default, the implication, nicely put, being that people are simply not bothered paying. I put it to Mr. Brown that the vast majority of people are not paying because they are having extraordinary difficulty paying. Often this is because of income loss, it is not always job loss. Incomes have been slashed in this country by between 20% and 30%. Even the people who are currently paying their mortgages are often doing so at the expense of not feeding their children properly or not being able to pay other bills. That is the position people are actually in. Therefore, I suggest that for Mr. Brown to separate the economic crisis which the banks helped to cause from the current problem of mortgage default is a sleight of hand that really becomes a justification for Ulster Bank to launch into an aggressive programme of repossessions and legal action.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to disagree. Mr. Brown will find that Ulster Bank did not have much default before 2008 and it has a good deal of default now and for him to suggest there is no direct connection between those two things is bordering on the preposterous. Mr. Brown stated that 35% are not engaging and 35% of 15,328 home mortgages, which he says are in default of one description or another, is 5,364. The bank has already gone down the legal route in the case of 4,354 and Mr. Brown has said that 2,851 are not engaging. This makes a total of approximately 7,000, or 2,000 in excess of 35%. Does that mean there are possibly up to 2,000 people above the 35% figure who are engaging with Ulster Bank but the bank is still going down be legal route with them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The jury is out on this stuff and we will know a little more in six months or a year. It is alarming that in the case of all of the banks which have come before the committee a very high proportion of the supposed solutions they have offered to meet the targets involve their going down the legal route. One could be forgiven for thinking that there is an avalanche of repossession cases on the way. Ulster Bank maintains that is not the case but certainly the evidence at the moment at least is pointing in the direction of wholesale repossessions taking place as a result of the change in the legal obstacle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point which I heard earlier. The economic concession is an interesting issue. Anecdotally, what I hear is that people are not interested in split mortgages because they think they will be sunk in debt for the rest of their lives. There has been some emphasis in the media debate to the effect that split mortgages are akin to Moses and the Messiah coming to save people in mortgage distress. I do not think they are.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The economic concession runs short of a debt write-down, which is what I would like to see, but it is an improvement and we need to look at it more closely. If Ulster Bank, unlike Bank of Ireland in cases of voluntary surrender, is not chasing as a matter of course the shortfall which is very fair and reasonable, it is, in effect, giving a write-down on an unsustainable debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What it is doing is giving people an incentive to throw the keys back at the bank. Why does it not give them an incentive to stay in their homes and give them a write-down? Why would Ulster Bank not extend that logic to keep people in their homes? I do not understand. The bank is going to take the hit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In conclusion, I think the banks need to work harder at getting the message out. The bank needs to be fair. It is making efforts to some degree, but it needs to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no doubt that people are not engaging with the bank because they are terrified. The bank must recognise its role in creating the fear and genuinely reach out to people by saying it will help people to stay in their homes if that is at all possible and that it is willing to take some responsibility for its role in the mess in working out a solution with them. If that message was sent, it would begin to change the dynamic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Acting Chairman (Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett)	2011-03-09	None	Senator Barrett has ten minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am an Ulster Bank customer and want to appeal to the bank on Deputy Mathews's earlier point. I understand having a call centre out of hours, but I find it bizarre when I am trying to telephone my branch that I am diverted to somebody who tells me he or she will act as an intermediary with my bank and that I will receive a call back some time. That disconnect between bank customers and the local people in the bank whom they usually like and with whom they have a relationship is crazy. It does not make sense from any point of view and the bank needs to think about this. The budget is coming. Ulster Bank has been reported as stating it thinks the Government should stick to the troika arrangement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies. Mr. Brown is on record as having said the Government should continue with the troika's austerity programme. It was put to him that there is a big contradiction between that and the sustainability of people being able to make their mortgage repayments. Regardless of what he might have said in the past, not only for those currently in mortgage distress who are trying to move to a sustainable position, but also for many of the 80% who are put to the pin of their collar to make their payments, should Mr. Brown not change his view and urge the Government not to do anything in the budget that would impact negatively on the incomes of ordinary people in terms of social welfare cuts, income cuts or increased taxes on people who could be in mortgage distress?
