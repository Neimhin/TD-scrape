RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The last time the Taoiseach and his party were in government and faced with a major crisis, at that time caused by the greed of bankers and developers, working people got it in the neck, hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs or had cuts to their pay and a decade of austerity followed. For most people, the test as to whether Fianna Fáil has changed and will lead the Government of change that people voted for on 8 February is how working people will fare under its governance. A key and immediate litmus test as to whether it will bring that change and whether ordinary, working people are going to get a fair deal and the support they need under this Government, faced with another crisis, is the situation faced by 1,500 Debenhams workers who have been protesting following Debenhams' treatment of them in the most despicable manner by, without consultation and without notice, moving the company into liquidation in April of this year. The company has refused to negotiate with the workers and is orchestrating this situation. Even though there are probably tens of millions of euro worth of stock in the stores in Henry Street, Blackrock, Cork, Tallaght and Blanchardstown, apparently, this is a company with no assets. This is because, conveniently, the company, through a subsidiary, lent itself some money and made the Irish business a co-guarantor on money that it lent to itself, effectively eliminating all assets from the balance sheet of the company. This is despicable treatment of workers. The Taoiseach said earlier that he is focused on legislation. What does he propose to do to support the Debenhams workers? Debenhams cannot be allowed to siphon off assets, as it is trying to do, to prevent a fair redundancy deal for these workers. The legislation to re-order the priority creditors in situations of liquidation needs to be immediately amended such that workers in this situation are not treated in this despicable way, as happened in the case of the Clerys' workers. This issue has been well flagged. Where companies are contravening employment legislation or treating workers in this way they should suffer serious penalties for doing so. The Taoiseach needs to utilise all of the sections available to Government through the Companies Act 2014, in particular sections 599 and 608, to make sure that the company does not take off with the assets and that the workers get the fair redundancy and decent treatment they deserve. Solidarity-People Before Profit has placed a motion to this effect on the Dáil Order Paper, which the Debenhams' workers hope the Government and all parties will support and thus take the actions necessary to get them a just settlement. As we speak, these women workers are picketing outside the Henry Street store to prevent assets being physically removed from it by a cynical company that has treated them with contempt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome, as I am sure the Debenhams workers will welcome, the Taoiseach's words of sympathy and his condemnation of how Debenhams has treated them, but the test is what the Government will do about it. We need to act urgently to do everything we can to make sure that Debenhams does not get away with manipulating the law as it stands to siphon off these assets. Its failure to consult workers and the fact that the State may have to pay out the statutory redundancy gives us certain leverage under that legislation for the insolvency fund to go after the assets of Debenhams, and we should do that. It tried to siphon off those assets but was prevented because of the heroic protests of the workers. There are echoes of the Dunnes Stores-South Africa strike battle on those picket lines. I encourage the Taoiseach to go down and meet the women because they are an absolute inspiration and they are not going away. They are going to fight for justice. I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to do absolutely everything to ensure justice for the workers. The assets are in those shops. Debenhams must not be allowed to take them out. The assets should be liquidated to the benefit of the workers to ensure a just settlement for them. There is a lot at stake because this is not just about Debenhams workers. We are facing potentially tens of thousands of similar redundancies, so this is a test. Are we going to stand with workers faced with this kind of treatment and the possibility of mass redundancies in this country to prevent that sort of shoddy treatment and to protect workers who have given decades of loyal service, as these workers have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to take the Minister up on his earlier offer to listen to ideas for the July stimulus package. I will focus on a few specific groups. The pandemic and the lockdown affected huge numbers of people in terms of their income, employment and livelihoods but particular groups have been hard hit and are likely to be hard hit for the foreseeable future as long as Covid-19 remains with us. As well as big, broad measures and schemes, such as the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 before us, we need to be specific in looking at sectors that are particularly hard hit and which are not specifically captured by big, broad policy moves.  It is even more important to make that point on the day that is in it because I have been receiving calls from individuals in two of these sectors all day. I raised repeatedly with the Minister in his previous Government role - he is still in government but it has been in slightly different form since the establishment of the new Government - the position of taxi drivers and people in the arts, light entertainment, music and the gig economy. Today, many of them found that their pandemic unemployment payment had been cut from €350 to the €203 rate. This was due to a failure to recognise the specifics of their particular situation. I warned the Government that this was coming. People whose incomes, livelihood and future have been devastated for the foreseeable future as a result of the Covid pandemic are being kicked while they are down. There is no other way to describe it. They were kicked this morning when they received letters informing them that their pandemic unemployment payments were being cut. More of this is likely to happen next week when people who do not jump through a number of other hoops will also have their payment cut.I will be more specific in this regard. Taxi drivers whose income was deemed to be less than €200 face a cut in their payment. This will affect a huge cohort of taxi drivers, in part because the income is based on the figures for 2018, which is a random selection in its itself, but also because taxi drivers have very significant outgoings that reduce their income, which outgoings continued during Covid when their income disappeared and against a background where if they do return to work - there is pressure on them to do because their payment is being cut and some of them might not want to do because they are still concerned about the health situation - they will be returning to an employment where their income is not likely to cover to anything even close to pre-Covid levels for the foreseeable future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And also who does not benefit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister invited suggestions in this debate specifically about the July stimulus. He did actually invite such suggestions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Taxi drivers as a group are excluded from nearly all of these supports for reasons I do not understand. I asked some of the taxi drivers to explain it to me. I am told their exclusion is related to them not paying or charging VAT. I did not fully understand the explanation but I know they are excluded from many of the support schemes for small enterprise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an unfairness. Taxi drivers cannot return to work because there is little demand for taxis and also to do so they would need to install screens and the National Transport Authority, NTA, has not clarified what type of screen would pass muster in terms of insurance and so on. There has been no clear direction on this issue. Even though they have not been working throughout the pandemic, taxi drivers still face continued costs such as car loan repayments, maintenance charges and insurance costs. If they return to work, which they are under pressure to do because their payments are being cut, they will find that their income is insufficient to cover those costs. They will not be able to pay their insurance costs. Those taxi drivers who are lucky will be paying €2,000 or €3,000 for insurance. Those who are not so lucky will be paying €4,000, €5,000 or, in some cases, up to €10,000 for insurance. A taxi driver might also have to pay €600 per month on car loan repayments and maintenance costs of approximately €2,000 per annum and a taxi driver who returns to work will for the foreseeable future be paying about €7,000 per annum in fuel costs while driving the streets looking for customers but not able to find any.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying that they are microenterprises. They are the definition of a microenterprise. In fact, they are the most micro of microenterprises-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and they deserve support.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a microenterprise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any Bill that the Government should put forward supporting microenterprises should take these specifics into account. That is the point I am making. I am appealing to the Government to do that and, in the mean time, I am appealing to the Government not to cut their payments but to maintain those payments as income subsidies. Taxi drivers do not want to remain unemployed. They do not particularly want an unemployment payment. They want to be able to work but there has to be a recognition on the part of the Government that for them, particularly those who are worst hit - this is true of other microenterprises - there is no likelihood of a full recovery any time soon. We need to maintain income subsidies to them and also allow them to earn on top of that until they reach the point where they stand on their own two feet because there is a genuine recovery. That is the point I am making. Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned sound engineers. People in the arts, live entertainment and music industry also will not benefit from this Bill as they will not be able to access these loans. They would not pass muster or even be considered for many of these schemes even though they are freelancers or lone traders. For the benefit of the Minister I will elaborate further. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic a person who played music in the pubs and clubs in Temple Bar would have been paid €130 for two hours work. A person lucky enough to get a gig in Temple Bar now would be offered €30 for two hours work. This is not viable. People in this sector have also had their payments cut. What are they to do now? How do we help them? People involved in organising live music events and so on and who, like taxi drivers, have ongoing costs in terms of insurance, equipment storage and repayments on loans for equipment they purchased, also have no income. Even if there is some recovery, and there is no likelihood that any time in the near future there will be a significant recovery, those costs continue for them. Many of the supports that are being designed are not available to them, but many of them are having their payments cut. Those are two particular groups I wanted to speak up for. Specifically on the Bill, yesterday I had a conversation with a person who owns a business that is the definition of a business that is supposed to be covered by this Bill. The company makes sofas and it has eight employees, which is just below the threshold of nine required. This business is being told that it does not meet the eligibility criteria to access these loans and it is also concerned about taking on extra debt in terms of interest and so on. We need a scheme which works with microenterprises, taking account of the particular difficulties they are facing and tailoring the supports in that direction rather than rigid criteria, excessive interest rates and a debt burden that will result in the supports not being sustainable for those particular businesses. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance.
