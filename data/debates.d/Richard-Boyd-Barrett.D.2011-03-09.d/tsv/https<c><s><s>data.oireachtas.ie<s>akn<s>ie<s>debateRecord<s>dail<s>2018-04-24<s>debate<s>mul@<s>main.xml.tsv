What role will the council play and is the Taoiseach putting the need to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis as a central urgent priority? There may be issues competing for the title of the most pressing economic and social issue but I believe it is the housing crisis. Yesterday, a bus driver, who would be on the average industrial wage, came to my office because he and his family are now facing homelessness due to rent increases. He cannot find housing anywhere. If people on average industrial earnings are facing homelessness because there are no council houses, rents are out of control and their earnings will not allow them to get a mortgage, one can hardly state that the Government's housing policy is working. Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, which People Before Profit certainly does not control, passed a motion stating Rebuilding Ireland had failed. Wexford County Council passed a similar motion. The evidence is there for all to see. The fact that the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland, Simon and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions took to the streets as part of a national demonstration recently is also evidence there is simply no faith that the Government's housing and homelessness policy is delivering. How much of a priority will this be for the Taoiseach and the role he will assign to NESC?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the statement as one of aspiration. However, we are coming late to the party and the statement is somewhat general and lacking in specific detail. We need to move to real projects and investment which will make this a reality. Biological waste is a resource but we are not using it while doing things that militate against it. Building a huge incinerator in Dublin, for example, militates against developing a circular economy and a bioeconomy. Why develop a bio and circular economy - a sustainable economy - when there is a big incinerator where one can just burn everything? That militates against it. Cities such as London, Paris and Munich have all discovered that privatising waste collection and recycling services does not help develop sustainable circular economies and bioeconomies, which is why those three cities have taken waste and recycling back into public ownership. We see from waste companies, the factor that dictates what they will or will not recycle is whether something is profitable, not whether it is good for developing a sustainable, circular economy and a recycling industry. We need to take those services back into public ownership, as those cities have done. Finally, if we are going to develop biorefining, biomass and so on, we must dramatically increase forest cover in this country, which is currently pathetic.
