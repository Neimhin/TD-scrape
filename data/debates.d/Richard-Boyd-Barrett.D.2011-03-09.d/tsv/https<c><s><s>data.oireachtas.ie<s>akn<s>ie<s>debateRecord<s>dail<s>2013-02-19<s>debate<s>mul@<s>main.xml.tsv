RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are already indications that the deal on the IBRC which the Taoiseach trumpeted as historic will face objections from Germany in particular and possibly elsewhere, and that the Government will not be allowed to in any way attempt to use the claimed savings to the State of €1 billion next year and €1 billion the year after to pull back or alleviate in any way the austerity which has been imposed or which the Government plans to impose under troika arrangements or as conditions or targets of the fiscal treaty. Has this been indicated to the Taoiseach? Was it indicated at the December summit? Will our EU so-called "partners", particularly Germany, prevent the Government passing on any benefit of the supposedly historic deal on Anglo Irish Bank to citizens who are being hammered with austerity? Will the Taoiseach clarify this? If this is not the case will the Taoiseach clarify precisely what benefits can be passed on to ordinary citizens to alleviate the burden of cuts and austerity, or using the extra savings the Taoiseach claims to have as a result of the deal for financing a stimulus jobs programme or a programme of economic growth? The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, is now discussing possible legal problems with the IBRC deal, and even the possibility of legal action being taken if the deal breaches ECB rules on monetary financing. Will the Taoiseach clarify whether this was discussed with him previously? Was it signalled this might happen? Did the Taoiseach fully proof the deal to ensure it would withstand any such legal challenges from the ECB or any other quarter in terms of its legality under ECB or European regulations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, that is not what I asked the Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will wait until you have stopped with the hilarity, Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to object in the strongest possible terms to the Finance Bill - which is probably one of the most important Bills that will pass through the Dáil in the course of this year - being taken that late at night.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not ask you, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely unacceptable that the Finance Bill should be taken that late. I do not know why the Taoiseach thinks it is funny. It is an absolute manipulation and abuse of the democratic process that a Bill of this importance is being taken that late and into the early hours of tomorrow morning. This Bill has profound implications for the solvency of the State and for citizens. It should been discussed in the full glare of public scrutiny and media attention. In my opinion, it is deliberately being put this late at night.There is absolutely no need for it. Members could have been brought into the Chamber earlier this morning or, for example, the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill scheduled for Thursday could have been swapped with the Finance Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The introduction of the Finance Bill should be taken at an hour when the public, the media and everyone can scrutinise fully that introduction. I appeal to the Taoiseach to change this proposed order. I also reiterate a point others have made, which is to have some respect for the staff in the Dáil who will be forced to stay here so late.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Government did two weeks ago and now it is doing it again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is manipulation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In many ways I feel out of place speaking on this subject. I feel that the women themselves should have the first chance to respond to what the Taoiseach has said today on behalf of the State. Their reaction is the most important thing. Things are as they are, however. Given that, I will try to do justice to the issues as I see them following the Taoiseach's statement.As the Taoiseach and others have stated, the history of the Magdalen laundries is a dark and utterly shameful chapter in the history of the State. It is a history of 90 years in which more than 10,000 innocent women, who did nothing wrong, were imprisoned, enslaved, exploited, stigmatised, abused and denied their most basic human and civil rights. It is a history in which the church and religious institutions, which claimed to be the moral guardians of society, were the jailers, abusers and torturers of these women. These institutions were agents for the daily humiliation and incarceration of these women and were responsible for obscenities one would have thought would be unthinkable in a civilised society. The thought that in a society claiming to be civilised, there would be mass graves in which the number of bodies was not matched by the number of death certificates simply beggars belief in a modern civilised society. As I listened to some of the speakers at the vigil outside Leinster House, who described and mentioned the names of people who did not survive but who lived and died inside these institutions and who talked about how those women were in these institutions for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, it simply beggars belief. If, however, the church and religious institutions were the direct agents of such horrific treatment of these women, the State colluded every step of the way. It did so by sending thousands of women to these institutions, by inspecting these institutions but ignoring the plight and the treatment of the women inside them, by funding these institutions, by trading with and profiting from these institutions and by failing to uphold human and civil rights, not just as we understand them today but as were in place even then in international law. It did so by failing to ensure the right to education of these women and thus blighting their future possibilities. Moreover, the State was at the centre of facilitating a much wider architecture of oppression and abuse that included the Magdalen laundries, Bethany Home, the industrial schools and a more general culture of repression and control in which women, the less well-off, those who were different or who failed to conform to oppressive social and moral norms were the chief victims. It beggars belief that it has taken this long for these women to get the acknowledgement and apology they have so long deserved. It beggars belief that the last of these institutions closed down only in 1996 - this was only a few years ago when many Members of this House were involved in politics - and that it has taken until now for the women finally to get the apology they deserve. The fact they have got it is a tribute to these women. They are the leaders who have led where the State has failed, where politicians have failed and where we have all failed in public life. In conclusion, if we apologise, as the Taoiseach rightly has done, that apology must now have meaning and substance. It appears as though there is not much to consider in this regard. The women have led where we have failed. They have indicated what they need for redress and compensation and we should simply give it to them in order that they no longer are obliged to wait and suffer in the way they have for far too long. If apologies are to have meaning, we must act immediately.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have very little positive to say about the Bill, so I will say the one positive thing I can think of. I wish to commend the Department of Finance officials on the obvious hard work they need to put into preparing what is clearly a very technically complex and mind-bending Bill. They do so every year and deserve great credit. They were very helpful in answering some of my questions this afternoon and this evening.The conclusion I have drawn from my reading of the Bill is that there is not an awful lot in it. To my mind, that is the biggest problem with this Bill. I do not want to reiterate the point I made earlier on the Order of Business in regard to the timing of the introduction of this Bill, except to say that its introduction late at night is connected to there being nothing much in it. It smacks of manipulation of the debate around what is a critical issue about which every citizen of this State is concerned because of the severity of the crisis we are in, namely, the financial state of this country, and the measures and proposals being put forward by the Government in terms of offering relief, hope and a strategy for getting us out of that mess. This Bill is being introduced late at night precisely because it does not do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have heard that. However, I am unconvinced. I am not aware of the Minister's schedule or meetings in London. Perhaps he can tell me about them afterwards. Maybe he will convince me. This is the second time in two weeks that we have dealt with critical legislation dealing with the finances of the State at a time when they are in the worst state they have ever been in the history of the State. To my mind, it is problematic that this should happen twice in two weeks into the early hours of the morning. I see a connection between what happened two weeks ago and what is provided for, or not, in this Bill. Two weeks ago the Government used a late night session of the Dáil to present as a great victory a Bill which was in reality simply a repackaging of the treasonous decision of the previous Government to pin €30 billion worth of the gambling debts of former Anglo Irish Bank to the backs of the citizens of this State. The Minister presented that repackaging as a great victory and implied that there was something in it for the citizens of this country and the economy when the real substance of what went on during that late night session was that the Minister confirmed the disastrous decision made by the previous Government, legally committing us to paying every cent of those gambling debts and guaranteeing we are facing into long-term economic stagnation. The quid pro quo of making that commitment is that the Government now has no room to manoeuvre. That is the point I am making. The reason there is nothing in this Finance Bill that will make any substantial difference is because the Minister has given away all of our room to manoeuvre. What he should and could have done, much as he protests it is impossible and so on to do so, was said that these are not our debts, that our economy cannot afford to take them on if it is to have any hope of economic recovery and if he, as Minister for Finance, is to have any room to manoeuvre to propose measures that could help stimulate the economy and economic growth, and that we will not pay them. To put it simply, because of the guarantees given, this Bill can offer us nothing.  Furthermore, as if committing to paying off Anglo's debts was not bad enough, it has emerged during the past two weeks that even the short-term savings, about which the Minister was crowing two weeks ago we would get in 2014 and 2015, cannot be translated into any measures which make any substantial difference to the citizens of this State. It is somewhat debatable if these short-term savings even exist. It is clear that even if they do, and if the Minister's arithmetic is correct, they cannot be translated into any reversal of proposals to introduce a home tax, water tax or previous austerity measures such as the universal social charge imposed on low and middle income families, all of which not only ensure people suffer but are utterly destructive in terms of the domestic economy and its capacity to recover. The Government claims that none of these savings can be used for public investment programmes or to prevent the troika demanded sale of State assets, which to my mind are sales which move us precisely in the opposite direction to that we need to go if we are to have any chance of economic recovery. I would like to comment on the sale of Irish Life. I do so not for the sake of it but because I believe somebody needs to puncture the consensus. I cannot believe the Government is congratulating itself, that Fianna Fáil is congratulating it and that, more astonishingly, Sinn Féin is giving a cautious welcome to the sale of Irish Life. It beggars belief. We propose to hold on to all of the institutions that are broke, insolvent and have bad debts and to sell off a State asset that is profitable, resulting in the loss of a couple of hundred jobs, it being asset stripped and all of the profits derived therefrom going to somebody else. How on earth is this a good deal for us? I do not get it. Private financial institutions committed not to the interests of this State or its citizens but to profit caused the financial crisis. The Government now proposes to privatise a profitable financial institution owned by the State. It is beyond belief. The Minister's comments that this package is part of a general situation about which we should be optimistic and that things are slowly moving in the right direction are utterly unconvincing. The reality is that the key decision made by the Minister ensures there can be no development or growth in the domestic economy and no improvement in employment. What we are left with is a few gestures, which I welcome, which are marginally progressive but almost meaningless in terms of what they will gather for the Exchequer.These include increasing the level of universal social charge on people over 70 who earn more than €60,000 a year and increasing the level of the universal social charge on self-employed pensioners with more than €100,000 a year. This is progressive, but so small as to be utterly insignificant. I do not agree with tax incentives because they are focused on the same premise which caused the crisis in the first place. This premise is that we need to incentivise parts of the private sector to deliver the investment and growth the State itself is not willing to provide. Even here, the measures are marginal. They are small tweaks in the research and development credit, the foreign earnings deduction and the living city initiative which, frankly, is a bit bizarre and the Minister will have to explain this one. Why should people with Georgian houses get a particular tax break? I live in Dún Laoghaire but I do not see its logic. The Bill also includes tax breaks for the aviation industry. Aside from the specifics of these measures, the problem is they are part of the same failed approach whereby in so far as we can do anything, it is about incentivising the private sector. These are small tweaks and extensions to the much more fundamental policy, which the Minister has refused to examine, of stating we must keep tax on the corporate sector low. This means if we must levy taxes they must be levied on low and middle income workers. The most important dimension of this comprises the universal social charge, which is destroying people, the household charge and water charges. Whatever we do we must not look at corporate tax and think about increasing it or even forcing the corporate sector to pay the 12.5% it is supposed to pay. This is what the Bill should be examining and what we should be discussing. We need serious interrogation on this and we will deal with it on Committee Stage. The sacred cow that low corporate taxation was the key to our economic success could possibly stand up during the period of the Celtic tiger, but four years after the collapse of the Celtic tiger can we really say this sacred cow should not be questioned? The Minister's red-line protection of low corporate tax rates has delivered nothing in the past four years in terms of economic growth or employment. The Minister claims a marginal increase in the export sector, but this is at the expense of the domestic economy. There has been no net increase in employment. This is not a vista of hope for anybody. I propose the Minister examines whether we should do things the other way around and that we have a serious debate on this. The universal social charge should be removed from people earning less than €60,000 a year, which would cost approximately €2.5 billion, and taxes on the corporate sector and those earning more than €100,000 a year should be increased by €2.5 billion. This would be a combination of higher income taxes and increasing the effective tax rate paid by corporations. This would do more to stimulate the domestic economy by creating demand on the high street and by providing us with funds for a public investment programme which could stimulate growth.
