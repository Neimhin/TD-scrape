RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Government monitoring public private partnership agreements to ensure rights and conditions for employees are maintained? I ask this question in the context of the official pickets at the Shanganagh wastewater treatment plant yesterday. According to workers, the consortium of a Spanish multinational and an Irish building firm attempted to sack a shop steward who had sought to negotiate on conditions and so on. As a result, the workers have been forced to strike. The partner in this PPP is DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Will the Minister give an undertaking that such projects do not function as an opportunity for private firms to trample on workers' rights?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Setting aside the politics of it and focusing on the process, will the Minister not pre-empt and subvert the ballot of workers which is likely to take place in the next week by demanding that amendments for this Bill are submitted by tomorrow at 11 a.m? The workers have not looked at it and neither have Members.
