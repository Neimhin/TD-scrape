RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are aware that Apple avoided paying €13 billion in tax through the double Irish scheme using Irish registered companies. The Paradise Papers reveal that in 2014 and 2015, changes made by then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to the intangible assets allowance enabled Apple and almost certainly other companies to continue to avoid billions of euro in tax, using Irish registered companies and offshore tax havens. Will the Minister tell us what lobbying, discussions and communications took place for the Government to make the decision in 2014 which facilitated Apple and others?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The change made by the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, in 2014 is a scandal. Séamus Coffey said that had we not made that change, we would have collected €722 million in additional tax in 2015, and presumably there would have been a similar figure in subsequent years. Mr. Coffey said that if one ensured that all claims for this allowance was under the 80% regime, we would have an extra €1 billion next year. In 2015, a window was opened, through which Apple jumped, using Jersey and Ireland. This was conveniently opened that year by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan. We need to know what lobbying took place, what discussions were undertaken and what the rationale was for increasing that allowance in 2015. It cannot be a coincidence that after the double Irish was closed, Apple and others restructured their tax avoidance arrangements using Irish companies and Jersey to escape billions of euro in tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	During the committee hearings that year, it was said that the much trumpeted double Irish would, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies would be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes, but in a slightly different way, by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights. That is exactly what happened. The Government was warned about it. The Minister acts as though he is some sort of innocent and Apple got the better of him, but the change that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, made in that budget resulted in them avoiding billions of tax, just as I said it would at the committee meeting. The mechanism through which they did this has now been revealed in the Paradise Papers. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple earlier that year, as did the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and in the 2015 budget which was presented in October 2014, the change was included which opened the window for this tax avoidance scheme. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that he did not know this would be the result, and that conveniently Apple would be allowed to onshore billions of euro of assets and, as Séamus Coffey pointed out, not pay any extra tax at all even though the profits in that year jumped by approximately €50 billion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Coppinger. I will keep it brief. I personally wish all of the new appointees well and I hope they will succeed in their briefs. There has been much discussion about people being thrown or not being thrown under buses over the last while. Our concerns are not about the Deputies as politicians or as individuals, whom we may wish well, but about the issues they are addressing. That is what we are concerned about. Coming into Christmas, most people want to see this Government deal with the housing and homelessness crisis, the health crisis and the inequalities and injustices in our society. We will hold the Ministers to account on those issues. I particularly hope that we can begin to excel in the arts area. I wish the Deputies the best of luck.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am absolutely opposed to this further integration of this country into European military industrial complex. It is laughable that the Government and Fianna Fáil can try to justify this as being somehow in our interests to protect us against cyberterrorism.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is even worse. What a load of nonsense. The European Union border regime alone is like some sort of horrific nightmare from a dystopian science fiction horror movie in terms of our complicity in the horrors that are going on in Libya. We are involved in training the Libyan coast guard, which, in turn, is deeply implicated in slavery, systematic rape, beatings and torture of vulnerable people who are trapped. Up to 1 million people are trapped in Libya because the Western powers went in and destroyed Libya. Now the country has collapsed and these desperate people are looking to come to Europe for a new life. Thousands of them drown in the Mediterranean Sea with more sent back. I am absolutely amazed that the Minister of State finds this amusing, by the way. It is an horrific situation. If there are threats out there, it is because of what Western powers, including European powers, have done in places such as Libya and the inhuman response of the European Union. Instead, we are developing systems essentially to make it easier to repel these people and co-operate with some of the forces guilty of this horror. Of course, it dates back to beyond that. There is the horrific EU-Turkey deal, again about repelling desperate Syrian migrants coming from the disaster in Syria, turning a blind eye to the horrific human rights of the Turkish regime against its own people, against journalists, locking up politicians and so on. We are quite happy to do deals with Turkey. We are willing to engage in trade with horrific regimes such as Saudi Arabia, which is beyond words in its horror with the denial of human rights at the most basic level. After the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, went to the United Arab Emirates and was asked if he raised human rights issues, he said it was not really appropriate to raise human rights on trade missions. It is that kind of amorality of being willing to work with these regimes. We are doing big trade deals with the Egyptian regime. We were complicit in the US military assault on Iraq which destroyed Iraq and in turn had a knock-on effect in Syria. There would be no ISIS threat were it not for all these things. We then justify beefing up the European military industrial complex as a response to that to protect ourselves when we have actually created that mess or been complicit in creating the mess that generated those threats in the first place. On these particular initiatives, the European arms industry has boosted its lobbying budget over the past five years from €2.6 million to €5.8 million. The 36 different meetings between the arms industry and the European Commission between 2013 and 2016 form the backdrop to this. This is the totally immoral arms industry trying to cash in on this stuff that European and other Western powers have helped generate through their direct involvement in horrors in the Middle East, Libya and Turkey or through complicity with the US war machine at Shannon here. Those are the issues we should be addressing. Of course, we should also care about our soldiers who are standing outside the gates of Leinster House. Some of them are on family income supplement because we do not even pay them decent wages. We want to line the pockets of the European military industrial complex. We should have nothing to do with the international arms industry and the warmongering agenda that lies behind it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have much to add-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----except to say it appears that there is nothing that gets Members of this Chamber more excited than the issue of seats. They are more excited about it than the issues which concern the people. The matter has been resolved in that the boundary commission will be legislated for next week and the appropriate level of representation proportionate to the size of population will be established. I do not believe there is a particular need now for us to act and presume the proceedings will be withdrawn by Mr. Joe Costello on foot of this. While I understand the Houses of the Oireachtas will have to be formally represented, I am not in favour, without a substantial debate if the matter remains controversial, of assenting to a particular defence. It would have to be discussed properly, certainly by our group, as to whether we should defend the right of the House not to have people adequately represented or, for that matter, the other side of the argument. It is academic at this point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Private health insurance is a fundamentally parasitical enterprise. It preys on the fears of people about the prospect of being ill and needing care and the inability of the public health system, for which they pay through their taxes, not being able to provide them with that care. This is a shameful enterprise that, week in week out, with wall-to-wall advertising on the radio, plays on those fears to profit from a fundamentally unequal health system, and from what is euphemistically known as the two-tier system. As I have said many times in the House, it just absolutely drives me round the twist listening to advertisements about going to the accident and emergency department at the Blackrock Clinic or to the Beacon Hospital if people can pay. If people cannot pay, they must line up on a trolley in St. James's Hospital for the rest of the day and maybe into tomorrow, or go to St. Vincent's hospital for hours and hours, or wait years for vital operations. Incredibly, some people wait four years for cataract operations and people in chronic pain needing hip replacement wait two years. Children needing scoliosis operation wait months longer than they should have to, and in some cases wait up to two years. All the while, somebody is making money out of it. In fact, the worse the situation is in the public health system, the more there are waiting lists, and the longer those lists are, and the more accident and emergency units are overcrowded, the more these private health care operators stand to profit. It is really sick. I accept that in a sick, unfair, fundamentally unequal health system such as this, the Bill is a very moderate attempt to level an unequal playing field through risk equalisation and community rating. Of course, it is simultaneously propping up the whole market, as the Minister calls it. This is another thing that drives me mad. I do not know how many references the Minister made to the market for health.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the difference between the Minister and me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I fundamentally object to the health needs of humans being referred to as a market. Our State has an obligation to provide health care as a matter of human right to our citizens. There is an idea that a market has sprung up because we have been unable to do this, because we have underfunded our health service, inflicted savage cuts on it and slaughtered staff numbers and the budget and, consequently, have driven more and more people out of fear to take out private health insurance, in the hope they can skip a queue when they really need to. There should not be a queue, but if there is a queue, people out of fear and anxiety will seek to get up the queue when they are sick and vulnerable and need help. It is the failure of the political system to establish a national health system with cradle to grave health care of the highest quality as a matter of right for our citizens that has spawned this rotten profiteering parasitical two-tier system.We saw the extreme end of that with incredibly well-paid private consultants not even doing the hours they are supposed to do. In case anybody gets me wrong, I am aware that there are many decent consultants who would not do that. However, we create the conditions for that and we have the ultimate responsibility for the profiteering and self-serving, selfish behaviour of some well-paid consultants who want to make even more money. We have created those conditions through our chronic under-funding and under-resourcing of the public health system and our support of the parasitical private health insurance industry. There is no doubt about that. Obviously, and correctly, I am not entitled to a medical card. At a time when health care is being rationed, it would be shameful if I were. However, I believe every citizen should have access to the cradle-to-grave health care that a national health system would provide. As a matter of principle I would not take out private health insurance. It is absolutely wrong that one could jump a queue by dint of one's income. I would never take out such health insurance. Contrast that to the behaviour of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health. He introduced an additional levy on people who did not take out private health insurance by the age of 35 years before a deadline of May 2015. He had posters and T-shirts that touted, advertised and threatened on behalf of the private health insurance industry, urging people to get private health insurance or they would pay. He said at the time: As Minister for Health, I wanted to take a lead. I also wanted to avoid the levy ... I can honestly say that I feel a lot better having taken out health insurance again.What is the message there? It is that if one does not have private health insurance, one has something to worry about. He could afford to get it and he was relieved. What was he relieved about? He was relieved that he does not have to rely on the public health system. Is it not absolutely shameful that the person who was in charge of the public health system said he was relieved he did not have to rely on that system because he got private health insurance? That is shocking. No Member of this House should have private health insurance. If we have it, we are saying that the system over which we preside cannot provide for citizens. People must take out private insurance if they can afford it. Huge numbers cannot. The fear tactics on that occasion worked. Some 150,000 additional people took out private health insurance after the scare tactics mounted by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, in 2015. It was dragooning people into taking out private health insurance to the benefit of the private health insurance industry. What happened at the time was shocking. Consider the profits these health insurance companies make and the extraordinary waste in advertising. The money is not going to health care but to advertisements that urge people to go to the companies' hospitals so they will not have to queue. That is all waste. It is money diverted from the front line of public health care. I do not know why the Minister is shaking his head. That is a fact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are spending €2 billion on private health insurance. Would it not be far better if that money went into the public health system? It would go a hell of a long way towards sorting out the problems in that system. That is in addition to the €2.5 billion to €3 billion, or 18%, they fork out on out-of-pocket charges, such as accident and emergency charges, overnight stay charges, general practitioner charges and so forth. I recall what the Government said when it tried to defend the savage cuts it imposed on the public health system during the austerity period. It boasted that we spend one of the highest proportions of GDP on health, forgetting that a huge proportion of this does not go to the public health system. Only 69% of the spend goes into the public budget when one strips out the out-of-pocket charges ordinary people must pay and the €2 billion spent on private health insurance. That money and a system of progressive taxation could be used to fund a state-of-the-art national health system so that when people need health care, they need not worry. The last thing people need to worry about when they need health care is whether they can afford health insurance premiums or, if they do not have insurance, the out-of-pocket charges they might have to pay. The other issue with this Bill is that the industry report prepared for the Government has not been not published. Is it available to the public? Can we see it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are passing the legislation without seeing the report. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be useful. I am glad I asked because I do not believe we should pass legislation without either seeing the report on which it is based or being certain that the levies and the distribution of credits are all being passed on. Is it guaranteed that they will all be passed on to where they should be in terms of equalising the cost of insurance and not into the back pockets of certain health insurance companies? Does the legislation ensure that is the case and that there is accountability for the disbursement of the levy credits? That is an aside to my fundamental point. We will not oppose the Bill because it is trying to equalise a fundamentally unequal system. However, I object in the strongest terms to the fact that this Government has propped up the private health insurance industry, touted on its behalf and exacerbated people's fears and anxieties about having or not having private health insurance and also the concerns that arise from our abysmal failure to fund and resource the public health system properly, which is what should be resourced in order to ensure that there is genuine equality, not risk equalisation, in access to health care. All citizens deserve that as a right because they are human beings, not because they are players in the so-called market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I wish to pass on my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the two people who died on the streets, but these deaths, the seven in total who have died in recent weeks, and the 30 or 40 that the Taoiseach said who die every year bring shame on politics, the Government and our society. They are not acceptable but they are not necessary. That is the key point. We have talked about the vacant homes that exist in this State and gone on to debate the issue and questioned whether there are 180,000 such homes, as indicated by the Central Statistics Office, or a percentage of that figure but, nevertheless, there are thousands of them. The Peter McVerry Trust issued an email this week following the two deaths stating that it estimates that 250 to 300 Housing First solutions would solve the worst aspects of the crisis on the streets, the rough sleeping. There are certainly that number of vacant units and many more, but we must have the determination and will to get hold of them and to make them available to people who are sleeping on the streets. That is what needs to be done. We need to go way beyond that. Unlike the comments we heard from Eileen Gleeson, all of the people who are sleeping on the streets are there because of the failure to provide affordable public housing but many of them do not take up the emergency accommodation because they are terrified. I got a text yesterday when I was sitting in the Dáil from a man who has been homeless for three years. He is in one of the emergency accommodations in Dublin 8 and he said he is terrified living there. I know some of the emergency accommodation is okay but the Peter McVerry Trust and all the other agencies tell us that, in many cases, it is terrifying to go to those facilities. People are not willing to go to them and then they end up on the streets. I will not go through all the requests the Peter McVerry Trust has made: the Minister of State will also have received this email. It sets out a series of simple requests which should be met. We need to deal with the vacant homes issue, to get hold of the vacant homes necessary for those Housing First places and then move on to build the council houses that can solve the deeper problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should deliver the 250 to 300 Housing First places that the Peter McVerry Trust has asked for. The houses exist and should be identified and made available. Critically, the supports should also be made available. I have a personal friend who I have known since I was 12 years of age who is now homeless again. We had got him onto the Housing First system. He got himself clear of his addiction for about a year running up to that, but the supports were not in place for him. He was put into a place where there was no furniture, no beds, nothing and there was nobody around to support him. He cracked up again and now he is back on the streets. That is what happens if the supports are not provided. This issue is not just about numbers or how many emergency beds we have, it must be about the real supports and working with these human beings to provide them with accommodation that is sustainable.
