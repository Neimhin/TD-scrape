RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before Deputy Durkan starts, I came in earlier and indicated that I had to go over and return, so I do not understand why I was not included in the first round of questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that. However, that was not the question I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to clarify whether I can have ten minutes because I did come in earlier. I had to leave for questions in the Dáil. I signalled this to the Chairman before I left.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister understand the rage and fury felt by the public and perhaps nurses when he says he cannot afford to give them a pay increase which they must now go on strike to achieve, while the price paid by the public for the national children's hospital is 250% to 300% higher than the original bid? Does he understand the double standards the public believes are at work? Does he believe somebody should be held accountable? Does the Minister believe that whoever selected the building contractor in this case has questions to answer about that contractor's record? This is not the first time the building contractor has massively overrun, both in this country and abroad. Is the Department of Health aware of BAM's history? I am not saying anything that is not in the public domain. In Ballyfermot the company built a leisure complex and there was a major dispute with Dublin City Council over a cost overrun of €27 million. To add insult to injury, I believe the tiles of the swimming pool are falling. In the Netherlands BAM built a multistorey car park that collapsed and then there was a protracted battle with the Dutch authorities. A settlement had to be reached on the cost. There was an arithmetic mistake made by BAM on a job in Ringaskiddy involving the Port of Cork Company which resulted in an additional cost of €12 million. For the Beamish & Crawford brewery in Cork, the price tag was €53 million, but then the company asked for an extra €12 million. In Cambridge BAM issued a cost of £116 million for the guided busway, but the figure came in at €152 million. Does the Minister know how a company with that record and questions to answer could have been selected?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished. I would like to ask these questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister believe the fact the bid was €120 million lower than the next one should have raised a flag? Was a simple comparison made between the costs included in the bids? Who selected the board? Did the State look into its members' record in that regard? Mr. Costello who seems to be completely unconcerned and says BAM's tender was professional had to leave Sisk after a mess-up in Poland on road projects, in respect of which there were significant cost overruns that had not been estimated and that nearly led Sisk to going bankrupt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government selects the people who do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister suggesting the overruns are acceptable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying the company deliberately tendered under the budget to get the contract but there was not proper scrutiny of the bid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not make a charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I simply stated a fact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not criticising. I was just asking if we looked into his record. It is in the public domain that he was involved with a project in Poland with big overruns. I read that in the newspapers after googling him. It was The Irish Times, the paper of record.
