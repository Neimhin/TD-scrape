RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This budget is really a cynical bag of pre-election tricks without any substance whatsoever. It will do nothing to deal with the emergency in housing and homelessness, the disaster in public hospitals, or the gaping and growing inequality and poverty in society. I even have to disagree with some of my Opposition colleagues who are calling this a giveaway budget. It is not. A few miserable crumbs are being given to people who have had their incomes and services savaged for the past six years. The only giveaway is to the multinational corporations and NAMA, National Asset Management Agency, developers. This makes an absolute mockery of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan's claim today that this is the end of boom-bust politics. Boom-bust politics happened because we gave massive tax breaks and backing to corporate vultures and developers. Now, we are going to do it again. It is unbelievable. In a way, this budget is a magician's trick. The Government tried to hypnotise the media, which it has done largely successfully today, and then tried to hypnotise the public, but it will not be so successful with it, with the few crumbs it is throwing to ordinary people. The real business is being done with the new tax avoidance scheme being put in place by the Government to allow the multinationals to evade billions of euro in tax when the international community is screaming for action to be taken to prevent this very type of tax avoidance. The knowledge box is nothing other than a scheme to insulate the multinationals in this country from the international push to make them pay their fair share of taxes. The new corporation tax rate for research and development of 6.25% - exactly half of the 12.5% rate; as if it is not low enough - happens to be the actual rate they are paying under the double-Irish tax arrangements, if one looks at the EUROSTAT figures. The Government is insulating the multinationals from the moves to reform the corporate tax system internationally. It is a disgrace. Unbelievably, the Government is going to put NAMA developers back in business to make profits from the housing crisis that it wilfully fails to address by not introducing rent controls or building social housing. Instead, it is going to get NAMA developers to profit from the misery of the housing crisis while people are dying on the streets. It is shameful. The game was given away this morning by the Taoiseach when he was asked why there were no rent controls. He said such controls would interfere with the market. That is the agenda - nothing must interfere with the market. That is what the Government cares about and what it is protecting. That is what this budget is about. What has the Government given ordinary people? There is the insult of €3 for the pensioner after four years of an income freeze. Nothing has been given to raise the basic income of lone parents, carers or jobseekers. The shameful half-rate jobseeker’s allowance for those under 25 years which has driven 250,000 young people out of the country is an utter disgrace. Somebody on average earnings of €35,000 a year will receive €7 a week. It is a joke and it will be less if one is on €25,000 a year. Faced with the absolute catastrophe in the health service of 69,000 people on hospital waiting lists and 7,000 patients on hospital trolleys last month, the Government has not put enough extra money into the service, even when the most conservative standstill scenario indicates it needs €300 million just to stay where it is. The more serious standstill scenario indicates we need €600 million, which suggests the crisis is going to get worse next year based on these figures. The reality is we need several billion euro to undo the damage by the cuts imposed since 2006. The hospital crisis will be worse at the end of next year. The Government has cut capital expenditure in the education sector, with fewer school buildings. It has given nothing to the poor, the numbers of whom have grown under the Government. For the homeless, the budget is an utter disaster. The multinationals and the developers, however, have done very well out of it, thanks to the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would not surprise me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like clarification also because there have been instances in regard to aircraft leasing which have been an utter scandal. These are just further examples of the way the Government has crushed people with austerity taxes, charges and other cuts while fostering a regime which facilitates extraordinary levels of tax write-offs to the corporate sector, in particular multinationals. I did not have time to check back on the exact details of one instance I mentioned in this House on a couple of occasions in the past. One particular firm, GE Aviation, an aircraft leasing operation managed to pay 0.1% tax because of the tax regime of so-called incentives and allowances allowed by the Government then. I would like reassurance that this incentive is not just more of the same. I tried to get some clarification from the Taoiseach's officials before coming into the House as to what this incentive was and they told me something to the effect that it was being introduced to comply with EU state aid rules. Of course, that rings alarm bells for me, because it is precisely because of our facilitation of large-scale tax avoidance that we have been investigated by the EU Commission regarding breaches of state aid rules to the benefit of Apple. We are in serious trouble and our reputation has been seriously besmirched for having facilitated large-scale tax avoidance by one of the most profitable companies in the world. Therefore, I want reassurance that this is not more of the same. When I hear of the possibility that wealthy people with private aircraft could benefit from this, I want reassurance that this is not another case of tax breaks for high fliers from the Government. I ask for clarification from the Taoiseach as to who exactly will benefit from this and to what extent. I am deeply suspicious of these allowances, deductions and tax breaks for the corporate sector. As I said earlier in response to the budget, one of the shocking and outrageous proposals in it is the 6.25% tax rate in regard to the new knowledge box proposal, as if 12.5% was not low enough. We are going to halve that rate, essentially as a mechanism to replace the double Irish rule and insulate multinationals in this country from having to pay an increased tax contribution. We are replacing the double Irish rule with another tax scam, called the "knowledge box". Therefore, alarm bells ring when I see the sort of proposal we have here. I would like clarification from the Taoiseach as to exactly what this is and want reassurance that it is not just another tax scam that will benefit the big corporates and the super rich.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I disagree with this. Of course we should encourage people to give up smoking. It is a bad and dangerous habit. I can say that as a smoker.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not good. My children are always trying to persuade me and we should encourage as many people to give up a very bad and dangerous habit as possible but for those on low incomes, who are already struggling and who happen to have this habit and addiction, this is just another tax on their income. A pensioner who has got a miserly €3 a week back in this budget will have that wiped out by this measure. That person will be down 50 cent a week. An unemployed person, a jobseeker, a lone parent or a carer, none of whom has seen any increase in their basic rate in this budget, will be down another €3. It is particularly a tax on the poor. It does not matter if a person is wealthy or well paid. It will make no difference to or impact one way or another on the predilection to smoke, and it will not for most people, but it will have an impact on their income. As we have in previous years, we will oppose this tax. This is a revenue-generating exercise, nothing else, and it always has been. In every budget in which it is put forward, there are plenty of places where the Government does not hit the well-off but where it could generate revenue through the corporate sector, financial transactions, the wealthy, and higher incomes. This is just another tax on the least well-off and I will oppose it for that reason.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no change to the core payment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no change to the basic payment.
