RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Finance Bill is going through the Houses at present. Section 481, dealing with tax relief for the film industry, amounts to €70 million or €80 million a year. It is positive that we are investing in the film industry but, as the Minister knows, given it was discussed at length at the all-party Oireachtas committee, there are quite serious disputes and issues over working conditions in the film industry. The all-party Oireachtas committee recommended that there be a stakeholder forum where all stakeholders get together to discuss the future of the industry. I want to know which film industry stakeholders the Minister met recently. When will the forum be convened? Can we have assurances that all stakeholders will be asked to attend that forum?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The screen education-training forum is important and is long overdue because there is still no proper structure for training and progression for trainees. However, the industry forum is critical. This was recommended by the all-party Oireachtas committee and we need to know it is going to happen. As the Minister knows, there are very serious issues that need to be resolved in the interests of everybody in the industry, so we need that forum to happen. I am sure the Minister is aware there is a lot of controversy around this. The position of the Government has to be absolutely clear that all stakeholders, whether representatives of workers, producers or otherwise - namely, all those who work in the industry - need to be represented to address whether workers' rights are being fully vindicated in the industry, whether section 481 and public investment in the film industry are being properly policed, what benefit we are getting in terms of employment and, in particular, the requirement for quality employment and training in the industry. I am seeking assurances that the Minister will ensure that this forum happens and soon.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The "Prime Time" programme certainly outlined the disputes that exist. However, it was a bit of a travesty in terms of balance because it tried to imply that one group alone was responsible for problems in the industry and deliberately ignored evidence from other sources, for example, from workers in the industry and in particular from a number of organisations such as the GMB and SIPTU-Equity, whose representative, for example, said blacklisting was widespread in the industry. The point is that no group should have a veto on whether this forum happens. The forum should happen. Everybody should be involved and these issues should be resolved. I agree there are internecine trade union disputes and so on, but it is not a trade union forum; it is an industry stakeholders forum. Trade unions should be invited but all representatives of workers and all stakeholders need to get into a room to resolve this in the interests of the film industry. While I appreciate the Minister's response, we have to force the pace of this and ensure that industry forum happens and that nobody tries to boycott or sabotage it.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be careful about the narrative that a minority of people in the industry are doing this, that or the other. There are accusations flying from all directions. I would not take anything related to the "Prime Time" piece as read. We need to get to the substantial issues, which are predictability and continuity of employment and whether the public investment in the industry is securing what the tax relief is supposed to in law achieve, which is quality employment and training. It is critical that the forum happens and that we have an open airing of the different perspectives and come to a solution which allows the industry as a whole to move forward. The accusations and counter-accusations seem to be designed to prevent getting a resolution to this important question, which if we get it right will be to the benefit of the film industry and the country.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier this week, I raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, the problems that are pretty rampant with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. I cited the example of a working couple with a clean credit rating who saved their deposit. One of them is working in telecoms and the other is a hairdresser. Their application under this scheme was refused. I had heard the figure of 67% of applicants being refused. The Minister of State indicated that it is not that bad but that the figure stands at 50%. He said it needs to be worked on. It certainly does if that is the level of refusal in a scheme that is supposed to provide working people with the opportunity to buy homes in a climate where prices are extortionate and where people are having difficulties getting mortgages. When will the work to which the Minister of State referred be done? When will we do something to re-engineer the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme?
