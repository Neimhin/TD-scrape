RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They used to, they just stopped.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does it for other unions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the programme for Government, it is stated that the Government should be tested on its ability to deal with the housing crisis and provide social and affordable housing. On Friday, the Minister produced a regulation on affordable housing stating that somebody on €45,000 a year should be paying no more than 35% of their income, which would be €998 per month. On the front of today's edition of The Irish Times, we have an account of the Land Development Agency, LDA, which the Government set up, proposing affordable housing that would be €1,300 a month for a site in Shankill in respect of which we have been campaigning for five years to get council and affordable housing. That is not affordable, even by the Government's own definition of affordability. Furthermore, there will not be a single council house. The Taoiseach said earlier on that he is not ideological. That is ideological. Under the guise of promises about affordable housing, the Government is privatising public lands for unaffordable rents and preventing the construction of the council housing that we actually need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rent of €1,300 is not affordable. That is €15,000 a year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This time last year, just prior to Land Day, I warned the Taoiseach that the Israelis were preparing to attack the Great March of Return protests planned in Gaza. I do not think he even responded when I raised the issue. In advance of the protests I said it was likely that hundreds of Palestinians would be killed and that turned out to be the case. It is estimated that more than 200 Palestinians were killed and that a further 18,000 were injured. The conflict continued for months. Land Day is coming up at the end of this week and further protests are planned by the people of Gaza to vindicate their right under international law to return to the homes and villages from which they were expelled in 1948. Israel is already giving signs that it is going to do the same as it did last year. More innocent Palestinian blood will be shed as the Israelis seek to deny the Palestinians their rights under international law. At the same time, the US President, Mr. Donald Trump, in defiance of international law, has legitimised the illegal annexation by Israel of the Golan Heights, which is sovereign Syrian territory. Was there a discussion at the EU-Arab League summit on the likelihood of the conflict escalating into violence again because of the justified and legitimate protests by the people of Gaza to vindicate their rights? Was there a discussion on the behaviour of President Trump in legitimising the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and his systematic denial of Palestinian rights? Are the Irish Government and the European Union going to do anything more than they did last year about the likely killing of innocent Palestinians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was at the summit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest that the Taoiseach holds a public consultation on the role of local government. There was a very good presentation today by a number of trade unions organising members in local authorities. It pointed out that we are at the absolute bottom of the European league table in terms of services provided by local authorities, the level of funding local government gets, and the extent to which services that should be delivered by local authorities have been centralised or outsourced and privatised with damaging consequences. If we want to reinvigorate local government and local democracy, we should seriously consider a consultation on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The populists are for public consultation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree, but when people make decisions the Taoiseach does not like, he calls it populism.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously we hope that a deal might be done to resolve this matter, but we do not know if it will be done. Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with Theresa May about her view of what Britain intends to do in the event of no deal? The Taoiseach has said he is not making preparations. I welcome that because he should not. I am not so sure about the EU's intentions in that regard if there is no deal given its desire to protect the Single Market. Did he have discussions with Theresa May on what Britain is planning for the Border if there is no deal? The other matter I wish to raise has particular pertinence given the possibility that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his gang might throw the DUP under the bus, as it were, and that their solidarity with the DUP might disappear for their own parochial English reasons. Is it not time, as Professor Colin Harvey and others are saying today, to point out that the single lesson from this debacle is that it does not make sense to have administrative, political or economic divergence between two parts of this island and that it is time to open a discussion on a united Ireland in a serious way?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even Jacob Rees-Mogg and his gang are willing to jettison the North for their own parochial purposes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for missing the earlier part of the debate. I was at a committee meeting, not that it ever bothers the Taoiseach when he walks out while we are speaking, even when we have been here since the beginning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach again today took an opportunity to raise the spectre of populism and particularly had a go at what he described as "the far left populists" in this country. This common theme is repeated and has become a theme throughout Europe. This term is being used as a way of failing to understand the very serious political dangers and threats arising in Europe. It was not an amorphous thing called "populism" that led to the rise of fascism in the 1930s and the Holocaust.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was fascist right-wing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly. Extreme nationalists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas Cheann-Chomhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This failure to distinguish extreme right-wing politics with racism at its heart and what it did to Europe in the 1930s and to throw that accusation at others comes at a time when our own Government is in a political alliance with the most dangerous manifestation of crypto-fascist extreme right racist, Islamophobic politics in the entirety of Europe, in the form of Viktor Orbán, a person who has spewed out anti-Muslim filth of the sort that legitimised the massacre in New Zealand. That is what is going on. The Taoiseach then had the audacity to attack the British Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and somehow equate him with Viktor Orbán. Jeremy Corbyn does not have a racist bone in his body. He has fought his entire life against racism, anti-Semitism and anything even remotely like it. The people who are attacking Corbyn are those who say that if one criticises Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians, one is anti-Semitic, which is the most dishonest accusation imaginable because what Israel is doing to the Palestinians - Europe stands idly by while it does it - is the absolute vicious persecution of the Palestinians and the denial of their most basic rights and the right to return to some sort of self-determination and sovereignty.It locks up hundreds of Palestinian children without trial. The European Union ignores what Israel does and ignores the fact that today, in defiance of international law, Donald Trump is legitimising the illegal annexation of Syrian territory and that Israel is planning another assault on peaceful protestors in Gaza as they prepare to protest for their rights under international law and for the right to return. Europe stands idly by. The Taoiseach stands idly by and then pops out allegations against the left when he is conspiring with or failing to challenge the political forces that visit death, destruction and illegality on the people of Palestine and colluding with obnoxious political forces in Europe such as Viktor Orbán. The hypocrisy of it is absolutely stunning. It is that kind of hypocrisy, playing around with these political forces and appeasement of those sort of political forces to use the terminology of the 1930s, it is appeasement of the fascist far right, racism, authoritarianism and all that goes with it that led to the horrors of the past and that is the very real danger that is growing right across Europe. Instead of playing petty politics to have pot shots at Members on the other side, the Taoiseach should start to show a little bit of a moral compass when it comes to the very dangerous far right political threat that is emerging across Europe.
