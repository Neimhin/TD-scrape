RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am against this amendment because if we need people to make medical assessments, they should be employed full-time. We do not need agency people. The reason we have a backlog is the moratorium. Many Departments have massive backlogs because we are understaffed and that is having a detrimental effect on people who are awaiting decisions. It is also having a detrimental effect on the quality of the decisions made because they are made on the basis of ticking a box and without any real concern for the human beings involved. The way to deal with this is to recognise that we do not have enough staff in these areas and to take people on full-time and pay them properly, rather than using agency workers. There is another aspect to this which concerns me. I do not understand why amendments in the same sort of area, and to which we will come in a minute, have been ruled out of order. They concern the basis on which we make adjudications where medical opinion is required. If, as is often the case, a GP says a person is in need of full-time care or is not able to work, why do we have people second-guessing him or her? The ultimate decisions are made by deciding officers who do not have any medical qualifications whatsoever and that is completely unacceptable. The Government could save the cost of taking on agency people if it accepted the word of a GP. If a GP says a person is in need of full-time care or is not able to work, that should be it - case closed. The decisions could be made on that basis, but instead we have a huge backlog and people who are not qualified to make decisions are second-guessing medical professionals. I assume they do so on the basis of looking to refuse people benefits to which medical professionals say they are entitled. It is unacceptable that people should have to jump through hoops when they have medical testimony from their own GP to the effect that they should be entitled to medical benefits or supports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am assuming that any GP who gives a diagnosis of someone's condition does so in good faith and in accordance with their responsibilities as a medical professional. It is not about putting pressure on them. Day in, day out GPs write letters in which they state someone is not fit for work or permanently incapacitated and, in their professional opinion, needs care. I do not believe non-medical people should be second-guessing doctors on those medical judgments. An official in the Department would want a very good medical reason for denying care to people. The intelligence and professional integrity of GPs and even consultants is being insulted by non-medical people overruling their diagnoses about people's capacity to work. That is absolutely unacceptable. The proof that this is completely unacceptable behaviour is that when these people go on to appeal, a huge number of cases are won. I do not have the exact number but it is over 50% of cases.People with serious disabilities and medical conditions are being forced to jump through hoops or into an appeals process to get their just entitlements and desserts, many of which are being delayed for unacceptable periods because somebody who is not a medical professional, presumably under pressure of budgets and so on, is making wrong decisions. This has to end. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While the Minister of State may have a point about people wanting short-term contracts, the optimum situation is undoubtedly for people to be taken on full-time. If the Government takes seriously or accepts that the optimum scenario is to have people recruited on a full-time basis if or when we need them then the amendment should specify that this is the first call. The Minister of State should consider that if he takes the point. It should be specified that any recruitment via an agency would only be after the possibility of full-time recruitment for the necessary position has been exhausted and someone could not be found. In that context there might be a possible case for taking people on via an agency. I do not accept the response or the point made by the Minister of State. The fact is general practitioners and in some cases consultants are testifying to the fact that people are not capable of work, permanently incapable of work or require full-time care. Despite this medical testimony from qualified medical professionals the Department is refusing people. That is a fact. I do not see how that can be justified in almost any case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Joan Collins tabled these two amendments on my behalf. I am gobsmacked that they have been ruled out of order, particularly the one that refers to the general practitioner. One could possibly argue that because amendment No. 4 removes the requirement regarding care for in excess of 12 months, it could mean greater access and, therefore, represent a potential charge on the State. We will deal with this issue when discussing the section because we will still be able to argue these points then. My point is setting aside the moral arguments we could make when dealing with the section. Applying to amendment No. 5 the same logic applied to amendment No. 4 is preposterous. How could it possibly represent an additional charge on the State if the legislation states one must comply and given that we do not second-guess diagnoses, as the Minister just said? One either fits the medical criteria or one does not. It is on that basis that people are deemed to be eligible. Therefore, how on earth could the making of the decision on eligibility by a general practitioner, rather than a deciding officer, involve an extra charge on the State? Either one fits the criteria or one does not. The amendment is simply about stating who is best suited to decide whether a person fits the criteria, be it a medical professional or somebody with no medical training at all. How could this be a charge on the State? I am gobsmacked that the amendment has been ruled out of order. It is out of order to rule it out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How could it allow greater access?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who makes the ruling?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How would making the general practitioner the officer to determine eligibility involve greater access?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With due respect-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman has articulated a possible explanation. All of the points she has made have nothing whatsoever to do with the Bill because they are arguments around it. They are assumptions people are making that have nothing to do with the Bill which is about meeting certain criteria. Does it state anywhere that, when deciding whether somebody is eligible or meets the criteria, budgetary considerations should come into play? It does not. Therefore, the argument is totally irrelevant. It is implied in the statement of the Chairman and, sadly, that of Deputy Ray Butler that general practitioners are writing letters based not on their best medical opinion but on the basis of pressure being exerted on them. First, we have no right to assume and certainly no right to adjudicate on whether a point is in order or out of order. If the implication is true, it is an absolute scandal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a different matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I most certainly will. I really believe the decision to rule amendment No. 5 out of order is baseless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I submitted these two amendments and I will revert to them on Report Stage because there is no doubt in my mind that this section involves a deliberate subtle or not so subtle attempt to tighten eligibility and entitlement for carers. That is unacceptable. What it is doing essentially is to retrospectively legislate for what has been happening in practice, which is a tightening up of decisions to grant - or to refuse, should I say - where there has been a sort of default position of refusing people who are then forced to go through even more hoops and appeals in order to get what they are seeking. I can only assume this is in the hope that a significant portion of applicants would just give up and go away. Up to now, the legislation was ambiguous and that ambiguity allowed deciding officers to refuse people who really should not have been refused. However, this provision is shifting the balance towards the deciding officer to make it easier for the deciding officer to refuse people. That is what is happening; it is to restrict the eligibility in terms of the 12 months. What happens if a person gets cancer and he or she is undergoing a very intense treatment of chemotherapy and is not already in the best shape? That person will need care for a temporary period that may not continue indefinitely if the treatment works. This is not an unusual situation. It may not be the case that this person will require care indefinitely beyond 12 months. This may or may not be the case but most definitely full-time care will be required for six or eight months during treatment. This provision will rule out such people. Similarly, if people suffer a particular injury when they are old and infirm, generally, this would mean they would require full-time care for a particular period but maybe not for an indefinite period. These people will be excluded. That is wrong. It is also wrong that we are shifting the balance away from medical professionals onto non-medical people with regard to the issue of making decisions about medical eligibility. I refer to the statement in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill that the provision is to clarify that eligibility for these schemes is determined by a deciding officer on the basis of all information provided to support the applicant's claim, including all relevant medical evidence. The deciding officer is making the decision. Why would a deciding officer, a non-medical person, have any say at all on medical matters? If the deciding officer is to have a say on other eligibility criteria, for example, such as means testing, that is fair enough because deciding officers may be qualified to do that. However, that distinction has to be made. There should be absolutely no question of non-medical people second guessing medical diagnosis. Anything that does not clarify this is unacceptable and is allowing an ambiguity which ultimately translates into hardship and unfairness for people who have medical need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State has confirmed what I said. He has read out the same passages that I read to him a moment ago and that is the reason I tabled these amendments. He has confirmed that we are shifting the emphasis to the deciding officer. He has clarified that it is the deciding officer who only has "to take into account". What does that mean? They have to take into account the medical testimony but then they can make a decision to refuse despite the fact that the medical testimony from the GP says somebody needs care. They can take that it into account, have regard to it and then ignore same. That is what is happening. That is precisely the reason I tabled an amendment saying that medical decision-making should be done on the basis of medical opinion supplied by professionally qualified medical personnel, that is the GP or a consultant, and not by a deciding officer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The phased reduction over a period of three years of the back-to-work family dividend will mean a progressive reduction in the overall income of lone parents who work more than 19 hours, and in the third year the payment will disappear altogether. It defies my understanding as to how this is an incentive for people to get back to work if they will lose out and their income will fall.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am working off the tables that SPARK put together, which set out that the transition will mean people who are working will lose out in general. The losses are spelt out whereby someone working 20 hours could lose up to €80.52 per week in the third year, someone working 28 hours could lose up to €66 per week and someone is working 35 hours could lose up to €54 per week. The loss of income percentages are fairly dramatic, at 18%, 14% and 11% for these three categories. This situation worsens progressively because of the phasing down to zero of the back-to-work family dividend. The Minister of State said the situation may improve because a person is in work, and it might, but it might not. This is the point. In many cases it might not. For those people who will be worse off even though they are working this will be a disincentive. There is no reason to presume they will be in a better position in a year or two, as it may be the case or it may not be the case. For many it will be a disincentive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am merely concerned with regard to lone parents. These people are losing out.
