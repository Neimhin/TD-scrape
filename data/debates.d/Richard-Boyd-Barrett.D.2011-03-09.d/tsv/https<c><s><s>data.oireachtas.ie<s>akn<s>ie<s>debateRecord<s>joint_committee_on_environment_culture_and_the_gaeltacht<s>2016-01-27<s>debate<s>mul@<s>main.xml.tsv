I put it to him that it points to the folly and impracticality of separating responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities. Notwithstanding his promises that Irish Water will not be privatised, as it stands, it is reported that 25 private companies, some of them multinational companies, are carrying out various works, maintenance and other operations for Irish Water.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How is it practical to move from having a single port of call - the local authority - for people who may be affected by works being carried out on water infrastructure to having no clear lines of accountability or contact? People will not know if they should contact the local authority, Irish Water or one of its private contractors. They are not removed from proper lines of accountability or contact when it comes to issues that arise when works are being carried out on water infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I think the pudding might not taste good but we will see. We all want clean water so that is a red herring of an argument; it is just that we differ on how to deliver it. In terms of the priority to deliver new council housing and social housing, one obstacle to that is the servicing of land and the provision of the necessary water infrastructure. Will that area be further complicated by all of this, because we now have two entities, if one likes, who will have to co-ordinate. Irish Water’s capital investment budget might limit its capacity to put in water infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not mine. Irish Water’s capital budget and capital plan might be limited and Irish Water might not work in a co-ordinated way with the plans of local authorities to deliver social housing. That adds a further complication in terms of providing the infrastructure we need to deliver the social housing that is an urgent priority.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will we ensure there is co-ordination and that Irish Water liaises with local authorities so that its capital plan is complementary?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have to see how that pudding tastes as well.
