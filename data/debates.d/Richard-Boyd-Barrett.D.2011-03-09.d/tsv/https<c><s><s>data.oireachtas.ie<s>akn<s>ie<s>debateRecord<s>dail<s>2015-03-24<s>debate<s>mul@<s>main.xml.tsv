RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am amazed at the infrequency of meetings of the social policy committee. I would have thought it would be meeting at least on a weekly basis and, frankly, in emergency session when it comes to what, by any standard, is a central matter of special policy, namely, the chronic and daily deteriorating situation in social housing provision. Today representatives from council estates in Dublin, Limerick and Cork complained to the European Commission about the abysmally unhealthy and completely inadequate quality of social housing in council estates in our biggest cities. The Taoiseach has gone out of his way to be the best boy in the European class when it comes to doing what Angela Merkel says, paying back bondholders and doing what the financial markets want him to do, but he is certainly not the best boy in the European class when it comes to the quality of social housing provision in Ireland if the case being pursued by these communities is anything to go by. Should the social policy committee not be meeting to discuss this issue and should the Taoiseach not be ashamed of his Government for its abysmal failure to address the social housing crisis? There has been a considerable spin put on this issue. Last October the biggest social housing programme in the history of the State was announced. I have since been contacted by my local authority on an almost weekly basis to ask whether there is any additional money for social housing, but there is not one cent. Only 19 council houses will be built in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown next year, even though 1,200 people joined the council's housing list last year, bringing the total to 5,200. In the period since I entered this Dáil, the average waiting time on a council housing list has increased from eight to 15 years. In other words, some people will never get a council house. I am dealing with families who are facing unbelievable situations. One man who was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer has been couch surfing for several weeks. He is an emergency case, but he has no idea when he will be housed. Another woman with two children, one of whom has special needs, has been homeless for the past year. She is moving from couch surfing to emergency accommodation which is not guaranteed from one week to the next. She does not even know where she will sleep tomorrow. She is No. 1 on the priority list, but the council cannot even state when she will be given a council house. Someone who is No. 100 or 150 on the list is looking at a wait of seven or eight years before being housed. Despite all of the announcements made last October, not one extra cent has been provided for the budget for social housing provision. That is just in one county. God knows what the situation is like in the rest of the country. What is the social policy committee discussing, if not the provision of social housing during the greatest social housing crisis in the modern history of the State? Working class communities are going to the European Court of Justice because of the Government's failure to take this issue seriously. What is the committee doing? Is it going to discuss the social housing crisis and are we going to have real policy change when it comes to dealing with the social housing emergency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question was also focused on a particular issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's response to my question does not give me confidence about the urgency with which the sub-committee is dealing with what is probably the most important issue of social policy facing the country, the provision of social housing. We have an unprecedented crisis in social housing and have now exposed a widespread crisis in the quality of existing social housing which is substandard to the point where it is not safe for the huge numbers of families living in it. Will the sub-committee treat this as an emergency issue? Will it show some urgency and acknowledge that social policy is failing disastrously?The facts speak for themselves. It is getting worse by the minute and there is no sign whatsoever, notwithstanding grandiose announcements that were made nearly six months ago, and nothing is changing on the ground. I want the Taoiseach to say what he is doing about it and what is this committee doing to push up the priority of what is probably the major social crisis facing this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no sign of them. It is a mirage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They tell us they have no money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's demeanour and behaviour in respect of Greece at the most recent Council meeting were nothing short of despicable. Regardless of where this all ends, the Greek Government has at least challenged the narrative of austerity that has done such damage, crushed the ordinary people of Greece and given rise to a desperate humanitarian crisis and asked that the possibility of introducing alternative policies that will not require future suffering on the part of ordinary people be considered. Instead of stating that the Greeks are absolutely right - particularly in light of our own humanitarian difficulties, namely, the unprecedented housing crisis, the unbelievable increase in child poverty levels and a similar increase in the number of suicides related to the economic crash - showing solidarity with them and appealing for relief, latitude and an end to policies which cause human suffering, the Government chose to stab them in the back. We have aligned ourselves with austerity bullies such as Angela Merkel and Mario Draghi, and the remainder of the financial, corporate and political elite throughout Europe, who are willing to sacrifice the livelihoods and well-being of ordinary people in Greece and, for that matter, in Ireland. That is absolutely shameful and treacherous and not just in the context of the Greek people but also regarding our own citizens. Deputy Clare Daly referred to the demonstration which took place at the weekend. The Minister of State really should have been in attendance because he would have seen people holding aloft the Irish flag in one hand and the Greek flag in the other. It was fantastic and demonstrated both instinctive internationalism and the sense of international solidarity between people in this country and their counterparts on the other side of Europe. The Taoiseach, Chancellor Merkel and all the rest of them are playing with fire in terms of what they are doing. If the people who are opposed to austerity and who stand on the tradition of solidarity between different nationalities against austerity do not prevail, then that will create the space for the far right to grow. I was interviewed by a German journalist who is based in Saxony in recent days and I must admit that what he told me was terrifying. Immigrants are now afraid to walk the streets of the major cities in Saxony, such is the level of growth among Pegida and other organisations on the fascist far fight.It is scary for immigrants to walk on the streets. The fascists are able to mobilise up to 60,000 people on the streets in Germany. We have not seen figures like that since the 1930s. The growth of the far-right in Greece and other parts of Europe is a direct result of austerity. In the absence of an alternative being offered by the political establishment, the anger and despair at austerity is beginning to express itself in the most disgusting and frightening ways. The Minister of State is playing with fire. He should stand with the people who are fighting austerity rather than stab them in the back.
