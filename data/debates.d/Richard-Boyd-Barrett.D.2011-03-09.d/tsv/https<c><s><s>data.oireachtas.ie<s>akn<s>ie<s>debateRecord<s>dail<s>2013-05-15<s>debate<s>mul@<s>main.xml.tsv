RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the discussions will deliver a positive outcome for the workers at Bus Éireann, whom I commend on their determination and willingness to take industrial action to protect their pay and conditions. We are familiar with the line that core pay is not being touched. Allowances, overtime and other forms of remuneration for workers are under attack in the cost-cutting plan. The workers, who are not especially well paid, are right to fight and resist this attack on their pay and conditions because they are not responsible for the problems in Bus Éireann. Responsibility for the company's losses lies with management and the Government which substantially reduced the subvention to Bus Éireann. Ireland provides among the lowest levels of subvention in Europe to its public transport service. Bus Éireann should not be operated purely on the basis of profitability given that it provides a public transport service on routes and to areas where it is not possible to make a profit. I ask the Minister of State to ensure workers at the company do not become the fall guys for the lack of proper subsidy and subvention to our public transport service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The workers are just as concerned as the Minister of State and everyone else about their jobs and the viability of the company. However, they are not in a position to take a hit of in the region of €3,000 each per year. The figure of €51,000 to which the Minister of State referred relates to all employee costs and contemplates the salaries of executives who are on much higher levels of pay. It is those executives who, along with the Government, are supposed to bear responsibility for any problems which arise within the company. Will the Minister of State acknowledge that there is a difficulty with regard to the low level of subvention relating to the company? As a proportion of its total revenue, Bus Éireann receives a subvention of 12%. In comparison, the bus company in Switzerland receives a subvention of 51%, that in the Netherlands receives 49% and that in Belgium receives 78%. I put it to the Minister of State that the pathetically low level of subvention being provided in respect of a company which provides a public service and which is not just a profit-oriented entity is obviously forcing attacks on the pay and conditions of ordinary workers. In addition, it is driving the public bus services in their entirety towards privatisation, which I suspect is the real agenda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are the subventions available elsewhere in Europe much larger than those given to Bus Éireann?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is still a fraction of what is available throughout the rest of Europe.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Acting Chairman; I appreciate it, and I am ready to speak when Deputy Healy-Rae concludes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the debate roll over if I am not finished?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a big problem with the rationale behind this Bill. The legislation is part of a suite of measures that arises from our commitments under the troika programme and under the fiscal treaty, both of which I oppose. On the face of it, the Government's arguments might seem reasonable - that we require budget discipline, need to balance the books and have medium-term planning. In addition, the Government says we need monitoring of budgets to ensure that things do not become unbalanced and go out of control. Those all seem like reasonable aspirations but context is everything when it comes to the economy. This suite of measures, which arises from the fiscal treaty and the troika programme, is not taking place in normal economic conditions. It is taking place in the context of the most severe economic crisis Europe has faced since the 1930s. It is unprecedented in modern Irish history. The Bill before us is one part of that suite of measures which comprises a new architecture of monitoring, surveillance and co-ordination. All those measures are unfolding against a background where our economy - as with other economies across Europe - has been loaded with enormous debts that are not ours. If we continue to have to pay off these debts and meet strict targets for doing so, it will consign this economy to a long-term economic depression. It will ensure that the severe suffering that ordinary workers, or vulnerable unemployed people, are enduring will continue. These measures will make it much more difficult, if not completely preclude governments from taking the sort of measures necessary to get us back on the path to growth, economic recovery and a resolution of the most pressing crisis this country and Europe are facing, which is unemployment.  The rationale behind these measures is based on a false premise, which I heard articulated by some of the earlier speakers. They said the reason we are in the current mess is because public spending got out of control. Anybody who fairly and objectively examines the circumstances that led up to the economic crash, however, will conclude that we are not in the current mess because public expenditure got out of control. Quite the opposite - it was because the markets got out of control. In addition, there was a systematic drive over a period dating back to the late, unlamented Margaret Thatcher's ascension to power in Britain, wherein a consensus developed that we had to row back the State and public enterprise in favour of letting loose market forces. The consequences of that were devastating. Most obviously in this country it was the insanity of the property bubble, together with completely unregulated financial and housing sectors. Something as basic as housing was left in the hands of greedy, profit-driven developers whose main interest had nothing to do with a rational housing policy or providing people with affordable accommodation. Some people claimed it was just about trying to cash in on a market and things got out of control, and it had nothing to do with public spending. However, if we had more public spending on social housing during that period we would not have had the bubble, or at least not to the extent that it occurred, and neither would we have had the devastating crash that followed. We needed to have more public spending on the provision of housing, which is a key area. I would argue that we are likely to see more property bubbles and crashes without further public spending on social housing. It still seems that despite everything that happened, the Government's policy is to let the market and the banks sort out the housing crisis. Those are the same people who created the bubble in the first place. This is obviously long-standing Fine Gael ideology but I find it extraordinary that the Labour Party has bought into this. The Minister has managed to twist the argument from being about how to deal with the current economic crisis to one about policing and monitoring public expenditure. I do not believe for one moment that was the cause of the crisis or that it is the solution.  That argument involves forgetting about the people in the European Commission and others who will be monitoring and co-ordinating our economy. Do these people seriously deserve our respect and trust when it comes to managing budgets and having a strategy to serve the best interests of the economy and, more importantly, the citizens? I do not think they have earned that trust; quite the contrary. The European Central Bank, the European Commission and the rest are up to their necks in responsibility and culpability for what happened. They allowed the dogs - that is, the financiers and corporate interests - off the leash to indulge in riotous market forces that caused the crisis in the first place. I find the idea of embracing a plan for budgetary discipline, which is monitored by these kinds of people, to be deeply worrying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The most recent phase of conflict in the North began when civil rights protesters campaigning on matters such as equality in housing were beaten off the street by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC back in the late 1960s. That produced 30 years of conflict. We all welcome the fact that an Agreement arose out of the fact that people in the North got sick of communal violence, demanded some sort of end to that violence and rejected paramilitary violence as a way to deal with the problem, and rightly so. However, it is worth reminding ourselves that the start of it all was repressive forces of the state attacking peaceful protesters who were not protesting on communal or even on nationalist lines. They were just campaigning for housing equality. So it is a great irony when one sees the so-called peace dividend in the North manifesting itself in the most horrendous, deliberately intimidatory security operation around the forthcoming visit of the G8 to Fermanagh where, incredibly, drone planes that are used to kill innocent people in Afghanistan will be deployed in the North to monitor protestors who will protest against the militarist agenda of G8 and its failure to deal with issues such as global poverty. There is a concerted campaign to bully and intimidate those peaceful protesters including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Friends of the Earth, War on Want, Trócaire and a host of other civil and political organisations which are campaigning against global poverty and militarism. Incredibly 2,500 police are being drafted in from Britain for the operation. In an unprecedented move, courts will be opened on Sundays. This is against a background where the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP will not even allow children's playgrounds to open on Sundays because we must keep holy the Sabbath day, apparently. However it is all right to have special openings of courts to deal with protesters, as they are suggesting they are going to do, and prepare cells to arrest hundreds of protesters in a deliberate attempt to discourage, bully and intimidate people who want to do nothing more than engage in peaceful protest around the visit of the G8. That is a disgrace and is the sort of thing that led to the conflict in the North in the first place, and we should be protesting about it down here.
