RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I add my voice to the condolences to Austin Currie's family on his recent passing. It is a sobering thought that the momentous events that propelled him into activism and the civil rights movement that followed in the North started with housing. It is on that question I wish to question the Taoiseach. Today's daft.ie figures are a further indication that the dire situation in unaffordable rents is becoming a catastrophe. It is contributing directly to homelessness and to incredible hardship for people. Will the Taoiseach seriously reconsider the Government's strategy on limiting further increases to 2% or claiming that additional supply will address the problem? During the period of the Celtic tiger, 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year were coming on stream and rents and house prices went up. The idea that unaffordable supply will solve the problem is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I propose is that we set up a rent authority to set rents and to reduce them to affordable levels based on people's income.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You did not even give me a minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not be jumping over myself to have a personal or political relationship with Boris Johnson to be honest and I am certainly no fan of his but did the Taoiseach discuss with him the differing strategies on dealing with the Covid pandemic? The one thing that I will give him a little credit for, and on which I think that the Taoiseach should take a leaf from his book, is that in the UK, you can get free antigen tests - as many as you want or need - as part of the effort to screen for the presence of Covid-19 whereas here in Ireland it costs â‚¬100 to get 20 tests. I heard a public health doctor suggest that the reason the Government may be slow in making antigen tests available and using them as a weapon to deal with the pandemic was because of cost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, then let us make them free as they are doing in the UK. I am not saying that Boris Johnson has been top of the class in dealing with the pandemic but this is a measure which many scientists and public health people are saying could be part of dealing with Covid. The UK policy of giving them out free to people when they need them, and as many as they need, is a good policy that we should follow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach can throw his response into his answer on this next question. We need antigen tests on public transport.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the past ten days or so, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the attempt by Coillte, the State forestry company, to sell off Killegar forest in Enniskerry. Despite-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have done well. I am glad to say I got a call from Coillte yesterday informing me it had decided to abandon the sale. Coillte tried to suggest that the sale was not finalised. I will inform the House that there were for sale signs all around the forest when I went there. Killegar forest was being advertised on an estate agent's website so Coillte had planned to sell it. Intervention and public outcry stopped it. When Coillte phoned me, I was told it was considering selling because access problems were impeding the Killegar's commercial viability. That points to one of the big problems with forestry in this country, which is that Coillte's mandate is all wrong. It is linked to commercial viability rather than the expansion and protection of the forest estate, issues such as biodiversity and supporting farmers in developing afforestation as a viable livelihood rather than a problem for them. The Government should consider revisiting the Act governing Coillte and changing Coillte's mandate in that context.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should look at Coillte's mandate in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Against what?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am against carbon tax-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----on people. Put it on the corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the data centres.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the data centres.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought the Taoiseach said I must have done a good leaving certificate.
