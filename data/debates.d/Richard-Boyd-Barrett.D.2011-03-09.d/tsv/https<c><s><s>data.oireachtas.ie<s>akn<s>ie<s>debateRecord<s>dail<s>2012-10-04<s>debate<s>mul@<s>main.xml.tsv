RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When some of us on this side of the House rail against the austerity the Minister is imposing on working people and the vulnerable, he always asks us for an alternative, implying there is none. I almost felt sorry for him earlier when he said we are never helpful. Let me be helpful by offering him some alternatives. The case of just one company based in Shannon, one of the most profitable companies operating in the State, points to the alternative. GE Capital Aviation Funding, based in Shannon, earned €606 million in profit last year and paid but €379,000 in tax. This represents an effective tax rate of 0.5%. If the company had paid at a rate of 12.5%, it would have paid €95 million in tax. This would cover almost all the savage cuts that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, imposed over recent weeks on home help and mental health services, and which he attempted to impose on the disabled. I refer to just one company that is paying tax at such a negligible level, and which is not even paying at the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%. How much more revenue will be available if we force the corporations in the State to pay at a rate of 12.5%, which they are not paying at present? Last week, I asked the Minister a parliamentary question on the effective tax rate being paid by companies in the State but I did not receive a proper answer. I was told the amount was difficult to calculate. Dr. Jim Stewart of the school of business studies in Trinity College estimates that companies in Ireland are paying corporation tax on profits at a rate of between 4% and 7%. Therefore, will the Minister ensure that all companies pay at the effective rate of 12.5%? If they did so, it would generate, by any estimate, several billion euro in extra revenue for the State, thereby eliminating the need to impose brutal, austere cuts on low and middle-income earners, families on social welfare and the vulnerable.

I cited an example of one of the country's most profitable companies paying a corporation tax rate of 0.5%. It was well publicised. Is it not of concern that the tax forgone to the State is approximately €90 million at a time when Ministers are considering imposing further brutal attacks on people in the coming budget? Another set of figures show that total profits in Ireland amounted to €51 billion in 2008, but that the effective tax rate across all corporations was 10%. If the Government increased that rate to 12.5%, an extra €1.25 billion would accrue to the State. Is this not a problem that the Minister should examine? Does it not concern him that multinational corporations are getting away with murder and not even paying the derisory 12.5% corporate tax rate at a time when cruel austerity is being imposed on people who cannot afford it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about raising the effective tax rate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggested it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly disagree with the Minister. Ireland has become Europe's version of the Cayman Islands. It is part of an international architecture for tax avoidance in multinationals. This system of tax avoidance, of which we form a critical part in Europe, is destabilising the global economy. As multinationals are increasingly not paying tax across the world - an act we facilitate - there is a destabilising effect on the world economy, meaning there is no money available to invest in social goods in the real economy or sustainable industry and enterprise. We cannot just throw up our hands and indicate, as we seem to do with everything, that we are powerless to act on this. We should act because there will be a correction with this issue, as there was with other bubbles, and we should get in ahead of the game. To make low corporate tax rates the cornerstone of industrial policy, as this and previous Governments have done, is to make ourselves a hostage to fortune. Unless we prepare for what will happen, we will live to rue the day. Will the Minister consider the question of at least raising the effective tax rate to 12.5% in an effort to deal with our budgetary crisis?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not seeing much of an effect.
