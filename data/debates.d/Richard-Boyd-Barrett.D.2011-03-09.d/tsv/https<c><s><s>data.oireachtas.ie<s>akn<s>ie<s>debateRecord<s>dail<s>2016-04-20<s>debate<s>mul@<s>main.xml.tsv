RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also think it is unacceptable that, as the whole country is aware, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are currently debating the issue of water charges as part of the discussions on the formation of the Government because they fully understand that this is one of the key issues that produced the election result we just had. It is also one of the defining issues informing the discussions on the formation of the Government, but this House is not being allowed to discuss it. As Deputy Adams mentioned, we have also signed the motion calling for a debate on water charges. The Government should allow this House to debate that issue particularly as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are now debating it. There are already some signs of the U-turn being the first issue on the agenda when it comes to water charges. This House should have the opportunity to put forward its views. While many issues are up for discussion on the formation of the Government, one thing seems to be absolutely not up for discussion. This House was mandated to get rid of water charges because more than 90 Deputies sitting here today are present because their manifestoes opposed water charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, but we have a clear mandate and at the very least we should be allowed to discuss it. Of course, it was very deliberate that the Government prevented us from discussing it. Even though it was requested at the Whips meeting, the Government does not want to discuss this issue. However, this is the place where that discussion should happen. That is what democracy means. Democracy requires that a debate on the matter take place this week while the two main parties are cooking up a plan behind the scenes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe the Ceann Comhairle can clarify matters. The Taoiseach has just said that in the case of amending legislation, it is quite possible for it to be done in the Dáil. By the very same token, it would be equally possible to amend the legislation around water services and abolish water charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. I am going to make a last stab at this argument. Originally, on tomorrow’s schedule, there were to be statements on agriculture. For reasons to do with a Government decision, this item was taken off. Accordingly, there clearly is space tomorrow to have a discussion on water. It was requested at the Whips’ meeting but the Government was not up for including it.While the Brexit discussion is an important one for the country and should be held tomorrow, originally, two items were to be on the schedule so there is no reason we could not have the debate on water charges tomorrow afternoon. I urge the Government-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying that, originally, statements on agriculture were agreed. It was on the schedule for tomorrow. It was then taken off it, I presume as a result of a Government decision, so there is time available tomorrow. We do not need to discuss Brexit all day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will focus in particular on health and car insurance. One also could throw in flood insurance and other insurance issues. Insurance is one of the biggest rip-off scandals affecting ordinary citizens nationwide. It speaks to a fairly dramatic policy failure on the part of the current and previous Governments. As for what I mean by that, the problem is one of constantly rising premiums that cost people an absolute fortune and I refer to trying to understand how to deal with this problem, which is crippling many people who are paying out for private health insurance, the premiums for which have rocketed in recent years, or car insurance, the cost of which increased dramatically again last year by an average of 30%. When one cuts through all the chatter about it, what is at its base is profiteering by private companies. It is as simple as that. The Minister, in his speech to which I listened and through which I have read, pretty much admitted this.  To get to the bottom of this issue, instead of simply spouting hot air, an explicit acknowledgement is needed of what is at its base and how the reality of what is happening in insurance has debunked the ideological inclinations and prejudices of Fine Gael in particular but one possibly could throw in Fianna Fáil as well. The Minister said "healthy competition within the insurance industry should facilitate" reasonable insurance costs. He said it should, as that is the market belief. If one has competition between private insurance providers, such competition should, according to market theory, reduce premiums. Strangely, however, it does not. The opposite happens, premiums go up and it costs people a fortune. Why does the reality defy the theory consistently? A page or so further on in his contribution, the Minister gave the game away. He stated:Until recently firms enjoyed a prolonged period of reasonable investment returns on the asset side of their balance sheets. This income stream provided firms with the scope to compete aggressively on price. However, recent reversals in investment markets worldwide have generated investment losses.Consequently, in layman's language, when the insurance companies are not making a profit, premiums go up regardless of how much competition there is in a market. The idea that there would be competition and that this would put downward pressure on premiums simply does not translate. This was further confirmed at the beginning of 2016 by Standard & Poor's, one of our favourite international players. These are the guys who tell us what is happening on the bond markets and who rate states and their bonds on their creditworthiness, and in January 2016 the agency stated that Irish insurance companies would need to hike the costs of car insurance if they were to return to profitability any time soon. This was a senior analyst for Standard & Poor's explaining why, to get to profitability, they would be obliged to hike up car insurance costs and boy, did they do that to ridiculous and obscene levels, such as increases of 30% and young people being asked for up to €9,000 to be insured in some cases. This is absolutely unbelievable and is simply all about them making money. If they are not making money, they must jack up premiums and crucify people. Is it not obvious that Members must cut these gombeen men out? That is what they are: they are fancy, global, nicely branded gombeen men. The middlemen profiteering in the area of health, car insurance, flooding or whatever it is are the problem. Their hunger for profit and the fact they operate purely on that basis dictates everything and currently is dictating extortion in the area of insurance. They must be taken out of the equation and profit must be taken out of the equation, most obviously in health. Five years too late, the Government acknowledged this with the abandonment of the universal health insurance policy. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, hardly a radical think tank of the left, confirmed what some Members on this side of the House had been saying for five years, namely, that involving private health insurance companies and claiming one could deliver universal health using private insurance companies would not work because one was not factoring in their drive for profit. One could add to that all the other unnecessary costs that go with private for-profit companies in this area. I would love to know how much they waste on advertising. I do not have the figures to hand but it would be nice to find out because one hears and sees their advertisements every day on television, on billboards and on the radio advertising private health or car insurance. How much money is wasted on that totally needless expenditure? All this stuff like branding, public relations consultants, administration and billing is absolute waste and profiteering. That is why the ESRI finally concluded with regard to universal health insurance, and the Government finally was obliged to admit five years too late, that the universal health model was going to cost €600 million to €2 billion more than currently is being spent on health and the Government was obliged to abandon it.However, the Minister of State should take the next step and recognise that the involvement of the private health insurance industry in health care at all is a disaster. It is not just that we need to abandon universal health insurance; we need to get the private health insurance industry out of health, full stop. All it is doing is leaching money out at the expense of people who are forced into private health insurance because of fear of what is happening in the public system.  This relates to the debate we had earlier. I have here a very interesting paper, called "Creating Two Levels of Healthcare," which I invite the Minister of State to read. It was produced by Claire Finn and Niamh Hardiman at the Geary Institute in UCD. There are a couple of interesting passages in it. They explain the relationship, if one likes, between the private system - private health in general and private health insurance - and the mess in the public system. They state:... the quality of the public sector is kept at a level that induces those who are better off to leave the public sector and seek private treatment ... Waiting time induces patients with high waiting costs to choose private treatment...In other words, no one would take out private health insurance if there were no waiting lists. The private health insurance industry would not exist and people would not have to pay out €2,000 or €3,000 a year - and those costs are rising all the time - were it not for the waiting lists. Why would one possibly do it? It is only because there are waiting lists and accident and emergency units are a mess, meaning people are frightened to go into them. That is the only reason one would possibly take out private health insurance. The viability of private health insurance depends on the existence of a crisis in the public health system. The private insurance companies need it. Without it, no one would go to them. Therefore, they leach money out of the system. Billions of euro are spent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will finish now. When the Minister and the Government spoke before Christmas about how we spend more than everyone else in Europe on health, what was not unravelled was how much of it is in private health insurance and charges. In fact, it is about 25% or 30% of overall expenditure. This is second only, probably, to the United States, where approximately 40% of health expenditure is on billing, profit taking, advertising and administration and is not going to the front line. What do we need? We need to get rid of private health insurance in the public health system and we need a State insurance firm that is driven not by profit but by the aim of having reasonable insurance costs and that is not profiteering at the expense of ordinary citizens.
