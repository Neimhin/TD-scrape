RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are approximately 8,000 PhD researchers in the country. They do a vast amount of the teaching in our institutions of higher education. The great majority of them get stipends that mean they are in actuality earning less than the minimum wage. This is true even for those with the best stipends. That compares with the Nordic countries, where they get up to €50,000 as a starting point. Will the Minister agree, as part of the review, to meet the PhDs Collective Action Union and the Postgraduate Workers Alliance to ensure this situation is remedied urgently?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that. I think they would appreciate meeting the Minister. While the opportunity for them to make submissions is important, the end game is the critical thing here. The vast majority of people doing PhD research in this country are living in poverty. That seriously impacts on their ability to do their research or even continue as PhD researchers. We give more than €700 million in tax breaks, mostly to private companies, for research and development and yet in our universities and higher education institutions, our researchers are living in poverty, in most cases earning less than the minimum wage. There is huge discrimination against non-EU PhD students, with many of them doing unpaid teaching and not being treated as workers when they clearly are. Without them, many of our higher education institutions simply would not function and yet they are either not paid or are paid below the minimum wage. They need to be treated as workers, as they are elsewhere. There is no question about it. They need to be treated as employees with collective bargaining rights, sick pay and all the other things because that is what they are doing. They are working in our universities and teaching our undergraduates. We should recognise how important they are, given the skills shortages we have and the need for us to be at the cutting edge of research and development, rather than forcing most of them to live in poverty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is welcome that we want to be best in class but let us be clear what the starting point is: we are worst in class.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The average PhD pay in Europe is €32,000. In the Nordic countries, it starts at €50,000 and progresses to €55,000 on a fixed-term, four-year contract. In the Netherlands, researchers get about 10% more. Indeed, a lot of our people who are doing postgraduate and research work are going to the Netherlands because everything, from housing to fees to the cost of living, is so much better in places like the Netherlands. That is bad news, not just for our PhD researchers but for the entire country. It is urgent that we listen to them and that we get up to a level where they are paid for the work they do and are paid sufficiently well that they are not living in poverty or having to do other jobs impacting on their research. They should be properly remunerated for the work they do so they are not living in poverty. We have a hell of a long way to go. They are also affected by the all the other issues we are facing, like housing and the cost of living. Many of them have families and the majority of our PhD researchers are living below the minimum wage. It is an outrageous situation, quite frankly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a stark and unacceptable fact that even if a student is in receipt of the maximum SUSI grant of €6,115, he or she will not be able to afford student accommodation at UCD, where even the cheapest and supposedly most affordable rates range from €6,900 a year up to €10,745. What will the Minister do to ensure there is affordable accommodation at publicly funded colleges and universities, and more generally, for the student population?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Government funding for student accommodation is welcome but the devil is in the detail. Will it be genuinely affordable? How much of this new accommodation will there be? It is only the accommodation built with the money the State will put in that will be supposedly affordable. The rest will be unaffordable. Is the Minister aware, for example, that, every year, UCD imposes the maximum legally allowed increase of 2%? Every year, it increases the rent on students despite the fact there is an affordability crisis. Does he know the new accommodation built at UCD will be €1,300? It is outrageous. That is the same as market rates. We cannot have a situation where national universities and publicly funded universities are charging these extortionate rates. According to the Minister, there will be a little bit of affordable, but we are not even clear on the detail. Will it genuinely be affordable? Even if the maximum rent is €6,000, as the Minister stated, that would eat up almost all of a student's grant. There is not a single piece of accommodation at UCD currently, for example, that would be fully covered by the maximum SUSI grant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that point, we must do the catch-up and provide purpose-built, affordable, student accommodation on university lands. By the way, the idea of state aid rules kicking in is slightly worrying when it comes to public universities. These are public universities and public goods, but I will leave that aside. The vast majority of students are still prey to what is going on in the wider private rental market. Many of them are licensees living in digs and so on. One of the things UCD students' union again said this morning is we need some minimum protections for people in licensee arrangements who are facing short notice evictions and all sorts of things, and who have no rights and protections whatsoever. The students' union representatives also asked to meet not just the Minister but the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, given that many students are affected by that wider rental accommodation and housing crisis, to address the issues students are facing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome President von der Leyen to the Dáil and to Ireland. I appreciate her comments about Europe's commitment to ensuring that there will be no hard Border on the island of Ireland or that the exit of Britain from the EU should not in any way adversely impact on the peace on this island. To be honest, nobody out there in the world would thank me if we used this opportunity just to slap each other on the back. With that in mind, I am going to raise some issues in respect of which I think there is concern about and necessary criticism of the EU. To take up the final point made by Deputy Shortall, we are suffering an absolutely devastating housing and homelessness crisis in this country. What is going on is shameful. I refer to the number of people in emergency accommodation and suffering hardship as a result of this housing crisis. While much of the responsibility lies with successive Governments failing to address it, a large component of the responsibility also lies with the decisions taken by the European Commission and the ECB, as part of the troika, to ram billions worth of austerity down the throats of the people of this country, which has left us with this legacy of an utterly devastating housing crisis. It is long past time that the EU acknowledged its mistakes in imposing that austerity and devastating consequences it has had. I also note that this week the President has called - I support her in this - for a tribunal to be established to investigate the undoubted war crimes of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. We all condemn the utterly barbaric and murderous invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We support the people of Ukraine in their struggle for self-determination. I must say, however, in the week when there is the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, for the President to not call simultaneously for an investigation into the ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed by the apartheid state of Israel against Palestinian people makes me wonder about the consistency of the ethics of the EU's foreign policy. It is utterly unconscionable that we can say, on the one hand, that we must investigate the war crimes and atrocities of Vladimir Putin but remain silent, as the President did when she spoke in June in Israel beside the then Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, and not say a word after we have had two devastating reports from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on 70 years of ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, apartheid and the siege of Gaza, which was a 15-year long criminal action. Do we talk about investigating the war crimes of Israel? No. Do we sanction Israel for these crimes, as we have sanctioned Russia? No. Instead, we continue to give Israel favoured nation trade status, import great amounts of gas from it, deepen relations with it and engage in considerable military and defence trade with it. This is all with the state that is doing what I described to the Palestinians. I also find it remarkable when we say that we must break our dependence on Russian fossil fuels, including oil, when, at the same time, we are increasing our imports of Saudi oil. Ironically, Saudi Arabia has this year doubled its imports of Russian oil and is effectively laundering it. We are now importing more oil from the Saudi dictatorship - one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world - which, just like Vladimir Putin, has engaged in a 15-year long war against Yemen that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.Leading European states continue to arm that regime. Indeed, Dr. von der Leyen herself, in 2015, went over and signed a defence arrangement with Saudi Arabia when she was Minister of Defence in Germany. If we are to condemn, as we must, the war crimes of Putin, we must simultaneously condemn all war crimes and all crimes against humanity, even when they are committed by people that the European Union perceives as allies, such as Israel, Saudi Arabia or those that arm and support them. Finally, in that regard, it is similarly unconscionable when the European courts have found against the EU-Moroccan trade agreement, which involves essentially taking the fish and mineral resources of the occupied Western Sahara people, that the EU Commission has lodged a legal appeal against its own courts in order to continue a trade deal that is robbing the people of Western Sahara of their resources while they are subject to an illegal occupation of their land and territory. President, we must have consistency in our foreign policy, in our ethics and in our morality if we are to be taken seriously as defenders of human rights and opponents of war.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The only reason we need this legislation is because of the shameful fact that we have a two-tier health system. Consequently, huge numbers of people, nearly half the people in this country, are so frightened of what will happen to them when they get sick, given the state of the public health system, that they feel it necessary to pay out large sums of money every year in order to have insurance so they might access private healthcare in the event that they are sick. They do it out of fear. It is obviously not their fault that they are afraid. It is the fault of the Government that it presides over a public health service that is failing people so disastrously. That is not in any way a criticism of the heroic healthcare staff and professionals we have in the public health service, who work under the most extraordinarily difficult circumstances. The nurses, midwives, doctors, porters, orderlies, cleaners and allied health professionals do their very best for people but they are crushed by the lack of adequate and, for the most part, safe staffing in our hospitals and health services. They are dealing with massive backlogs and record numbers of people. In the month of November in particular, we saw the highest number of people on trolleys on record. When people are faced with that sort of disastrous situation in our public health service, it is no wonder they are terrified into having to take out private health insurance. It is a source of shame that that is the situation, that people are encouraged to buy into the idea that if you have money, you can get a better standard and quality of healthcare than if you do not. As Deputy Murnane O'Connor has pointed out, as the cost-of-living crisis impacts on huge numbers of working people, they are having to make very difficult choices. With the cost of heating their home, the cost of feeding their family and the cost of just about everything going up, the pressure will come on and they may decide they cannot really afford the private health insurance premiums and will let them drop, with all the associated fear that goes with that. I was asked by somebody who recently suffered a tragedy to read something into the record. I will only do it because they have asked. It is pretty harrowing. You kind of understand the sense of despair and anger people feel when they go through situations like this. I will not have a chance to read it all but it is from Karen - I will not give her second name - who wrote the following: This letter is mainly about the health service and what all the ministers of health and all past and present governments did, or [are] doing to help, which is basically nothing to change the system.On the 6th of November 2022 my brother passed away, it took 55 minutes for an ambulance to arrive to my family home 55 minutes due to your cuts. My family lives 10 minutes away from St Vincent University hospital and it still took 55 minutes.We couldn't get him down the stairs to get him out to a car, we needed help, we needed our health care providers, he needed them to save his life, that night was a complete nightmare for us. Being helpless, being told after ringing a few times it was on the way, watching out windows and doors waiting on help.I live further away from my family home, his home, and I arrived before the ambulance did, he was still alive, when I arrived, he was in so much pain. He wasn't a drinker or on drugs, we will have to wait to find out how and why he passed.I will not get into the political stuff but she goes on to absolutely castigate the parties of Government. She is very explicit in the letter that she is not blaming the ambulance workers, who she says were wonderful when they arrived, but places the blame for all of this squarely on the shoulders of the Government. Why did that ambulance take 55 minutes to make a ten-minute journey from St. Vincent's Hospital? We probably know the answer, because the ambulance drivers have told us. They are sitting outside the emergency departments because those emergency departments are overrun. They cannot discharge people from ambulances, and so they sit in a queue in St. Vincent's Hospital and other hospitals and are therefore not able to go out as quickly as they should on calls, even ones ten minutes away from the hospital. Why is that happening? Another letter I got this week kind of explains it. It is to do with staffing and our inability to staff the public health service. This letter is from student nurses and midwives. It reads: Dear Deputy,Student nurses and midwives are working and training in unprecedented conditions in the health service. On top of this the Government has failed to implement an agreed report to address significant costs associated with travel, subsistence, accommodation, and uniform costs associated with our clinical placements.We are affected by the same cost-of-living challenges as our qualified colleagues, with many of us struggling to meet the costs of transportation, fuel, heating, accommodation, and other necessities required for students to complete our training, including the additional burden of obtaining accommodation away from home during placements, and the costs of acquiring and laundering uniforms. The McHugh report, originally published in August 2021, and accepted by Government, was aimed at bringing allowances for student nurses and midwives in line with the expenses incurred as part of their training, and recognizing the additional challenges placed on students while they made their extraordinary contribution to the frontline pandemic workforce. However, many recommendations of this report, which were due to be implemented by September 2022, have yet to be implemented, and student nurses and midwives continue to struggle to meet the costs of our training.I do not have time to read it all but the writer goes on to talk about the enhanced reimbursement scheme for student nurses and midwives, travel costs, subsistence costs, the fact that even just going to work each day they are paying about €9 in parking charges and the cost of the uniforms they were promised they would be given. Another simple thing is the cost of laundering those uniforms. She also writes:The COVID-19 pandemic proved that student nurses and midwives are an essential part of the healthcare workforce in Ireland, and that recognising our high level of skills and training was an important part of keeping those skills in the Irish health service. The long delay in implementing these measures undermines that recognition, shows complete disregard to us as student nurses and midwives, and will not encourage the current cohort of students to build their careers in the Irish health service where they are so badly needed. Furthermore, this delay has no regard for the very significant cost of living pressures we are experiencing.She goes on to plead with the Minister to address that. We can put the two things together. If this is how we treat our student nurses, is it any wonder that the vast majority of them say, as they have in survey after survey, that once they qualify they will leave the country? Consequently, we are massively understaffed in hospitals so when ambulances arrive at St. Vincent's or any other hospital, there are not enough staff to deal with the people there and to open the wards and beds. Often the beds are sitting there empty but we do not have the staff to open them. Then if you listen to the radio you will hear the ads for the private hospitals, saying "come to us". There are no queues there, if someone has private health insurance and can afford it. There is a sort of hierarchy, is there not? People can get a better package of health insurance depending how much money they have. That is abhorrent. It is obscene. It is obscene that we have the health capacity, or much of it, we actually need to have a decent and dignified health service but it is only available to those who can pay. In our public health service, we cannot retain and recruit the staff we need to prevent the sort of tragedy that woman and her family had to go through because we do not treat the staff properly. We must have a national health service, with cradle-to-grave healthcare, not a two-tier system or a system where the healthcare people get is dependent on how much private health insurance they can get. The idea of a private health insurance market is frankly abhorrent, with people profiting from this health misery when so many people are suffering.We need to do away with that two-tier system but in order for that to happen, we need to resource the health service and, crucially, treat the people who work in it properly so we can actually recruit and retain those nurses and allied professionals so they want to work in a health service that actually delivers decent healthcare for everybody regardless of the size of their pocket.
