RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is advising the Economic Management Council on the economics of housing? Whoever they are should be sacked. We are facing the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the modern history of the State. No matter how much the Government talks about it and makes announcements, it gets worse on a daily basis. Under the Taoiseach's stewardship, the housing lists have gone from 96,000 to 130,000. That is a disastrous failure by any definition. The number of children and families living in homelessness increased exponentially. Waiting lists have gone from approximately eight or nine years, which was bad, to 18 years. The wait is 18 years in Dún Laoghaire if one joins the housing list now. This is an index of disastrous failure, which is now not just affecting people who would traditionally have had difficulty affording a home, but is reaching up into every sector of society. Nobody who is not very rich can afford to put a roof over his or her head. That is where we are at. Anybody who finds themselves, for whatever reason, without a roof over their head and looking for one, is, by definition, in trouble, unless they are earning €70,000 or €80,000 a year, which most people are not. We now have the phenomenon of the working homeless, people who are going out to work and are sleeping in different hostels on different nights, trying to do a full day's work while not knowing where they will be sleeping that night. That is what is going on. It is beyond belief. I am asking what advice the Economic Management Council is getting on this. The Taoiseach made a very telling statement on budget day: when asked about rent controls, he said that while he was looking at the matter - we keep looking at these matters but doing nothing about them - he would not be doing anything that would interfere with the market. In other words, it was an economic decision that was informing his refusal to introduce rent controls. As he well knows, one of the major contributory factors to the homelessness and housing crisis is spiralling rents that are unaffordable and consequent evictions, or the inability of people to access affordable housing, because we are essentially dependent on the private sector. Is this not the problem? Whatever advice or economic doctrine the Taoiseach is working on is telling him we must not interfere with the market, and that is the fundamental problem; in fact, we absolutely must interfere with the market. He needs some advice from somebody who will tell him that we desperately need to interfere with the market and that we must not allow the market to dictate this issue or imagine that the market is going to solve it, when he has pursued this policy of hoping the market will sort the problem out for the entire duration of this Government and the market has self-evidently not sorted the problem out. Does the Taoiseach accept that? Does he accept that the advice is wrong, the policy has been wrong and the problem is continuously getting worse? If we do not get that admission, we are on a hiding to nothing in terms of a chronic situation. Finally, on the economics of housing, the Taoiseach keeps saying that we need to increase supply. First of all, it has not happened. He keeps referring to the fact that we built 90,000 houses during the boom and now building has dropped to abysmal levels, so what we need to do is get supply up. Would he acknowledge the basic economic point, and does the EMC even discuss this point, that even when we were building 90,000 houses per year, mostly private, during the boom, the housing crisis was still getting worse? The numbers on the housing list were increasing even then. The idea that supply equals demand - this economic notion - is just nonsense. Is the Taoiseach getting any contrarian advice, to use the Nyberg phrase, in the aftermath of the analysis of economic crash? Is he getting any contrarian advice that is challenging the orthodoxy-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that supply equals demand, because it clearly does not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It did not work during the boom.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It did not work during the boom. Rents went up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should sack DKM. It is rubbish.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rubbish. The Taoiseach should sack them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach needs another adviser.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apparently, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will not be present. As the refugee crisis unfolded, someone told me that the tears of sympathy would soon dry up and policy in the EU would revert to type. That is starting to happen. The barriers are being raised again against refugees who are fleeing desperate circumstances. Fortress Europe is being re-established. There are many aspects to this issue, but something that was of concern in the European Council's discussions was the talk of enlarging the mandate of FRONTEX. That mandate and FRONTEX's resources have increased exponentially in recent years. I wonder about FRONTEX and its approach to desperate people fleeing desperate circumstances. Its record is not good. I will cite a few instances. Recently, inflatable dinghies carrying refugees on the River Evros at the Turkish-Greek border were shot at by FRONTEX. Border officials have also stated that German police stationed there were involved in incidents in which refugee boats were shot at. In 2012, a Spanish patrol boat co-ordinated by FRONTEX and travelling at great speed off Lanzarote deliberately overran a refugee boat that had 25 people on board who were waiting to be picked up by the coast guard. Seven refugees were killed. In 2011, 63 refugees died of thirst after being at sea for 15 days in the Mediterranean even though FRONTEX and NATO ships that were involved in the assault on Libya at the time were aware of their presence.In recent days, a refugee boat was shelled by Libyan soldiers or militia. This raises the question as to what precisely FRONTEX is doing when mandated to go into the countries of origin of some of the refugees with the aim of what is described as stemming the flow of refugees. I am deeply concerned, and there is widespread criticism, that there is no transparency in FRONTEX. We cannot get real information about what it is doing but its record is not good. As we further expand its mandate, it is not clear precisely what it is doing. Certainly, signs are that Europe is trying by various means to close the door further on desperate people looking for refuge in Europe. A particularly worrying example of this is the attempt to offload the problem onto Turkey and to co-operate with the Turkish regime. The Turkish regime has an appalling record on treating some of its own minority groups, especially the Kurds. It is widely believed Mr. Erdogan and the deep state in Turkey are behind the recent bombing directed at peaceful protesters in Turkey, yet it seems we are willing to do deals with, co-operate with and give resources to the Turkish regime, which has a very questionable record on human rights within its own borders and on the treatment of its own people. This is because we want to keep the problem out of Europe. This speaks to the fundamental problem. I heard Deputy Martin state earlier — I presume he was directing his comments at some of us on the left — that it was completely wrong to blame Western policy for the rise of ISIS or the conditions that led refugees to flee from north Africa, Syria and Iraq to Europe. Of course, the Deputy could not be more wrong on that. The Turkish example highlights this. In one way or another, Europe consistently co-operates and trades with, talks to and supports ruthless, vicious, despotic, brutal regimes right across the north African and Middle Eastern region. Now we are co-operating with Mr. Erdogan. We have done so with successive regimes in Iraq and are doing so with Israel in terms of its brutal persecution of the Palestinian people. Another important example concerns the el-Sisi regime in Egypt, which is engaged in a vicious campaign of persecution, oppression, mass imprisonment and execution of its political opponents, to the extent that an election took place in the country in which there was no electorate. Nobody is voting. Some 16% of the electorate turned out for the elections in Egypt because no ordinary Egyptian believes they are anything other than a sham and rigged. They believe the el-Sisi regime is a brutal dictatorship, yet we are doing beef business with Mr. el-Sisi, and the Taoiseach recently met him. No voices are being raised in Europe about what Mr. el-Sisi is doing to his own people and the political opposition in his country. Similarly, no voices are being raised demanding sanctions against Israel for what it is doing, including in respect of the escalation in the number being thrown out of their homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. I include the Palestinians who have been killed by Israelis and settlers since the beginning of this month. No serious voices are being raised over these matters. What does this do? Is it any wonder that against the background of Western hypocrisy and co-operation with these brutal regimes, people are driven into the hands of extremist groups such as ISIS? In some cases, we are actually doing business with regimes that finance groups such as ISIS. We must first show compassion and allow people into this Continent who need refuge. We must not try to stop people. Also, we need to change our hypocritical policy on dealing with the brutal regimes in the areas from which the refugees are fleeing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Minister of State. It is to the credit of the political class and to Irish society, more to the point, that the overwhelming response to the refugee crisis is one of compassion and solidarity. I accept that point. However, the thrust of many of the questions and contributions directed at the Minister of State is to ask why Ireland does not raise its voice more loudly and decisively against the double standards, hypocrisy and sordid manipulation by Western powers in the Middle East and north Africa. This behaviour created these crises in the first place and they are continuing. This is not simply an interesting historical point. However, there is a historical point with regard to the US bombing of Iraq. Does the Minister of State not accept that, undoubtedly, the bombing of Iraq destabilised the region and unleashed these forces? Does the Minister of State not accept that the arming, supporting and financing of the Saudi regime has been a contributory factor to the growth and prevalence of some of the worst, most vile and extreme forces in the region which have helped to tear Syria apart? Does the Government accept that? If it does, why are we not speaking out more loudly? Why are we not a voice in Europe calling for the European Union to refuse to do business with Saudi Arabia or sell that country arms? Why do we continue to trade with these regimes? A total of 40 Palestinians have been killed in the past month in an escalation of Israeli and settler violence against the Palestinian population. Why do we not declare that it is time to say enough is enough, stop treating Israel as a normal state and demand sanctions on Israel? Why can we not be that voice in Europe? Why are we afraid to do that? I suspect that those occupying much of the political spectrum in this country agree with this privately, even if they do not say it publicly. They know these things to be true. Why are we doing business with the el-Sisi regime when he is busily crushing all political dissent? Is it because we can make money out of the beef trade?Is that it, with human rights concerns going out the door? He crushes democracy and civil rights go out the door because we are doing business with him. If that is not it, can the Minister of State please explain why we do not raise our voices?  One of our citizens, Ibrahim Halawa, is suffering in Egypt, but many others are also suffering. It is not just the Muslim Brotherhood. People involved in campaigns for secular and civil rights, lawyers and people on the left of the political spectrum in Egypt, are in prison because they organised peaceful protests against the el-Sisi regime and face possible execution. What about the Turkish regime and what it is doing to the Kurds? We now seem to be willing to shut up about all that because we want to unload the refugee crisis onto Turkey rather than having to deal with it ourselves. Why are we not more forthright in pointing out these inconsistencies and hypocrisies, which produced the problem in the first place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Europe is, as is America.
