RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rich are saving.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister thinks we are all saving our money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	"Squeeze" is the word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in tatters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am opposing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In respect of Deputy Martin's comments, the phrase about the pot calling the kettle black comes rushing to mind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amnesia has settled deep into the consciousness of Fianna Fáil because it used to regularly punish dissidents. Deputy Mattie McGrath over there-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The substantive point is correct. The Government promised to be different. It promised a democratic revolution and a new level of accountability but is clearly closing down dissent through this move.If we want to have a genuinely diverse Parliament, the idea that Members should be removed from these positions as soon as they disagree with the Government does not sit well with the promise of a democratic revolution. I oppose the proposal and think the Government should reconsider if it wants to act on a higher moral plain than its predecessors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The cuts the Government is planning to impose on the further education sector are retrograde, stupid and defy any logic. The Government regularly claims that its priorities are to create jobs, re-skill and retrain those who have lost jobs in order to prepare them for a return to employment and to protect the vulnerable against the impact of austerity and cuts. The cuts in the further education sector fail having regard to all of these priorities and do precisely the opposite to what the Government claims it is committed to doing because the further education sector caters for some of the most disadvantaged communities in society, those who have lost their jobs as a result of the economic crisis and who are in difficulty and need to be re-skilled and retrained in order to have some chance of returning to employment. The cuts being made will also lead to the loss of existing jobs, the loss of approximately 500 temporary jobs and up to 200 permanent jobs. The cuts make no sense whatsoever. The range of courses that will be available to people who are seeking to re-skill or retrain or who are not candidates for university will be degraded and reduced, further reducing the opportunities for people who find themselves in this situation. Therefore, I urge the Government to rethink its position urgently. The further education sector provides a significant service for society, particularly the most marginalised, and is a key part of any serious attempt to chart a way out of the unemployment crisis. The Minister should reverse the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where would they go?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The European Commission, in its recent review of our circumstances, suggested that if growth, particularly that in the domestic economy, continues to remain poor and does not rise to the desired level and if the issue of chronic mass long-term unemployment is not dealt with, there is a real danger that our debt will become unsustainable. The rating agencies consider our debt to be junk. Most important, we will have to pay €9.1 billion this year in interest on our enormous and clearly unsustainable debt, at a terrible cost to the citizens of the country. It is the equivalent of the whole education budget being paid in interest on debt. Will Ireland's EU Presidency just be a load of pomp and ceremony signifying nothing? Alternatively, will it be used as a platform and pressure point to obtain fairness and sustainability and relief for ordinary Irish citizens from the absolutely intolerable and unsustainable burden? Can the Minister give us concrete reasons to hope that, by the end of the Presidency, we will obtain the relief we deserve and desperately need if the economy has any chance whatsoever of recovering? Can the Minister give us concrete assurances or outline plans that could lead us to believe this might be the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That response is completely inadequate. We had a report that over a six year period Google had €47 billion in sales but had paid only €69.9 million in corporation tax, an effective rate of less than 1%. In replies to questions I had tabled to the Minister for Finance it was revealed that in 2010 total gross profits in this country made by corporations amounted to €70 billion, on which they paid only €4 billion in tax, an effective rate of a little above 6%. When ordinary workers and those least well-off are having their incomes looted through the universal social charge, property taxes and other cuts, how can the Minister stand over a situation where remarkably profitable corporations are getting away with paying almost nothing in tax? Is he going to do anything about this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ceann Comhairle, I have another question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is twice I did not get a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody else gets a second question.
