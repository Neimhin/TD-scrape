RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As long as we have been dealing with this issue, which has been for some time, I have let the Minister of State and the Government know that People Before Profit's view is that the only way fair insurance premiums will be achieved and the profiteering of the insurance industry stopped is to have a not-for-profit insurance company. The sooner we go down that road, the better. Then we will get to a situation where we have fair insurance for our young people, for example, who are completely extorted, our taxi drivers will not be facing a situation where their livelihood will be lost if they have one claim against their insurance, and we will get past the situation where huge numbers of small businesses, festivals and so on in this country literally have their livelihoods and their ability to continue to function viably threatened because of insurance extortion by insurance companies. I commend the work that has been done on a cross-party basis, including by the Government, the Minister of State and others, in dealing with legitimate issues. There is no doubt they are legitimate issues. Insurance fraud is wrong and it has to be dealt with and stamped out. There should be no excessive awards. There should be fair rewards for fair and legitimate claims. We should not have a situation where legal costs are essentially driving up the cost of insurance for people and we should do everything we can to eliminate unnecessary legal costs and all the other matters we have talked about to have some sort of consistency in awards. There is nothing in any of this update that will prevent the profiteering. That is the problem. The insurance companies will continue to profiteer for as long as they can. Why would they not? They always have and unless we do something to stop them profiteering, they always will. I put it to the Minister of State that this is the problem with all of this and the evidence is now starting to come in, because whatever claims they could make that all these sorts of reforms were necessary in order for them to bring them into line, and they were not making money and so on are gone now because they are making money. They are making a lot of money, they are not dropping the premiums, and I do not believe for one minute that they ever will. That is why the Minister of State cannot get that assurance from them in writing because they will not ever give it in writing. To be honest, there is nothing that we are proposing that will force them to reduce premiums to fair and reasonable levels because that is not the business they are in. They are not in the business of ensuring that people get fair insurance premiums. They are not even in the business of making sure that everybody who needs insurance gets it because, as we know, they will exit from areas where they cannot make a profit if they feel like it. They just decide not to provide insurance in that area because they cannot make a profit. They go where the profits are and they will use every compulsion and pressure on the Minister of State and on us to get us to take measures which will drive up their profits. What compulsion is there on them to feed those increased profits back into fair premiums? I put it to the Minister of State that there is none.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is, and the Minister of State did not really respond to this point, that there is nothing we can do apart from keeping the spotlight on them, to use the Minister of State's phrase. There is nothing we can do to compel them to give fair premiums and not to profiteer. There is nothing we can do to stop them just exiting the market whenever it suits them for whatever reasons they decide. I put it to the Minister of State that there is probably not a lot we can do either to stop them cooking the books for when they are making losses and when they are making profits, because we know they can carry out creative accountancy with their internal operations, their parent companies and their subsidiaries and they can move money around, just as the likes of Google and Facebook do. I suspect that is what they have been doing to put pressure on us to do certain things which will increase their bottom lines. That is my belief, but aside from that, my point is that there is nothing we are proposing here that will prevent them from doing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State saying that if somebody cannot make a profit out of an important insurance sector, then that sector just will not have insurance coverage? That is the logic of what he is saying. Take taxi drivers as an example. Society and public transport need taxi drivers. However, problems with insurance coverage and premiums threaten the livelihoods of taxi drivers if they have one claim against their insurance. If the insurance companies decide not to cover taxi drivers because they cannot make a profit, does that mean the taxi industry would shut down? Would we be precluded from stepping in where the market fails and ensuring there is insurance coverage of that sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is bonkers for us to allow that to happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do fix the price for the taxi driver.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with all of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not. However, there is a cross-party agreement on these issues. We needed to address them and they are being addressed now. I will give credit where credit is due. This is notwithstanding the fact that people have legitimate claims for serious injuries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough. We should not debate matters we do not have to debate. Insurance fraud should be stamped out. Excessive awards should not happen. Cases being dragged on for ever and ever with extortionate legal costs should not happen. We need to streamline that in the interests of-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----society, business and people who have to take out insurance for one reason or another. My point is that there is no mechanism to prevent insurance companies taking advantage of the well-intentioned work of the committee and all parties or of the measures taken by the Minister of State. I put it to the Minister of State that is what they are doing. They are taking advantage of the public demand, as well as the political willingness in the Oireachtas, to address these issues. They are just taking us for a ride. There is nothing to stop them doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am firmly of the view that they are. As I said, I believe we need a not-for-profit insurance company. If one looks at road safety generally, it has improved over recent years. Safety in the workplace has generally improved, with workplace fatalities going down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. We agree on that point. As Charlie Weston rightly put it, there is something wrong in the Irish insurance industry and it is not just about these matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that we will be here again dealing with high insurance premiums in two years when all of this is gone through because they are profiteering. I have raised with the Minister of State and his predecessor engagement with the taxi advisory committee on the specific problems faced by the taxi industry. I understand one meeting occurred with Insurance Ireland and the taxi advisory committee, after which a report was given to the Minister of State. What happened to this report? There is a particular difficulty for taxi drivers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will anything practical come out of it? Will anything be done for taxi drivers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that as much as the Minister of State can say? Yes. The issue was raised repeatedly by me and others as well as by taxi drivers that premiums for them were so high that their livelihoods were at risk. If they had even the slightest prang, it could push their premiums to a point where it was not viable to operate as a taxi driver. That is still a particular problem and we need taxis. Something had to be done about this. It was agreed that the taxi advisory committee would meet Insurance Ireland with a view to looking at the specific problems with insurance faced by taxi drivers. Then a report would come out of that engagement.What is coming out of that? Is that going to address the problems faced by taxi drivers?
