RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had an extensive discussion on section 481 tax relief for the film industry when we were considering the Finance Bill. I am very keen to press the issue. The monitoring of the quality employment and training condition that applies to those who get this funding must be improved if we are to ensure quality employment in this sector is actually manifest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad to hear what the Minister has said. It would be a major step forward. I would like to get as much detail and information as possible on this. The allegation being made by some workers can be summed up by comments made by the SIPTU equity representative when he was asked about blacklisting in the film industry. He said:People are terrified of rocking the boat in any way, shape or form when they are in a precarious situation in work. One of the questions on the survey asked whether respondents had ever experienced or observed any form of bullying or harassment. Something in the region of 65% to 70% of people said yes. The next questions asked if they reported it. Of that 70% of respondents who had said yes, roughly 70% said that they did not report it for fear of not getting the next job.He went on to attribute this low level of reporting to the "precarious" nature of the industry. If such a level of concern about blacklisting and being seen to rock the boat exists, that does not sound like quality employment to me. It is critical for us to design our approach to attracting the investment that is necessary in this sector in a way that ensures people who are employed in it are not vulnerable to the sort of thing that has been described.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many things that could be done, but I would like to focus on one of them in the short amount of time available to me. It would help if we had a clear register of the employees in the film industry. If the various stakeholders had to provide a list of the people in the industry, it would help us to ascertain the level of direct PAYE employment, as opposed to contractor employment, to determine whether there is evidence of bogus self-employment, to establish whether the trainee system is being abused, and to assess whether too many trainees are being taken on to avoid employing and paying qualified people. A register would help us to get the sort the information needed for a proper appraisal of the extent of quality employment and possible abuses in this area. I suggest we also need to examine the extent to which the certification process is looking under the surface of the different applications for the review under the different headings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what the Deputy said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment. The biggest source of tax avoidance by corporations globally centres on this digital area. We know these companies can, essentially, write their own tax bills. In Ireland, that is because of loopholes that I believe we have helped them create. We have worked with them on a nod and a wink basis to create a situation to allow them to write down their taxable profits. That is done by having loopholes which allow the corporations to write-off the costs of payments for intellectual property or royalties on intellectual property. They make payments to themselves for the use of their own intellectual property. Consequently, things that would be profits become costs and then become tax deductible. It is just a joke. It is assisting in accelerating inequality in the distribution of wealth to extraordinary proportions. These sorts of companies are leading the charge on this. A digital tax is a reasonable response to try to get a bit of tax back from these firms which specialise in avoiding tax. If the Government has concerns that this might have a disproportionate effect on Ireland, then we should get out ahead of it. We should acknowledge there is a serious problem with tax injustice and tax avoidance and state we have a better solution to it. The starting point for that solution has to be acknowledgement of this serious problem. It should also be stated that what these companies are doing is immoral and we need mechanisms to deal with it. Then we go out and argue, in a positive way, for a way of dealing with that. On the other side of this debate, the bigger countries may be playing for their own advantage. I accept that. We should not, however, be just as bad as they are by stating we care only about our little bit of advantage. There is a bigger picture here and that is of the big multinationals being parasitical in not wanting to pay their fair share of tax. We should look to address that problem. It is reasonable to have a report on this issue and also to have a serious discussion in this House about how we address it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The next amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 31:In page 145, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:
“Report on tax revenue foregone
62. Within 6 months of the passing of this act, the Minister shall produce a report on the actual or estimated tax revenue foregone, specifically in the area of property investment, as a result of section 110 tax relief on such investments, dating back to investments made since 2012 up to the present and in any future years where the benefit of this tax relief might still accrue.".I will be brief on this as we have discussed the topic quite a few times. The dog in the street knows extortionate profits are being made in the property sector currently. Much of this profit is being made by investors, asset management companies, vulture funds or however we might want to describe the likes of the real estate investment trusts. They were invited here, it is fair to say, to buy property-related debt from NAMA and some of the banks we bailed out. They bought vast amounts of property and building land at discount prices and they have now gained a major foothold in the Irish property sector, playing a very significant role in generating the current housing and homelessness emergency. They are engaged in wholesale property speculation, land hoarding and efforts to evict and de-tenant properties bought off NAMA. I have had to fight quite a few cases in my own area where Cerberus and Apollo Global Management have tried to evict people or get around rent caps. All they are doing is trying to ratchet up the values of those properties and rents to extortionate levels. Most of these people, particularly the outside investors, will benefit from this section 110 tax loophole if they hold their investments for a specified period of seven years. As well as making profits from rents and capital gains, they will then pay no tax on it. We could not make up that stuff. It is absolutely shocking. The public needs to know about this. There are many losers in the housing and homelessness emergency but there is a small cohort of winners who are being facilitated by these kinds of tax loopholes and Government policy in general. It is wrong and utterly shocking that when asked how much tax is forgone on this, the Government cannot or will not tell us. It must be to the tune of billions of euro, without a shadow of doubt, if we consider what is happening in the rental and property sectors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am mystified by the Minister of State's response. That percentage has definitely dramatically increased if we consider how these types of entities have come in. In the overall landlord sector, the number might be relatively small.That IRES REIT is the largest landlord in the country and is still buying up property loans and properties gives an indication of where the situation is heading. It was a deliberate policy. This is analogous to the double Irish and the intangible assets debate in that windows were opened. The Minister of State mentioned that the Government changed the law in 2016, and it was around that time that the intangible assets measure reverted to 80%. A specific window was deliberately opened up for these people in terms of intangible assets and property. It is in that window that we have this enormous scandal of a large amount of tax and of NAMA and the banks unloading vast amounts of property, building land and loans related to those. I do not buy the argument that it cannot be quantified because behavioural changes might have occurred had we done things differently. That could be said about any tax. At the same time, the Government is well able to give figures on revenue forgone under other tax heads. The Government does not want to give us this figure because it is a staggeringly high one. If it came out, people would be scandalised by it. The idea that the Government cannot even give us an estimate of how much tax would be forgone if these entities paid normal levels of tax on this kind of activity stretches credibility.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Seeing as how it is you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 33:In page 145, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:
“Corporate tax rate
62. Within 6 months of the passing of this act, the Minister shall produce a report on establishing a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent and the tax loopholes that are used to avoid paying this rate.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 145, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:
“Bogus self-employment
62. Within 6 months of the passing of this act the Minister shall prepare a report on the scale of bogus self-employment and measures that can be taken to prevent same.”.This relates to some of our discussions on the section 481 tax relief and, more generally, the problem of bogus self-employment. In the short time available to me, I will put it to the Minister this way. It is an incredible fact that there are workers, such as pilots, construction workers and film workers, who are fighting to pay tax but are being prevented from doing so. When we discuss tax reliefs, we usually refer to people who do not want to pay tax, avoid it and make lots of profit, but there is a cohort of working people who are fighting for the right to pay tax and are being frustrated in their ability to secure employment where they pay tax. If they secured employment and, instead of being falsely classified as contractors or freelancers, were classified as PAYE workers, as they want to be, then everyone would gain. They would get some sort of security and continuity of employment and Revenue would gain additional tax income. It would be a win-win situation except for certain classes of company, employer and so on who would rather not have to take responsibility for their employees, pay PRSI or pension contributions, pay sick pay and holiday pay and so forth and are instead deliberately playing the system. It gets even worse. Many of these companies that are trying to force bogus self-employment on people are in receipt of large sums of public money. We have discussed the film industry at length. There are protests under way on Gardiner Street in the Minister's constituency - I have not been able to attend it this week because I have been so busy in here - where building workers at St. Mary's Mansions are fighting for direct employment on an approved housing body, AHB, site where social housing is being constructed. Subbies are bringing people down who are working as bricklayers and classified as contractors despite in reality being employees. There are workers outside the gate who are fighting for direct employment as PAYE workers. That situation is wrong. In all of these situations, be it in Ryanair, the film industry, the construction sector or other sectors, we need clear definitions of an employee. They are not difficult to devise. Does someone set people's working hours, tell them when to go on lunch and pay them certain moneys for certain hours? If so, then they are employees. They are not contractors or businesses. Revenue needs to go into these places, be they in the film industry or construction industry, and say that someone will be classified and taxed as a PAYE worker.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that here has been some movement on this. It has been a long time coming and building workers have been fighting on this for many years but I accept that there has been movement from the Government and Revenue recently. However, more is needed. There is a protest in the Minister's constituency as we speak involving an approved housing body that is building houses with public money. The Minister should pop down and talk to those involved in that protest. Deputy Fitzmaurice is correct in saying there may be legitimate reasons for subcontractors to be involved in projects. However, we must ask whether the people who are working for the contractor or subcontractor are getting payslips, are being properly taxed and properly classified. Is the subcontractor hiring lots of people who are all being classified as self-employed entrepreneurs? Often these workers are not self-employed and are getting paid less than they would be paid if they were directly employed. That is the main issue. Similarly, I have spoken to people working in the film industry who have told me that a lot of problems in that industry could be sorted quite easily. They suggest that officials from Revenue's joint investigations unit, JIU, or from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht visit film production sites before filming starts and obtain a list of all of the people who will be working on the project, including their names and grades and whether they are working on contract or are self-employed. In that way, everyone will be properly classified and abuse cannot happen. This would require additional resources for Revenue, or whatever body is responsible, in order to be effective. Resources are needed, as is a willingness to do this properly. We also need legislation which is why a report on this, as per my amendment, would be good. We need legislation to tighten up things like the definition of an employee and an employer in order to make it easier to deal with the grey areas and the areas of dispute and abuse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pressing my amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment, particularly given the very generous tax reliefs we discussed earlier which are to be given to those who are making extraordinary amounts of money out of property, rents and, frankly, profiteering off the back of the current housing and homelessness emergency. It has got to shocking levels. A new record was struck in the docklands area, which is in the Minister's constituency as it happens. Rents of €3,300 are proposed for apartments in a new block which has just been completed. That is just wrong. At this point surely the Government recognises that we have to do something in terms of real rent control. I do not refer just to rent caps: we need rents to be set at affordable levels. This is done in other jurisdictions. People from local authorities or some other Government or State body go in, look at places and at their size, take into account any reasonable factors and say that more than a given figure cannot be charged. We have to have that now, otherwise this will be a disaster on many levels. Even from the point of view of economic competitiveness, which may be more of a focus for the Government than the social and humanitarian side, we are not going to be able to get the people we need into this country to address labour and skills shortages or to keep our own young people from leaving the country if we cannot set affordable levels of rent. In the absence of that, the little bit of relief proposed in this amendment is a good idea, but the Minister really has to look at rent controls or we are in serious trouble. Many people are in serious trouble, as is our wider society and economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment. The key point is I do not see how the Minister can possibly justify that such relief exists for those paying subscriptions to professional bodies and not allow the same for trade union members. It is a clear case of discrimination. Workers need the protection of trade unions every bit as much as professional bodies may feel the need to exist and that people may wish to be members of them to protect their interests or to carry on their particular trade. The discrimination and inequity of this must be addressed. The trade union relief should be brought back in. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response because the position is not fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said that this debate should not be personalised and that it should be about policy. For the people who need solutions, it is intensely personal. For the people in homeless accommodation, on housing lists for more than a decade, in mortgage distress, priced out of the market, in overcrowded conditions, living with three or four generations in one house and living in poor quality housing, it is very personal. There are many people in despair over their personal circumstances. I am currently dealing with a couple who have eight children and are living in a HAP tenancy in Clonee even though they are from Dún Laoghaire. This is the third HAP-RAS tenancy they have been in. A few four-bedroom houses have come on-stream in Dún Laoghaire but it does not look like they are going to get one of them. Despite pleading with the council, it is not looking good. This family has been through a tough time. This is just one story. I deal with dozens of similar cases every week. This is personal for those people. They need solutions, they need them fast and they need to be real solutions.  The Minister appealed for us not to be ideological and to be practical. I refer him to an advertisement in the property pages relating to the Honeypark site, which was previously in NAMA and given back to Cosgrave. The Government made the decision to give it back to Cosgrave, who it paid to build it out and now Cosgrave is making the money on it. The Government has done the same with other sites. The sale price for these 214 recently completed apartments, which are being sold to international investors, is €95 million, which is €440,000 per three-bedroom apartment and they are not that big. On another property page, there is an advertisement regarding the sale of more than 1,600 apartments, many of them in Honeypark and almost all of them on sites that were in public ownership, namely, NAMA, and given back to developers, which are being sold to international investment funds for €610 million, which is just under €400,000 per unit. Many of the apartments are three-bedroom, which the investment funds are renting to people in Dún Laoghaire at between €2,400 and €2,800 per month. A number of them are being rented to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. This is a joke.  Further up the road, there is another site, Cherrywood, which was also in the hands of NAMA but was returned to Hines. The company has obtained a lot of planning permissions and thus increased the value of the site. It has also flipped some of the site to Cairn Homes. Regarding the 10% of units the company is providing for social housing, it is asking for in excess of €400,000 for some of them. When we had this land in State ownership, via NAMA, the prices were much lower. It is a heist. We give the developers land free of charge and they sell, rent or lease it back to us for a fortune. This is madness. Who can afford rent of between €2,400 and €2,800 per month? Who can afford to buy the units at €440,000? Virtually nobody, particularly not the people who need council housing. The local authorities also cannot afford to buy them at that price for social housing and people earning up to €80,000 per annum cannot afford to buy them. These units are being bought by investors to rent at extortionate prices, which causes one to think. The Government says that we need these people in the property market to help us. I think we want these people running out of the country screaming because we impose such heavy taxes on them and put such severe rent controls in place they are forced to leave, because only then will house prices drop. We do not need them here. They are driving prices through the roof. They are exploiting the crisis. Because they know the people they are going to rent to cannot afford to buy at this level they can charge these rents. This is the vicious circle we are in. I commend Deputy Ó Bróin for bringing forth this Bill. We similarly proposed this in the motion that was defeated by the Government. Fianna Fáil did not vote for it, for which I criticised it heavily at the time, because it liked some of what was proposed but not all of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tit-for-tat does not work on this issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a problem. The Minister has a point. The motion we tabled during the summer proposed a minimum of 20% social and affordable housing and a minimum 30% on SDZs. There is a problem if that is all we do. I regret that what Deputy Ó Bróin has proposed is not enough. We need 100,000 social houses on public land, for which we have sites available, over the next five years to even begin to get near solving the problem, which equates to 20,000 houses per year. Anything less and we are in serious trouble. On Part V, there is a problem as well, even with this proposal if done on its own.The problem is that if we buy the units back at these prices - and the State must, under the Part V scheme, lease or buy them - it will cost the State a fortune. We should therefore not buy the completed units. This was the point Mel Reynolds made, and I put it to all in the House, particularly the Minister. He said we should take the 10%, 20%, 25%, 30% or whatever the percentage is - and I think 25% and 30% are good percentages - of the land now and upfront, not the completed units whenever these speculators decide to build. We do not know when they will build. In Cherrywood, for example, one of the biggest planned residential developments in the State, not a single unit has been built. The developers got it about six or seven years ago from NAMA. We should therefore take our chunk now, take a chunk near the entrance to Cherrywood so we avoid any of the servicing problems and so on and build our bit now. This would mean we could build it at a much cheaper price. The State can build on the land at about €200,000, perhaps €250,000 - or less, between €170,000 and €220,000 - per unit. If the State buys the land, it will be relatively cheap; if the Government waits for the developers to give the State the completed units, the State will be waiting forever and will pay a fortune when it arrives. This is what we should do on all these sites, whether strategic development zones or whatever else. We should take the land now so it becomes public land and build at the price at which we can build, which will be cheaper and then we will deliver the units more quickly. This is a very serious, practical proposal. Whatever percentage is agreed on this, this proposal would make a significant difference. It would accelerate things and collapse the dichotomy that Deputy Darragh O'Brien and the Minister proposed when they spoke of the impact on price and so on because it would not be-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to Deputy Darragh O'Brien's criticism that this is reliance on the private sector. We would not be relying on the private sector because we would be taking the land and it would become public sector land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Great. That is excellent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil is going to champion this policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am running out of time now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a serious proposal and I would like to hear a response from the Minister on it. It would make a big difference. If the Minister does not believe so, I would like him to explain how we will get these people on these strategic development zones. Lastly, in ten seconds I want to say this on social mix. The Minister's comments are a bit rich. On public sites he wants to sell off public land to the private sector because we must have social mix, but on the private sites we can only have 10% public, so the social mix is different because it is a private site. This is not a serious notion of private mix; it just covers for the fact that we are allowing the private sector to dictate housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why I am saying we should take the land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not proposing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that it does not work in Dún Laoghaire.
