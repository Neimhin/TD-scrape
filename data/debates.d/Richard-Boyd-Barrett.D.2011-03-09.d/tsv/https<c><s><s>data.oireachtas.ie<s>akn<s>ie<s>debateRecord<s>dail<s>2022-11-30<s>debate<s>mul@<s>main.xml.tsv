RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise with the Taoiseach the very severe danger to people’s health because of the lack of fast and efficient medical assessments of people with housing needs. The lack of social or any other housing options is seriously jeopardising the health of very vulnerable people. I gave the Taoiseach some examples yesterday. Here are some more. One relates to a 59-year-old man with severe Alzheimer’s disease in a housing assistance payment, HAP, residency. He has been moved seven times in the past nine years. His doctors have specifically said he needs one location in which to live so as not to aggravate his medical condition. I received an email today from a couple with two twins. There are four young boys. The mother is getting cancer treatment, namely, chemotherapy, and she is also getting multiple infections because the family is living in mouldy, damp conditions. In all these cases in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it now takes up to a year for the medical assessment to happen, never mind giving people places to live that are suited to their health conditions. Will the Taoiseach addresses this as a matter of urgency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are still being asked for more information even though they have an oncologist's report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has severe Alzheimer's disease.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Taoiseach to look into the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The following is a message from a student nurse:I myself am a student nurse working 39hours on placement for free and having to work 2 days on top of this to earn money and i am honestly burnt out. Most student are doing over 60hors a week. It is costing 9euro a day in parking alone without including petrol and lunches. To add even more to this disappointment, I am yet to receive the thousand-euro nurses' bonus promised to us in June. something needs to change to help our health system and it is not for the lack of nurses training, it is the treatment we receive that people leave Ireland seeking better conditions.She particularly asked, as do her colleagues, what has happened to the recommendations for an enhanced reimbursement scheme for student nurses arising out of the McHugh report and other recommendations, including the provision of uniforms and a payment for the cost of laundering uniforms and so on. It must be remembered that we have record numbers on trolleys. We have the highest number of patients on trolleys on record for this month of November. When we treat our student nurses in this way, is it any wonder we cannot get the staff we need in the health service?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has not been paid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure she is not lying to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last Monday week, Mahmoud al-Saadi was shot in the stomach as he made his way to school by the Israeli occupying forces while they were conducting a raid on a refugee camp in Jenin. He is one of 47 children who have been murdered by Israeli forces just this year, as well as a massive escalation that has claimed the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. When the Taoiseach met the US congressional delegation, or whenever he talks to his American counterparts, does he ask them the very simple questions as to why they continue to arm the Israeli State to carry out these criminal and murderous actions against Palestinian people, why they continue to give billions of dollars in military aid and why they continue to veto every effort to bring sanction against Israel for its crimes against innocent children going to school and being shot down by murderous Israeli forces?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With the Americans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should the Americans stop arming them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not accuse you of being a puppet of a different state.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We said you wanted to align with NATO.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not trying to suppress the debate.
