RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Another shameful statistic has emerged in the utterly shameful record of this Government on the issue of housing and homelessness. We now top the league table in Europe for the proportion of women who are homeless. The number of women as a proportion of those who are homeless is 48%, which is approximately 10% higher than the next highest in Europe. This is shameful. I have looked at the draft National Risk Assessment - Overview of Strategic Risks that the Department of the Taoiseach has produced and, frankly, I understand why we are in this mess. This document was produced in the last couple of days. While there is a lot of commentary about how we got here and the failures of the market, in all of the prescriptions, in so far as there are any in the risk assessment, and there are very few, there is no mention of social housing: none. That is extraordinary given a collapse in the provision of social housing is the key reason we are in this mess. There is no mention of the need to increase the stock of social housing dramatically and for the State to do it when the market has so obviously failed. It is in that context that I am asking if the Taoiseach will consider, as I and others have asked before, moving legislation for a constitutional referendum on the right to housing. It needs to be established in our Constitution so that there is an obligation on the State to deliver the housing that we so urgently need to deal with the shameful situation that has emerged under Fine Gael's watch.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The clock applies to all of us. The Taoiseach was right to acknowledge that there was something to be investigated given the outcome of the trial of the Jobstown defendants. I welcome that he did so. This is all in the public domain. The evidence was aired.There was a flat contradiction between objective video evidence and statements made by three very senior gardaí. There were also other highly significant contradictions in evidence. When three senior gardaí make the same false statement, word for word, that is a crime if it turns out to be collusion. I hope Deputy Micheál Martin acknowledges, as the Taoiseach appears to have done, the seriousness of this matter, coming as it does on the back of the scandals about whistleblowers, 1 million false breath tests and 15,000 false convictions. I could go through a list but this is another instance of the same thing that needs to be investigated. In that context, I put it to the Taoiseach that the investigation cannot be conducted by the Garda. These are serious matters and the investigation must be done by people who will consider the evidence objectively. Has the Taoiseach discussed the correspondence sent by the solicitor representing Cynthia Owen to the Minister for Justice and Equality? He will be aware of the terrible case involving an 11 year old girl who was raped and gave birth to a child that was subsequently murdered and who has made allegations against very senior gardaí. Ms Owen's solicitor has stated that the barrister from the independent review mechanism, the panel of barristers examining certain cases, who carried out the review of her case had previously represented one of the accused in the case. This gives rise to a serious conflict of interest. I ask the Taoiseach to examine this serious issue. Cynthia Owen is being denied the justice and investigation she is seeking in a context of a major conflict of interest on the part of the person who made the decision in her case.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach include Egypt on his itinerary of foreign visits? As the Taoiseach knows, the trial of Ibrahim Halawa has dragged out for more than four years. He has suffered terribly in that time. He is going through a laughable legal process under what is now just a tin-pot repressive dictatorship that is locking up en masse anyone in its own population who politically dissents against its brutal regime. The prosecution case against Ibrahim finally got going and ended at the weekend, but the Halawa family's fear is that the judges will be changed in September, given that Egypt changes its judges. If that happens, the whole process will return to the start and there will have been four wasted years. That cannot be allowed to happen. I urge the Taoiseach to increase the Government's efforts by making a high-level visit to Egypt and insisting that our citizen be brought home. This sham legal process cannot continue. Ibrahim Halawa cannot stand much more time incarcerated in that country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The horror of the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 is totally unspeakable. Some 8,000 people were murdered. There were mass graves. Some 440 children were among the dead who have been identified, while more than 1,000 of the victims still have not been identified. It is an absolutely horrific moment in European history. It is right that we should commemorate it and learn the lessons in order that such things are not repeated. However, if we are not to repeat those horrors, it is very important that we are honest in our appraisal of what happened and how we failed. Otherwise we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. I would say that this is exactly what we are doing. There is no question about the culpability of Milosevic, Karadzic and Mladic. There is no question that they were rotten, racist nationalists who stirred people up to the most foul actions. However, we are being one-sided if that is all we say. Let me read the following account from 1995:Evidence of atrocities; an average of six corpses per day continues to emerge ... [T]he corpses; some fresh, some decomposed, are mainly of old men. Many have been shot in the back of the head or had throats slit, others have been mutilated. Isolated pockets of elderly civilians report people recently gone missing or detained [...] Endless [...] invitations for [people - I will tell Members who they were in a moment] to return, guarantees of citizens' rights and property rights etc., have gushed forth from all levels.This is an account from a European Union report cited by Robert Fisk describing the ethnic cleansing of Krajina Serbs after Srebrenica. This was effectively condoned by the western powers and the NATO bombing, which intervened on one side of the conflict and essentially allowed the Croats, led by an equally rotten racist who was also, in the case of Franjo Tudjman, a fascist sympathiser. We said very little about his politics at the time because it suited the interests of the West. Indeed the Vance-Owen plan encouraged ethnic cleansing in that it mapped out in advance of all this the ethnic partition of the former Yugoslavia and encouraged the worst, most right-wing nationalist and racist elements on all sides. The consequences were disastrous for ordinary Croats and Muslims and many Serbs as well. The reason it is important to balance what we are saying tonight and to acknowledge the culpability of the western powers is that a selective approach to horror, war and obscenity continues today. Rightly we condemn the Assad regime for its brutal suppression, with Russian support, of its own people. However, we remain silent when it is western allies that are encouraging similar obscenities and atrocities. We fail to speak up about how, for example, Israel, al-Qaeda and Turkey are manipulating the situation in Syria and are even threatening the safety of our troops in the buffer zone in the Golan Heights. We do not speak loudly about how Britain, the United States and France arm Saudi Arabia which in turn arms ISIS. These forces manipulate the situation, leading to the sort of horrific atrocities that we are seeing for ordinary people across Syria. When those refugees then seek to come to Europe, we allow 14,000 of them to drown in the Mediterranean - men, women and children. We deny them entry into the European Union or we lock them up in direct provision centres and treat them as subhuman. In remembering Srebrenica, we have to remember those lessons and end the hypocrisy, double standards and cynical manipulations that allowed those horrors to take place in the first place.
