RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems to me that the most elementary function of a government in order to have a functioning economy is that its citizens can exist in that economy at the most basic level. Students from Dublin City University, DCU, gathered outside Leinster House today because they have been asked to suffer an increase in rent from €4,500 per year to €8,700. For many that means they will leave education. An open letter was written today by a student nurse who is leaving nursing studies because after paying for her accommodation and her bills she has €4 a week left to live on. Even somebody on average industrial earnings is paying 70% of their income to meet average rents, which are now between €1,800 and €2,000 in Dublin city. Does the Taoiseach recognise that if students, people on low income, nurses and a vast number of our citizens cannot put a roof over their heads we have a serious economic problem? Does he recognise how serious the problem is? Talking about limiting rent increases to 4% against that background is worse than useless, a futile exercise in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Does he not need serious emergency measures to bring the cost of accommodation down to a level where people can exist?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer my final question about the unaffordability of rent and accommodation and, therefore, I will try again. DCU students were protesting outside Leinster House earlier. They are being asked to swallow a 30% rent increase, bringing their rent up to almost €9,000 annually. This is because student accommodation was not covered by the Government's inadequate rent cap legislation. Will the Taoiseach do something for the DCU students and other students who will be unable to continue their studies if they are asked to swallow these rent increases? Does he accept that a 4% rent cap is ineffective? Even the imposition of criminal sanction in the legislation mooted earlier by the Minister would be a futile, half-baked exercise in closing the door after the horse has bolted because the problem is rents are unaffordable. Will the Taoiseach please address this point? There is no point limiting average rents of between €1,800 and €2,000 in Dublin to a 4% annual increase. Rents need to be reduced to affordable levels. These average rents equate to 70% of the income of the average worker. That is not sustainable or payable. I mentioned the young student nurse who wrote an open letter to the Minister for Health about how nurses are going home at the end of the week in tears because they only have between €4 and €6 left in their pocket after they have paid their rent. I ask in all sincerity what the Taoiseach will do about that. If all the Government is promising is to limit unaffordable rents to 4% annual increase, that is a complete waste of time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is still no answer to the question on housing, despite it being asked twice. There were three minutes spent on one issue. Could it be spread out a little?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Germany is the most powerful state in the European Union and probably the biggest supporter in Europe of the state of Israel. Does the Taoiseach ever raise questions with it about its policy of providing pretty much uncritical support for Israel, particularly given what has happened? Before the Easter break, I warned the Taoiseach in this House that innocent, unarmed protestors would be shot by Israeli snipers. That was two days before it happened and the Taoiseach did not answer the question. I asked him to speak up if people were killed, but the European Union has remained silent. Unarmed protestors marched to vindicate international law. The right to return is part of international law, as confirmed by United Nations resolutions. Some 34 unarmed Palestinians were shot for trying to assert their rights under international law.No Israeli diplomats were expelled and there was no threat of sanctions or discussion of military strikes or other measures. Does the Taoiseach think he should speak up to the leaders of other European Union countries, Germany in particular, who do not like to criticise Israel, and tell them this is not acceptable and that Europe should take action and sanction Israel for this murderous activity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been the first to say, and have said most loudly, and there is no doubt that the Assad regime is a brutal, callous, murderous, authoritarian regime supported by a very cynical Russia. I have no doubt about the brutalities it has committed and is capable of committing. The idea that US, UK and French missiles and a massive dose of hypocrisy and double standards from those powers will assist in the humanitarian disaster in Syria is stomach-churning. For Government representatives to talk about the attacks being understandable is shocking. Let me refer to the double standards we are talking about. In 2009, Israel rained down chemical weapons, white phosphorous, in the full view of day, on the UN school in Gaza and on densely populated areas. A report was done by Human Rights Watch afterwards called Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza. This was well-documented and proven. The shells were found all around the place. They were chemical weapons. Guess where they were produced? Louisiana in the United States. Were there sanctions? No. Were there expulsions of diplomats? No. Were there threats of military action by these politicians who told us, in the context of bombing Syria, that they could not sleep with the thought of the use of chemical weapons? They were able to sleep very soundly when Israel rained down chemical weapons on the people of Gaza. Incredibly, the Israelis said at the weekend that it was absolutely right to take military action to uphold international law but in the last few weeks, 36 unarmed Palestinians were killed who were marching to assert their rights under international laws to return to their homes as confirmed by UN resolutions. Sanctions? No. Military action? No. Expulsions? No. This sort of rank hypocrisy is corrosive of politics and is responsible for the mess in the Middle East. There is cynical interference of big powers, whether Russia, Donald Trump, Theresa May or Emmanuel Macron, trying to shore up their collapsing popularity by diverting people's attention with a war abroad and furthering the interests of imperial powers in that region, to gain influence on the back of the suffering of the Syrian people. We have to speak out against this sickening hypocrisy and have nothing to do with this murderous assault by Trump and his gang of allies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We got three minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Saying the attacks were understandable in any shape or form is tacit support. Quite frankly, the Tánaiste is not applying uniform or consistent standards when it comes to the behaviour of the big powers who dominate and who are currently paralysing the UN Security Council. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. People like Macron, May or Trump, with Israel cheering them on, said we must uphold international law and the prohibition on chemical weapons. Despite this, although the Tánaiste and I know that those same powers have used chemical weapons, nobody said a bloody word when they did it in Gaza. There were no sanctions or expulsions and nobody said it would be understandable if Hamas lobbed a few rockets back in retaliation. I bet the Tánaiste would not say that. There are double standards and that is what is fuelling the conflict that is tearing the Middle East apart.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the chemical weapons attacks in Gaza?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to say I am finding it quite interesting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason I am a socialist and believe capitalism needs to be replaced with a system that has a different set of values is that in its essence capitalism turns everything into a commodity from which someone can profit. As he or she accumulates that profit, he or she gains more and more power over society. When the first critiques of the pernicious logic of commodification and profit at the heart of how capitalism operates were developed by people like Marx, they talked about the commodification of raw materials, goods and services and the profits accumulated by the owners of these resources, factories, small businesses, landholdings and so on. Even 200 years ago Marx understood the logic was relentless, that the process of commodification would reach into every single aspect of human existence and the natural world and that slowly but surely everything would be commodified and made subject to the cash nexus. In fairness to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, perhaps slightly surprisingly, he alluded to this and was absolutely right. That is where we have got to with the digital or information technology revolution. I do not think even Marx could have understood just how far-reaching the process would be in commodifying every aspect of our existence, down to genetics, with the genetic profiling of individuals, categories of people and so on. The digital revolution has facilitated the process of commodification to an absolutely extraordinary degree. The beneficiaries of the technological process, the owners of the information or the technology that amasses and controls that information on us accumulate levels of wealth parallel to their accumulation of enormous stores of information on us as human beings and individuals and now dominate the economy and the globe like colossi. It could not have been envisaged 200 years ago when capitalist development got under way that a few companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple would absolutely dominate these sectors and control a vast amount of information on us, as we see in the issue being discussed in the courts related to Mr. Denis O’Brien, the richest individual in the country. His extraordinary control of the media, another source of information on our society, beggars belief and deserves another debate on its own merits because one wealthy individual who seems to be fêted constantly by Taoisigh and prominent political figures can control the Irish Independent, Sunday Independent, Sunday World, The Herald, half of the Daily Star, The Kerryman, the Drogheda Independent, the Wicklow People, the Wexford People, the Waterford People, 98FM in Dublin, Newstalk, Today FM, Spin, Spin South West and the list goes on. Now there is an allegation that Mr. Denis O'Brien was using his control over Independent News & Media, an enormous corporation, to access the data of the journalists working for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an allegation. I am just saying it is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just stating this is happening. The allegation is very much in the public domain. I am not judging or adjudicating on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not deciding it. I am not even offering an opinion on what the outcome of the case in the courts should be. I am simply stating what anyone can read on RTÉ's website, that the matter is being looked at and that there is an allegation which was written about widely in the newspapers at the weekend that Mr. Denis O'Brien and his representative in that company inappropriately accessed journalists' information and their sources, possibly including barristers and so on who were involved in the Moriarty tribunal, possibly including politicians and other sources. That matter is being investigated. Whether he is guilty will be adjudicated on by the courts. I am simply pointing out that that level of control and wealth gives people that access. Will the legislation we are bringing forward to protect data, in this case emails, if people are found guilty of the very serious charges levelled against Mr. Denis O'Brien, result in the police being sent for or will there be administrative sanctions? That is important because there is a parallel system of justice when it comes to these matters. It works in financial areas where, if someone is found guilty of engaging in white collar crime, the Central Bank imposes administrative sanctions and the person concerned is then immune from criminal sanctions. Will this legislation ensure people who are found guilty will be jailed, if, for example, as in this case, the courts adjudicate that there was illegal access of journalists' data? Will the police be sent in or will there be administrative sanctions? I want people who turn out to be guilty of committing that kind of crime, not just in this case but any case, to go to jail. They are doing exactly the same as someone who breaks into a house and burgles it. It should be treated as a criminal offence. There should not be two laws, whereby there are administrative sanctions for the corporate or financial sector or the owners of big digital corporations who have a lot of information on us and inappropriately allow our emails to be given to others, without our permission. They should be jailed. There should be dawn raids to arrest them. They should be subject to the same criminal sanctions as those guilty of common or garden criminal actions or theft. I would like to see legislation that would ensure that would happen.
