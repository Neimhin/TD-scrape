RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the points have been made. This is a new variation on an old and failed theme when the supply of housing in whatever form it takes that people can afford based on their incomes needs to be increased. The Government is instead returning to an old theme, which is to incentivise developers with tax breaks relating to property. The tax break in this case is hoped to increase supply and to incentivise the private sector to deliver housing. We have been down this road previously and it just does not work. It led to disastrous consequences. The evidence is clear that this proposal is driving up prices and, therefore, the benefit, if any, to the target group of first-time buyers is highly dubious but, in any event, it is completely the wrong way of approaching the problem. It smacks of the addiction that seems to exist of looking to the private sector to deal with this problem and trying to incentivise developers and bankers rather than the State directly providing the low cost housing that is needed. I do not understand why the Government does not grasp that fact. One does not have to be a radical left winger to understand this. Large scale provision of low cost housing was directly provided by the State previously. It is cheaper, more effective and quicker, but, instead, we have these round the houses approaches and the circuitous route to trying to solve the problem always goes via the bankers and the developers rather than going directly at it. We absolutely reject this as a solution and think it will add to the problems rather than solve them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister say that again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am surprised by what Deputy Doherty said, although I take his figures seriously on effective demand in the figures for people getting mortgage approval. I would have thought there was a huge problem with effective demand, not just in the ability to gather together a deposit but with regard to the multiples. The evidence for this was very apparent to me when I went to the teachers' protest. It would be the same on the nurses' protest. Their income is not enough for them to even dream of buying a house or renting. A person came to me the other day who is a tenured lecturer in a university. The person broke down in front of me because she believes she may be homeless in a couple of months. She has children but is separated. She lives on a tenured university salary in south Dublin but rents are more than half her net salary. It is unsustainable but she will not be able to afford to buy on the Cherrywood development either. She cannot afford the rents and will not be able to buy unless prices, either for renting or buying, are brought significantly down. I do not see how anything the Minister is talking about will achieve that. A hard lid is being kept on salaries and incomes and any increases are not much against a background in which rents and property prices are going through the roof. All the signs are that this measure is actually already putting up prices further. Unless we get prices to affordable levels by controlling prices and controlling rents I do not see how this problem is going to be solved. Cherrywood could help solve the problem in south Dublin because it is a big site with capacity for 11,000 homes. However, if the vulture fund dictates the prices of most of the properties, and maybe even the 10% to which reference was made, which it will probably lease back to the local authority rather than the authority or an approved housing body taking ownership of it, it will control the speed at which it is all built. It will decide whether a property is for purchase or for rent and will do so on the basis of whatever gives the best price for it. I do not see how it helps. It may make the situation worse but it certainly will not address the problem of the woman who came to see me. I was shocked in that if this could happen to somebody on €70,000 a year, what is the situation for others? In fact, I know what it is because such people walk through the door of my clinic every single week. It is totally impossible for them. Anybody who finds themselves without accommodation in the greater Dún Laoghaire-south Dublin area are in the housing crisis. They are in an emergency situation. One does not have to be a radical to see things this way. In the 1970s there was the Kenny report, which concluded that we had to control all building land. We had to control prices and supply or we would not meet social need and social demand. Is that not now obviously the case? If the 10% that has been set aside in the Cherrywood development was 50%, would that not bring down the price of rents and so on? Would it not be even better if it was 100%? We would then control the prices. What guarantee can the Minister give that the vulture fund to which he sold the stuff will not just charge whatever it likes and price most people out of the market? I do not think the Minister can give any such guarantee. We have recent experience of this because, before 2008 when there was a large amount of supply, prices were unaffordable and the only way people could afford a house was to take out an unsustainable loan. The only way to resolve the problem of people not having enough income to pay inflated prices is to borrow money, and we know how dangerous that is. People would be borrowing money they could not afford to pay back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My solution is to control prices. The State has to deliver large-scale rental or affordable housing through local authorities, mortgage schemes run by the State and so on. The State should control at least a significant amount of the housing stock to provide for people who cannot afford, on their current salaries, what the market is going to charge them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just gave the example of Cherrywood. It is not going to happen in Cherrywood.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to correct one part of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have no control over what they charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will state the very obvious point. Even with the 10% being spoken about by the Minister, they will build it. It will be sold or leased back to local authorities at a discount on the market price. We do not even know what a reasonable profit is in the legislation, and that is how it is defined. It will be relative to the market prices in south Dublin, which are off the scale. Even the social element will cost the State an absolute fortune as it will be built by the people being described by the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very unlikely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the proposal for a report on the cost of housing. Deputy McGrath referred specifically to the cost in the private sector but I think we need to know the cost of the State building housing too. I have tabled several parliamentary questions on this in recent years and the figures I get vary significantly. We need to compare the costs of public sector and private sector building to either further delineate the different types of housing that could be built and by whom they might be built.We should examine the relative cost of housing units built by direct labour by the State as against public housing built by contractors brought in to deliver it. The Minister referred to profit-taking, marketing is another cost to which he referred, and there are other costs which add to the cost of building, which we would not have if housing units were built by direct labour. Obviously, the cost of land is an issue. Any study needs to examine that and also co-operative housing, of which there are various schemes in development. A good scheme has been proposed in my area where there is a plan to build four high specification, environmentally advanced houses, the projected cost of which is €360,000 for four houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cite that as an example of the different costs there are for building housing, which is precisely relevant to the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Four houses for €360,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is less than that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, €90,000 each.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a proposal which Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has taken up. There are different ways of delivering housing and these are high specification, environmentally advanced housing units. Any study in this area needs to examine all the different models of delivering housing and make a comparison between them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, Minister------
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is related to the finances of the State. The reason I put forward the proposal is that we need the study to be comparative. I am referring to not only council housing but affordable housing. If it turns out that we can deliver affordable housing for purchase much cheaper by the State providing it directly, then we need to know that as part of any serious study.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to see the study.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is also a problem in my area.
