RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was one of the people who was sceptical when the lottery was set up in that it was a tax on working class people and promoted gambling.  I have to acknowledge that it has turned out to be the most benign form of that, probably because it is held a few times a week and the way it is done does not seem to be tied in with the serious and rampant gambling culture which is becoming an increasing problem.  My concern is that if it is privatised, and I would like to hear some words of assurance on that, there will be an incentive for the lottery to promote less prudent gambling.  I do not see how that cannot be the case if the operator fee increases, and Mr. Connell is suggesting it is possible for a significant increase in the operator fee but there will not be a diminution in the number of prizes given.  There must be some other way to make up the difference.  One possibility is that it promotes greater access to gambling and if we are talking about online gambling, as far as I am concerned that is one of the most dangerous forms of gambling gripping our society because of the ease of access.Mr. Connell intimated that he might be able to offer products through phones and so on.  That worries me.  It would worry me that a more privatised operator under less Government regulation and control, and less accountable to the Government, might be much more reckless in the way it made money.  I am not sure Mr. Connell can give me assurances on that but I ask him to have a stab at it and tell me that will not be the case.  If that is the case, I do not understand how the entire operation will not run at a loss or that there is not a serious danger of a loss to the players of the games, possibly in terms of prizes because the pressure comes from that front but, more importantly, on the question of moneys for good causes and the way those moneys are dispensed.  There is a certain level of accountability, when it is closer to public control, as to how much money might go to good causes and how we decide the good causes.Issues of conflict of interest are more important the further the lottery moves away from public regulation and control.  Without impugning the integrity of future possible operators, cronyism becomes a possibility in such a situation.  I am not saying cronyism is not possible in the public realm, but there is a little bit more control and accountability.  How much was the operator fee last year?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the realms of 5% to 6%.  My next question is not meant to be personal, but in these times when everybody's salaries are being examined, how much is Mr. Connell paid?  How much do the executives and the directors get paid?  How many people in the national lottery company are being paid in excess of â‚¬100,000 per annum?  Are these the kind of jobs where we could see upward remuneration if the company was privatised?  I think Mr. Connell is recommending this course of action.  Has he been given strong indications from the Government that the company is one of those State assets it is moving to sell?  How much does the Government expect to realise from that sale?
