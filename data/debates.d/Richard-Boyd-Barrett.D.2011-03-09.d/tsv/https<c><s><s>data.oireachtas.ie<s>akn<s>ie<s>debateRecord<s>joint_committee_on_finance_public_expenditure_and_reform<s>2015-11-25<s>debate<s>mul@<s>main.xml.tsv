RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their presentation. I did not really have any doubts about the case they made on the credit union legislation. If I did, they completely persuaded me as to the merits of their case. Given all that has happened, it is really quite extraordinary that the case they are making is not having a greater impact on the Government. Lending is risky but, quite obviously, lending by institutions that are not for profit is less risky. To me, that is so self-evident that it is beyond question. The credit union movement has proven itself in that regard in the teeth of the biggest financial crisis the country has ever faced. Whatever problems it had - it had a small number - they were just a drop in the ocean by comparison with those of the profit-oriented commercial banking sector. The entire banking system should be run like the credit union movement. For-profit banks should be put out of business. I am completely on the side of the delegates. Could they enlighten me as to why the Government is not listening? There are Members of the Houses who, in this debate and in that relating to the credit union legislation, have been falling over themselves to say how much they love the credit unions. However, they do not seem to have listened to the case the delegates made this time around and in respect of the legislation. They said that the one-size-fits-all approach and tiering proposed by the Government are not appropriate for the credit unions and are a stumbling block to the development of new services and to the sustainability of the movement. Therefore, why the hell is the Government or the Central Bank not listening? Perhaps the delegates will enlighten us as to which one is not listening. I am a bit baffled. I am shocked to my core that the Government and Central Bank have not taken up with speed and urgency a suggestion made by the credit union representatives in 2012 when what became the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act was being debated. They said they could contribute substantially to dealing with the social housing crisis.All we hear from this Government is that it takes a few years to build houses so it cannot solve the problem immediately. The big issue that the Government always cites is that it does not have the capital upfront, but two years ago the credit unions offered the capital upfront to help solve the social housing crisis. Mr. Johnson or Mr. Farrell said that in response to the credit unions' suggestions on this, the Government said that it was only a medium-term priority. Is that really what it is saying? That is quite extraordinary. We are in an emergency situation which has been looming for two years around social housing. The credit unions offered the Government the capital on a plate. I do not know what the Government is saying. Could Mr. Farrell or Mr. Johnson elaborate on that? I am baffled that the Government considered it a medium-term issue. Could Mr. Farrell or Mr. Johnson enlighten me about what is wrong with the Government?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the social housing side of it, Mr. Johnson seems to be saying that the Government has not lived up to the deal. Is it correct that the restrictions on credit union investments are part of this inappropriate regulation that is blocking development?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Johnson have an explanation? The thing that seems to be thrown around is the management of risk, which baffles me somewhat. Obviously, risk has to be managed, but the record would imply that, in general, the credit union movement has managed the risk pretty well. It did not require big bailouts. Only a few credit unions got into trouble - one in particular - and a few others had some small problems. How is the Government or the Central Bank - whichever is making the calls on this - justifying the delay or the failure to respond the credit unions' requests?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One might suspect that the commercial banks would feel very threatened by the credit unions. I can see why. I hope that threat is realised because I trust the credit unions more with banking. Is that force at work? Are the banks frightened that if the credit unions expand their service offering it will seriously challenge the for-profit banking sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The credit unions have my support. Sadly, I did not get speaking time on tonight's motion, but I will certainly vote for it. I hope we can advance this struggle towards a successful conclusion. I am bemused by the social housing issue. I have made that point. I hope that can be advanced. On the issue of the debit card, will the witnesses elaborate on what obstacles have been put in their way? It is quite extraordinary that they are being blocked on that.
