RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is incredibly sharp practice on the part of the Government. It makes a mockery of any sort of proper oversight of legislation. We had a briefing on Monday from officials on these 48 pages of amendments. These are substantial amendments in the areas of planning that will affect the rights of people to access justice through judicial reviews and will affect what is, broadly, a good objective as regards short-term lettings but, as others have said, the objective and the actual translation into legislation may not be the same thing. Everything of that sort needs to be scrutinised properly. I had to ask for an explanatory memorandum at that briefing. As with all legislation, we get an explanatory memorandum to try to translate what is often and, in this case, is, quite dense legislative language into relatively plain English so we can understand what we are looking at and voting on. I received this explanatory memorandum on these 48 pages of last-minute amendments from the Government to a Bill that is being guillotined so in reality we will not have time to look at and scrutinise it properly at 8:58 a.m., two minutes before the debate started. That is just an absolute joke. It is the Government laughing at the Opposition, and showing utter contempt for the legislative process, democracy and the public. The amendments the Government is bringing forward are far outside the scope of the original Bill we started to deal with on Second Stage. If we tabled amendments that were anything even remotely similar in being outside the scope of a Bill, we would just be laughed out of court. They would be ruled out of order and would not be allowed. The Government, however, can do it by putting forward this motion, ramming it through and then guillotining the debate on the Bill later so we do not have proper time to scrutinise the amendments. The substantial amendments that are of particular concern relate to planning matters and the question of judicial reviews. These are important issues. I wonder about the timing of the amendments. I suspect they result from lobbying by the private offshore wind industry. That is what I think. It has lobbied the Government to do this and that is why it is being done. It is so that industry can get flexibility in planning applications for offshore industrial wind turbines. In essence, the amendments amount to, from the perspective of planning and the public, buying a pig in a poke because they will give the industry the flexibility to apply for one development, but for the development it actually develops to be a different development. That is what the flexibility amounts to. The height and design of the wind turbines can change. The Government will say there are safeguards and the industry has to show the different options and so on and so forth. All of that should be subject to serious scrutiny but in actuality we are dealing with a serious matter, namely, the ability of private developers because that is what we are talking about here - probably most particularly on these legacy projects or relevant projects as they are described - to be able to put in a planning application for offshore industrial wind turbines, where the public has to respond to a particular type of planning application. However, what is actually developed later may be something completely different and the ability of people to take judicial reviews against developments that are being applied for, which may affect them or the environment and so on, will then be limited. That is unacceptable. I am sure the Government does not give a hoot that we think it is unacceptable. There is laughing. That is what it does at this time of year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, but in a more broad sense the Government is laughing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is trying to make fools of people as it does every year at this time as we head towards the summer recess. It barrels through a deluge of legislation, and guillotines it to get through and smuggles in matters that, if they were scrutinised properly, could be of serious import and concern to people. We will not have the chance, and the public will have no chance whatsoever, to have any look-in on these issues or to express any opinion on them because they will be done and dusted before they get sight of them. That is pretty outrageous. For that reason, we have no choice but to vote against this motion. We will have two and a half hours to scrutinise these matters later, which include substitute consent issues, short-term lettings, judicial reviews and maritime area planning. There is no chance of any of that being scrutinised properly on Committee and Remaining Stages. It is pretty disgraceful, totally undemocratic and shows contempt for the public and this House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. The Title of the Bill should make clear what we are trying to achieve here. For the vast majority of people who are impacted by the current housing crisis, the need for a Bill that will reduce the extortionate, frankly obscene and completely unaffordable rent levels is more than patently obvious, and this Bill attempts to do that. It seeks to bring rents back to levels that will be affordable for ordinary working people because they have reached an utterly unaffordable level. The consequences of that are utterly disastrous for some, with record numbers of families, individuals and children forced into homelessness, overwhelmingly because they simply cannot find anywhere that is affordable within the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits if they are eligible for the HAP, and of course, huge numbers of people who desperately need help meeting the extortionate rents they are being charged are not even eligible. Because they have crept a few euro over the income eligibility threshold, they are not entitled to any support and are expected to pay rents that are off the Richter scale in terms of affordability for the vast majority. I refer not just to low-earning workers but even to people who earn pretty decent wages and salaries. That is what the Bill is trying to do. It is a matter of absolute urgency that something of this sort be done, and I will now set out the manner in which we will do it. We propose that a national rent authority be set up and that this authority ensure that landlords cannot charge more in rent than 25% of the median household income, whether the national or local median household income, whichever is the lower, given we do not want people in low-income areas to be charged rents based on incomes in high-income areas. The broad principle is that people will not spend more than 25% of their income on putting a roof over their head. We propose that any newly constructed house or apartment, once the Bill has passed, that is going to rented out will immediately be subject to this rent control and the landlord will not be able to charge more than the median household income, as set by the national rent authority. For rental property that already exists and that, almost invariably, costs considerably more than that, the landlord will have one year to bring the rent back to that level, after which all rental property will be subject to that rent control. We make an exemption for luxury properties because, frankly, we do not want to control the rents that are paid by the super-rich, where they might rent luxury penthouses. We have no particular interest in protecting them against those rents or ensuring they will pay rents that would be far lower than their income would allow. We are interested in protecting rents for ordinary people. The need for this is self-evident. Average national rents are now in excess of €1,500 a month. That means a person needs to earn about €17,000 a year just to pay rent, which is about 45% of the median income. They are the national rents; the picture gets far worse when we look at Dublin, where the average rent is now €2,000, or €24,000 in after-tax income required just to pay rent. More than 50% of the national median household income is what is being asked for. It gets even worse in my area, where in the past six months average rents were €2,600. That is absolutely obscene. This is totally unsustainable and we can see the consequences, with the homelessness figures rising week on week. Of course, the main feature of the surge in homelessness we are seeing at the moment, in almost all the cases I am dealing with, is that it is people who are working who are being made homeless. They are often two working people in one household and still they cannot afford the rents out there. In many cases, such people are not eligible for social housing support because the Government and previous Governments, for ten years, have refused to raise the income eligibility thresholds in what is clearly a deliberate strategy to make it look as though fewer people are in need of social housing support when, in fact, it is self-evident that more people than ever before need social housing support. The proportion of households that are entitled to social housing support, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, recently documented, has dropped dramatically. Whereas 47% of households ten years ago were eligible for social housing support, that figure had fallen to 33% by 2019, and while we do not have figures for what it is now, it is clearly well south of that. The number of people who are getting help is lower than ever before and is being reduced constantly in a stealth cut, whereas the need for that support is greater than ever and we are facing a dire situation for huge numbers of families. It is equally evident that this is a uniquely disastrous failure of the Government in this country. ICTU, in its recent publication on the social wage, showed that accommodation costs in this country are 78% higher than the EU average.While rents have gone up by about 13% across Europe over the last decade, here they have gone up by over 70%. In my area, they have gone up by over 100%. This is a unique failure of Irish Governments, way beyond the failure of governments in other countries.  When we raised this issue yesterday with the Taoiseach, he said the legislation would not fly, was "illiterate" and could not be done. Strangely enough, they do it elsewhere in Europe. Is it not very odd that they have succeeded elsewhere in preventing this kind of dire housing crisis and these extortionate, obscene increases in rent levels? It is not that rents have not gone up in Europe, but they have not gone up to anything like the levels they have reached here. That is because other countries have rent controls. In France, they have recently introduced further rent controls whereby if they see rent reaching levels beyond what is affordable for ordinary people, they cap them with maximum rents. In the Netherlands, where rents are too high there is a legal power to reclassify housing as social housing and charge social housing rents. Germany has a rent control regime in place whereby if rents in particular areas are way out of sync with other parts of the country, they can be controlled, capped and brought back down to reasonable levels. The United States has multiple forms of rent controls. The idea this cannot be done is not true. Are we open to amendments that would tweak how we do this? Of course we are, but we want to establish the urgent need and viability of introducing a regime that ensures people can afford the rents being charged. It is done elsewhere and can be done here. The reason the Government does not want to do it is the same reason we have a housing crisis in the first place. It is because its housing and rental policy is being dictated by propertied interests, including developers, speculators and investors, rather than by the needs of our people for secure, affordable rental accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not shouting; projecting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have an absolutely dire rental and housing crisis. For a Bill that we table to try to address these extortionate rents we get sent the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, electoral reform, local government and planning. The Minister with responsibility for housing does not even bother to come in. I find that really sickening. Yet again, I do not get an answer, although I am not surprised, on why the Government broke its promise to tell us what is happening with the review of the social housing income eligibility thresholds. We were promised they would be announced before the summer recess. The promise has been broken. Many people are suffering as a result. Rents have reached €2,000 and €2,200 a month in Dublin. This year, rents have increased by 10% in Dublin and Cork, 13% in Galway, 15% in Limerick, 16% in Waterford and 24% in Leitrim. Record numbers of families and homeless people are on the street. The Government will go off on its summer holidays while people are suffering misery. The Minister of State reeled off statistics. I will give him statistics. He mentioned Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. There are 4,000 households in need of permanent secure homes in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Over the next five years that are covered by the plan, another 2,825 will join the list. The Housing for All plan the Minister of State said will work will deliver 2,318 homes. There will be more people on the housing list in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown at the end of the plan than there are now. The situation now is that people on the housing list are waiting for 20 years. People cannot get a house from the council. The HAP rates are not high enough. In many cases, people cannot even get on housing list or become eligible for housing support. Amy, who has a family of three, was homeless once five years ago. She is overholding and will be evicted in the coming weeks. She will not go back into homeless accommodation.Shauna is over-holding on her lease, has three kids, serious mental health issues and nowhere to go. She is faced with homeless accommodation. Joanna, who has three children, is faced with eviction at the end of July and there is nothing within the HAP limits in the area. Maria actually works for a housing charity and faces eviction in October. She cannot find anywhere to rent. Karen faces eviction on 3 September. She has a child with a severe ASD diagnosis. Emily has one child and has been put into emergency accommodation in Dublin city centre. "D", whose full name I will not mention, is working, was previously homeless, is being evicted from a HAP tenancy, cannot find anywhere else and will be back into emergency accommodation. Another mother with two children was removed from the housing list because her mother works part time. She has gone over the limit by €400 and is entitled to absolutely nothing. Jason works for the council and lives in his car. Helen is sleeping rough in Glasthule. I could go on and on. There is nothing for them and the Minister cannot even bother to come in to address it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not. I have one minute and 30 seconds. The Government says it is not possible to anything about all of this and yet, Berlin did it. Berlin brought in rent-cap legislation in 2020 to do precisely what we are looking to do, which is not to allow rents go above levels that are affordable. It was brought in throughout Germany in 2020. In Paris, it was brought it in 2018. If there is a tense situation, we can introduce extraordinary rent controls, but the Government will not do it. We have declared an emergency, but the Government still will not do it. No matter how much human misery there is, the Government will not do it. It is not possible. Then, as Deputy Paul Murphy said, we hear the real reason. The landlords would not like it. They would flood out of the market. If the landlords cannot deliver rents that are affordable, they should not be landlords. If they exit the market, as Deputy Murphy said, they cannot take the houses and apartments with them. The local authorities should step in and buy them. One of the reasons we have the highest levels of rents is that we have the lowest levels of social housing. We have 9% social housing in Ireland, against 25% in Austria and 19% in Denmark. We would get a lot of extra social housing if all the landlords exited and the State just went in and bought the houses and charged affordable rents. There is no problem. In fact, it would bring down the excessive rents and house prices in the market. The Government does not want to do it because it is only representing the landlords and vulture funds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The St. Margaret's service in Blackrock, which caters for people with intellectual disabilities - people with very complex needs - and their families, has made an urgent request for the publication of the action plan for the disability capacity review. The review was published in July 2021. The Department of Health said the action plan would be completed by December 2021 and there is no sign of it. It is asking very particularly that this be done as a matter of urgency so the needs and the residential and home support places, both existing and new, will be catered for and provided for in budget 2023.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The action plan was due in December.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would have suspected what Deputy Murphy has outlined in any case, but it confirms something for me. One thing the US has done is try to secure access for US Palestinian citizens to the West Bank and Gaza, and vice versa, something that is made extremely difficult by the state of Israel. The Israelis want to be part of the US visa waivers scheme. In essence, there is a bit of a quid pro quo going on. Israelis are entitled to be part of a visa waivers scheme to enter the European Union but, simultaneously, they make it difficult for, or sometimes simply prohibit, people from the EU, including people from this country, going into Gaza and the West Bank. They make it extremely difficult for Irish Palestinian citizens to visit their families or vice versa. I had Palestinian guests from Gaza in the Gallery yesterday. They have family here and they told me about how extraordinarily difficulty it is to meet each other, whether for a family member going there or one of them coming here. Yet, we grant easy access for Israelis coming here. Should we not, at the very least, put some conditions on Israelis having free access to the EU while Palestinians and EU citizens, whether or not they are Palestinian citizens, are discriminated against when trying to enter the occupied territories?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a fact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did he organise the coups on his own?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Quite a few, I would say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach respond on the visas issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May we have a 30-second reply on the visa issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Dutch have rent controls that are not dissimilar to the ones we put forward, which the Taoiseach’s Government rejected. It was claimed that our proposals were "illiterate" and "unworkable". Perhaps the Taoiseach should have asked Mark Rutte about how the rent controls work in the Netherlands. That country has a points system for the quality and size of a property. The majority of properties below a certain standard are subject to maximum rent caps. This means that the Netherlands does not have the exponential rental crisis we have that is immiserating so many people. The Taoiseach should know that our housing costs are 78% higher than the EU average. Our rents have jumped by more than 70% in the last ten years, while rents in the rest of Europe have only increased by 13% on average. This has been the case because the Dutch, the Germans and the Austrians have rent controls, and we could go on through that list. Therefore, the next time the Taoiseach is chatting to the Dutch Prime Minister, he should ask him how the rent controls work in the Netherlands and perhaps consider introducing something similar here
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surely the Taoiseach does not believe they are working.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is much worse here though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are in a better situation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will not be surprised that I want to raise the housing element of the national reform programme. One of the issues that should now set alarm bells ringing is that the construction sector in this country is starting to contract. As inadequate a plan as Housing for All is, and it is wholly inadequate and does not address the crisis, even it may not now be delivered as we are starting to see a contraction in construction because of rising costs. How will the Government respond to that? We have a developed policy proposal because we cannot afford not to address the housing crisis and deliver on building the public, affordable and other houses that we need. If costs are going to stop the private sector from building, as is now becoming evident, we need a State construction company. We simply cannot not build public and affordable housing. We cannot allow a contraction of construction activity. The State will have to step in where the market in not capable of delivering. What does the Taoiseach say to that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We pay; they profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will not be implications for the oil companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the case for the food companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When I refer to murderous military aggression, illegal occupation, destruction of homes and key infrastructure, crimes against humanity and war crimes, what country am I talking about? Is it Palestine or Ukraine? Of course, the answer is that it is both. This Government is more than willing to do something to condemn and take actions to deal with illegal occupation, murderous unjustified military violence, destruction of infrastructure and homes and the killing of civilians when it comes to one of those places, but is willing to do absolutely nothing when it comes to them being done in another one of those places, namely, Palestine. I find that, frankly, nauseating. The latest example of it is a letter from a constituent I got. I will not identify the person. Her son was born in Ireland and is an Irish citizen, while his father is Palestinian. The child’s father cannot leave Palestine and be with the child’s mother and his son. The son has an Irish passport and was born in Ireland but also has Palestinian identity. When he goes to Israel, his Irish passport is not accepted. That is apartheid. He is an Irish EU citizen but Israel does not care. It held him and his mother, a mother of an Irish child with a Palestinian passport, for hours, subjecting both to humiliating interrogation and so on. Israel does not recognise the Irish passport of the child. When he reaches the age of 16, he will never be allowed to Jerusalem, where his family lives, and will not be allowed into Ben Gurion Airport or to travel anywhere outside specified areas in the West Bank. That child’s cousin who lives in Jerusalem was recently picked up by the Israelis on Israeli nationalist flag day on Jaffa Street, where and a dozen other children were just gathering on the street and doing nothing. He was arrested and taken to the police station where he was blindfolded and his hands and feet bound tightly with metal cuffs. He was then brought to an area of the station with no cameras and beaten all over his body by six heavily armed soldiers. They beat him with their fists and M16 rifles on his hand and back in an area where there were no cameras, knowing that he could not defend himself. After that, he was put in a windowless cell for six days, where he was not allowed to contact his parents or a lawyer. His mother had no idea where he was. He asked for a blanket because he was so cold but he was denied it. Another child prisoner from Nablus lent him one to keep him warm. On the last day, he was due to attend court and the television was turned on in his cell. On it were videos and images of other Palestinian detainees screaming and being tortured. This was a deliberate psychological tactic to traumatise the young men. He was then taken to court. When he looked at his parents who were in the court he was beaten again for doing so. I could go on but I do not have time. The father of the Irish-born EU citizen is also Palestinian.This is what happened to him when he was arrested and interrogated by the police when he was 16 years old:The interrogation was one of the most difficult times in my life. The Israeli interrogators tortured me and it affected my education because it affected my mind and my psychological state. It was a really bad time. I was tied to a small chair. I fainted ... they put their fingers on my neck as if to strangle me. I think they studied [the art of] how to hurt someone until they [thought they] are almost going to die. They hit me in my private area with their legs and batons. They did it slowly and then finished with a big kick. [...] They put pencils between my fingers and squeezed them tight. They threatened to rape my Mom and sister.I could go on. That is how the father of a Palestinian-Irish boy who is an Irish citizen and was born in Ireland was treated. That is how his nephew was treated. All those Israelis can come here without a visa but Palestinian families cannot even meet their own family members and this is what they have to put up with. There are 1,200 children in Israeli prisons but the Government does nothing. How are we honestly expected to believe that the Government or the European Union really care about brutal and unjustified aggression against innocent people when they allow this to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My questions follow on from what I said earlier. How is it acceptable that people with Irish passports, who are Irish citizens and who seek to enter Palestine or Israel, do not have those passports recognised by the Israeli authorities because they also have Palestinian family connections? That is apartheid. Let us be clear: it is racism that is informing that policy. It is a clear apartheid, racist policy, not just directed against Palestinians within occupied Palestine, but directed now against Irish citizens. They get privileged access and a waiver, and they do not require a visa coming into this country, and we allow that to happen. How can that happen when they treat Irish citizens like that going into Palestine? Second, are war crimes and crimes against humanity somehow less requiring of accountability if they happen in Europe rather than in Palestine or Yemen? That would seem to be the inevitable conclusion one draws from the Minister of State's attitude.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Crimes against humanity committed against Israel are war crimes documented over long periods, with no accountability and no sanctions, yet there are immediate demands from the Government and Europe for accountability and sanctions when it comes to Russia's horrible crimes against humanity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not. It should be one state.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A mountain fell down because all the trees on the top of it were cut down and a wind farm was built. This had devastating consequences for a community. If we do not get this stuff right, it has very serious consequences. A huge number of fines were then levied on this country for years. We are now planning major industrial development in our marine area. We have a Government that is giving a special pass, as I see it, to a number of legacy projects that will see massive industrial development all around the near coastal area along the entire east coast and much of the rest of the country. By any stretch it will have a big impact on people, fishers and the marine environment. God knows what it could do to the marine environment. If these things can make mountains fall down, they can also do a lot of damage to marine life and the marine environment if we do not get them right. We have a Government that has given a special pass to these legacy projects. They are all projects of private corporations. They are not projects of the State but of private corporations interested in making money from our marine when we have the lowest number of marine protected areas anywhere in Europe. This itself is a sign of the lack of commitment in the State to protecting our marine environment. Now the Government has come along with a Bill that is supposed to deal with the issues of substitute consent that arose out of Derrybrien. It introduced a Bill on this issue, which is very serious in and of itself, and then, at the last minute in the last week of the Dáil session when a deluge of legislation is being piled through and guillotined, we get dozens of pages of amendments that introduce wholly new issues. These new amendments impact on matters such as the plans for industrial development of the marine and large-scale residential developments, which I did not mention on the previous occasion. Let us consider what a shambles strategic housing developments were. Of course, they were not a shambles for the private developers and the investment funds based in Guernsey and the Virgin Islands making a fortune. They were a shambles from a planning point of view and for the communities they impacted. They have done nothing but worsen the housing situation. We have major amendments that will in the case of large-scale residential developments allow developers to have flexible planning applications. Is the Minister of State serious? What is the basis for this? After the mess that was made of the strategic housing developments, there will be flexible applications for the replacement of such developments. This has serious implications for public participation, the Aarhus Convention and the credibility of the entire planning process. The Minister of State has come in here very feisty I must admit and fair play to him. He was obviously told to come in fighting. He is saying the amendments are technical. There is nothing technical about it. We have a new type of planning application for something that is very controversial, to put it mildly, as a replacement for strategic housing developments and developers can ask for a flexible application in which they do not have to give all of the details of what they will build. Immediately alarm bells start ringing when the Government comes in and says this is technical when it is self-evidently not technical. It is very substantial. The massive industrialisation of our marine environment is not technical. We all want offshore wind and renewable energy but we are deeply concerned that we have not protected as we should have the areas where this industrialised development should not take place. The Government wants flexible applications where circumstances could dramatically change. These changes could have a very serious impact on our marine environment. In case anybody says that even raising these points means we are not serious about the environment let us remember the biggest carbon sink on the planet is the sea and what lives in the sea. If we mess up the sea and marine biology in the name of addressing climate change, we will potentially do the opposite and do more damage to the climate and to biodiversity. These are not small issues; these are very serious issues. Even with regard to the measures that we like, such as those relating to short-term lets, we wonder why they are being introduced for only six months. We need to have serious scrutiny of these matters. What sort of enforcement will there be? Does it mean anything if there will not be enforcement? All of this needs to be scrutinised. None of it will be scrutinised because of the guillotine and the fact the amendments have been introduced at the last minute. The briefing we got the other day was not a place to argue. We were trying to get our heads around the massive number of amendments. Something I asked for, as Deputy Matthews knows, is whether we could please have an explanatory memorandum to explain what the hell is in these amendments. It was not available at the time. Because we asked for it, it was eventually produced at 8.58 this morning. That is when we received it. Now we are dealing with all of these amendments and the Bill is being guillotined. If this is not a disgrace in terms of legislation I do not know what is. Please do not tell us it is technical. Do not try to fool the public, the media or whoever it is the Minister of State is trying to fool by saying such things. This is sharp practice and there is no question about it. It is sharp practice with things that have very serious implications for our environment and the public.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It fell down is what I said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I said it fell down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State would go a long way to convince us that is true if, in the same way he withdrew amendment No. 25, he would withdraw amendments Nos. 12, 13, 40, 41, 42 and 47. Maybe he could let us know if he is serious about that and save us the bother of having a needless debate because otherwise this is going to be guillotined through. We are not going to reach most of the amendments. I do not know what he means when he says he is open to co-operation because whatever is said here is going to make absolutely no difference because, at whatever time, all the Minister of State's amendments will just be through and that will be the law. I am not sure what the Minister of State means when he says he is interested in co-operating.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is one of these substantial last-minute amendments the Government has brought in, the purpose of which we agree with. As well as some of the questions I have already heard asked, as I alluded to in my opening contribution, I want to understand clearly what is being done here. It is not legal to offer for short-term let properties that do not have the planning permission to do so or the exemption that would allow them to do so . It is against the law but companies are doing it. We are now bringing in an amendment which will prohibit and then penalise platforms or owners who advertise properties that do not have permission or who cannot show they have the permission, but we will only do so for a period of six months. I do not understand that. Maybe I am missing something. If the Minister of State can explain it, that is fine. If it is illegal and they should not be doing it, why would the prohibition on it be only for six months? I do not understand that. Surely if they do not have the permission and they do not have the exemption, they should not be doing it and any penalties that apply to the owner or the platform advertising should apply because they are not complying with the law. Why would there be a six-month limit? Maybe I am missing something. If that can be explained to me, I would be glad. That seems a little strange.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want my question to be absolutely clear. I think it is a similar question to Deputy Ó Broin’s, although the Minister of State is not quite getting it. As I read it, for the next six months, if someone advertises a short-term residential tenancy for which they do not have permission for a change of use or an exemption, they will be breaking the law and they will be fined and, potentially, imprisoned. However, in six months' time, unless the Minister renews it, they can advertise a tenancy for which they do not have permission and which is in breach of the law, and they will not be subject to a fine or imprisonment. I do not understand that. If someone should not be doing short-term lets because they have not got permission to do them, then why would there be a six-month expiry date on the penalties for advertising that? Unless I am missing something, this is an example of what happens when there is rushed legislation. It does not make any sense. There should be no expiry date on that. How, under any circumstances, could it be right for Airbnb to advertise at any time, anywhere, short-term lets for a property that does not have the permission for short-term lets?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A resolution of the European Parliament was sent to me which was agreed on 1 June 2021. It relates to the impact of offshore renewable energy on fishers and the marine environment. This resolution was adopted and recommended by the rapporteur. To cut a long story short, what it basically states is, notwithstanding the commitment of the European Union to develop its offshore renewable resources, it should not do so in such a way that would displace fishers or do things that could potentially damage the marine environment. It says that the precautionary principle should apply. In other words, where we are not sure what the impact might be, the precautionary principle should apply. This is right. The commitment to developing our offshore renewable resources is clear in this resolution, as well as the priority and urgency of doing this, but it is equally clear in stipulating that doing so should not damage communities with a close connection to an area, where social or economic activities could be potentially damaged by a specific type of development. The resolution cites things such as the reef effect that can sometimes accompany the establishment of these offshore wind farms. There is potential in this regard for a reef effect. In other words, reefs are created as a result of putting these things in place. This can have significant and far-reaching impacts on marine life, on fish and so on, and consequently on those who make their livelihoods from fishing. Reference is also specifically made to the electromagnetic impact of cables, even cables buried underground, and how those cables can then impact on marine life. The whole predication of this amendment is that developers can come along and say they are going to put forward a planning application, but that certain details of that planning application cannot be provided when the application is submitted and that what may eventually be developed may be different from what was applied for. The grounds given for this provision is the rapid advance of technology. When we consider the issues at stake here, however, that makes us even more worried. Pile driving is another process mentioned in respect of its potential impact on a specific marine environment. Regarding the rapid advance of technology, we have already established that it is precisely the advance of those types of technologies that could have all sorts of spin-off consequences in terms of their impact on marine life. Of course, the new technologies may have different effects from the old technologies. The new technologies may have more impact in respect of what type of pile driving is undertaken, for example, and the technology used to undertake that operation. Such new technologies may also create reefs or damage fish, in respect of the routes fish take and whether they will continue to inhabit a particular area. In fact, when I talk to the fishers in the areas where many of these legacy and relevant projects are sited near the coastal area off the east coast, some of which will be as close as 8 km and 10 km, in places like the Kish Bank, the Codling Bank, and so on, which are spawning grounds for fish etc., those people are convinced, and this point is alluded to in the European Parliament resolution, that this type of activity is not compatible with the continuation of fishing in those areas at all and that they will be gone from those areas, which are their traditional fishing grounds. That is bad enough as it is. If applications are openended, however, regarding what technologies may be used for the construction of these projects or the types of cables that can be used, for example, and their potential impact on marine environments and fish, and all the rest of it, the idea that such applications could be openended based on new technology is more worrying. Therefore, I am not convinced that this is necessary or justified. I am most certainly not convinced that there is any justification for it in respect of large-scale residential development on land. I do not see the need for that at all. That has definitely been lobbied for by someone.  I repeat what I said earlier about SHDs and the shambles they turned out to be. That SHD legislation was written by the developers. I have strong suspicions regarding this openended type of planning application, which can change further down the line, and therefore bypass potentially the proper stakeholder consultations, public participation and EIAs in respect of LRDs. I just do not see the justification for that.I would like the Minister of State to explain the circumstances in which a developer might put in an application for an LRD without giving all the details of that development, only for things to change further down the line. I do not see the justification for that and, arguably, it breaches the environmental impact assessment directive and so on. It is similarly very concerning in terms of offshore developments. An Taisce, which went to the trouble of writing to us this morning, is pretty clear in its view that this raises serious concerns around the environmental impact assessment and habitats directives, public participation etc. There are simpler, more legally compliant and more effective ways to address these challenges without creating the legal and procedural problems associated with the proposed approach. We need to discuss that, but we are not really going to because it will be a short-circuited discussion and the Bill will be rammed through. At whose behest and as a result of whose lobbying will this happen? Somebody requested that this be included and the Government has bowed to that lobbying. We do not know who the lobbyists are but it does not take much to guess that they are on-land and offshore developers. I am deeply opposed to these amendments. They should, at the very least, be scrutinised seriously or withdrawn from the Bill. It is more sharp practice with potentially very damaging environmental, social, economic and cultural implications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Minister of State gives us those assurances, it is apparent he has been given them by someone else. While I do not doubt that he is honestly relaying what he has been told, it does not satisfy me that we are having a fully rounded and well-interrogated scrutiny of these amendments that relate to large-scale residential developments and large-scale industrial infrastructure that will fill the near-coastal area all around our coast with industrial developments. We are talking about large-scale, massive industrial development. We are allowing these developments flexibility. This is where proper scrutiny is required. I would not be satisfied unless I hear from all the stakeholders on this. It is fine to hear from Government officials, who have their view. I do not know where they are getting their advice from, be it from the Attorney General or whoever, but I want to hear from all the stakeholders who have a stake in this so that we can make an informed decision about whether what the Minister of State just said is true and that there is really nothing to see here.I am not convinced that that is the case, even more so because of my deep anxiety about the site selection process for these big industrial offshore "relevant projects" that got special designation in the marine planning Act, whereby developers chose their own sites. That is what happened. They decided where they wanted to build. Even on land developers do not have that, but now, for some of the biggest industrialised development we have ever seen in the marine area, the developers have decided the sites in advance of any plan or any proper designation of marine protected areas. Then there are little bits like this about what has to be provided when looking for this flexible application, namely, "such other information, drawings or representations as the prospective applicant may wish to provide or make available". I repeat, "may wish to". Surely the onus should not be on the developer to decide what he feels like putting forward in his application. He might wish to give us some details in the application or he might wish not to do so. This is so wide open to abuse it is beyond belief. Developers could hold back stuff. They could say they want flexibility when actually they plan to do something different from the outset from what they have put in the application. Let us be honest that this is open to abuse and open to developers to say, "This is how we get the application through, and afterwards we can disclose the truth about what is actually in the application and what we are really planning." We certainly have not had the opportunity to scrutinise this legislation to ensure that this is not the case and that we have safeguards against that. We have not heard from the experts who could really tell us whether this open to abuse. This just is not on. It is not on to do this in the manner in which the Government has done so with the time available to scrutinise the Bill. The letter from An Taisce says it all and is directed very strongly at the Green Party, quite rightly. I am pretty surprised the Green Party are going along with this.
