RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am party to a detailed submission on this. I am involved in the Save Our Seafront group and we raised a number of concerns about the Bill. I have also raised the issue of the Providence Resources oil rig application on the foreshore off Dublin Bay at the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and I was referred back to this committee for discussion. I am, therefore, representing that committee's desire to discuss the issue as well. There could not be more important legislation than this because we are an island nation. We have probably the highest ratio of coastal zone to land mass in Europe. At every level - cultural, environmental, economic, historic and so on - this is important. We all agree that the 1933 Act governing this area is inadequate and, therefore, the legislation needs to be streamlined and modernised. The current legislation is unacceptable because all the power is in the hands of the Department. Officials can sit on an application for as long as they like - six days, six months or six years - before making a decision on whether something can go ahead on the foreshore. That is unacceptable. There is no appeals process and we are dealing with sensitive and serious projects, particularly those relating to wind energy, oil rigs and so on. Does streamlining mean making it easier for oil and energy companies to get big projects onto the foreshore and to get around environment impact statements and proper public consultation, as demanded by the Aarhus Convention, or will it result in a robust system of public consultation and protection? I worry that it will be former, not the latter, because of the three commitments in the programme for Government, which refer to streamlining, efficient foreshore licensing and getting resources onshore from offshore. There is no mention of the environment at all. Providence Resources had to withdraw its application to build an oil rig at a location unprecedentedly close to the foreshore because it was running seriously foul of European requirements for proper environmental impact assessment and there were major problems because of the negligible public consultation. The company placed one advertisement in one newspaper and a few signs in a number of Garda stations, which was a joke. All that was left at the whim of the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a detailed question. Providence Resources has a licensing option to explore further out from the shore but it was required specifically to make an application to put an oil rig on the foreshore. If the legislation is passed, will the company get around the requirement to conduct an environmental impact assessment relating to the oil rig because it has the licensing option for the entire area? Once one gets a licensing option and a general okay regarding the environmental impact assessment, then anything built relating to the project does not require a more specific assessment. Will Ms Kelly comment on the public consultation aspect of this? There should be a normal planning process initially, an appeal process relating to the overall coastal zone and finally a proper appeals process governing everything.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Ms Kelly speak about the public consultation and appeal elements and specific protections for the foreshore as distinct from areas further out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask a quick question. I must run somewhere for a few minutes at 2 p.m. How long will the opening statements last?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Great. Thanks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentation and I wholeheartedly agree with the closing sentiment that we need development in the marine area that is sustainable. What is the witness's view on whether this Bill ensures the sustainability aspect in the full sense of the word? This follows on from the questions I asked the people from An Bord Pleanála. Does the witness have any concern in this regard? I should qualify everything I say by indicating that replacing the 1933 Act is a good move, as is moving the process out of what is essentially ministerial diktat into a proper planning process people can understand as transparent. Have we got all the environmental protections and an open system where people can be consulted and participate in decisions that will affect local communities, stakeholder groups and people with an interest in the marine area? The witness has raised some concerns and I have taken note of them. Following my earlier point, is there a lack of specific protection for the foreshore because of the creation of one zone being spoken about with this proposed legislation, if I understand it correctly? It is said that this is to avoid unnecessary duplication but I am concerned that this could mean the particular need to protect the foreshore area, which is more sensitive in many ways, could face a potential problem. What is Mr. Gault's opinion? Streamlining can work both ways. If I understand the proposed legislation correctly, local authorities are out of the picture for anything outside the low and high water mark, and responsibility goes to An Bord Pleanála. I am concerned about that, as the potential democratic input at a local level could be reduced. I want to strengthen rather than weaken the capacity of local communities to have a say in matters that affect them. I understand there are issues beyond the local, of which we must certainly be cognisant. I wonder if we would be better to have a three-phase process. In Dún Laoghaire, for example, the council wants to build a small jetty at the Dún Laoghaire baths, which is fine. That could be dealt with at a local level, although I am unsure as to whether it would come in under the high and low water mark. It probably would. Could this be deemed part of the foreshore and be the responsibility of somebody else? It seems there is a major difference between a small jetty and an oil rig, as one has massive implications not just for local communities but also wider coastal zone management. A small jetty from which people can swim does not really have a major implication. What is Mr. Gault's opinion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the witness concerned about that? For example, in Norway there is a specific greater level of protection for the foreshore area, covering 22 km. That country views the foreshore as requiring greater and more robust protection than what is further out. I have a concern, which seems to be reinforced by the witnesses, that the specific protection for the foreshore is not included in this Bill, which could be problematic in cases involving oil rigs on the foreshore, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I heard them correctly, the witnesses are somewhat concerned by the vagueness or lack of clarity around public consultation and the lack of an appeal.
