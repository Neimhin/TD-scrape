RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public sector recruitment embargo started by the last Government and continued by the Minister's has led to an enormous reduction in staff numbers in key areas of public service, in particular in the health service and in local authorities. The Minister's slogan originally was, "We'll get more for less". I put it to him that when one looks at the chronic staff shortages in the health service, leading to serious risks to patient safety in our hospitals and to tens of thousands of children on waiting lists for speech and language assessments, and when one looks at the disastrous housing crisis with which local authorities are unable to deal, we have to now consider lifting the public sector recruitment embargo and getting staff into key areas like housing departments, housing maintenance sections and hospitals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the cruel, cold logic of cutbacks but the reality is that in December of last year 32,000 children were waiting for speech and language assessments, many of them for more than a year, and 16,000 children were waiting for therapy. The INMO says that in hospitals we need one staff member for four patients, whereas currently we have one per eight during the day and one per 12 during the night. We have three times less staff than we need to keep patients safe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In local authorities, people with chronic disabilities, heart conditions and other vulnerable people are being told they have to wait a year or two to get a grab rail in order that they can get up the stairs to have a bath. That is absolutely unacceptable, yet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned three new spin doctors at the beginning of this year. It was considered vital to have PR advisers but-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am fully in favour of cutting the pay of people at the top of the public service and politicians, and reducing the number of bureaucrats at the top of the system, but I am absolutely against having levels of staff shortages among nurses that endanger patient safety, that we do not have enough people to carry out assessments on vulnerable children with special needs or that we do not have maintenance people in local authorities who can put in grab rails or carry out renovations on houses of elderly, sick and vulnerable people. That is not acceptable. Cutting the numbers to the level that has taken place means public services are grinding to a halt and vulnerable people depending on those services are being made suffer cruelly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Minister going to do about that?
