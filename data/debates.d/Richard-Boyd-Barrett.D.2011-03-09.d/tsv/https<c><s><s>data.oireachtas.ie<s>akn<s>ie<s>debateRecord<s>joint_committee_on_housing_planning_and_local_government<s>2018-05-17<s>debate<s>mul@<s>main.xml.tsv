RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bureaucratic manipulation of figures to meet targets is a feature of Stalinist dictatorships and tin-pot regimes. That is what we saw with the re-categorisation of figures in March and we should desist from trying to meet targets through such manipulations. That also matters for the Opposition. I am fed up hearing that we have to get everybody out of hotels. I am aware of families that I would like to get into hotels because there are no hubs or council houses available. That is another target we want to meet or not meet. I am glad to hear the Minister say there is nobody who does not have a place because I am dealing with two families. A woman with three children, including an infant, is wandering around the streets of Dún Laoghaire as we speak. She has been told there are no hotels available and there are no hubs. If there is a place for everybody, please offer her a place and please do not offer her a place infested with drug users and people with alcohol or other problems. I ask the Minister about another family I am dealing with who have six children. To give the background, they have been on the housing list for 15 years. I hear people rightly being critical of being eight years on the housing list but this family have been on the housing list for 15 years. They have been in 15 different precarious types of accommodation, including HAP so-called social housing, in the past 15 years. They were pushed out of the Clayton Hotel where they had been staying since March because it is filling up for the summer, as are many of the hotels. Last night, the family was split into three different components because there was nowhere to go, and they do not know where they are going tonight either. I hope the Minister can help them as he has said on the record here that there is a place for everybody. I will expect those two cases to be resolved this evening. Other forms of manipulation of figures include knocking people off housing lists because their income is slightly over the threshold even though there is absolutely no accommodation for them. I told the Minister of State, Deputy English, in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago about three cases I am dealing with where people got a little bonus on their salary, who did a little extra overtime or whose income very marginally went over the €35,000 threshold. They have been taken off the list, in some cases having been on it for ten or 15 years. That is manipulation of the figures because there is no solution. If there was an actual functioning affordable housing scheme for those who were thrown off lists I would say, "Yes, maybe" but that should not be allowed. Those people should be put back on the list immediately until there is something else available. I would like a response to that because at the moment there is nothing for that group of people and it is wrong to throw them off the list. On the emergency aspect, I want to make a serious proposal. With the hotels filling up for the summer we are in a dire situation. There are no hotels available in many cases, particularly at the weekends. We need immediate action on that. I have two proposals. First, we need extra staff and resources provided in each local authority whose job is to spend the entire day phoning around for accommodation. Families who are dragging around three, five or six children should not be expected to spend half the day on the phone trying to find accommodation that does not exist. I propose we have properly resourced teams who will get on the phone the moment those people present and find them somewhere to stay. Second, we need teams of people who will walk around the towns in the affected areas physically looking at every empty property and approaching the property owner and saying, "What is happening with that property?". I can tell the Minister that in my area now there are at least 30 units sitting empty that I can name and provide him with the addresses. In fact, there are over 30. There are 25 in Robin Hill, which I have mentioned in the Dáil several times. The Robin Hill apartments are in the hands of Cerberus. They have been sitting empty for about three or four years. I am sick to my back teeth with this because that could solve some of the emergency cases. They were sold to Cerberus by NAMA and it is just sitting on them. Similarly, St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire is owned by Apollo Global Management, another vulture fund. It is de-tenanting the complex. There are four or five empty units there at the moment. The Minister should give the local authority the power to go down there and say, "What are you doing with those units? We are taking those units". I do not care what has to be done. Whatever powers or emergency legislation is necessary to empower the local authorities to make those units available for people should be put in place. Lastly, for six or seven years I have been campaigning to get council houses built on the Shanganagh site and this game of ping-pong is still going on between the Department and the council. We hear that it is up to the council to come up with a plan and the council says it cannot get the funding from the Department. It is just ping-pong and nothing happens. People from the Minister's Department who are empowered to make decisions should meet the Deputies, councillors and those officials in the council who can actually make decisions. They could sit down for two, three or four hours or whatever is necessary to identify the blockages to getting that site moving. I personally believe the blockage is the Minister's insistence on having the private sector in some way involved. If I am wrong, let us find out with a proper sit-down instead of the ping-pong that has been going on for years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is always against Stalin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are Trotskyites, yes. We are against Stalin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He got an ice pick in the head for his opposition to Stalin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not like bureaucratic manipulation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will take a house.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is spurious. Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister get somewhere for these people tonight?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I echo the call made by the previous speaker. I also raised that issue a couple of weeks ago and I really think the Minister has to take that action. It is not right to pretend that HAP is a permanent housing solution when it is not. Some people are satisfied with HAP. If they are happy to be off the list, that is fair enough. However, it is not right to take people off the housing waiting list compulsorily when they have been on it for ten or 15 years and to put them into what are, in many cases, precarious situations. In some cases people have been through two or three accommodations under RAS and HAP. They have been in and out and in and out. To lose their place on the list is just not acceptable. Quite frankly, it is another form of manipulation of the figures. I ask the Minister to take the action Deputy Barry has suggested. On the cases I mentioned to the Minister, I will pass on the individuals' details. I thank Ms Hurley, who is beside the Minister, for contacting me. I will pass on the details of those cases. I reiterate, and ask for a response on, the issue of increasing the number of proactive outreach teams to go out and physically find empty properties. I could walk the Minister around Dún Laoghaire and point him to empty buildings. If we could get those buildings into use we would make a big difference. There is no reason we could not do that if the staff and resources were provided for local authorities. We could start going around and checking everything that is available. Teams could be physically walking around and looking at the empty properties. There could be a line which people could call if they see such properties. I am sure everybody here gets calls asking why certain properties are sitting empty. We could find and identify these things. We should then proactively approach the owners and find out what is going on. We should see whether we can get them into use. Some we could get into use just by doing that, in other cases we may need new legislation on compulsorily purchase or other measures. Whatever we need to do, we need to get those properties in use. I would like a response on that. On the local issue of the Shanganagh development and without pointing fingers, in my opinion there is politics going on which is slowing this down. I ask that we move beyond the politics. The way to stop the ping-pong between Departments and the councils - with political parties in between - is to get the representatives from all the parties on the council, local Deputies and the officials from the Minister's Department and those from the local authority who actually make the decisions together in a room and go through the issues and blockages that need to be overcome in order to get work on that site moving. We need to know where the problem lies. Everybody is blaming everybody else. That could be resolved if we could get people together in the room. Indeed, Senators could also be involved. One of them is present at this meeting. There is no doubt, and no room for politicking, about it: we have to get straight answers from all concerned as to what is going on, what the problems are and how we can overcome them. That is a direct appeal. We could do that. I would not mind it if also on the agenda for that meeting was the issue of affordable housing, what affordability will actually mean in our area and how we are going to deliver affordable housing. I do not really see how we are going to deliver affordable housing because of the way the market is at present. We are supposed to be having it in Cherrywood and possibly in Shanganagh but there are real questions about how that is actually going to happen. I am making a serious solution-oriented appeal not to be politicking with the issue but to actually go through the nuts and bolts of how we can make that happen.
