RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate lone parent groups, particularly SPARK, on forcing the Minister to back down on the disgraceful proposal to cut lone parent payments once the youngest child reaches the age of seven years, proving once again the effectiveness of protest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise another issue with the Tánaiste.  Will he explain how in 1995, when he produced this leaflet in the Dún Laoghaire constituency, and the mid-1980s, when he supported a boycott of water charges, he argued water charges were just another tax on workers?  In the same leaflet he also opposed the introduction of a residential property tax.  Will he explain how he is now planning to impose water charges on working people and the least well-off in our society?Given the shocking fact that 700,000 people in this country are living in poverty, including 200,000 children - this refutes the Tánaiste claim that he protected the less well-off in the budget - and that almost half of households have a disposable income of less than €100 at the end of the month, will he dissociate himself from the Taoiseach's comments yesterday when he refused to rule out the possibility that water supplies will be cut off, the most basic necessity for human life, to people who would not be able to pay-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----at a time when so many are living in poverty as a result of the austerity being imposed on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Government not being entirely dishonest or ignorant-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I fully expected it.  Is the Government not being-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle quell the mob?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make a few placards for him which he can bring with him when he next comes in for Leaders' Questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Government not being entirely dishonest or ignorant in its assertion that water metering and charges will not lead to the privatisation of water services when the EU treaties which the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil supported and for which they advocated a "Yes" vote make it absolutely clear - I refer to Articles 106 and 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - that once charges are introduced for a service and it becomes revenue producing, all EU laws on competition and state aid apply to that service-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----leading inevitably to the deregulation of those markets and the privatisation of services?  That is the reality.  Once charges are introduced, privatisation follows.  It is a requirement of EU law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Tánaiste be honest with the people that following the introduction of water charges, the Government is planning the privatisation of water services?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree entirely with the Tánaiste that the real issue is the decrepit nature of our water infrastructure and the need to repair and rehabilitate it, but unless water meters have developed new capacities that I do not fully understand-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----how will the installation of water meters result in the decontamination or rehabilitation of the decrepit waterpipe infrastructure?  Water meters do not have that effect.  They have one effect only, that is, to allow the Government to charge for the provision of water.Why is the Government going to waste a year and a half installing water meters instead of putting thousands of people to work on rehabilitating the water infrastructure?I would like to correct the Tánaiste on privatisation.  Article 106 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: "Services of a general economic interest, or having the character of a revenue producing monopoly [which is what the new semi-State will be] shall be subject to the rules contained in the treaties, in particular to the rules on competition."  It is as clear as day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Private companies will be able to take the Government to court if it does not allow for open, private competition in the area of water services if it becomes a revenue producing service.  The only way to prevent the privatisation of water is not to charge for it and to fund the rehabilitation of our public services through progressive taxation on wealth and income.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As jovial as those on the Government benches are, it is a serious issue that requires a debate if this House is to make any claim to represent the concerns of citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The possible introduction of water charges is literally striking fear into the hearts of the elderly and vulnerable sectors of our society, with the prospect of up to €600 in property taxes at the beginning of the next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the very least, the people of this country are entitled to see a full, detailed debate take place on these issues and to have the Government clearly set out its intent-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to give them some type of reassurance.  Do we want a situation where pensioners and vulnerable sectors of our society will be afraid to turn on the taps-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or to run a bath for fear of running up a bill they cannot afford?  Give some consideration to people who are fearful and struggling to make ends meet by arranging for a proper debate in the House on this issue in the next few days.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Tánaiste's expression of concern at the disturbing events surrounding the eviction from their home in Killiney of Mr. Brendan Kelly and his wife.  Mr. Kelly has been in contact with me and I am sure he would he glad to hear from the Tánaiste and from any other local public representative about his plight.  As Deputy McDonald said, this speaks to a much wider issue.  Many situations like this occur that we do not hear about and which are not filmed.I add my voice to the urgency of bringing forward personal insolvency legislation.  Is there nothing the Government can do to put a freeze on evictions and repossessions, pending the enactment of legislation surrounding these matters?  Scenes of this sort are reminiscent of the mid-19th century and must be stopped.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find it utterly incredible that anyone could have suggested - as have a number of Deputies - that this Bill is premature.  It appears incredible that 20 years have passed since the X case.  I first became active in politics about that issue around that time and my views on the issue were not then formed.  I did not really know what I thought but when the X case emerged, my views became very clear.  This was because the X case demonstrated the utterly inhuman situation that pertained in this State, whereby a 14-year old girl who had suffered the heinous crime of rape could be criminalised for seeking to terminate that pregnancy.  Moreover, at a time when her mental health meant there was a real and substantial threat of suicide, the State sought to criminalise her and her family for seeking to terminate the pregnancy.  All the abstract and moralistic discussions surrounding this issue were cleared away and the human reality of crisis pregnancy, particularly in cases in which there was a threat to a woman's life - in this case a teenage girl's life - made it clear for people in this country that at the very least, which is all this Bill proposes, in the case of a threat to a woman's life, she should be given the right to make that decision herself and this State should support her and provide for her in making that decision.  Could anything be simpler or more straightforward than that in the case of a threat to a woman's life, her decision and her right to choose should be upheld?  It is simply extraordinary that in the 20 years since that decision was confirmed in referendum by the people, Governments have been too cowardly to implement the will of the people and to introduce some degree of humanity when it comes to a threat to a woman's life when faced with a crisis pregnancy.I pay tribute to Deputies Clare Daly, Joan Collins and Mick Wallace and all the other activists who worked on putting together the Bill.  I also pay tribute to the four women who came to Leinster House yesterday to highlight the tragic human reality of what it is like to become pregnant and discover that the foetus has an abnormality which is incompatible with life.  This is a terrible and tragic situation for parents to find themselves in and I have personal experience of it because my former partner and I had a daughter who was born with a genetic abnormality which was incompatible with life.  The type of situation to which I refer is an awful one for anybody to experience.  In such a situation who, other than the mother, has the right to make the choice about what should be done?  Who else would claim that right?  People state they have their own views on this matter and they are welcome to them, but how could we do other than give to women who find themselves in the type of situation to which I refer the right to make decisions on their own behalf?  To do anything else would be inhuman.  That to which I refer is all that is being requested in the Bill.Women are being forced to travel overseas at huge cost and to the massive detriment of their psychological and physical health and well-being to access the relevant services.  Some women who are suffering from cancer and other life-threatening diseases are being obliged to travel by boat to alien places with which they are not familiar and in which they have no access to support.  The financial cost involved for them is huge.  What is being done is absolutely inhuman.Many Labour Party Deputies built their political careers on championing the right to choose.  They also spent many years demanding that legislation be introduced to deal with the judgment handed down in the X case.  However, they are now playing politics with this issue and kicking the can down the road such that thousands more women who will find themselves in the terrible and tragic circumstances to which I refer will be obliged to sneak off in the dead of night and travel across the sea.  It is not easy for women to cope with situations of this kind and it is not right that they are being denied support for their choices by the authorities in the State.I appeal to those in the Labour Party not to play politics with the legislation or make excuses about its proceeding further.  If they agree with the spirit of the legislation - I cannot understand how they could do anything else, particularly as they have for many years been saying what we on this side are now saying - they should allow it to pass Second Stage.  If it requires amendment and further development, they should allow this to happen on Committee Stage.  They should not kick the can down the road or sweep this issue under the carpet again.  If they do, thousands of Irish women will continue to suffer and be treated as criminals and with inhumanity by the State.  I appeal to Labour Party Deputies to support the Bill and encourage their colleagues in government to do so also.
