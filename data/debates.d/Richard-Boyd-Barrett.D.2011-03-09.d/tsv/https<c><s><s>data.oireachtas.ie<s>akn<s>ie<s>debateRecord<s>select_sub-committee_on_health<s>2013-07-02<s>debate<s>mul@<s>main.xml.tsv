RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are discussing this because very brave women who faced a horrendous, cruel and unacceptable situation had the courage to come forward and tell of their truly tragic circumstances, when they had wanted pregnancies but received a diagnosis that the foetus they were carrying had a condition that was incompatible with life. I repeat, incompatible with life. That is the key phrase which underlines the fact that legislating for terminations in this very particular and tragic situation is not in conflict with the constitutional requirement to uphold the right to life of the unborn because we are talking about a foetus that has a condition that is incompatible with life. Therefore there is no clash. There is a very strong legal argument to support that view that this is compatible with the existing Constitution, and let us remember that if we do not explore the possibility at least of including this in the legislation we are consigning more women every day to continue to go through these cruel and unacceptable circumstances. When this Bill passes, women may still have to bring their dead children back in the boot of a car as some have had to do. We have a moral responsibility to explore every possibility available to us in the context of this legislation to see if we can prevent that from happening. The Minister says we need constitutional certainty and therefore we cannot do it, much as we may sympathise with these women. I reject that argument completely. The Minister for State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Creighton, in a different context, has said that the legislation------
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is relevant to the discussion. It is a question of whether there can be a legal challenge to this legislation or whether we have constitutional certainty even about the existing legislation that the Minister is proposing. The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has pointed out that we do not have constitutional certainty about the Bill as a whole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is about the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not casting any aspersions. I am talking about an argument that she made, that even setting this aside, there is no legal certainty about this Bill. It can be challenged. On the basis of the argument that the Minister of State is using we would have to strike down other elements of the Bill but the Minister of State is not proposing to do that. The Minister of State, Deputy White's, argument-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State has said that we cannot do this, as much as we might like to do it because there is not constitutional certainty on the question of whether this is compatible with Article 40.3.3o. I put it to the Minister of State that there is no constitutional certainty about other things that are included in the Bill. How is it that some things around which there is not constitutional certainty can be included but other things around which there is not constitutional certainty cannot be included? If it can be done in one instance it can be done in another. The Minister of State has a moral obligation to do it, given the horrendous nature of these situations. Surely we must explore that possibility. Jennifer Schweppe, who has written the amendment that Deputy Healy tabled, also proposed another way to approach it - if we do not do it as an amendment do it as an accompanying Bill which would be read together with this Bill so that if the accompanying Bill was struck down it would not impact on the main Bill. That is another option that the Minister of State could explore. We are asking the Minister of State to explore that, given the seriousness of this situation. I do not see what argument the Minster of State has for not exploring that possibility.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State acknowledged that there is no certainty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly, that is the point. Even with the Bill, setting aside this issue, the Minister is having to go on the balance of probability and the best advice he can get as to whether what he has put forward as being compatible with the Constitution will pass muster if it is challenged legally. The Minister does not have certainty, yet he is pressing ahead because he feels it is important to press ahead and because he advises that he has a reasonable chance of this passing muster legally. The point we are making to him here is that there is very substantial legal support, argument and advice that this provision we propose to allow for terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality also have a good chance - nothing is certain, as the Minister of State, Deputy White, stated - of passing muster legally. They have as good a chance, one could argue, as certain other aspects of it and that is why I was raising the other matter. I was not trying to bring it up. I was simply making the point that a former Attorney General has advised that other aspects of this Bill could be challenged. Presumably, that has not led the Minister to change the Bill. He is pressing ahead, even though he may face a legal challenge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that given the seriousness of the issue, given the tragic nature of these situations and their frequency, and the moral obligation on all of us to do everything we possibly can to avert a situation where more women must unnecessarily go through these tragic circumstances, surely the Minister has an obligation to explore every possibility for including this element in the Bill. The amendment is one proposal to the Minister. Ms Jennifer Schweppe has put another proposal, where the Government would essentially put the same amendment as an accompanying Bill. Even if that accompanying Bill, which would essentially be this amendment but set as an accompanying Bill which would be read together with the main Bill, were struck down, it would have no impact on the main Bill. Those are two options the Minister could explore and we are asking him to explore them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not really get an answer on that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I oppose the amendments. They second guess the doctors' medical assessment of the case in such a way as to put pressure on them to take into consideration factors other than the health of the woman. That is problematic because it is directive when it should not be. This is entirely misplaced and could lead to the uncertainty that surrounded the Savita Halappanavar case, whereby people are not sure and are subject to different pressures and so on. These factors should not come into play. There has to be an assessment of the threat to the life of the woman. A real and substantial threat is all that should be taken into account.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am concerned about the intent behind some of these proposals. Amendment No. 45, in particular, is effectively proposing the provision of directive counselling for women. That is an important point to make. The Minister said he will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to deal with some of the concerns reflected in the proposals by Deputies Billy Kelleher and Denis Naughten. I certainly hope that amendment will not impose any type of enforced directive counselling on women. I assume that will not be the case, but amendment No. 45 makes an allusion to directive counselling and could well be construed to justify putting pressure on women. That would be utterly unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a good idea.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to signal a couple of points I intend to raise on Report Stage. First, I intend to bring forward an amendment which would insert a definition of "appropriately qualified practitioner" in line 25 of page 5. This relates to other amendments we will propose further down the road. In some places the current draft Bill is too prescriptive about who the practitioners should be. We need to debate that and I will propose that we have a heading that refers to a definition of appropriately qualified practitioners. That would include general practitioners, medical practitioners, midwives, obstetricians, gynaecologists and so on. That relates to other matters. I will also table an amendment on the definition of the unborn in section 2 which is problematic in that it defines human life as beginning at the point of implantation. This is a contentious issue to say the least and may cause problems in dealing with the issue of inevitable miscarriage and fatal foetal abnormalities that I would like to see dealt with. Many others have expressed their willingness to deal with this further down the line, whether in this legislation or elsewhere. Finally, the issue we discussed earlier in respect of section 2 for the Government to consider, will be the subject of some amendment. In fact the Minister prompted the thought. He has referred constantly to viable life as the key definition. To Deputies who were concerned about what the Minister described as a misplaced fear that a baby that was born might be destroyed, he referred to viable life as the key issue. Working in another direction, that definition is very significant in terms of the debate we had about fatal foetal abnormalities because while the Minister rightly used that definition it also has an impact on the debate about whether the Minister's legal advice on fatal foetal abnormalities is correct if we talk about pregnancies in which the life is not viable and therefore there is not a clash with the right to life of the unborn because there is not a viable life. We are not talking about a viable life. I want to signal my intention on that issue.
