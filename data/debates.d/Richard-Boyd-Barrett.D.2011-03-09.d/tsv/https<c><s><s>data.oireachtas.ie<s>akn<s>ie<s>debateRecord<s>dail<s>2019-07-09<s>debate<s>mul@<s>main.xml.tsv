RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is outrageous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But you cannot say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The likelihood of Boris Johnson taking over as leader of the Tory Party and becoming Prime Minister, God help us, is ironic. The upper class Etonian twit who harks back to the great days of the British Empire could be the person who will help to facilitate the break-up of the United Kingdom, but intelligence is not his strong point. It creates a dangerous scenario for us in that it increases the possibility of there being a no-deal Brexit. I have not yet read the entire briefing document - I will look at it - but I was alarmed by something the Tánaiste said. He gave reassurances that the European Union would not seek to protect the Single Market by imposing Border infrastructure, but he did say the tariffs that would be demanded to protect the Single Market would do immense damage to the all-Ireland economy. We have to say two things in response. The all-Ireland economy should not be scarified to protect the Single Market. We must tell the European Union that we want a special dispensation because of the damage it would do. It also raises the very serious prospect, as even Simon Hoare, MP, Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster said, that a Border poll could result from this. If even Tories and unionists are discussing the possibility of a Border poll, we should also talk about it as a basic democratic demand in the event that there is a hard Brexit to give the people of the North the opportunity to say "No" to the madness of Boris Johnson and the Tory wreckers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like an answer to the question as to whether it is a reasonable basic democratic request to suggest there would be a border poll in the event of a hard Brexit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This deal is a sell-out. It is a sell-out of farmers. It is a sell-out of the environment and the battle to address the climate emergency. It is a sell-out on human rights. It is a sell-out on food safety and quality. It is facilitated by an earlier sell-out of democracy in the form of the Lisbon treaty which did away with Ireland's veto in the area of trade deals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of us opposed it and joined the anti-globalisation protesters in Genoa specifically because it would enable the EU to do international trade deals that would destroy our environment, hammer farmers and undermine human rights. Now the chickens have come home to roost. The Ministers should confirm it. Somebody asked earlier if we have a veto. The answer is that we do not because of the Lisbon treaty. Is that not right? The Ministers should confirm it. We can vote against this but it will not make any difference because we sold our veto in agreeing to the Lisbon treaty. Is it not correct that there is qualified majority voting in this area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The script will just confuse people. In simple layman's language, we do not have a veto because we gave it away in the Lisbon treaty, which extended qualified majority voting to this area. The chickens have come home to roost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I opposed it. Deputy Howlin supported it and that is why he is interrupting me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We warned about it and protesters took to the streets all over the world. The big mobilisations in Genoa, Florence and Seattle were all about this. At the time, small farmers and indigenous peoples from Latin America were on those protests. Farmers from France, such as José Bové, were warning that this would screw the small farmer and here we are. That is the consequence of it. I would like some clarity on beef. The figure of 99,000 tonnes of beef is mentioned. People should be clear that at the moment 246,000 tonnes of beef come into Europe from the Mercosur countries. Is this 99,000 tonnes on top of that? The Commission documents on the Mercosur deal state that progressively over time tariffs on all Mercosur imports into the European Union will be eliminated. That is the deal. We sell out the farmers and many other things that I will come to in a minute to remove tariffs on manufactured goods, mostly cars and pharmaceuticals, but in exchange we have to remove tariffs from all that beef over time. It is not just 99,000 tonnes, but all of it, further flooding the European market which is significantly flooded with cheap beef from the Mercosur countries, with devastating consequences for small farmers across Europe. Is that not the essence of the agreement that the Government has in principle, notwithstanding a bit of tweaking, signed up to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will just read from the EU Commission document, "The agreement will, over time, remove duties on 91% of goods that EU companies export to Mercosur." It goes on to state, "The agreement will also eliminate import duties on 92% of Mercosur goods exported to the EU." That is what is says: over time get rid of all the duties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am reading from the Commission document. The Minister can explain it to me but he has not explained it in his answer. Some 20% of the world's oxygen comes from the Amazon rainforest. In the past ten years, an area the size of Portugal of those rainforests has been cut down. Mr. Bolsonaro is accelerating on a massive scale an already horrendous programme of deforestation. It is not getting better because of the trade negotiations with the EU; it is getting worse. He has declared war on the indigenous people and on the forests. Deforestation has increased 60% in the past year alone, 800 sq. km of rainforest were lost last month alone. Last year 5,800 sq. km of forest, which is 100 times the area of Manhattan, were cut down and that is accelerating. I would not even repeat some of the stuff Bolsonaro has said about the indigenous people but I will give the Minister a flavour so that he understands what this guy is about. He said "it's a shame that the Brazilian cavalry hasn't been as efficient as the Americans, who exterminated the Indians." This guy is seeking to exterminate the indigenous people and slaughter the rainforest that produces 20% of global oxygen. Does the Minister seriously think we should be doing trade deals with a guy like this? Does he honestly believe he is going to respect environmental rights, human rights or anything? He does not care about these things, he is celebrating this deal. To give another flavour he said of one his political opponents, Maria do Rosário, she was "not worth raping". He described immigrants as "scum". He supports the use of firing squads and talked about the need for a hyper-aggressive police force, saying "a policeman who doesn’t kill isn’t a policeman". He said about homosexuality "I would be incapable of loving a homosexual son" and "I would prefer that my son die in an accident than show up with some guy". That is the sort of person we are dealing with. Does the Minister honestly believe we should be trading with people like that? Is that not an absolute betrayal of the fight to deal with the climate crisis and human rights on a global scale, and in particular for the victims of that kind of filth in Brazil? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, and I do not mean to be disrespectful to the Minister but that is just nonsense. There is no way to police this guy. There is no dealing with people like that. This guy is a dangerous lunatic, a climate change denier and a thug. Even if we set aside what Bolsonaro is doing in Brazil, has the Government quantified the sheer expansion of transport emissions as a result of this deal, even on its own terms? What are the extra emissions of CO2 that will further choke the environment as a result of this deal being done? They will be massive. Does that not show complete hypocrisy on the part of the European Union that it plans to sell cars for cows, as some people are saying, massively increasing emissions as a result of the expansion of transport emissions? Is that not an inescapable fact? Here is an irony about the tariffs: we had a briefing today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, who said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, Europe will have to impose tariffs on agriproduce from the North of Ireland. Europe is going to do that and the Irish Government agrees with the principle of doing that. More tariffs will be imposed on stuff coming from the North to the South of this country than there will be on the massive amounts of poor quality beef coming up from Argentina, based on cutting down rainforest and jumping up and down on people's human rights. One could not make it up.
