RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The world is rightly expressing its utter outrage and revulsion at the despotism and warmongering of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. I have asked at the Business Committee for the Government to facilitate a debate as a matter of urgency on a crisis every bit as horrific, involving Saudi Arabia and Yemen, where the UN recently reported there are now 13 million people on the brink of starvation. This is a war where Saudi Arabia is armed to the teeth by Britain and France and their lives count every bit as much. We need to discuss that crisis, which is reaching horrifying proportions, and decide whether we are going to take action against the Saudi Government. The Tánaiste led a trade mission there in November and it has been reported that he did not even raise human rights issues. I do not know if that is true but it is something that needs to be discussed because what is happening in Yemen is absolutely horrific.

They are now overrun again. There are record numbers on hospital trolleys and further surges in Covid. On 19 January the Tánaiste proposed that €1,000 would be given to each healthcare worker. This week, I had several representations from healthcare workers to say that it still has not been paid and that the Government is essentially proposing an unsustainable model which the representatives of the healthcare workers does not feel is acceptable. I believe there was a meeting yesterday. Will the Tánaiste update us? As one healthcare worker pointed out, other healthcare workers in Europe received reward payments 18 months ago yet 18 months on our healthcare workers still have not received the €1,000 reward payment that the Tánaiste promised them.

The world is disgusted and revolted at what Vladimir Putin is doing, his bloody invasion and the imperialist logic behind it. Rightly, people's hearts go out to the people of Ukraine and they want to show all the solidarity they can. The best hope is that the resistance of the Ukrainian people, alongside the opposition of the Russian people to this bloody war, will bring it to an end and, with any luck, bring down the Putin regime. Nevertheless, I just do understand why the response to this horror of the leaders of Europe, the United States and parties in this House, largely on the Government's side, seems to be to want to use this crisis to make an argument for spending more on weapons and putting ourselves closer to the NATO military alliance. If that is the lesson one draws from this, our world is doomed. This horror flows directly from the logic of the global arms industry and all the major powers building up terrifying military and nuclear arsenals and using them again and again. Largely, the West has either ignored these horrors when they have happened elsewhere or, worse, actively colluded in them. I refer, for example, to what Saudi Arabia has been doing in Yemen for the past five years, killing 330,000 people and bringing 14 million people, as we speak, to the brink of starvation. Not only do we not sanction Saudi Arabia but we arm it, travel to the country on trade missions and say nothing about what it is doing. We support Israel and allow it to bombard Gaza again and again, to steal its people’s land and to demolish their homes, and then we expect that logic will not be pursued by other powers in the world. Of course it will be. Furthermore, global arms expenditure has shot through the roof. While we talk about housing, health, education and our ability to deal with humanitarian catastrophe, globally we are now spending $2 trillion a year on weapons and arms, and the countries that spend it are the United States, at 39% of it, China, India, Russia, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Germany and France. They are all to blame for this madness. If you build up nuclear and military arsenals, if you fight to control spheres of influence and if you back dictators or ignore their crimes, what do you expect is going to happen? There are going to be wars, atrocities and brutal regimes such as Putin's. The last thing we need to do, faced with this horror arriving on the doorstep of Europe, is to say we need more militarism. We need to oppose militarism, full stop. We need to oppose all dictatorships and that is what Irish military neutrality is about because it came from the Irish revolution. It came from a revolution against an empire and against the First World War, to say we would not be part of this imperial madness but rather that we would stand against it and align ourselves with forces in the world that stand against war and empire. That is what we should do today.

We are happy to support the Sinn Féin motion on energy price increases and the proposed measures, but we also will move an amendment to the motion that the Government needs to use the powers it has under the Consumer Protection Act to put caps on prices to declare an emergency in respect of the supply of energy and fuel and put caps in place. The reason we are proposing this - and have done from the beginning - is because, essentially, the Government and most European and global leaders are peddling a lie as to the reasons for the staggering increases in energy and fuel prices. The increases are not happening because of the weather. They are not even happening because of the war in Ukraine. While hundreds of thousands of people are suffering as a result of these energy price hikes, huge numbers of corporations are profiting. The crisis results from profiteering by energy companies, oil producers, electricity producers and suppliers. Our Government and EU and global leaders do not want to do anything about it because they are in cahoots with these companies that are making enormous amounts of money. By way of some facts, a Saudi Arabian oil company's profits last year were $49 billion, up from previous years. Russia's Surgutneftegas made $9 billion in profit, also up on the previous year. Shell made $20 billion profit last year, which was up on the previous year. BP made a profit of $7.5 billion last year, an eight-year high. Here in Ireland, the ESB's profits were up again last year, standing at just under €700 million. Energia profits were up 46%. In the previous year, they were up 45%. I could go on. Given that Ukraine is being cited as an excuse, another group of companies making enormous amounts of money out of the crisis there and the global arms industry are those that produce weapons. Last year, with global expenditure of $2 trillion, profits of up to $520 billion were shared between American, Russian, UK, Chinese and Saudi Arabian companies. I say to the public out there: "Do not believe the lies of governments to the effect that everybody is losing in this crisis." Actually, some people are making enormous profits and, sadly, our Government, as well as European and global governments, are facilitating them in doing so.
