RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the macro issues involved and the troika, perhaps I did not hear Deputy Arthur Spring's question fully, but is the IMF stating the multiplier effect was far greater than expected?  That is a significant admission on its part.  In subsequent discussions was there a rethink on the part of the IMF about the merits of cutting as a means to improve the economic situation and spur growth?  The logic seems to have been that if we were to do this, we would somehow attract private investment.  However, there is no sign of an increase overall in investment.  Every year since 2007 the level of investment fell substantially until 2011, the figure for which was down on that for 2010 in terms of gross domestic capital formation.  Where are the indications that the cutting approach is encouraging investment?  Overall, the level of investment is down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We disagree substantially.  People need to know in considering the macro position that of the figure of €15 billion that is always repeated, €9 billion is interest on debt.  The Minister should admit this publicly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have looked at them.  In 2007 the debt was €47 billion and it is now €196 billion.  That huge increase is the direct result of the bank bailout and the economic collapse resulting from the activities of banks and financial institutions.  I consider all of it odious and unacceptable debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that, but I am making the point that the primary deficit is considerably smaller and that there are other ways to bridge it.  I argue that to finance the other aspect of the debt, we are doing things that are preventing us from closing the deficit through the generation of growth.  The primary deficit is manageable and we could deal with it through a change in tax policy and greater levels of investment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to disagree on those issues.  At least we have aired them.  I will move on to the question of public sector jobs.  Despite what the Minister has said about the focus on stimulus, etc., his projections for next year are absolutely flat in terms of jobs.  Is that not correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does it not indicate that whatever we are gaining on the swings, we are losing on the roundabouts?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The medium-term fiscal framework currently provides for no change in unemployment levels next year.  Is the Minister predicting that as a result of measures to be introduced in the budget, we will see an overall net increase in employment, or reduction in unemployment, next year?  I do not see how that can be the case if we are simultaneously committed to continuing to reduce public sector numbers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am studying it very carefully.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	More jargon.
