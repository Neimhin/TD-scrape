RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have three points to make. First, people are effectively seeking to outdo each other in this House, among almost all the political parties, in claiming to be the most opposed to a hard Border. There is a constant exercise in outflanking and claims of being more concerned than anybody else about the impact of Brexit. Should we not, instead of playing politics with all of this, conclude that since nobody wants a return to a hard Border, we will simply put our foot down and say there will be no such return because we will not allow it? Ironically, it is the great internationalists in the European Union who most want to impose a hard Border. Their internationalism ends at the borders of Europe. My internationalism, on the other hand, goes way beyond the borders of Europe, whether in respect of the movement of people or goods. If the Taoiseach is serious about internationalism and democracy, he should say to his EU colleagues that we will not accept the imposition of hard borders or anything else that will impede the free movement of human beings and trade.
