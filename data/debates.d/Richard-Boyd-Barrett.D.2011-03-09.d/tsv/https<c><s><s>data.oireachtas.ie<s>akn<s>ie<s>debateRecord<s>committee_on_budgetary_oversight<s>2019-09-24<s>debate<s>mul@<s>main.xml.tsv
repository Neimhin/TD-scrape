RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the research and development tax credit, given the limited amount of money that may be available for any discretionary budget measures,why does Chambers Ireland not argue for redirecting some of the research and development funding that is currently disproportionately benefiting a small group of IT companies and big multinational corporations rather than seeking an extension of the research and development element to those who are not getting the funding? The research and development tax credit has absolutely ballooned to approximately €700 million and, overwhelmingly, this money is going to a handful of multinational corporations, the names of which names we are all familiar with. In the interests of developing a sustainable economy, should that money not be redirected towards SMEs and public universities rather than being extended to another group of people? I am of the view that it should be redirected. I do not see why Apple should get a research and development tax credit for coming up with the latest upgrade to its iPhone 11 Pro. Directing money towards such an upgrade should not be a priority. Why do we not invest the money in projects that will benefit the domestic economy? To follow up on what Deputy Broughan stated, would our guests agree that any consideration the Minister for Finance might be giving to holding back on social welfare increases or introducing measures that might reduce the spending power of ordinary working people is completely wrong in the face of Brexit or a possible international recession? Should we not be boosting the purchasing power of ordinary people because that would benefit Chambers Ireland members and also prevent suffering and hardship being visited on ordinary working people as a result of economic turbulence or difficulty? I welcome the comments on public transport, childcare, infrastructure and so on. Will our guests elaborate on those? What do we mean when we refer to investing more in public transport in order to tackle climate change, alleviate congestion, etc.? We should move to free public transport because that would really encourage people to abandon their cars. There must be far greater frequency on public transport routes, greater reliability and public transport routes that are run on a not-for-profit basis. The latter could be operated in areas where they are not commercially viable, in the narrow sense, in order to get people to use public transport. Do our guests agree that we need to heavily subsidise public transport systems? One could make the same argument about childcare. What do they have to say about the blight of vacant shop units and vacant accommodation units above shops? What should be done to prevent such units becoming vacant? There are units on the main street in Dún Laoghaire that have been empty for years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not vacant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad Mr. Talbot is keeping an eye on me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of housing, do the witnesses accept that there is a big problem with gentrification? To put it even more dramatically, I could talk about the social cleansing of areas like the inner city, as well as some suburbs such as my area. This is because of the punitive and exorbitant cost of rent and home purchases and the lack of social housing delivery from the Government, leading to the crowding out of sites by cuckoo funds who go on to rent properties out at exorbitant prices. Do the witnesses accept that this is a problem that needs to be addressed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank SPI for its presentation. Before I ask a number of questions, I wish to say I am very much in favour of the State providing support to film and all the other arts in the sector, and indeed I would welcome a very significant increase in the budgets for them. However, I am not, as I suspect the witnesses know, convinced that the way in which section 481 is structured achieves the ends we want in terms of the provision of quality employment and training, which is the legal requirement of section 481, or the development of companies of scale, which 24 years ago the Indecon report said should be the purpose of section 481. That report strongly criticised the project-by-project nature of the Irish film industry and said section 481 - or section 35, as it was then - was encouraging and perpetuating a project-by-project, short-term film industry which would not result in the development of companies of scale. Furthermore, the EU, in its guidelines on state aid to the audiovisual sector, pointed out that such aid should deliver the consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience. I put it to Ms Geraghty that none of that is happening. For example, SPI and other supporters of section 481 came before the arts committee a year and a half ago and said there were 17,000 whole-time equivalents in the industry, which sounds good.Today the figure of 7,000 has been used but there was a counter-point put at that committee from the workers in the industry, who said the figure was actually nearer 2,000 and that very few, if any, of those were secure jobs. On foot of that debate, the Minister asked for an investigation into the matter. A study concluded that in 2016 the Revenue Commissioners estimate the number of employees directly engaged in section 481 productions was 2,158. In other words, SPI and other supporters overstated the level of employment in the film industry deriving from section 481 by 800%. That is pretty significant from a value for money point of view for the public. Ms Geraghty might tell us how many of those are permanent or even secure jobs. One of the things the Indecon report stated way back in 1995 was that what we actually had was a series of micro-companies with a very small number of permanent employees. That continues to be the situation. Almost nobody has any security of employment. There is absolutely nothing to protect workers from wholesale displacement or even blacklisting, which has been alleged by workers in the industry. Riddle me this; given that section 481 says specifically that it is given on the proviso of the provision of quality employment and training, how can it be that when challenged by workers in the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, SPI's members claim that production companies that apply for and get the relief are not the employers? I do not see how a company can get a relief to provide quality employment and training and simultaneously claim that it does not employ the crew on those films, but hide behind a designated activity company, DAC, which is an accountancy tool, not a company. Although the companies that actually apply are standing companies that exist year after year, such as Element Pictures, Metropolitan Films and so on, they claim to have no responsibility whatsoever for the employees. They claim they are not their employees or trainees. As a result, nobody has any kind of security. In terms of training, can anybody even tell me how many trainees have qualified in the different categories of employment over the past ten years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said State support for the film industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not necessarily do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, the point is that in the finance legislation, the tax relief is explicitly tied to the issue of quality employment and training, so it is relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some 2,150.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, I am in favour of more public investment in the arts and the film industry but not necessarily, and for the reasons I have indicated, section 481. Our guests say that the particular nature of the industry means companies of scale are actually much smaller. I put it to them that this is not the case with animation. An animation company can have a much bigger workforce that enjoys some security of employment. I do not accept that that cannot be done with live action film and television. Given the amount of public money going in and the fact that it is largely going to nine companies, and if, as our guests describe it, there are ten to 15 people in each company, how many people have permanent jobs when the figures are added up? Is it 100, 200 or 300? That is a significant problem. Whether our guests say it is 2,000 or 7,000, it means that all the rest have absolutely no security of income or employment from project to project. I put it to the them that this is the current situation and that there is nothing to stop wholesale displacement of people who may have worked in the industry for years or blacklisting, which has been alleged not just by some of those outside the ICTU fold but even the Irish Equity representative here in January 2018. He stated that there was a significant problem with bullying and harassment and that workers had no protection. Who is the employer of these people? The production company is not, or at least it tells the Workplace Relations Commission that it is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not. The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act cannot and does not apply if the employer is a designated activity company, DAC, which can only exist for the purposes of one project. As a result, is it not correct to state that almost nobody in the group in question who have contracts of indefinite duration or any kind of expectation of or right to employment from one project to the next? Our guests stated that it should be comparable with other employment. Do most of those workers get sick leave, holiday entitlements and maternity entitlements? How many trainees have qualified?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if that company does make other projects that require construction?
