RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was considerable fanfare last week and much talk of a breakthrough following the deal at the European Council meeting.  There was a lot of self-congratulation about what had been achieved by the Government and the EU leaders.  We heard similar talk from the troika, whom we met this morning, about this great breakthrough.  People in this country have heard these expressions on many occasions, usually shortly after almost every summit in the last few years, and no sooner are the politicians slapping each other on the back and declaring they have made great progress than the whole thing unravels and nothing changes for ordinary people being crushed by cuts and the impact of austerity.  I would like to think this one was different and that all the talk of the great breakthrough was meaningful this time so ordinary people could look forward to some relief and hope instead of the terrible situation faced by so many.  However, this is highly unlikely.The Government and European leaders, and the troika in our meeting this morning, when asked specifically what the deal would do for ordinary working people and the unemployed and for our economic prospects, gave us no detail at all.  The troika in fact said the details were vague and we would have to see what the details actually were.  I find it hard to understand how people can talk about a breakthrough when we are told the details have not been worked out.  Is it not the reality that any change of policy last week did not arise from the great talent or ability of our Government or any of the politicians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just so those in the Visitors' Gallery are aware, every time a Deputy from the Technical Group gets up to speak, the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, plays with her phone and talks to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is indicative of the contempt the Government has for the Opposition.  The Visitors' Gallery, which is full right now, should understand that this is generally the approach of the Government.  None the less, these problems will be resolved by ordinary people such as those in the gallery and in society.  They will not be resolved by politicians in the club of the political establishment who failed us so miserably for the last four years.I challenge the Government to tell us specifically how this deal will improve the lot of ordinary people.  Is it just more PR spin, smoke and mirrors and an elaborate accountancy trick?  One would not have much reason for hope when the first meaningful statement from a Government spokesman in the aftermath of all the declarations of the great breakthrough came from the Minister for Finance, who said it would make no difference whatsoever to the cuts and austerity that the Government plans to impose in the budget in December, a fact confirmed by the troika.  While the troika members could not tell us what specific improvements in terms of employment, cuts and austerity the Irish people would see as a result of the deal, they were able to state that the cuts in incomes must continue, the privatisation agenda would continue and property taxes must be imposed.  One wonders what all the hoo-ha is about.In so far as there is any substance whatsoever to all the declarations of a breakthrough last week, it seems to revolve around the fact that perhaps the debts of the banks and the bailouts necessary to fill the hole in the banks will not be routed through the sovereign and that the ESM will directly bail out the banks.  People should take note that the first and major priority of the European leaders remains unchanged, namely, to bail out the banks but to do so in a slightly different way.The question is whether this new method of bailing out the banks will bring about an improvement for ordinary people.  It may result in a reduction of our debt-to-GDP ratio, although that remains to be seen.  However, we are going to pick up the tab at the other end through the ESM because it will now be the mechanism to bail out the banks and we, the citizens of this country and Europe, pay for the ESM.  In our case it is now more likely that the Irish people will be on the hook for the full €11 billion or more to finance the ESM by virtue of the ESM treaty and that we will be called upon to bail out the European banks given that it is considered that there is in the region of a €2 trillion hole in Spanish and Italian banks alone and the ESM has only €500 billion of so-called firepower.  That makes it almost certain that Irish citizens will just pay the bill in a different way.The truth is that we will only have reason to celebrate when the Minister of State can tell us where the jobs are and how the 300,000 or 400,000 jobs we need to get our people back to work and to get the economy moving again will be created.  When will the Government stop the imposition of brutal and unjust cuts on working people and vulnerable sectors of society?  The Minister of State has made it absolutely clear that will continue.  The policy is to prop up the banks, privatise everything and crush ordinary people with austerity.  That is not a breakthrough and it is certainly nothing to celebrate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State fairly accurately characterised socialism in the context of the current crisis as being about putting state or public money directly into job creation.  Will the Minister of State indicate what is wrong with that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, socialism is about putting public money into job creation and if I understand the Government's policy correctly, it is about putting public money into banks.  We have billions of euro for the banks, and that is seen as being sensible and rational, but the idea - God help us - to put the same money into job creation is the most extreme nonsensical idea in the world.  It is bizarre logic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just did so.  Is it not the case that the Government's policy amounts to borrowing billions of euro, which we cannot afford, to put the money into private banks?  Why does the Government continue to do this when the strategy has demonstrably failed?  Banks will not lend, no matter how much recapitalisation they get, and at a European level, they are not investing.  Will the Minister of State explain the logic to me?The Minister of State has given no detail about what will result from this seismic shift that took place last week.  She has said it is a high level political agreement to recapitalise the banks directly through the ESM.  How is that in any sense going to relieve the burden on ordinary people?  Even if the debt to GDP ratio is reduced, will the public not pick up the Bill on the other side through our contributions to the ESM, which we must fund?  Given that the hole in the Spanish and Italian banks is estimated to be in the region of €2 trillion, with the ESM only having firepower of €500 billion, is it not guaranteed that the full €11 billion call on the Irish people is likely to come to pass?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had the money for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought we were disentangling these issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not getting money from the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is all in the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's efforts are not working either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had a question on the ESM.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have dodged another one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Minister on the last point - the nauseating hypocrisy of Independent Newspapers.  I do not mind naming it.  The company was previously owned by one tax exile and is now owned by another tax exile and is paying executives obscene amounts of money and then attacking other people who are earning far less.  That is sickening in the extreme.The context for most people for this question is the tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs, cannot make mortgage repayments and are affected by cuts in social welfare allowances and child benefit.  They are literally nailed to the wall and they wonder from week to week whether they can make it through the month.  Then they find that the new chief executive of the VHI is not satisfied with earning five times the average industrial wage but that in order to take up the job he must earn six times the average industrial wage.  That is nauseating also for people because they simply do not understand it.One must wonder what sort of abilities, talent or business case anyone can make in stating that €191,000 a year is not enough but that they must have €238,000.  It is pretty sickening.  Are we openly advertising those posts and asking if anyone is out there who could do the job who is willing to work for the limit we have set?  I do not think it can be justified for someone to insist on getting approximately €50,000 more than what is already an extremely generous salary by anyone's standards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was €411,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pleased that the Minister has acknowledged the injustice people feel at this decision, and how it is inexplicable to most people that someone would demand a €50,000 increase above and beyond €191,000 for doing the job.  What does not satisfy me about the Minister's response is why we have allowed it.  I do not see what special abilities or talents can justify the decision or that there was no one else who could have done the job that this person will do for the VHI for €191,000.Given that the person's name is O'Dwyer, they must be Irish – perhaps I should not say that - but they do not seem to be showing a hell of a lot of patriotism given what everyone else is going through, that they cannot operate on a very generous cap of €191,000.  What case did they make and could we not have got other people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is protecting the rich.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am an urban Deputy from Dún Laoghaire but I commend the Save Our National Schools campaign and all the parents, teachers and children who have come from all over the country, including Leitrim and Donegal, to fight and defend their small schools.  I say to them, lest they be depressed at the responses they have heard from the Government side, that they should keep up their fight because the Government is worried.  It hopes these people will go away but they should not and should keep harassing those in power.In many of the responses we have heard from the other side, there has been a subtle attempt to play the country against the city and the big schools against the smaller institutions.  Those people in the small villages and towns who are fighting for their small schools are doing so for the entire country and the education system.  Everybody interested in defending that education system, whether they are children in big or small schools, in the city or country, has an interest in supporting these people in the fight for their small schools.  If this Government gets away with attacking education or closing schools in one place, it will move very quickly to do the same elsewhere.  I know big schools in urban areas are under massive pressure as well from the same agenda of cutbacks.The Government's actions make no sense whatever, despite attempts to spin it as a positive.  These are cutbacks, pure and simple, to obey the diktat of the troika.  Some on the other side have argued we are exaggerating and full of hyperbole.  Some years ago, a Deputy stated:As far as I am concerned, these cuts will do irreparable damage.  If ever cuts were made in the wrong place, these are them. These cuts represent a life sentence for children, their parents and their grandparents.Who said these words but the current Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, in 2008.  He was responding to Fianna Fáil education cuts.  Was that hyperbole or exaggeration?  Of course it was not and he was absolutely right.  Now he is trying to justify the unjustifiable, and the consequence will be to rip the heart from rural communities.  It will affect small schools in rural communities that are under massive pressure and which have lost significant numbers.  They are literally hanging on for dear life.  These communities will be under serious threat and if the Government takes away the small schools, it will rip the heart from them.  The possibility of these communities disappearing will become very real and it will be a major attack on what is unique and special about an Irish culture of small village and town life in rural areas.  It is absolutely disgraceful and this action will be counter-productive at every level.There will be no savings as if amalgamations are to come about; there will be associated costs.  There will also be transport costs and we will have to provide prefabs and refurbish the larger schools.  That will cost money in any event.  It is sickening that the Government is slipping in the language of the market and commercial viability to educational matters.  Education is not about costs or financial viability but rather the future of our society.  It is about young people and prospects for recovery.The Government has argued there is no pot of gold and we do not have any money but it is telling untruths.  I received an answer to a parliamentary question today from the Minister for Finance indicating that the top 10,000 earners in the country earned €6 billion in 2011.  Their average earnings were €595,000 each per year and they paid an average of 29% tax.  While the rest of the country is being savaged, these people are using tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share.  If the effective tax rate on the 10,000 richest people in the country could be raised, more than €1 billion could be generated and they would still have average earnings of €295,000 per year.  They would still be super-rich but we would have an extra €1 billion that could ensure small schools would not suffer cuts.  The nasty austerity attacks on the vulnerable sectors of our society would be unnecessary.  The Government should protect our small schools and go after the super-wealthy in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should state he supports the Bill.
