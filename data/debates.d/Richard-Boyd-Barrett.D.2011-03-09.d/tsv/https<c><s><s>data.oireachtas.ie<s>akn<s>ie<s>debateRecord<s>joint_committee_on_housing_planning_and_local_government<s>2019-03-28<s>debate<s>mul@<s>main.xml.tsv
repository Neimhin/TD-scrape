RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well done to Deputy Wallace. I completely support the Bill and its objectives. I also agree with him wholeheartedly that speculation and land hoarding is a major, if not the main, contributory factor to the current housing crisis and the excessive cost of housing. The point made by Deputy Ó Broin is also very important. It is a point that is not highlighted enough, although we have done so periodically. The tax breaks available are extraordinary. When we ask the Minister for Finance to cost them and tell us how much is forgone under those tax loopholes on capital gains and rental income allowed for, he cannot even tell us, which is shocking. Given the increase in property prices since those tax breaks were put in place, it has to be in the tens of billions of euro, certainly in the billions. People have no incentive to build. My next question is for all of the witnesses, given that I agree with every word they have said and the purpose of the Bill. Do most of the people who bought up this land have any interest in building anything at present? Mr. Reynolds has said, which is very worrying and alarming when we consider the state we are in, that we are now at the top of the cycle. Perhaps he will elaborate on this point. If we are at the top of the cycle and output is pathetically low because it is more profitable for people to sit on land or flip it, we will be in deep trouble in the event that output reduces. I support the 25% punitive rate but if people do not want to build now and this rate is imposed on them, they will not build either. Is it not most likely that they will just get out of the market? That would not be a bad thing if they had to sell it back to the local authorities under section 12. Is it very likely they will state they have made their money and decide to walk and sell back the land? Even then the local authorities would have to buy it back at 60% or 40% of current value and that would still mean the State picking up a significant Bill and the people involved walking away with large profits. Will the witnesses tease this out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one more question on something that occurs to me. Given land prices and values in the private sector, if some people were to build, would they not almost have to build unaffordable units that are useless to the vast majority of people affected by the housing crisis? Given the economics the witnesses have described, the only viable units the private sector could build, if it decided to do so, would be ones that nobody could afford.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is connected to that point. If people decide to build-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just before he does, that is the point I am getting at, namely, units at €400,000. When I met the Hines guys - sorry mentioned them aloud - they said it was going to cost them €400,000 to build the apartments. I asked myself what was the point in that. Some would ask, and perhaps Mr. Reynolds could elaborate on this, whether the developers have any interest in building anything.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask one brief supplementary question because I am nearly out of time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a question for Professor Drudy and one last question to Mr. Reynolds and to Deputy Wallace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is two, but they are both the same question. On the need for cost rental council housing, with which we all agree, what is Professor Drudy's view on the issue of income thresholds for council housing? Many of us have argued that the thresholds need to be raised. Should there be any thresholds? It drives one group into being social housing people and others are above that. All witnesses have identified the slowness in the public provision of council housing and affordable housing. Professor Drudy said that while they are amenable and they are doing some stuff, it is very slow and less than is needed. Do Deputy Wallace and Mr. Reynolds believe, as I do, that there is a connection between their slowness and an anxiety that if they were to build large amounts of council and affordable housing, available for significantly less than market prices, it would impact on the profitability of the private sector, and that they are worried about this? If the council built affordable housing on the lands at Shanganagh Castle for €200,000 and the private developer down the road was to sell the more or less the same sort of house for €300,000 or €400,000, then there is a big problem for the private developer if the council is putting up affordable housing on a large scale. I believe the council should do that, but is this the reason the council is not doing it on such a scale?
