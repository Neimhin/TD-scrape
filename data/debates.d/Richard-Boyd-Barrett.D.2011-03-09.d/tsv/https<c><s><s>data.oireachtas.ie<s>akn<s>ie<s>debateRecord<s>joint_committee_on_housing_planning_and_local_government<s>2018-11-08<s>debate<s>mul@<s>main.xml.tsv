RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Five minutes-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps I can comment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Single people who are homeless in Dún Laoghaire are not allowed to self-accommodate. I do not see why single people should not be allowed to self-accommodate if the alternative is to go into a hostel where there are active drug users. The person might be a recovering drug user. If there is no suitable and appropriate accommodation for a homeless person, whether single or whether he or she has a family, he or she should be allowed to self-accommodate if possible. That is a general comment. In Dún Laoghaire specifically there is a particular unfairness, which is probably the case in any part of the outer reaches of Dublin, where one is told that one cannot self-accommodate even though one can find a hotel or a bed and breakfast, and that one has to go into a hostel in Dublin city centre, specifically the Brú Aimsir hostel on Thomas Street. That is not fair, and it is not right. I would like some explanation for that policy, and I ask that that policy is changed so that people who are homeless and who are from Dún Laoghaire can find emergency or temporary accommodation as near as possible to where they live and to where their family are. If that means self-accommodation, they should be allowed to access that.Second, why it is the policy that people seeking HAP approval from, for example, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, and I assume this is true of Fingal and south Dublin county councils, have to go into Parkgate Street to get such approval? That is crazy. It is bad enough being homeless without being told one has to traipse all the way into Parkgate Street to get homeless HAP approval rather than simply being able to go to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdrown County Council to get such approval.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That does not answer my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms Gleeson is not answering my question. She is merely stating the existing policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking Ms Gleeson to change the policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How is it better for a homeless person from Dún Laoghaire to be sent to James's Street?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to briefly respond. It is cruel and inhumane to defend the policy Ms Gleeson has just defended, namely, to tell a person who is single and homeless in Dún Laoghaire that it is better for them to go into the Brú Hostel in James's Street rather than get bed and breakfast accommodation or a hotel room in Dún Laoghaire when they can get one. It is self-evidently better for that person to find temporary accommodation in the area where they live close to their family members and that they would not have to traipse all the way into town. It is particularly self-evident in cases where that person does not have a drug habit or is recovering from a drug or alcohol problem. However, that person is being told they cannot self-accommodate in Dún Laoghaire, even though they can find a place, and that they have to go into a place where there are active drug users and where it is dangerous for them. How can Ms Gleeson say that is fair, or right, or better? I simply do not understand that.
