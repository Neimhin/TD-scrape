RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Paul Murphy and Mick Barry. I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing forward the motion. Anything that gives us an opportunity to highlight the housing crisis and the plight of renters is very welcome. I support overwhelmingly the thrust of the motion. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and Deputy Devlin's attempts to defend the Government's position and their countermotion are threadbare in the extreme. A few weeks ago, I described the LDA legislation as a heist where the Government had opened the door, not just so that private developers and speculators would control the private market, but for the entire public land bank to be plundered by private financial interests. I pointed out that the references to setting affordable prices and rents subject to local market conditions meant they would not be affordable. With the affordable housing scheme, my worst fears are confirmed. What planet is the Government living on? For €450,000 in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire to be affordable, one would need an income of about €120,000. Average wages in this country are €39,000. A single person can forget it as he or she has not got a chance. The legislation refers to market rents - not even average market rents but local market rents. In my area, local market rents are between €2,000 and €3,000 or even €3,500. The Minister suggests the cost rental will be a discount on the local market rents. It is a joke. What will happen and is happening is that the cuckoos come in, buy all the blocks and lease them back to the council, which pays an extortionate fortune. They make a fortune, paid for with taxpayers' money, and in 25 years they feck off. They have made a fortune and people are put out, as is happening with the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. It is extraordinary. I cannot believe Shanganagh is mentioned as a positive example. Shanganagh was handed over for public housing by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 2006. Since then, we have had Fianna Fáil in government, Fine Gael in government, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in government and not a sod has been turned. Now we discover the affordable, cost-rental housing on it will be subject to a benchmark against local rent and prices, which are the highest anywhere in the country.It is flipping unbelievable. In Cherrywood, which is also in my constituency, former NAMA land, a Fianna Fáil construct, was handed over to private developers who are now building four blocks of build-to-rent apartments. I met the developers and they told me it was costing them €400,000 per unit to build and that every single one of them had been sold to a Dutch state pension fund. Even the Dutch understand that its state should invest in public housing, but they are doing it here because our State will not do it. It will not build its own affordable housing and public housing that is genuinely affordable. It is beyond shocking. In Cherrywood originally, when €15 million of public money in local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding was given to pay for the infrastructure, we were promised that 40% of all housing built with that money would go for affordable housing and that it would cost no more than €300,000. Within weeks, that had disappeared. There was no 40%, or any other percentage: in fact, we do not know what percentage of affordable housing there will be. Yesterday, the Minister told us that affordable housing has increased from €300,000 a few years ago to €450,000. How is housing affordable based on people's income if it is capped at €450,000 in one area, €400,000 in another area, €350,000 in another area, €300,000 in another area and €225,000 in another area? It has got nothing to do with affordability. Does the Minister think people get different wages depending on whether they live in Leitrim or Dún Laoghaire? It is just disgraceful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish Wildlife Trust, IWT, recently issued a very stark warning about the biodiversity crisis, which is often forgotten in the context of the equally urgent crisis of climate change. It is very important for us to remember that biodiversity collapse could spell the end of our ability to live on this planet. One of the areas the IWT pointed to was the critical importance of the marine environment. It, like many other organisations, is deeply concerned about the ramming through of the marine planning framework and the rubber-stamping of what is essentially the grabbing of very sensitive marine sites, such as the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank off the east coast and other parts of the country, by private companies. It is concerned these decisions would be rubber-stamped despite the potential implications for biodiversity, marine life and, of course, fishermen when we talk about a just transition. I want appeal once again to the Taoiseach to allow for proper scrutiny of the marine planning framework to take place before the vote next week. There should also be no question of there being a rubber-stamping of licences for private companies for sensitive areas off the east coast and other areas before there is a framework and law to govern the proper planning and development of the marine environment.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should answer the question raised by Deputy Barry, and earlier by Deputy Paul Murphy, on chosen representatives of ESB technicians being recognised by the ESB, a semi-State body, and on respecting the right of people to choose their own representatives in a legitimate dispute about outsourcing. The Taoiseach should intervene in this regard as a matter of urgency. I want to raise the co-ordination by Departments in key areas, such as providing schools for our children. I raise this because the lack of co-ordination that was highlighted to me by the community of the new multi-denominational Gaelscoil in the Blackrock area, Gaelscoil Laighean, is really quite shocking. Four years ago, it won the competition or vote on patronage of the new school that was to be established in the Blackrock–Booterstown area. At the time, it was told that, for two years, it would be in a temporary location and that it would then be given a permanent location. Since then, there has been broken promise after broken promise from the Department of Education. The school is still in a temporary location. It is now moving to another temporary location. A few weeks ago, it received a letter from the Department stating it had agreed a permanent location for it with the local authority. We contacted the local authority and it stated there is no such agreement on a permanent location. I realise the Taoiseach will not know the answer to this off the top of his head but I ask him to look into the matter and get the Department to plan properly for permanent locations for schools.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The violent scenes in the North over recent weeks were a worrying reminder of how the institutionalisation of sectarianism can lead to these sectarian outbursts. If we are to challenge that and achieve the unity of this island and the end of partition, and undermine the conscious stirring-up of sectarianism by forces such as the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, we have to offer a better alternative, not just joining together two somewhat dysfunctional states. We cannot hope to convince people in the North to become part of a united Ireland unless we have a state-of-the-art national health service.Our national health service is failing in many regards. It is a two-tier system. The majority of our student nurses and midwives want to leave the country because they are not paid enough, are treated badly and have to work in intolerable conditions. Over recent weeks, I have raised issues affecting young psychologists. I am overwhelmed by the response I have got from them. They are living in poverty while trying to train to get into psychology to deal with the mental health crisis and they say it is an absolute nightmare. Those are just two examples. We need a single-tier quality national health service. If we do not have that, why would people of a unionist tradition in the North want to be part of our country? We also have to separate church and state. It is unbelievable that the national maternity hospital is to be controlled by a Catholic religious order. How could people in the North want any part of a health service like that?
