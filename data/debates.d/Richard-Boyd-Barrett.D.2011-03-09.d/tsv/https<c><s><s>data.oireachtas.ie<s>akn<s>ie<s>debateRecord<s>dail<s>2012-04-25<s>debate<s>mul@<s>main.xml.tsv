RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These two amendments, relating to jobseeker's benefit and mortgage interest supplement, deal with two groups of people who have been hammered by the current recession - low-paid workers and people with mortgage difficulties.  I am concerned that amendments are introduced at the last minute and we have not had enough time to consider the possible ramifications.  We do not have sufficient time to table amendments and debate the matters properly.  These provisions could have an adverse effect on two sections of society that have already been hammered and do not need to be hammered further.The change to jobseeker's benefit just looks like a cut to the low paid.  What is the rationale for introducing such an amendment at such a late stage?  Can the Minister give us a guarantee that people, who will now lose entitlement to mortgage interest supplement as a result of this amendment, will not find themselves in greater difficulty if the banks are unwilling to facilitate them with some sort of moratorium on their interest payments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about jobseeker's benefit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From where is the Minister reading this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The more one looks at this, the more one realises how unacceptable it is that this debate is being limited in the way it has been and that these amendments have come forward so late leaving us with so little time to consider them and put forward further proposals.  We are dealing with a serious issue that affects a growing and vulnerable group of people who find themselves with mortgage difficulties.I agree with the Minister and others that anything we can do to put pressure on the banks to engage with borrowers and people in difficulty is the right and necessary thing to do.  However, when we look at this, the onus is almost entirely on the borrower rather than the banks.  Correct me if I am wrong, but under this provision, even if borrowers make an arrangement with the bank and comply with that arrangement, they lose a year's mortgage interest supplement because it is not paid until a year after entering an arrangement.  Is that correct?  Unless it is backdated, it is lost.  The Minister should return to this and explain it, because it is certainly not clear here.  Also, there are no corresponding measures in the legislation that will compel the lender to engage, but that is where we should put the pressure.Deputy Collins put it best suggesting that would be the way to go.  As soon as somebody finds himself in need of mortgage interest supplement and is granted such a supplement, the pressure should then be on the Government to force the banks to engage with the borrower, or perhaps it should give authority to groups like MABS to do that.  We must think carefully about how to do this.  We must in some way force the banks to engage.  Currently, there is no obligation on the banks to engage or to engage in a reasonable way.  Given that the borrower will not get mortgage interest supplement unless he has entered into such an arrangement and has been in such an arrangement for 12 months, the banks have the whip hand to compel borrowers to sign up to an arrangement that might not even suit them well.  The conditions may be too difficult, too onerous or unsustainable for them.  The banks will want as much as they can get and will want to pressurise the borrowers into agreeing to giving the bank the most it can get from them.  The banks have the whip hand in that regard because the borrowers may feel under pressure to sign up to an unsustainable arrangement on the basis that only by doing so they will be entitled to mortgage interest supplement.There are many problems in this regard and we have only had a short time to thrash them out and consider the full implications.  While there is a reasonable aspiration on the part of the Minister to ensure that if we are paying money to the banks, some pressure is applied to the banks.  However, it is highly questionable whether this amendment succeeds in that objective.  It may have unintended and adverse consequences for borrowers in mortgage difficulties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We agree with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will it be backdated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The more one listens to this debate, the more one realises that it would not be a three-way problem if we just nationalised the banks we have recapitalised.  We could then square the circle properly and force the banks, as they should be forced, to engage reasonably and fairly with people who are in mortgage difficulties primarily because of the banks' activities.  However, the previous Government did not do so and neither will the current one.The politicking between Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael-Labour Government is beside the point and trivialises the matter, if the Minister does not mind me saying so.  Regardless of what the last Government did, and I might agree with the Minister on those points, the key question applies to people in mortgage difficulties now and who might require mortgage interest supplement.  They should not find themselves in more difficulties as a result of this legislation being passed.We agree that the banks should be put under pressure to engage and the sum of €50 million is a significant amount, but does the Minister envisage a saving as a result of this?  Is that budgeted into this matter?  If so, it might colour whether we understand this to be a cut masquerading as something else.  Is the Minister envisaging a saving?  She is shaking her head, so maybe she could confirm in her reply that she does not anticipate any saving as a result of this measure.Can she clarify one point concerning someone who loses their job who would otherwise have applied for and received the mortgage interest supplement, but now cannot access it and must engage with the bank to come to some arrangement?  Is it correct that such persons will not receive mortgage interest supplements unless they have entered into an engagement and have complied with it for 12 months?  Is that not what this amendment says?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Right.  Therefore, in order to receive the supplement one must engage with the bank and be in an arrangement for 12 months before accessing the mortgage interest supplement.  Will the interest that has built up in that 12-month period be paid and backdated?  The borrower will lose out unless there is some obligation on the bank, as a result of this legislative change, to write off interest arrears that might have built up in the 12 months when that person was not entitled to mortgage interest supplement.  Can the Minister clarify that issue?I do not see why the Minister cannot accept that point.  In order to be fair to the borrower, a loud and clear message should go out from the Minister to everybody who might lose their job and find themselves in mortgage difficulties, to engage with their bank.  If, however, the bank will not engage reasonably and fairly, the borrowers should not worry because they have done their best by trying to engage in the process.  They should be told not to worry about mortgage interest arrears arising because the Government will put pressure on the banks.  If people are not reassured they will continue to worry if banks are not engaging fairly, reasonably or at all.  The best way to do this is by putting pressure on the banks.The Minister says her Department relates to the borrower, not the bank, but she also says the bank is the target of this legislation.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, there is no way to see this other than that the borrower is being used as a pawn between the Department and the banks.  Is that fair?  Is it the right approach to use the borrower as a pawn if, as the Minister says, the target is the banks?  Why not go directly to the banks instead of using the distressed borrower as a pawn?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of the points have been made but like other Deputies, I believe the Minister should delete this section.  When one looks at the combination of measures in the budget which were directed at lone parents, one would have to conclude that, in a quite malicious way, lone parents were attacked with the deliberate intention of driving them out of the workforce or that these measures were based on complete and utter ignorance of the nature of lone parents and people in receipt of lone parents' payments.From the point of view of a Government which is cutting everywhere, I can see an austerity rationale behind both explanations.  One is that we will drive lone parents out of work because we want to free up certain types of employment to get people off the live register and the various other schemes we are cooking up to ensure the figures for long-term unemployment are kept down.  That is one possibility.  It would not surprise me.  For example, community employment, CE, schemes became good projects and communities made them their own.  When they were first introduced, however, there was justified suspicion that they were meant to massage the long-term unemployment figures.If these measures were not introduced to drive lone parents out of the workplace, they were introduced through ignorance of the real character of lone parents.  I suspect this may have been the case.  To justify the lowering of the age threshold, the Minister and its other defenders state that the current system has not managed to lift lone parents out of poverty and that a disproportionate number of them live in or are affected by poverty.  The implication is that, given the fact that lone parents are not working, they need to be incentivised to work.  The key point is that 60% of them are working and they do not need to be incentivised by reducing their payments.The Government was guilty of having the same stereotypes of lone parents that had persisted for a long time, that is, people are sort of welfare queens sucking off the social welfare system and they must be driven off their dependency on social welfare and forced to work.  The Bill's provisions will have the opposite effect.  The campaigning of the lone parent organisations established in recent months and of groups such as SPARK, One Family and Treoir, which have shoved the reality of the experience and character of lone parents in the Government's face, forced the Government to acknowledge last week that it got this matter wrong and that implementing the cuts contained in this Bill without having the necessary child care system in place would be detrimental and drive lone parents out of work.  We need a Scandinavian model of child care if the Bill is not to drive lone parents out of work.Having made this acknowledgement, the logical next step is to delete this section.  One cannot make this cut on the basis of promises of pie in the sky.  Virtually everyone in Irish society, including myself, would love to see a Scandinavian model of child care being in place by the end of this year.  I differ from some of those who claim it would not be possible, in that I believe it would be possible were there a real will and determination to make it happen.  However, significant resources would be required.  This defies credibility, given the fact that this idea is coming from a Government that is slashing, burning and cutting left, right and centre and is committed to considerable further budget cuts in the next two years under the EU-IMF austerity programme.  If we pass the fiscal treaty, we will be required to make even more severe budget cuts in subsequent years.  From where will the Government get the money and resources to put in place a Scandinavian child care model?  The Minister and I would like to see such a model.  Ireland did not put it in place when the Celtic tiger was in full swing, yet the Minister is telling the House that she will have it in place within six months at a time when austerity butchery is cutting everything.  The Minister does not honestly believe it will be done.I hope a trick is not being played on people and that this is not a case of the Government agreeing to do something and acknowledging the problem under pressure, yet implementing the cuts as planned in the hope that people will have forgotten by December its promise about putting in place a Scandinavian child care model.  We will not forget.  Since the Government entered into office, that we are committed to having such a model by December is the one good development of which I have heard.  It will be brilliant and neither I nor parents can wait.  However, there is no justification for making this cut without that model being in place, as doing so will immediately drive people out of work.If a person's relationship breaks down next week and he or she has a 12 year old child, he or she will not be entitled to receive lone parent's allowance.  The Minister acknowledged this last week.  If that person has or is considering getting a part-time job, he or she will become disadvantaged and will be encouraged to return to full dependency on social welfare, given the lack of adequate, affordable or even free - it should be free, since it is free in Sweden - child care.  Other people will be affected as the various phases of these cuts kick in during the coming year as envisaged in Bill.Given the logic of the Minister's comments in the Dáil last week, section 4 should be deleted and should only be re-inserted after the enthusiastically awaited Scandinavian model of child care is in place in December.  Goodness me, we might even support her implementation of some of these measures at that point, but there is no justification or logic for implementing them prior to that time.  On their own, they can have no other effect but to drive lone parents out of the workforce and into full dependency on social welfare.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not flat taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What did I say?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is under the existing scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister was being very disingenuous in her responses to the points raised by some of us on this side of the House.  I was scratching my head trying to work out what was this terrible phrase that had been used with the very dishonest implication on the Minister's part that somehow I was using this terrible term and I could not quite figure out what it was.  What I was referring to was a term that was very frequently used to stigmatise lone parents and I was pointing out that lone parents were stigmatised-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister might as well dream here as in bed if she thinks I will apologise to her.  She must be joking.  She should apologise-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was a term-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  She asked me to apologise and I said she might as well dream here as in bed as ask me to apologise.  I will not be apologising.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Minister should do, instead of throwing up smokescreens - by the way that term was a term used in America to stigmatise social welfare recipients-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, in America and well the Minister knows it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, big deal, you have not heard it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is she being allowed make political points?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am dealing with the subject matter.  Why did the Acting Chairman not pull her up for speaking out of turn?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Acting Chairman addressing me or the Minister?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are you looking at me instead of looking at the Minister?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She was interrupting me when I was making my contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not.  I was wondering why you allowed the Minister to interrupt me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not be apologising to you or to this House but I would-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is going on here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am beginning to wonder what is going on here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will address the Chair in my own way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister should apologise for launching this vindictive, socially regressive attack on lone parents, which is coupled with the vindictive and socially regressive attacks on lone parents launched in the last budget and which will do nothing but punish a section of our society that is already suffering disproportionately from poverty but which is struggling.  It is a section of our society that is struggling to participate as fully as possible.  All of the points made by the Minister precisely indicated that the stigma to which I referred when I used the unusable term which was applied to lone parents, is still alive and well within the Government.The Minister says we need lone parents to become financially independent and we must encourage them to participate fully in society.  Lone parents are already doing that and that is the point we are making to the Minister and that is the point that SPARK and other groups associated with or made up of lone parents have been making since her budget announcements.  Lone parents are working and they want to work and they do not want the Minister to put in place measures that will drive them out of work.  The measures she has introduced, by lowering the thresholds on the income disregards, by getting rid of the concurrent payments and now, through the course of this Bill, reducing entitlement to one-parent payments once children reach the age of seven years or ten or 12, as will be the case, starting next week, will drive lone parents out of work.I have been receiving furious texts from the SPARK group since this debate commenced.  They ask me to respond to the Minister's attempt to suggest that those of us on this side of the House were trying to create a special category of lone parents and that the Minister, on the other hand, was very concerned, that every parent should be regarded the same rather than making a special category of lone parents.  She was trying to deflect in some way the blame and responsibility onto those of us who are being critical of this Bill.  The furious texts say that clearly the Minister does not understand that lone parents have very specific difficulties and problems resulting from the fact that they are lone parents.  To say that is not in any way to cast aspersions on lone parents or to create divisions between lone parents and families based on couples but simply to state the fact that there are more options for juggling responsibilities between a couple.  It is a different situation for a parent on his or her own because one will not have those options.  The juggling options are not there.  Unless a lone parent has supports, he or she cannot go out to work or access education, training or whatever.  The reason lone parents and their supporting organisations are up in arms and have stated categorically that this section of the Bill should be withdrawn is because they know it will drive lone parents out of work.  That is the reality of the situation.As has been said by other speakers, the Minister acknowledged this fact last week by saying that these cuts should not go ahead until the Scandinavian model of child care was in place.  It is not in place but for some people the impact of this Bill will start next week and that is the point.  A new applicant for one-parent family payments with a child who is 12 years or older who applies next week, will not qualify for the payments.  As of next January, this will apply to those lone parents with children aged ten years and as of the following year, new applicants will not qualify once they have children over the age of seven years.  That is the fact.  The cuts start now because of this Bill.  Frankly, even sunset clauses do not resolve the problem.  The Minister must withdraw this Bill until there are adequate supports and the Scandinavian model of child care which we all so earnestly wish to see, is in place and they we can talk about the possibility of reducing these supports that at some level, inadequate as they are, have helped 60% of lone parents to get into the workforce where they want to be.     We should not be thinking about removing the supports that helped them to get into the workforce, rather, what extra supports we could provide to get the other 40% into work.  No such supports are provided for in this Bill, however.How can we pay for the Scandinavian model while the Government side of the House is against the necessary taxes?  I have never heard of anything so preposterous.  We are sick and tired of saying we want to see higher income taxes - which are progressive because they are based on ability to pay - to finance our public services.  We have clearly stated this.  In addition, we are in favour of higher taxes on the 5% in this country who own 40% of the wealth.  It is not hypothetical wealth, it is real and we believe it should be taxed.The Minister is part of a Government that keeps repeating a meaningless mantra, which states: "You can't impose higher taxes on wealth because it is a tax on jobs."  Every time Ministers say that, I scratch my head and wonder what they are talking about.  What does that mean?  I still have not figured it out, but maybe the Minister could explain it.We are positively in favour of the Scandinavian model and would not have a problem with a section of income tax revenue being earmarked to finance our local authorities.  We would welcome that, but the Government is not in favour of progressive taxation on income and wealth.  That is why we do not have the money to fund Scandinavian-style public services.  It is a Government of regressive stealth charges.An opinion poll in the newspapers this week compared the Government's policy to ours.  It asked members of the public if they were in favour of stealth taxes - including household and water charges, which the Minister favours - or whether they were in favour higher taxes on income based on ability to pay.  The poll results showed that more than 60% were in favour of our policy.  Once upon a time, Labour used to believe in that policy but has now betrayed it.  Or perhaps the party does not have the courage to argue for it because tax is a hot potato.The Irish public are intelligent and they can be persuaded and convinced of the necessity for higher taxes on income and wealth if they are fair, progressive and will finance quality public services.  That is what we are in favour of but it is dishonest of the Minister to suggest otherwise.Water and household charges are regressive stealth taxes that disproportionately hit the least well off.  We have an unfair tax regime that has always protected the rich and those on higher incomes, while disproportionately hitting those at the bottom.  It is also the reason our public services are in bits.  The Government should levy taxes on wealth and higher incomes that could finance quality public services.  Until that happens, the Minister should remove this austerity cut directed at lone parents who suffer disproportionately from poverty, as she has acknowledged.  They will be driven out of work if these measures go through.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is being disingenuous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was talking about the stigma that is applied as well the Minister knows.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not using it.
