RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that one of the most pressing issues facing people is the massive unemployment crisis, the fact that close to half a million people are without work and many are leaving because there is no work.  The programme for Government stated that job creation was central to any recovery strategy.  Given that the public sector recruitment embargo means a slow grinding attrition of jobs, demand is being depressed in the economy because of cuts in income and pay and the bank recapitalisation means the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the banking sector, where does the Taoiseach see his commitment to job creation in the programme for Government being realised?  How will the Taoiseach create jobs as he committed to do in the programme for Government given that everything happening in terms of austerity is working in the opposite direction and is leading to a jobs massacre?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What targets does the Taoiseach have for net job creation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was surprised to hear the Minister state that the effective rate is 11.9%.  Perhaps he can clarify the source of the figure because other figures were outlined in the Private Members' debate on this issue which indicated that the effective rate was approximately 10%.  Can he confirm whether the fleets of company cars which are given to highly paid executives in highly profitable companies continue to be written down for tax purposes so that companies can sidestep some of their corporation tax liabilities?  Given the sacrifices being made by ordinary workers and vulnerable people dependent on our public services, is it fair that profitable companies which make hundreds of millions of euro per year pay a lower proportion of tax on their earnings than the workers who clean the floors of their buildings?  How can the Minister morally justify that in the current circumstances?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should swanky company cars be taken out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	"Love" is a strong word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Clare Daly, Catherine Murphy, Shane Ross, Mattie McGrath and Thomas Pringle, by agreement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is nothing surer than the need for political reform.  The people of this country desperately want reform and for their politicians to be brought down to earth, taken out of the bubble of the Houses of the Oireachtas and planted with their feetfirmly in the ground where ordinary citizens are forced to suffer the effects of bad political decisions.In the context of the obvious need for accountability and politicians who are responsive to the needs and wishes of the public, this Bill and almost anything the Members of this Dáil might say is virtually irrelevant because of the EU-IMF package which hands over the control of this country to the unaccountable representatives of bankers and bondholders who care nothing about ordinary people.  This Bill merely shifts the deck chairs on the sinking Titanic of the economy and Irish society.  It does not even proceed in the direction of addressing the need for political reform.  The measure to ensure by-elections are called within six months is reasonable, if overdue, and it is also reasonable to reduce the spending limits on presidential elections.  I support the abolition of the Seanad because it is an elitist institution which does not represent every sector of society.  The question remains of how to develop a political system that genuinely represents the people.  Can we achieve that aim by providing less democracy and public representation or do we need more democracy and better and more responsive representation?  The Seanad should be replaced by another tier of democracy composed of genuinely elected representatives of all sectors of society.  As non-professional politicians, these representatives would not be paid but they would have real powers over local services and issues, as well as oversight of this House.The plan to reduce the number of Deputies goes in the wrong direction.  Savings of €3 million have been suggested as the maximum that can be achieved from this measure.  We all want to cut the cost of government but, given the obscene level of remuneration that many politicians and Ministers receive, why do we not cut their pay?  We could save far more than €3 million by cutting the pay of politicians.  If we did so, they would also be more responsive to ordinary people because the big problem is that they are unaffected by the decisions they make over the lives and incomes of others.  If our pay and conditions were more closely aligned to that of the average citizen, perhaps this House would be more representative of the needs and aspirations of ordinary people.  To put it simply, instead of reducing the number of public representatives we should be cutting politicians' pay, expenses and leaders' allowances.  It would not only be fair in itself to cut the pay of politicians at a time when they are slashing the incomes of ordinary people, but it might also make them more wary of imposing austerity on those who cannot afford it.
