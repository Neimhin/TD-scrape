RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fundamental principle in supporting children and families with special needs should be that they get support based on their needs, but that is not what is happening. What is actually happening is the rationing of resources, and then inadequate resources that are not based on the actual needs of children in schools are stretched to the point that they do not provide the support that is necessary. It is not acceptable to treat SNAs with the contempt they have been shown during the period of the pandemic. At one point, SNAs were just informed they were going to work in nursing homes. It was as if the virtual supports they were giving to children with special needs were somehow irrelevant and then there was back-tracking on that plan. The pay is pathetic. We need to treat SNAs with respect and we need to have supports for children with special needs that are based not on the rationing of inadequate resources but on the needs of children and providing schools with supports, and of course to address the shocking backlogs in assessment, which are especially acute in particular areas. The people who are protesting outside would like to know that the Taoiseach is taking seriously their issues and the hardships they are suffering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Notwithstanding the U-turn the Government was forced into on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and travel I do not think the Government really gets the anger that is being felt by the economic victims of the Covid-19 measures. I have been trying to explain to the Taoiseach and to other Government spokespeople for weeks now that there are particular cohorts of people who have been savaged, decimated and put on their knees because of the economic consequences of public health measures. These people are likely to face the devastation of their livelihoods for the foreseeable future through no fault of their own. They are taxi drivers, people in the arts, music and live entertainment, as well as the crews behind the scenes in those areas. To that list one might add people in the bar sector. The Government has completely shafted those people, who faced the same hardship as everybody else and who are still facing it. Let us start with taxi drivers. Taxi drivers are now being whipped back to work because of the cuts the Government has imposed on the PUP via the new conditions. The work available to them is about 20% of what was available pre-Covid because their livelihoods are linked to tourism, music, live entertainment, theatres and so on. This will be the case for the foreseeable future. What has the Government given them in the Bill debated last night or in the Bill before the Dáil today? I am trying to get in an amendment in respect of the latter but apparently I cannot. My amendment deals with a question, namely, whether the Government gives taxi drivers access to the wage subsidy scheme as a step-down payment in the same way it has given companies access. The answer is "No". The Government has given taxi drivers nothing. Did it give them access to the restart grant? The answer is "No". Did it give them measures that would not even have costed the Exchequer anything, such as the ten-year expiry date on their vehicles being extended to 15 years? The answer is "No". The Government has given taxi drivers nothing; it has shafted them. They are suffering through no fault of their own. The same is true for arts workers. Musicians have been shafted as well. They do not get the grants, they do not get an income subsidy and now they have had their pandemic unemployment payments cut. What is the Government doing for these people who are suffering and are likely to suffer as a result of the economic fallout of measures the Taoiseach's Government has imposed? The answer so far has been nothing. It is not fair and it is not right. I can tell the Taoiseach that the Government is storing up a big revolt among these sectors of society unless some supports are offered to them this week. They are angry. A lot of them are people who used to vote for Fianna Fáil and they are angry. There are going to be protests unless the Government does something. It is driving a coach and horses through the principle that we are all in it together. Unless the Government gives these groups some support, it is stabbing them in the back. So far they have got nothing. When I have asked about this in the Dáil over the past few weeks, the Taoiseach and other Government spokespeople have wittered on and said that these groups would get some of the business grants. This morning their representatives called both the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation asking whether they could access the business grants. The answer was "No". Why are they being refused? Why are companies getting these grants and a taxi driver cannot? It is not fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we have a brief supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Taoiseach in advance of the Bill tonight, and I know it is late but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Bill tonight. I ask that the Government amend it to make the income subsidies available to employers available to the self-employed in sectors such as the arts, music, live entertainment and taxi drivers. They are having their pandemic unemployment payments cut but, unlike other people, whom Government is trying to encourage to maintain their relationship with employment, there is no step-down subsidy for them. They want to work but no work is available for them or there is very little work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just asking this because it is very important. Will the Taoiseach please give them an income subsidy scheme or a step-down scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not getting it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit is one of a minority of political parties in the Dáil that have elected representatives in the North and the South. We have representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly and in councils in the North. The reason is that we believe in ending partition and uniting this island, not because we are bleary eyed nationalists but because we are internationalists and oppose partition in the tradition of James Connolly. James Connolly understood how one developed a tradition of a shared island and why partition was about dividing people and setting them against each other, which would lead, as he correctly predicted, to a carnival of reaction with green and orange at each other's throat. He argued, and it is as relevant today as it was he first made the argument, that one must unite working people on the things they have in common to break the shackles of partition and empire. What does that mean today? I will give two concrete examples. We will never convince people in the North to be part of a united Ireland unless we have a national health service. We must move immediately to a national health service, not back to the two-tier system as the Government is doing currently. Why on earth would people in the North join a dysfunctional two-tier health system? They will not do it, so we must move immediately to a national health service. Second, we must immediately separate church and State. Why on earth would people in the North join a state where 90% of the schools are controlled by the Roman Catholic Church? There is no chance they will do it. We still tolerate a situation where the Religious Sisters of Charity are closing down nursing homes on the Merrion Road because, for some reason, a religious organisation controls nursing homes and can close them down even though they are funded by the State. Why on earth would people join a state that allows that to happen? These are the things we must do if we want to share the island and convince people that overcoming historical divisions is in their interest. That is how we will do it. People in the North are angry about the state of their health service. They would like to fight for a new and better National Health Service where people get access to healthcare on the basis of their need, not on the size of their wallets or the austerity that has been imposed on the service. They would also like to be in an education system in which everybody is treated equally. We could share that education system and have integration of our children. If we lead the way in progressive, radical change such as that, in the tradition of James Connolly, we will become an attractive option for the idea of ending partition and uniting this island.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. The wage subsidy scheme is a good scheme in principle, which tries to ensure that people who lost jobs and income as a result of the Covid-19 measures have a road back to employment, retain their relationship with their employment and have some sort of income support to sustain them through the very difficult period of the lockdown, when people, collectively and based on the principle that we are in it together, endured very significant hardship to protect our society from the virus. While it is correct to look to extend that scheme to protect people, the Minister's failure to provide support for particular sectors, namely, those hardest hit by the measures taken to protect us from the pandemic, is destroying the solidarity that existed and threatens to undermine the principle that we are all in it together. This is a very dangerous thing to do when it is very likely that there will be a second wave of infections and further spikes. If there is a second wave and we have to call once again on people to come together and make sacrifices for the common good, the Minister will have done extreme damage to the goodwill of those who are being hung out to dry in the current situation, where he has started to dismantle the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, support scheme without putting anything its place for particular groups. The Minister can probably guess which groups I am talking about because I have been referring to them repeatedly for weeks. In the case of two of those sectors, I fought very hard to get their representatives in front of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, where they presented their case. However, it appears that the Government is just not listening and I do not understand why that is the case. The two groups are, first, people in the arts, music, live entertainment and the events sector and, second, taxi drivers. Both of these groups have been given no roadmap to full recovery of their incomes and they are being savaged by the cuts to the PUP. This morning alone, I had ten emails from taxi drivers who have had their payment cut. I am inundated, as I expect many Deputies are, by correspondence from musicians and others in the arts sector who have had their payments cut. I was able to get their representatives before the committee, where they explained their plight and begged, urged and appealed to the Government to provide them with an income subsidy until such time as the sectors in which they are employed fully recover. The Government has ignored them. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider, even at this late stage, and to provide them with specific supports. Their requests are very reasonable and he could have met them in this Bill. I tried to submit amendments but encountered difficulties. The Opposition has bent over backwards to accommodate the Government by waiving pre-legislative scrutiny and allowing guillotines on all the Bills that need to be put through.Some of the amendments I submitted earlier were refused because they were too late, even though I submitted them before Second Stage. That is unfair. It is not the Minister's fault but I appeal to him to address this matter, even at this late stage. If employers can get a wage subsidy, why can taxi drivers, who are their own employers, not get the same? Why can they not get an income subsidy when their business has collapsed by approximately 80%, which is much more than the required percentage to benefit from the wage subsidy that employers are getting? The Minister can ask any taxi driver who is going out looking for work at the moment. They are getting a fraction of the work, because their previous work was strongly linked to the sectors most hard hit, such as tourism, music, live entertainment, theatres and bars that are now closed. That was a significant volume of their work. It is now gone and they are, therefore, struggling. Taxi drivers have made a few requests, some of which do not even require money. They asked for a step-down income subsidy, which the Government could have put in this Bill; a moratorium on the further issuing of taxi licences, given that we have more taxis in this city than in New York city; the ten-year rule for replacing their cars to be changed to 15 years because of all the income they have lost; and to benefit from the restart schemes, from which they are being excluded. They still have fixed costs to cover such as insurance, paying taxi companies and other fixed costs, which were estimated in one recent report to be €11,000 a year. They are being denied even the €1,000 grant from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, never mind the €4,000 grant that is being given to other businesses. How is that fair? I ask the Minister to provide some support for these workers. The Government's failure to support a particular cohort of taxi drivers is endangering lives and public health, because older taxi drivers aged over 66 did not get the PUP and continued to work during the pandemic, thus endangering their own health when they should have been cocooning. Many of them decided to stop working but are now being whipped back out to work when they do not feel safe doing so. That is unfair and it endangers the public health effort as well as those drivers' specific health. I appeal to the Minister to engage with these workers and to provide them with some supports until their sector, which has been decimated through no fault of their own, recovers. Similarly, musicians, artists, crews and so on need some support for their sector as well. In many cases, they are not benefiting from the grants and their income supports have been cut due to the PUP cuts. I refer to people who play music in bars or bands that do weddings. There are restrictions on the number of people that can go to weddings, and fewer people are likely to get married in the current circumstances, so there is less work for them. There might be a bit of work available and they might get the odd gig, but it is nothing like it was previously. They need an income subsidy, which is a floor below which they will not go and which they can earn a bit on top of. That is the same principle the Government is applying to employers, so why can it not apply it to these sectors that have been especially hard hit? The Government should do that because its treatment of these workers contrasts with the way it is treating employers. Money is being thrown at employers liberally. I assume the reason the Government will not give money to arts workers and taxi drivers is that it is afraid they will scam the system. When I asked earlier why the Government was not supporting them, the Taoiseach said that such supports were hard to administrate. That is code for the Government being afraid it will be scammed. This is the same impulse that led to the cuts in the PUP, the travel advice debacle and so on. Basically, the Government thinks that lower-income workers and the less well off are going to scam the system. That is the bias that is operating here, whereas we will throw billions of euro at big businesses and are not too worried about whether they might be scamming us. Many of those businesses are profitable. There are no provisions in this Bill to ensure that big businesses, which are making significant profits, are not ripping us off and taking advantage of the subsidy scheme. There is no scrutiny there and they are not excluded while others are. It is not fair. I appeal to the Minister to be fair, first, because fairness is important in and of itself but, second, because we are all in this together. The social solidarity we will need in the face of Covid-19 for the foreseeable future will be absolutely wrecked if the Government continues in this manner. Many of these workers have expressed a lot of anger and despair about this.  Finally, employers that are being given the subsidy should not get it unless they recognise trade unions. If they are guilty of collective redundancies, unilateral pay cuts or taking advantage of this wage subsidy, they should not get it. There should be conditions attached to big and profitable businesses benefiting from this subsidy to guarantee the rights of workers. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be glad if the Minister did respond to some of the points raised on Second Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we speak on the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we turn on the microphones?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can go section by section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is how it works.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to speak on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Minister will respond on the section. Section 1 deals with definitions. The problem with one definition is that it refers to employers only in terms of the wage subsidy scheme, WSS. As I pointed out on Second Stage, many people need an income subsidy but they are not employers or they are their own employer, that is, they are self-employed or lone traders. This group, to put it bluntly, has been left hung out to dry in the July stimulus. They should get the benefit of an income subsidy. I would like the Minister and Government to explain why this is happening. Some sectors have been decimated by public health measures that have protected us all, and people's willingness to adhere to them. Why are employees now being betrayed - there is no other way to describe it - by having their PUP payments cut without being offered an alternative support until their sector recovers? The Government owes these people an explanation. They are very angry. I spoke to Mary Coughlan on the telephone. She was quite happy for me to cite her as an example. Her case is typical of many self-employed artists. They have had their PUP payments cut from €350 to €203. She pointed out that pre-Covid she earned €20,000 a year, which is a modest income. As a result of Covid and the public health measures, she has had 35 concerts cancelled in Britain, Norway, Finland and elsewhere. She has no idea when there will be any substantial recovery in the gigs available to her. This is all because of public health measures. We need to protect our society, but her livelihood is gone.  Her story is repeated by dozens of people working in the sector. Lighting designers and self-employed musicians were earning €25,000 or €30,000 a year. Their payments have been cut to €203 despite the fact that they were earning in excess of €200 a week because of the way income for the self-employed is reckoned by Revenue. I could go through a long list of those affected, but I do not have time to mention them all. Many musicians, including Mary, pointed out to me that they regularly do gigs for Pieta House, women's refuges and support various good causes for free on national television.Then, when a moment comes for a bit of reciprocal solidarity from the Government, the artists, musicians and the crew standing beside them are cut loose. I really want the Minister to understand that the mental health trauma a lot of these people are going through is severe. The musicians' association that has been set up with 4,000 members is saying a large number of musicians and crew are suffering from serious stress, anxiety and mental health issues because their incomes have been slaughtered but they have no way to get back to full earning capacity.  They have appealed, as have I on their behalf for weeks now, for an income subsidy the same as the Minister is giving to employers. They are not asking for handouts but for the same income subsidy scheme, or similar, to the ones the Minister is providing for employers. If they lost 30% of their turnover, he is paying the wages of their employees. Why can he not do that for the musicians, crew, artists and actors? It is wrong. Why can he not do it for taxi drivers who are in the same boat? They are having their payments cut again. I can read out the names. They have had them cut, and more will be cut as a result of what the Minister did yesterday. They are now being whipped back to work but there is no work for them. They are asking for an income subsidy the same as the Minister was giving to thousands of, often profitable, companies. Will he please do that? It is relevant to this section, because there is no reference to this group in the definitions section but there should be, because that is what "We are all in it together" means. Or is it that we are all in it together but some people are more all in together than other people, to paraphrase George Orwell. It is rotten and it is a breach of the trust and solidarity that the Minister preached and people bought into over the past number of months because these people have served our society and now, they are being cut loose and betrayed. I appeal to him to please respond and tell us what he will do to help these people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Doherty is giving way. First, I hope the Minister knows that I do not do personal and my comments were not in any way personalised. I know the Minister has good taste in music and that he understands the plight of musicians. The reason I used the word "betray", however, is because there are a number of groups who really bought in, as did the vast majority of society, to the notion of "We are all in it together". In doing that, they protected our society from Covid-19 overrunning our health services and saved lives. The stakes were high and everybody, and I include the Government and the Opposition in that, bought into that "We are all in it together" principle. To some extent, differences were set aside and the hardship and mental stress of the lockdown was accepted along with the income loss suffered by many, because people really felt that we were all in this together. What is happening now is that particular groups who made as much effort as anybody else are being left behind. That is what I meant by being betrayed. They are being forgotten about. If I sound a bit desperate to the Minister, it is because I and others have been raising those particular groups for weeks, it is now two days before the Dáil goes into recess and they do not know what they are going to do. Some people have certainty about what they are going to do over the summer. They know what their income is going to be and what the roadmap for the months ahead is going to be. They have some degree of certainty, although none of us have total certainty because in many ways, the virus is controlling our future at the moment. Nevertheless there is some form of roadmap. The Government, however, has not responded to people from these sectors despite them asking the Government again and again. This included making their case to the Special Committee on the Covid-19 Response, before which I fought to have them appear. I know the Minister understands but in his reply, he did not respond to the specific requests they have made. In my speech, I said that the wage subsidy scheme was a good one insofar as it sought to maintain the relationship between employer and employee. As such, the Minister was wrong to say I did not acknowledge this. I said it and I accept it. What I do not accept is why the Minister will not use this Bill to extend the income subsidy scheme or something similar to these particular groups of people, who cannot return to work through no fault of their own and whose employment and income has been decimated as a result of the Government-imposed public health measures, which they support for the most part. That is the question. I was speaking to Mary Coughlan on the phone before the debate and she said something which sums up the dilemma for people in these sectors. I would really like the Minister to address the specifics here because I am talking about substance and not politics here. As I told the Minister, Mary Coughlan was earning €20,000 before Covid, which is a very modest income. She was then on the €350 per week payment because all 35 of her gigs were gone. She has now been cut down to the €203 per week rate. She has recently been offered a few gigs in reduced venues including, for example, the Mermaid Arts Centre in Bray. There will only be room for 70 people in a room that used to take 300. Does the Minister know what the dilemma is for her? It is that if she takes that gig, which will not nearly recover her income, she will lose her payment. Is she actively seeking work if she refuses the gig? That is the question that needs to be answered. If she says no to it, the Minister could, under the current situation, accuse her of not actively seeking work. If she takes the gig she loses her payment. I say to the Minister this is not right. It is the same for the taxi driver, who should perhaps be cocooning and who is afraid to go out and work. Such drivers have now had their payment cut, however.They are going out working in the taxis. There are no proper guidelines from the NTA on safety in taxis. After weeks of pleading, they are still excluded from all of the grants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to drag this out but what I would like, although it is not about what I would like because I am not in this position and none of us in this room is, but those 23,000 taxi drivers and their families, and at least 30,000 or 40,000 musicians, crew, theatre practitioners, artists and performers of various kinds want an answer before the summer recess. Mary Coughlan wants an answer as to whether she should take the gig in the Mermaid Arts Centre. Will the Minister answer the question? We have been looking for answers on this for weeks. It is not as if it is new. He needs to give them the answers. Why are they not included in the groups of people who can benefit from the income subsidy under the definitions in this section? I am talking to the section. I sought to table an amendment to this section to include this group and it was ruled out of order, again for reasons I do not understand. They should be included. At this stage, because the Bill will be guillotined and rammed through to make sure everyone can go off on their holidays next week, it seems we cannot do anything about it. Will the Minister at least say we will do something and we will give them a basic minimum income, above and beyond which they can earn without losing it, in the same way as he is now doing for thousands of employers throughout the country? They will get the subsidy, they will be allowed to earn and at a certain point, it will be tapered. Nobody is asking for a handout. They are just asking for a floor below which they will not fall. In the case of some people, they are asking that they will not be whipped into working in unsafe conditions where it might be a threat to their health and public health. These are reasonable asks. They are asking for some of the grant schemes to be made available. They do not qualify for the schemes, even though they have the overheads, because they are not rateable and registered for VAT. Will the Minister please respond to these specific issues? I would not sound so desperate, and my desperation is nothing compared to the desperation these people feel. This is the request. Many of these people did not ask to be in this position. An awful lot of people who work in the arts would love to be directly employed, as a very small number are in the Abbey Theatre but there are only so many jobs in the Abbey Theatre. Perhaps if we had a proper national film industry, as we used to before we privatised all of the studios, some of these people would have jobs and they would be on the wage subsidy scheme. Some of them have been forced into being self-reliant and then they are punished for this fact. Genuinely, I am not trying to be personal but on behalf of these people, who are desperate, who are worried and who are suffering real mental anguish, will the Minister please give them some hope that he will respond to them before the Dáil finishes for the summer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment. It is another way to try to address the deficiencies in the Bill and the need for sectoral-specific approaches for those sectors hit harder than others. We have gone through the debate, and I do want to extend it, but I have one additional appeal to make to the Minister. He asserts, and it is a fact, that we cannot further amend this Bill now. In addition to the suggestion that he should talk to the NTA about the taxi drivers and listen to the points made concerning the arts, music and entertainment sectors, will he respond to the request that before the Dáil winds up for the summer there would be a meeting between party groups to look at those sectors? That is what this amendment is trying to do and it is right that we should have that sectoral-specific response. Even while listening to the debate, some of the people affected have been texting me with heart-breaking stories that I do not even want to read out here because they are so upsetting and personal. Those people are begging and it is a pity they have to do that. It would be very much appreciated, therefore, if the Minister responded positively to the suggestion made by Deputy Doherty earlier that we meet to discuss some of these specific issues before the Dáil recess. These issues are not limited, by way, to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. They cover several Departments, including the Minister's, as well as the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Business, Enterprise and Innovation. I refer to addressing these really difficult concerns. Turning briefly to this section, all my amendments have been ruled out of order. That is unfortunate and I do not quite know why. It is bad enough that we have had no pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill and that all Stages are being taken together. The Opposition, however, has bent over backwards to be accommodating. Then, our amendments, which I think are reasonable, to attach some conditions regarding workers' rights to the subsidies being given to employers have been ruled out of order. I do not understand why. If the Minister will respond, however, does he not think that there should be conditions applied to those getting substantial subsidies? Those subsidies are important and nobody here is arguing against them. We support them to keep people in employment, but there should also be some responsibility on the employer to recognise trade unions, if people in workplaces are members of trade unions. Certainly, anti-union companies should not get support without being forced to change their attitude towards workers and the right to be in a trade union.  Conditions, therefore, should be attached to these supports to ensure that employers are not engaging in unilateral redundancies, cuts in pay and attacks on working conditions without consulting their employees. The principle of the pandemic is that we are all supposed to be in this together, so employers should sit down with their employees and discuss any proposed changes. A basic condition of these supports should be that no company getting them should be making excessive profits or giving big bonuses or pay increases to CEOs, when other people, including workers and the self-employed, are really suffering. Nobody should be profiteering off the back of this crisis and these public supports, which we must not forget are paid for by all the people. Finally, in this section we had an amendment regarding the subsidy not applying in cases where people were earning less than €151.50 per week. I would like the Minister to explain that exclusion, because there is a real danger that employers may decide that if they do not get a subsidy for employees, who are often part-time and often women, working for only a few days and earning less than €151.50 that they will be the first to be let go. That would be unfair and would hit some of the most vulnerable lowest-paid workers. I do not understand why the Minister inserted that exclusion and I wish he would explain it. I ask him to ensure the scenario I described cannot happen and that those workers do not lose out because of the way the subsidy scheme has been designed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like an answer to the questions I asked on the section. There was a specific request to discuss those sectors that are in trouble before the Dáil session ends. Is the Minister open to that, given he expressed sympathy for the sectors mentioned? This amendment was attempting in another way, as had some of our amendments, to address the concerns of those groups that we have talked a lot about tonight, namely, the arts workers, the music workers, the defence workers and the taxi drivers. If the Minister is genuinely empathetic to their plight, is there an openness to discuss those matters with party groups or, indeed, with some of their representative groups before the end of the Dáil term or some point soon? The Minister did not really respond to the issue of conditionality raised by me and by Deputies Shortall and Nash in trying to attach some conditions in terms of collective bargaining rights, trade union rights and examining the profitability of some firms to ensure nobody is taking advantage and people are not getting the support they should not be getting. The Minister might just respond to those points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I really do not want to stretch this because I know Deputy Doherty wants to get to his amendment. What the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, told me was the direct opposite of what the Minister just said. I do not accept this pass the parcel. I talked to her the other day. I asked questions and she said insofar as the resources allocated to her have been made available, she had put in some supports. That was her point about the €25 million. When it came to the issue of income subsidies, she told me I needed to talk to the Ministers for Finance, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection. That is the truth. This pass-the-parcel stuff is not good enough. This is why it is totally relevant to this Bill. We need an answer. Will there be an income subsidy for all these people in the arts and music area? It is not just the artists; it includes the crews and so on. It is not just an arts issue. In fact, the events people are very keen to say they are not even defined as arts. It is about income supports for sectors that have been decimated by the pandemic measures. The same point goes for the taxi drivers. I ask the Minister not to pass it off to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. We need to know if the Government is even interested in looking at this. That is the question and an answer would really be appreciated.
