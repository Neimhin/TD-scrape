RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the Tánaiste's people in the former Soviet Union?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is not doing a good job in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste should tell that to the pensioners who are freezing in their homes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste suggested the Government has secured a deal on the promissory note that will give some relief to people.  Some of us believe this is a trick of the eye to ram through the fiscal treaty and that the Government is again conspiring with European Union leaders to deceive people and have the treaty passed.  Will the Tánaiste disprove this theory by showing some urgency on the concrete matters that affect people and specifically one of the worst austerity measures that has been pushed through by stealth, namely, the ending of the construction of social housing by a Labour Party Government?  In that regard, when will the housing Bill come before the House to give Deputies an opportunity to debate the decision of a Labour Party Government to effectively abolish council housing when 96,000 people are on housing waiting lists desperately waiting for homes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the legislation be introduced?  Will the Government reverse this austerity measure which means people do not even have a roof over their heads?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That shows the Government's urgency in the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Ross, Fleming, Wallace and Joan Collins.The Government's dishonesty in its attempt to deceive people on the issue of our debt burden and the fiscal treaty is really staggering.  We know the Government conspired with EU leaders to try to avoid the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  That was confirmed to us by the German European affairs minister.  When the Government could not avoid the referendum, it came up with a new dishonesty to deceive people into believing they are getting relief on the debt burden on the so-called promissory note.  In reality, it is not relieving that debt burden one bit, but in fact has made a sovereign debt of a crazy commitment - but only a commitment - made by Fianna Fáil to pay off the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank.  This makes less likely the possibility of the write down of that debt and guarantees that the debt is now foisted permanently on to the backs of working people and the vulnerable in our society.The key gimmick, to which the Sinn Féin motion refers, is to suggest that if people oppose the fiscal treaty, they will be cut off from funding from the European stability mechanism.  The Government has peddled this line over the last number of weeks, putting a gun to the heads of the Irish people to try to bully them into voting for the treaty, only to discover that in fact the gun does not exist.  It is in construction and the Government is party to constructing it.  That gun cannot be pointed at people's heads unless we pass the European stability mechanism through this Dáil.Will the Minister of State give an assurance that the Government will not point the gun at the heads of the Irish people and bully them into voting in favour of the fiscal treaty?  Will he assure us that the European stability mechanism legislation will not come in until after people have had the chance to vote on the fiscal treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister acknowledged, my original question was related not only to child protection teams, I also asked about child mental health teams, early intervention teams and disability teams, as well as the staff shortages in these areas.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to say, in a bureaucratic way, that they are within the remit of another Minister.  She is Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, not just Minister for child protection teams or social workers.The Government talks about the need for joined-up thinking and co-ordination and its commitment to child protection.  In her press release last Tuesday the Minister said there must be "robust safeguarding arrangements within all organisations working with children".  Therefore, there must be joined-up thinking and co-ordination.  We should be able to get an answer from the Minister on how the various services working with children are staffed, whether there are staff shortages and the problems they might cause.  The Irish Medical Organisation has reported massive shortages in child mental health teams.  For example, one team lost one third of its staff in the last year owing to retirements, staff going on maternity leave and redeployments.  It now has eight members of staff, instead of the 38 recommended in A Vision for Change and can do only emergency work.  It is part of the Minister's responsibility to say this is unacceptable.  Children are being put at risk as a result.I welcome the Government's commitment to publish the Children First guidelines, but what is meant by "shortly"?  Publication was promised before Easter.  Will publication be matched by the provision of resources?  How can we seriously talk about child protection if we have child mental health teams with eight staff instead of the necessary 38?  That is not child protection.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In so far as there is any progress, I welcome it.  Surely the whole point of the Ministry becoming a senior one is that it must have an overview of child protection.  In a certain sense the Minister should not respect ministerial demarcations because otherwise one could ask what is the point.  Talk of €16 million for priority cases and front-line services does not address the point that is being raised by the IMO, namely, that there are chronic shortages of staff for child mental health teams.The one example I have given the Minister is of a situation where there are only eight staff where A Vision for Change suggests 38 are necessary.  That is a chronic shortage.  It is difficult to see how children and teenagers who require those services are getting them.  In fact, we are being told the services are only taking emergency cases.  This is a real problem.  The Ministry must have an overview and must blow the whistle.  Otherwise, all the commitments in the world in Children First mean very little.
