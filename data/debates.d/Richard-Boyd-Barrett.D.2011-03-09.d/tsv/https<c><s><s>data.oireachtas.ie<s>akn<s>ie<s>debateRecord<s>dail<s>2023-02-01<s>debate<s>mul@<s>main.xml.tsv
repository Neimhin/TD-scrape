RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Joan Collins and the Independent Group for tabling this important motion. It is a welcome opportunity to discuss the impact of development on our communities across the country and the degree to which these communities are actually benefiting from the development that is occurring. We all understand that, as a matter of urgency, there has to be a significant development of housing. One thing that this motion points to is that the development that is happening is being driven by the profit hunger of property developers who see the housing crisis as an opportunity to make money. Consequently, we get development that does not particularly benefit the community or assist in addressing the housing crisis and where the stresses and pressures that that type of development then puts on communities actually reduce the quality of life and the environment of many in the localities in which those developments take place. Whereas they should be enhancing the quality of life and making things better for people, the opposite is often the truth. The last consideration is often precisely what the community needs. That does not just start with the development levies and how they are spent but with the development itself. I want to first point out that, given the scale of housing development that is needed and is hopefully likely to happen, in the areas where that development is occurring, we are not getting enough public and affordable housing in the various developments. The provision of 10% social housing is pathetic against the backdrop of the housing lists that we currently have. Even if we add in 10% affordable housing in new developments, that is pathetic. It means that in every private development, with private developers dictating what developments happen in my area and, I suspect, in most people's areas, some 80% of what is being developed is not affordable for ordinary working people. The only people who can buy properties are big funds or, sometimes, approved housing bodies, AHBs. I will come to that. By and large, they are buy-to-rent properties bought by big funds and rented at extortionate rates. The State often ends up paying the bill for them through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and housing assistance payment, HAP, even though the people who live in those places still do not have security in respect of where they live and often find themselves evicted further down the line. The first thing I want to add to this motion is this. If we are going to have a serious impact on the dire housing crisis we are now facing, we need a much bigger proportion of every private development that is completed to go to social and affordable housing. To my mind, there is no point whatsoever in building unaffordable housing. What possible benefit does it serve? To give one example, we have been criticised for opposing some developments in our area. One example is the co-living development that is near completion in Dún Laoghaire, built by Bartra on a former school site. We have been campaigning for public and affordable housing there for more than a decade. It was bought by a property developer who is now completing a co-living development where there will be 200 rooms that are the size of disability parking spaces with pull-out couches. It will cost €1,800 a month to rent them and tenants are only allowed to rent for six months, or it might be extended to a year. In other words, it contributes nothing to the housing need of the area. Ordinary people affected by the housing crisis will not be able to rent those places. It begs the question of who the hell could afford that or would want such a development. That is the kind of development that is going on. It is purely profit-driven. That has to stop. The quality of the housing is an issue. We have discussed the impact of the Celtic tiger on building defects. It may well be the case that the cowboy building of the Celtic tiger era is not behind us and is still going on. I will give another example. The Acting Chair, Deputy Devlin, may be interested in this. On Johnstown Road, a new development, much welcomed by many of the people to whom houses were allocated, was all bought up by an AHB. Within three months of the development completing, there is uproar among the residents over the quality of the build by the developers. Within three months, there is damp in the newly allocated social housing. Water is pouring into the underground car park. There is no lift in the underground car park, so people have to carry their shopping up two flights of stairs to get in, and there are issues for people with buggies or with mobility issues. There are major problems with the windows. The water going into the car park is also affecting the fire alarm system. Where the hell is the oversight of these developers who are still building stuff like that? It is unbelievable. That needs to be addressed and we need to stop the cowboy builders. Another example relates to residents of a number of units near Deansgrange that were bought for social housing by the local authority.People moved into Glebe Court thinking "happy days" because they had somewhere to live, but instead they have found that the place is wracked with damp because the heating systems are not working and there is no proper insulation on the doors and windows. People are literally shivering and freezing during the winter months. It is unbelievable stuff. These things need to be addressed by getting a proper share of the development levies to address them. Instead, it is as Deputy Mac Lochlainn said earlier. I was a co-host of the Oxfam event yesterday, as was Deputy Pringle. Where is all the wealth that Oxfam identified? It is in the hands of the new layer of multimillionaires and billionaires which Oxfam identified in its report. Often it is in the hands of the property developers and property speculators who built these substandard developments where these extortionate rents are being charged. They are profiting off the misery of communities through the extortionate rents associated with substandard building because we do not have proper planning and we do not have appropriate taxes to tax them to give people the community resources, the public services and all the things, including quality housing, that they deserve. I thank Deputy Joan Collins. I hope the Government will start to listen to the issues that are being raised here but I will not hold my breath.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Across the UK today, more than 2 million workers are on strike, including teachers; rail workers; higher-education workers; people who work on border checks in the North; and University and College Union, UCU, members. This follows a series of strikes by health workers. Some of the key issues driving this huge revolt of working people are issues they have in common with many workers in Ireland, namely pay increases that are, in effect, pay cuts because of the spiralling cost of living. When one considers the recent report by Oxfam, about which there was a briefing this week, which identified the fact that if the absolutely extraordinary growth in the wealth of the very richest people, the millionaires and billionaires in this country, was modestly taxed it could raise €8 billion in extra revenue, it could be used towards paying decent wages to workers, addressing the housing crisis and public services. Oxfam is arguing for this internationally. When one looks at the strikes and the cost-of-living crisis and how it is impacting on nurses, teachers and healthcare workers in Ireland, as well as in the UK and across Europe, will the Government look at taxing the wealth, which has seen extraordinary growth, the very richest people are enjoying and using it to address the cost-of-living crisis that the vast numbers of workers struggling to pay the bills and rent are facing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I heard the Taoiseach's responses earlier on the nursing home charges scandal. He defended the strategy that has been pursued by successive governments not to give people what they should be entitled to in respect of the huge outlays they have for nursing home charges. He defended that position and said the Government has never conceded the obligation to pay these charges. If that was the case, why did the Government need a legal strategy at all? Why did it have to settle with people? Why was there a memo stating that we had better keep these settlements quiet in case other people become aware that they would have a legal case against the Government for the refund of nursing home fees they had paid? Does this scandal not highlight the systematic policy on the part of a Government that is willing to give €64 billion to banks and bondholders and do anything to resist taxes on the rich such as the proposed wealth tax while denying ordinary, often very vulnerable, people who have suffered at the hands of or been let down by the State, whether it is the Brigid McCole case, CervicalCheck, the nursing home fees scandal or the mother and baby homes redress scheme we will discuss later where tens of thousands of people will be denied redress they should have as survivors of these homes, because the Government is penny pinching and creating arbitrary criteria to deny them the things they deserve to protect the interests of the wealthy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I noted that those in the Dáil for Leaders' Questions stood for a pause for peace. It is a very good thing that people would stand up and call for world peace. When we look at the horrific conflict that is taking place not only in Ukraine but also in Yemen, Syria, where we have seen the horrors, and many other parts of the world, I do not really understand how we can stand for peace and call for a pause for peace, on the one hand, but there is no sign from the Government of what is supposed to be a neutral country of our actually urging peace in the terrifying conflict taking place in Ukraine. The despicable character, as the Taoiseach called it, of Putin's invasion is beyond question. He is a tyrant, a warmonger and a bully and what he is doing is wrong but that does not mean that continually escalating the war is the solution because it has reached a terrifying level. As I mentioned last week, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which was set up by Einstein in 1945, has stated the clock towards nuclear annihilation is closer than it has ever been since the end of the Second World War. It is 90 seconds to disaster. That is where things seem to be going. President Zelenskyy is looking for tanks. Then he wants F-16 fighters. Where does it go? Is the Taoiseach worried about the possibility of this escalating to a nuclear confrontation which would be a disaster for everyone? Should Ireland not use its voice to call for de-escalation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not being blasé. It is death or glory though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Davos gathering of billionaires, political elites and multinational corporations that are staggeringly wealthy to discuss the future of the world is sort of nauseating in and of itself but at least it provides the opportunity for groups like Oxfam to highlight gross inequality and wealth and put forward proposals. As I mentioned earlier, and as we have done ever since I have been in this Dáil, we are putting forward proposals for a modest wealth tax on those very highest of earners. Oxfam has proposed a modest incremental wealth tax on the net assets of people who have wealth in excess of €4.7 million. This is not a tax, as the Taoiseach said earlier, on ordinary people. Some 95,000 people have that much wealth in this country. Would it not be reasonable to put a 2% or 3% wealth tax on that wealth to fund housing, health services and cost-of-living measures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I commend all those who have fought and campaigned, and continue to campaign with the emails they are sending to us in this House and particularly to the Government. They are appealing to it, even at this late stage, to rethink what it is doing and not to deny the survivors of mother and baby homes the closure and justice they deserve. After all they have suffered and been through and all they have had to fight for, this day should be the day when they get that closure and justice. Instead, as the Minister well knows, they will not get that. Tens of thousands of people will feel excluded and insulted. The abuse, suffering and injustice they endured at the hands of the church and the State for decades and decades continues if the Minister denies them that closure and that justice. This is not just an insult to those who are excluded on the arbitrary grounds on which the Minister has excluded; it is an insult to every mother and child who suffered forced separation in the mother and baby homes. It shows a singular failure on the part of the Government to understand what the crime and the abuse was that it can come up with this arbitrary, unjustifiable scheme which includes some, excludes others and has a league table including a price tag which commodifies your suffering. Does the Minister not understand how insulting that is for all the people have suffered? One of the particularly dark, terrible ironies of something else going on at the moment is that there are dark and sinister forces running around this city for the last few weeks who are claiming utterly falsely that vulnerable, desperate immigrants and asylum seekers are a threat to women and children in this State because they are foreigners. Those people need look no further than this House, the political institution that is supposed to represent the Irish people and the religious institutions. The Irish religious institutions and Irish political institutions orchestrated decades and decades of systematic abuse of mothers and children - not poor, desperate immigrants or asylum seekers - and the State is continuing to do this and to insult and abuse those who suffered. I searched the Minister's speech on Second Stage and his other speeches in vain for any justification by him of this arbitrary exclusion. I am an adoptee, as the Minister knows. I was born in a mother and baby home. I was in a couple of them, actually, because I was sent off to England to be ushered out of sight. The child of a fallen woman, an illegitimate child; that is how the mothers and the children were characterised. I was then brought back. I do not even know how long I was in a mother and baby home. It is irrelevant whether you were there for one week, one day, six months or two years because the central crime that church and State committed was the primal wound of separating a mother from their child which, from the moment it happens, has a lifelong affect on mother and child. It is the primal wound that begins on day one. I always say that my story turned out to be lucky. I was eventually reunited with my mother and I was adopted by a wonderful family. Regardless of whether your story of what happened is terrible - and for some it is absolutely terrible; they suffered all their lives because of the primal wound inflicted by church and State when they were boarded out, suffered abuse, as mothers were forced to work essentially as slaves, were shamed all their lives and had to endure the stigma of illegitimacy - the truth is that to a greater or lesser extent everyone had a crime committed against them from day one when they were torn out of the arms of their mother and the lives they would have lived were taken from them because of the twisted, perverted morality of church and state that deemed some people legitimate, some people illegitimate and some women "fallen women". It is shocking, perverted and twisted stuff. Now we have a league table of arbitrary exclusions and a failure to acknowledge the individual, specific suffering that some people may have endured because of being boarded out, because of discrimination because they were mixed race, or whatever it was. It is shocking and still we have no justification. I appeal to the Minister, if he is serious, and to the officials or whoever came up with this plan, even at this last moment. We do not just want a report. That is just a way of trying to force a debate. I am putting it to the Minister at the last minute that he needs to rethink this so that people can finally get the closure and the justice. He should step back from this now and listen to the survivors, the people who are at the wrong end of the systematic abuse and crimes that church and State committed. For God's sake, do not negotiate with the religious organisations that were responsible. There is no negotiation required. Take their assets off them and make them pay the redress and all the compensation for the crimes that they have committed. We should not be talking to them. We should be telling them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputies Funchion, Sherlock, Cairns and others for their comments and contributions. For clarity, I want to respond briefly to something Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said. Of course, there were many decent people in the church and State, but there was a system that was official, orchestrated and systematic. It was approved and endorsed at the highest level of the State for most of its history and at the highest level of the church. Yes, there may have been individuals who were appalled, tried to do their best and so on, but this was the system of the State and the church. Every single mother and child who had their identity taken from them, every child who was torn out of his or her mother's arms and every mother who had a child torn out of her arms is a victim of abuse by church and State. There is an idea that we can exclude them. Of course, beyond that, some people suffered much worse, but it had nothing to do with an arbitrary date of six months. It often had something to do with being boarded out or being discriminated against on the grounds of colour or class, but it had nothing to do with arbitrary dates of a week, a month, six months or whatever. There is no basis for these exclusions, including the exclusion of institutions for the failure to acknowledge particular suffering, or for arbitrary dates. It is shocking that the Minister will still not respond to that central point. There is no justification for it. I did psychology in university as one of my subjects. There are many schools of psychology, but there is not one serious school of psychology that believes there is a blank slate for the first six months and that things that happen to a person from day one do not impact on a lifelong basis. If a person is traumatised and something is done wrong to him or her, such as mothers and children being separated at that age, it leaves a lifelong imprint on the person. The person has been wronged. The State must acknowledge that but it is failing to do so. The Minister has not even shown the decency of explaining to the survivors how he came to this decision. Perhaps it is because there is no explanation. It is an accountant's decision and that is compounding the abuse, suffering and injustice of so many.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So did I.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to support Deputy Funchion's amendment. We have enough reason to worry given the Government has set its face against the appeals of survivors and people in this House to not exclude people. It has not provided an explanation for that because we all know the explanation, it would appear, is about penny-pinching on real justice and redress. That is in line with the sort of other issues we have been talking about in the Dáil over the last few days where the State has done everything it can to cover itself against what it sees as financial exposure, regardless of the consequence for vulnerable people or people who have been wronged by the State. We have seen it tragically played out again with this legislation. It is telling that we say there is going to be a deciding officer who is independent but the definition of independence in this particular role is somebody who is willing to disagree with the Government if necessary, who has staff and so on and would, if necessary, disagree with the Minister and take the Minister on. We are dealing with a group of people who have been wronged by the State, who have very considerable concerns and are deeply unhappy with the redress that has been established because it excludes and because it is so minimal. The very least you would expect is that the deciding officer would have the capacity to be a bit independent. Critical to that, he or she should at least have the opportunity to recruit some of his or her own people, people the deciding officer feels are experts or particularly suited to doing the jobs necessary. That is not a negative commentary on staff that might come from the Minister's Department because I am sure many of those are well-suited and well-qualified but the deciding officer, if he or she is independent, should have the right to decide what sort of staff resources he or she needs, including what kind of people and what kind of qualifications they might have. This clearly sets out that it is really the Minister who is going to decide on the officers and the staffing of the independent deciding officer's office. The two things do not add up. It is not independence if the Minister is making all the appointments. It is a reasonable amendment Deputy Funchion is putting forward but I suspect that, as the Minister has ignored the appeals on the bigger and more substantive issue, he is probably going to ignore these appeals too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made by many here, again and again in this debate, and in previous debates. It is tragic and unacceptable that the Government is not willing to acknowledge the central point that is being made. I will take this last opportunity to dramatise the issue for the Minister about why the exclusion is so completely unacceptable, and fails to acknowledge the human reality that the separation of mother and child involves. One of the features of mother and baby homes is that when children were born in a home, which demonstrates the wrong that was done to the mother and child, is that the nuns required the mother to immediately bandage their breasts so that there would be no bonding at all between the mother and the child. If there was any bonding, that would make it more difficult to take the child away from the mother and vice versa. Can the Minister imagine how traumatic that was for the mother and the child right from the first moment, which is normally a moment of joy for the mother, when the instantaneous and unique bond is created between a newly born baby and his or her mother? However, that was immediately denied. A bond could not be created between the baby and its mother. It goes from there. If people think about their own children at one week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks, and that someone snatched their baby out of their hands and said they would not see the baby again, they could imagine the trauma that involves. The idea that we can set a timeline of six months and that before that there is not a trauma or something that deserves to be acknowledged as an abuse and as a crime against the mother and child is utterly incomprehensible. It flies in the face of everything we know about the relationship between a mother and child, and about the development of children and the shaping of a child's character as well as the scar the mother carries from that moment of separation on for the rest of her life. The point has been made, but we need to take this last opportunity to appeal to the Government not to do this because it subverts, sabotages and undermines what was supposed to be the acknowledgement of the State of the wrong that was done and the abuse that was perpetrated. It makes hollow all of the apologies or the claim that the Government has learned from this and is serious about redress for all of those who suffered that forced separation - the mothers and the children. It is not too late for the Minister to reconsider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. I agree with the Deputy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this proposal. People have waited long enough and there should not be uncertainty over getting a prompt decision. As has been said, we had reports and they were relayed to the Minister here recently. When was it we last discussed this? Was it a few weeks ago? We spoke about people having experienced significant delays in getting their personal information, so there is a problem. In locking this in, at least there will be a clear imperative and obligation on the Government to ensure people get decisions promptly and are not left waiting even longer. They have waited long enough.
