RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have specific questions on the particular subheads but, more generally, the Minister mentioned that the Department has expended some extra money looking at the property tax. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And the Minister subcontracted a bit of work to Deputy Michael McGrath as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister looked at, or does he intend to put any resources into looking at, something that we and others have raised in the context of wealth taxes, namely, wealth distribution? While I do not know what the Minister's view is, there has been much dispute and debate about where wealth is distributed. Has he thought at all about allocating some resources to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not get into the political debate now, although I am sure we will have that debate again. A lot of that has to do with income. A particular area to which, it seems to me, it would be worth allocating resources is examining the distribution of wealth in terms of financial wealth and assets. Certainly, when issues such as a wealth tax are raised, one of the standard responses is that we do not really know how or where that wealth is distributed. The figures we get from the Central Bank show how much household wealth there is and how it has dramatically increased in recent years, which leads some of us to believe, given that everybody else has seen their income or their wealth fall, that it must be concentrated somewhere. The Minister disputes that. Is the Minister considering allocating any resources to look at the distribution of wealth and assets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister think he should?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it of no interest to the Minister if there is a heavy concentration of wealth in a small number of hands?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would strongly suggest that the Minister do that. If we ever get the chance, we will. With regard to expenses pertaining to office premises, the 2014 estimate was €649,000 and the 2015 estimate is €1,389,000. That is a big jump, almost a doubling of expenses. What is the reason for that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand it. Health and safety considerations have increased the total from €394,000 in 2014 to €1,389,000 in 2015?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does seem like a big jump from €394,000 in 2014 to €1,389,000 in 2015.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. Subhead C4 deals with consultancy services. There is a jump from €161,000 in 2013 to €575,000 in 2014 and then to €850,000 in 2015.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For clarity on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One could construe that in a different way, which is that we are paying a fortune to consultants to ensure that multinational corporations do not have to pay any more tax because of the international focus on this country
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. I am saying that we are seeing a significant increase in the expenditure on consultants essentially around protecting a low tax regime for corporations. We are spending taxpayers' money to ensure that mostly foreign multinationals pay a very low rate of tax. Is that why these consultants are being employed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would question that expenditure because we are spending taxpayers' money - taxpayers who do pay a high proportion of their income in tax - to ensure the multinationals, who pay a very low proportion of profits on tax, continue to pay a low proportion of their profits in tax. We are increasing the public subsidy of maintaining low taxes on multinational corporations. That is a gross waste of money and it would be far better, if we do have to employ consultants, to employ consultants doing something useful which might benefit the Irish taxpayer. It is noteworthy that there was a significant increase in that regard. Our job as a committee is to monitor expenditure. On the consultancy services on page 23, provision of shared services subhead E1, there was an increase to €490,000 in 2014 and €1.85 million in 2015. Could the Minister outline the reason for this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a big jump. I hope it gets a result.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just one quick question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will take less time than that. In the context of the deployment of staff and resources in the Revenue Commissioners, I am interested in how much resources are deployed in chasing after what one might call the big corporate avoiders, the big fish as against those who have not paid their property tax. Rather than go through all of that now, could the Minister provide a breakdown of the divvying up of staff resources for the different sections or categories within Revenue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
