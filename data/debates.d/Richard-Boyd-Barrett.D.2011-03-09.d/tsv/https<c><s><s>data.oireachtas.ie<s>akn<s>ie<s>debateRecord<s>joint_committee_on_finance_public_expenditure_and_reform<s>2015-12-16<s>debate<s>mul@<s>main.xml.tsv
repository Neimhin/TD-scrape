RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No charge was made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am neutral in this. I am just saying I did not hear any charges being made. Questions were being asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the delegation tell me the following? With all the residential portfolios that NAMA has sold, either built residential units or land for residential development, what is the total amount it has got back in the residential area? What was the original value of those residential units?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Between 5,000 and 6,000 units.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But Mr. McDonagh cannot tell me what NAMA got back for them and what the original value was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will outline why I have asked for that information. First, one can look at the fact that property prices are now back almost to 2007-2008 levels or heading in that direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are climbing pretty fast in Dublin. I accept that that is the case in other parts of the country, and rents in some cases are back to what they were.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I question the rationale behind selling off all this residential property when its value is appreciating at its current rate. I wonder whether we got the best value for money. I wonder whether the vulture funds that have bought residential property from NAMA will be the beneficiaries. I wonder whether the sale will end up being a very bad deal for the public who paid for all of this stuff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the following not obvious when one looks at how things are panning out? I acknowledge the point made by Mr. McDonagh at the beginning of his statement that previously it was not commercially viable to build and it is only just about becoming commercially viable to build now. I accept that this is a mandate that was set for NAMA, so in some ways it is not really NAMA's responsibility but that of the Government. Against a background in which NAMA was set up to deal with a disastrous market failure, that same market has dictated to NAMA and to the Government what is and is not built. The net result is that we have a chronic housing crisis and NAMA has delivered next to nothing to flatten out the boom-slump cycle when it comes to housing. Is that what Mr. McDonagh has more or less admitted?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has Mr. McDonagh not admitted that NAMA has had to wait for the market to tell it that it is okay to build, even though there has been an objective need for the past number of years to provide housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask Mr. McDonagh one question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	NAMA had 15,000 residential units and it has sold 5,000. Does that mean it still has 10,000 units?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Mr. McDonagh add to that figure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to gather some facts before Mr. McDonagh finishes his response. What about the development potential of residential land? What would that bring the figure up to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the total?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those are useful facts. Mr. McDonagh said at the beginning of his statement that because of the collapse in prices, neither NAMA nor anybody else would consider building up until now. Was that his point? The market dictated it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, if what one is trying to do is to make a profit. If what one is trying to do is to provide housing, one might have a different approach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not pointing the finger at NAMA. I understand the straitjacket that it is in, but I have always disagreed with that straitjacket.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are paying a disastrous price for it, given the failure to build housing for a number of years. I want to quiz Mr. McDonagh on another matter. It seems an obvious statement of fact that the mandate that has informed NAMA's activities has failed us, in that it has exacerbated the cycle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am running out of time. I take Mr. Daly's point, but the idea that NAMA has tracked the market, which is its mandate, is crazy and we are paying the price for it. I must be honest and say that. On the delivery of social housing, out of the 70,000 - now 52,000 - existing or potential units, the total that we can expect for social housing from NAMA is 2,000. Is that not a pathetic return?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is correct, and we did not get any social housing then either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree and I accept that point. However, 2,000 out of 70,000 is a pathetic return in terms of social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My next point follows from this point. I find Mr. McDonagh's concern for NAMA debtors and the possible feelings of discrimination or victimhood they might have a little nauseating. I did not think it was NAMA's job or the job of any public agency to worry about these debtors and developers who bankrupted the country. The idea should be to increase the provision of social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was a mandate to deliver social housing as well.
