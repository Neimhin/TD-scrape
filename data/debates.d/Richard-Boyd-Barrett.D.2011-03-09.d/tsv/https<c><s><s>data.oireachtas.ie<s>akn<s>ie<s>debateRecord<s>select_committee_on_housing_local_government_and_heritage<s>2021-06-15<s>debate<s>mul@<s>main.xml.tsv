RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section really gets to the heart of what is wrong with the Bill and the Government's whole conception of the LDA. It is the dirty little secret behind the Land Development Agency. The agency should be about gathering up land that is being sat on by private developers and speculators, or land being held by Departments or State agencies other than local authorities, and ensuring that land is developed for public and genuinely affordable housing. Instead, we have an agency that is creating the opportunity to sell off public land to investment funds, speculators and private developers. These are the very people who are responsible for the current housing and homelessness crisis. There is simply no justification whatsoever for disposing of public land or involving private finance, speculators, developers or investment funds with the public land bank. In fact, they threaten to undermine any attempt to deliver the public and affordable housing that some of us in opposition have been pointing out for a decade is needed to address this crisis. This is NAMA part 2, to put it simply. We warned about NAMA originally. NAMA should have been used to deliver public and affordable housing but instead it was used to flog off land-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am pointing out that the LDA is part 2 of the disastrous policy pursued with NAMA. It is exactly the same policy and will have exactly the same disastrous consequences at a time when we should be moving in precisely the opposite direction. Shanganagh Castle is proof positive of that. If the Government had simply provided the local authority, which had signalled its desire to build public housing on that land, with the funds to do so we would have public and affordable housing on the Shanganagh Castle site now. The funding was not forthcoming because the Government always had a plan, of which the LDA is the culmination, to open up that public land bank, that particular site that was publicly-owned, to private finance and private developers. The consequence of that is we do not know whether the affordable housing will be affordable. There has also been a chronic delay in actually delivering anything and a sod being turned on that site. Why is that? It is because the Government has involved private financiers in the equation and they must make a profit. The Government has been trying to square the circle of how to deliver affordable housing on public land and make a profit for private financiers and, of course, it is a very difficult circle to square. The Government would not have to square it were it not trying to dispose of the land and involve those private, for-profit interests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have basically made the point but I just-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry Chairman, stop interrupting me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt anybody else so stop interrupting me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I am just concluding on the point that this is the critical section that gives away what is wrong with this Bill. There is simply no justification from the point of view of finance, as has been confirmed to us by the ESRI, and there is no justification on the basis of efficient delivery of public and affordable housing because doing it in this precise way has led to chronic delays on sites where we could have easily delivered public and affordable housing by now. The Bill will not do what Deputy Higgins is saying, it will do the opposite and it will mean the affordable housing may well be completely unaffordable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to speak to the section. I have an amendment on deleting the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. It is not agreed.
