RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all in favour of jobs but the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy does not have responsibility for jobs. There is another sub-committee with responsibility in that regard. Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify the position but I was of the view that the work of the sub-committee on social policy relates to addressing poverty and social inequality and ensuring that all citizens will have the basic things they need to live a dignified and civilised existence. The evidence clearly points to the fact that both the sub-committee and the Government are failing disastrously in the context of dealing with poverty reduction, social equality and providing for the basic needs of our citizens in order that they might live a dignified and civilised existence. All of the indicators are going in the wrong direction. I appeal to the Taoiseach to read the recently published and very detailed Steps Towards a Fairer Future: Securing Economic Development, Social Equity and Sustainability by Social Justice Ireland, which states that, from the point of view of social equality and poverty, everything is going in the wrong direction. For example, it indicates that between 2010 and 2011 the at risk of poverty rate increased from 14.7% to 16%, the deprivation rate increased from 22.6% to 24.5% and the rate of consistent poverty increased from 6.3% to 6.9%. The position in respect of housing - the most basic need in order to function within society - was similar and now we have an unprecedented crisis in the areas of homelessness and housing. Matters are worsening on a daily basis. It is possible to have a working poor and, as is the case, massive numbers of people who are unemployed - and to seek to create jobs on that basis - while levels of poverty and inequality continue to increase. That is what is happening. The job of the sub-committee on social policy is to deal with those issues rather than telling us about the creation of 60 new jobs - which we all welcome - in Dundalk. The question that arises relates to whether we are addressing poverty and inequality and the answer is we are not. The situation has become worse under this Government and the indicators are moving in the wrong direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the sub-committee not failing in its duty? The indicators of squalor and poverty in the 19th and early 20th centuries were lack of access to secure, decent and appropriate housing and clean water, resulting in disease, high infant mortality rates and so forth. That is the direction in which we are currently heading as a result of the fact that the Government is removing the basic and universal right to an affordable and secure roof over one's head and access to clean water. A lack of these basic rights inevitably gives rise to poverty, squalor and social inequality. The Government must refocus its efforts. If the sub-committee is to be taken seriously rather than, as appears to be the case, being seen as mere window-dressing, it must address the issues to which I refer. It is utterly failing to do so at present.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It certainly was not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if they are still living in poverty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if they have jobs but still cannot pay the bills?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was talking about social indicators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Brilliant. The bond markets love it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not impacting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course I do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It only works if they can pay for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are left for even longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Government not put them to work building social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendments deal with an issue that is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the Bill and what it means for people on the housing waiting list. As I indicated in conversation with Deputy Dessie Ellis just before this debate started, while the thrust of what he is trying to do with the amendment is right, in that it deals with an issue that is central to the Bill and addresses a significant problem that will develop if the Government presses ahead with the Bill, as constituted, I do not agree with how it is phrased. I will explain why I believe there is a slight problem with its phrasing. The amendment points to a critical issue with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. During the controversy of the past week or two surrounding the Bill and the claims and counter-claims about what it means, the RAS has come to the centre. Last week the Minister of State claimed that the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme was really just the RAS expanded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Others did. Mr. Simon Brooke of Clúid stated it on radio the other day. He made the point - there has been a suggestion by the Minister of State to this effect - that we had not kicked up about this issue when the RAS was first introduced. The implication is that we are making a mountain out of a molehill and that, despite what we claim, there are no problems with the Bill. However, that is not true. In June 2011 some of us flagged the major problem with the RAS and the Government's proposals, which have found their way into this legislation. The issues have been raised in the Dáil repeatedly since. I looked back through a few statements I published at the time. In June 2011 I referred to how all new entrants to the RAS would be considered to be adequately housed and would no longer be eligible to be on housing waiting lists. I stated this was unbelievable, representing a counter-revolution in the State's approach to providing housing for low-income families and households, and that the hopes of tens of thousands of young families were to be devastated because their long wait of seven, eight or nine years for a council house - this period has since extended to 15 years - had come to nothing. They would never have a home that they could call their own and would become subject to private developers, speculators and banks, many of which had helped to bankrupt the country. I made this statement on foot of a major problem that had emerged with the RAS. The original entrants were told that they would participate in the scheme for four years, after which they would be given a council house. In June 2011 they were suddenly told that this was not the case and that they would be deemed to be housed under the RAS. There was uproar. We held a press conference in Buswell's Hotel with representatives of Tenants First and some of the affected families in my area. The media were befuddled trying to figure out the problem because they did not understand how housing waiting lists worked. They have taken four years to catch up. At the press conference we pointed out that this was the beginning of striking tens of thousands of families off housing waiting lists. On foot of this outrage, the 400 people in question were told that, while they would be placed on a fixed transfer list, everyone who entered the RAS after that date would be deemed to be housed. That is, of course, what happened. Anyone who joined the RAS afterwards was taken off the list.There are now thousands of people on the RAS. A few hundred are entitled to be on a transfer list because this concession was forced from the Government and local authorities at the time but the vast majority of people on the RAS have been taken off the list and are deemed housed. This Bill expands this to take everyone off the list. News of this is starting to filter out now but most people will only find out when they are forced onto the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. When they discover that their wait of ten to 15 years has come to nothing it will cause despair and outrage. They will learn that after all that time they will not get a council house but will be deemed to be housed in private rented accommodation. The councils will then be able to say they discharged their obligation to those people. In response to these points the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has said people can go on a transfer list. The RAS experience is clear. If a transfer list exists, and there are many local authorities that do not have one, one can only get on it if there are chronic overcrowding problems, medical needs, acute anti-social difficulties and so on. Only people suffering such problems will be accepted in their application to go on a transfer list. Even these people will have to wait months and sometimes years. The Minister of State suggests that people who do not have the acute problems outlined, who have merely spent a long time waiting, will somehow have a right to a council house but this is preposterous. We cannot even house the people in the most dire and chronic need. Housing departments will face the most impossible and diabolical choices as to who should be allocated the tiny number of houses that are available. I will give the example of an elderly man I am dealing with at the moment. He has had two strokes, he has brain damage, his memory is gone and he has serious speech difficulties as a result of the strokes. He has just been released from the National Rehabilitation Hospital. He is diabetic, needs two shots per day and must eat carefully to allow for those shots. Due to his memory problems the fear is he may not take his shots and if he does not do so he could die. He was released and put in emergency housing in Dún Laoghaire that is overwhelmingly populated by people with chronic drug or alcohol problems. When he arrived with his family and saw where he had to stay he was stricken with fear. On seeing his reaction his family worried he might keel over and have another stroke but the council said there was nowhere else for him to go. He is still staying in that emergency housing. If he dies as a result of the anxiety induced by being placed in completely inappropriate hostel accommodation it will be on the heads of this Government and the housing authorities. It is not the council's fault because they have no other accommodation for him. The people who run the emergency housing in question admit the facility is not set up for such a case. They argue that they are not doctors but rather deal with people with chronic alcohol and drug problems. They say they are not in a position to look after this man but will do their best. They say the emergency housing is not appropriate. Similarly, the hospital has discharged him because the bed is needed. His life is in danger. Given what is proposed under the HAP scheme, how will a housing authority allocate houses to people who have been on the list for ten or 12 years? The Minister of State says such people are entitled to a transfer. To whom will the authority allocate a house, the man who may die because he is in inappropriate hostel accommodation or the family that has waited on the list for 15 years? That family's need may not be as pressing an emergency but its claim on a council house is very legitimate. Where stands the list for these people? What of transfer priority or any priority? The man I refer to cannot be housed. I was told by the local authority yesterday it could be weeks or months before he is housed. How will a person on the list get a transfer in this situation? It will not happen. Housing officials will face appalling choices on who will get a house as every possible choice will cause someone else to suffer. Only those in desperate need will be considered a priority. This is going to be a disaster. Even those at death's door cannot be guaranteed housing. What the Minister of State proposes will not work. Housing departments are overrun already and I imagine officials feel sick with anxiety at what is going on and the situation in which the Government is putting them. The Minister of State must admit the truth and say this is not a permanent solution to people's housing issues. The RAS has not worked and placing a so-called obligation on local authorities to house people through the HAP scheme, which is an expanded version of RAS, gives people no chance of getting a council house. These people with housing needs will be thrown to the sharks, private landlords and developers. Only a trickle of people in the most dire circumstances may be housed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a contradiction in what the Minister of State just said. On the one hand, she says a person such as the one I described would have to take priority but, on the other, she is saying people in the HAPS can apply for a transfer and, based on the number of years waiting, can have a reasonable expectation that the position in respect of those years of waiting will somehow be preserved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can those two things be true at the same time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the point. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, for example, which I am sure is much the same as anywhere else, there will be two houses allocated this month, if we are lucky. There are already approximately 25 people on the priority list in dire circumstances. Their cases are similar to those I have just described. Therefore, the only choice available to the local authority is to house the people in absolutely diabolical circumstances. Effectively, therefore, the list is gone already. The Minister of State is saying that under the HAPS, their time waiting will still be taken into consideration and the reasonable expectation can still be delivered on, but it cannot be because there will be only two houses. Will the Minister of State say-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State saying that, of the two houses that will be allocated, one will be allocated to the person in absolutely dire circumstances while the other will be allocated to people on the basis of their time waiting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will not happen and cannot happen. If we are lucky, there are two houses allocated per month. Consider the case if there were five-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Minister of State is saying is just not serious. She bandies about figures on RAS houses and refers to allocations of 5,000 and NAMA. The Taoiseach said today that NAMA offered 4,000 houses. Although a figure of 4,000 has been bandied about for three or four years, only 300 have been delivered nationally. Therefore, what has been said is just rubbish. Let me outline why this proposal will make circumstances even worse than those associated with the rent allowance. With the rent allowance, a landlord must sign up for a period of a year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under the new scheme, he will have to sign up to a more long-term arrangement. This will mean even more landlords will run away from rent support schemes with the councils. Therefore, by introducing the proposed measure, the Government will exacerbate an already dire set of circumstances in which landlords are not interested in rent allowance or rent support.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will have to sign something.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then there will be only one-year leases.
