RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the witnesses think it is important for us to debate the strategy? The public are losing confidence and things are not going in the right direction. I do not think anybody could argue that things are going in the right direction at the moment. Notwithstanding differences of opinion, how important is it for us to have this debate? Even at our own committee, the Chair and I were very keen to have this discussion this morning but a number of committee members believed that we should not have the discussion at all because it might undermine the Government's new plan. I would like the witnesses to comment. I believe that we need an open debate; we do not need the political management of information and evidence, and we should not be afraid of openly debating the various strategies in front of the public in a very open way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a pity we only have a short time to discuss the last point. We need to have more of these discussions but that is for another day and we will talk to the committees here about that. Earlier Dr. Schaffer said that there is evidence that social gatherings, house parties and so on had contributed to the current situation. She may have information that we do not and this is part of the problem. People have also gone back to work. How do we know when it is stated that there is a high rate of infection among people aged under 40 years that it is due to attending parties or work? I am not convinced. I am not saying that it is or is not and I just do not know. We are flying blind and I do not know whether the public health authorities know this information but will not tell us or, even worse, do not know. I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  Notwithstanding the differences in opinion between Dr. Giesecke, Dr. Ryan and Professor McConkey, there does seem to be agreement that we could not possibly have enough testing, that the more testing we have, the better. Would mass screening of the population be possible if there was the political will to do it, in the same way that we have essentially eradicated certain diseases from the cattle herd, for example, which is a bit bigger than the population of this country? While it would be a big infrastructural investment and so on, if we knew where the virus was and with the pooling of testing, could it work if we did mass testing of the population, identified where the virus was and went after it?
