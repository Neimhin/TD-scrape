RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government states the Government will listen to ideas from others about how to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis. When it introduced legislation on rent certainty, we told the Government the measures would not control rents. We stated it would be necessary to set rents at affordable levels and introduced legislation to achieve this objective, which the Government voted down. Does the Taoiseach accept that, with a report from daft.ie showing an 81% increase in rents since their low point and an increase of 10% in the past year, the Government's legislation has failed and we need legislation that will control and reduce rents to affordable levels? Incidentally, I disagree with my colleagues in Sinn FÃ©in on controlling rents by linking rent increases to the consumer price index because that would not deal with the problem of new tenancies or rising rents. We need to set rents at affordable levels. Given what is happening, will the Government consider this as the only emergency response that would deal with rents, which are spiralling out of control?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pretty much every week that goes by, the US President, Donald Trump, provides us with further evidence of the threat he represents to the world, peace, the environment and whole swathes of the world's population. I assume the Taoiseach will meet Donald Trump on St. Patrick's Day in the White House. I would prefer if he did not and made it clear why he should not but I wonder whether he has any thoughts about what he will say to Donald Trump. If we just take two recent instances, in the past few days, Donald Trump has indicated that any discussion about Jerusalem is off the table. He is not even willing to discuss what the whole world recognises as a dangerous development, namely, the recognition by his Government of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel with all the connotations and provocation that represents for the Middle East. He does not even want to discuss it. He is saying it is off the negotiating table. Donald Trump has also simultaneously ramped up further aid to Israel. While he has reduced the overall US international aid budget by a third, he has increased funding to Israel by $200 million, a clear indication of what he is up to, which is backing Israel in its aggressive and provocative stance. In the past few days, on another issue about which the Taoiseach has spoken, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency - you could not make this stuff up - has said that global warming is actually a good thing and that it may be beneficial for humanity. Donald Trump recently tweeted that the US needs more global warming-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but the madness is threatening peace in the Middle East and the global environment. How is the Taoiseach going to make a statement against these sort of crazy policies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach was asked about Trump.
