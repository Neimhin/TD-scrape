RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we met outside the Citywest count centre and the scale of the "Yes" result had become apparent, I told the Taoiseach that the next step would be the separation of church and State. He said we would leave that issue for another day. This is another day. In fact, notwithstanding suggestions about the Citizens' Assembly examining these matters, the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 will be before the Dáil today. Amendments to it seek the deletion in full, not in part, of the baptism barrier that allows for discrimination in school entry on religious grounds. Other amendments seek to ensure religious instruction is given after school hours in order that people of no faith or minority faiths will not be subjected to moral or religious indoctrination that is not of their choice. The referendum's exit poll tells us what the key issue for 62% of people was, namely, choice. There has been much debate on the motive - choice was the motive. People do not wish to be told what to do with their lives, futures and kids.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In line with the referendum result and its own commitment to diversity, the Government should accept the amendments this week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if people do not share a school's faith?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the points have been made. It is correct that we should be able to compel a school to make provision for children with special educational needs. As Deputy Thomas Byrne indicated, the Bill seems to be a little convoluted in the way it proposes to do so. It appears to focus on the school, the council, the rather lengthy process involved and the powers of the Minister but does not seem to emphasise the child enough. Is the process of reporting on the provision of capacity in the area a bit of a get-out clause that allows a school to state it does not have to make provision because somebody else can do it? This argument is used by schools and one of the soft barriers in getting a child into his or her school of choice. The school states, "You would be better off going to the school down the road because it has the capacity to deal with you and we do not". The Minister should address that point to be sure the Bill does not allow for the continuation of soft barriers which discriminate against children with special needs in seeking to gain entry to a particular school. As I listened to the debate, I was struck that it might also be useful to strengthen the Bill a little to give power to the Minister and place an obligation on a school not to take any action that would degrade special education provision in a school. I say this and the Minister may remember because of the very strong case made by Clonkeen College in the fight to retain its playing fields. I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in the House. It was also one of the arguments put to the Minister when they met - that the decision of the Christian Brothers to sell the school's playing fields - essentially to benefit them - would significantly degrade the quality of the unit for children with mild and moderate disabilities that had recently been constructed in the school. The school has testimony from agencies that cater for children with special needs in the area that the move to profit from a school site by flogging off playing fields to developers will impact significantly and badly on the children with special needs in the unit because of the proximity of the unit to the commercial for-profit development on the green space that surrounds it. The agencies have pointed out that for children with special needs having an open green area is extremely beneficial and for it to be near the unit. Now they will be boxed in with a private development because the Minister will not intervene to stop the sale. In the Bill could we have the power to intervene on the basis of protecting facilities and preventing the degradation of special needs provision if anything was being done to degrade it and that would impact adversely on children with special needs? That would be a useful addition for the Minister to make to his amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are discussing all of the amendments in this group?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know how much evidence we need of the requirement for us to separate church and State completely, but we have had plenty of it in recent days. To my mind, in 21st century Ireland, it is just not acceptable to continue any form of religious discrimination in admission to schools or to continue a religious bias, which is imposed on children in a school of a particular ethos on children who do not share that faith or ethos. I submitted these amendments which allow for that discrimination and the continuation of essentially imposing a religious ethos on people who do not share it in our schools before the astounding result we had in the referendum at the weekend. If evidence and support was required for the idea that people in this country want a different type of society, we certainly got it at the weekend when it comes to church diktat imposing on the lives, choices and rights of citizens. Most obviously it was around the question of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy but everybody knows it was about much more than that. The exit poll carried out by RTÉ was clear. There was and still is a lot of debate about what it all meant but the exit poll clarified some of that. A total of 62% of people who voted said for them the vote was about "the right to choice". That is what people want, namely, the right to choose and to make their own decisions. It was also about equality. It was obvious from the preponderance of women in the campaign and its mobilisation that it was about a demand for equality, that they are not putting up with this anymore. That was the feeling. We all know it. We saw a tidal wave of that sentiment demanding a change. That has obvious implications in terms of the legislation and all that has been discussed today but to my mind it is obvious that it has implications for the relationship between church and State, especially in the area of education and in the area of health, which we should discuss on another day given the unbelievable situation where a religious order will control the national maternity hospital. However, we will deal with that on another day. To my mind it is just not tenable anymore that in the aftermath of that vote we are not going to move to separate church and State completely in the education of young people. Before getting into the detail, I refer to the point made by Deputy Clare Daly. One of the schools she mentioned was in Booterstown. I got calls about it. People complained that when they walked into a national school to vote on the referendum they were confronted with Bibles and statues of the Virgin Mary. They complained about them but they could not get them removed.Frankly, they were intimidated by them when they were voting. Thankfully, the vast majority were not so intimidated that they did not vote "Yes", but nonetheless they did genuinely feel that way. Obviously, I did not know at the time that it was more widespread than that, but Deputy Clare Daly has confirmed that it was widespread throughout the country. That is because we still allow Catholic domination of schools. It even impacted on voting during the referendum. I might mention in passing the statement made today by the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, about the Sisters of Charity and St. Patrick’s Guild.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing forward this Bill. Obviously, we will support it. It is right that student accommodation should be brought under the remit of the RTB in order that the sector can benefit from some of the protections, in terms of the rent caps and other protections, that are available to tenants in the private rented sector. Deputy Ó Broin acknowledged, as did Deputy Darragh O’Brien, who had brought a similar Bill forward, that students’ correct determined decision to protest against outrageous rent increases by private landlords who own student property, particularly the DCU Shanowen shakedown protests but also, more recently, the protests around similarly shocking rent increases in Galway, has forced the issue onto the agenda. I should also mention that while the protest Trinity students held recently was to a large extent about the repeat fees, it had also been preceded by attempts by the college to significantly increase rents for the on-campus accommodation. It is good the students are fighting back. It is important that we here listen and do something. Therefore, I absolutely support this move. However, I will go a little bit further and say that it is not enough. The problem is that rents are already too high. Limiting the increases, as would be done if we bring student accommodation under the RTB, to 4% is no good when student accommodation is already too expensive. It is better than nothing - at least, it prevents totally extortionate further increases - but it does not deal with the problem that student accommodation is already way beyond what is acceptable in terms of affordability for significant numbers of students, leading, as Deputy Barry stated, to shocking cases where people sleep in cars or where students are simply dropping out of college because they or their parents cannot afford the rents which have been allowed to reach the present extortionate levels. Student accommodation, if one can get it, is averaging between €700 and €1,000 a month. Student grants are a maximum of €3,000 to €5,000 a year. If one is a less well-off student, or one of those who is not eligible for grants but whose parents might not have that much money, one is in trouble. It is a real problem. It is a major problem that so much of the planned student accommodation the Government hopes will come on stream will be delivered by the private sector rather than the universities themselves building student accommodation that is set at affordable levels because, even if we bring it under the RTB, the providers can set the price of all the new accommodation at whatever they like. After that, they might be limited, if this Bill is passed, to an increase of 4% but when it is first rented they can charge whatever they like, and they are likely to charge rents that are completely unaffordable for students. Something has to be done to stop that from happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I was saying earlier, putting somebody’s religious or moral view into the Constitution, into the law or allowing it to dictate the behaviour and ethos of what should be a public service is not acceptable any longer in 21st century Ireland. I do not think it ever was. The “Yes” vote we saw at the weekend was part of a tide of public opinion welling up, an earthquake as some described it, against that sort of Ireland, which has not served us well. It has not served women well and, in this case, it has not and is not serving the education of our children well. We have had some significant evidence of this. The “Yes” vote was about people saying that they did not want to be dictated to by the church or the State, having a particular moral view imposed on them. We think people should be allowed to make up their own minds about those things, when it comes to women, pregnancy and so on. One sees further evidence of the need to make this shift, even with the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, today, about allowing what should be a State agency to be controlled by religious institutions, in this case St. Patrick’s Guild and the Sisters of Charity. I just heard the announcement today. Fair play to the Minister, Deputy Zappone, for contacting Deputies but I do not know if I am one of those children because St. Patrick’s Guild was the adoption agency that adopted me and I was adopted during those years. I do not know whether I was properly registered. I am lucky because my biological parent found me but had difficulty in doing so. There are people who may not know that they are adopted. This is unbelievable. That is all because we allowed things that should have been public services to be outsourced to particular religious bodies with a particular ethos and attitude. That very seriously impacted on the lives of real people and it is still impacting on them. This cannot go on. It is still going on the area of education and the Minister intends, notwithstanding some moves to improve matters in this Bill, to allow that discrimination against people who do not share a particular religious ethos – the Catholic ethos in most cases – to be discriminated against if it impacts on the ethos of the school. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should not get me wrong, as I think people are entitled to their religious views. They are entitled to express them and to associate with regard to those ideas. I would fight to the death for people’s right to have freedom of religious expression but we are talking about schools, publicly funded for the most part, although it does not matter what sort of school it is. Any school that is delivering the curriculum should not have a particular morality or religious view which is imposed on people who do not share that view. It should not be allowed to persist. The school should not decide to have any right to discriminate on admission to that school on the basis of people sharing or not sharing that religious ethos. It is just not acceptable. We have had a clear statement over the weekend and have evidence all the time that that should not continue and people do not want it to continue. It is in that spirit that these amendments are proposed. Whatever one may have thought last week, the week before, or the week before that, something has changed over the weekend and the Government should reconsider. To my mind, it is just a no-brainer. The baptism barrier has to go and that means removing the ridiculous situation where the Equal Status Act says one will not be guilty of discrimination if one is discriminating. How Irish is that? We are not discriminating when we are discriminating because we are in a school that has a particular ethos. It is Orwellian doublethink and the consequence is that it allows that discrimination to persist. In many cases where schools are not oversubscribed, it is not an issue, and I fully accept that it is not an issue. When there are places, most schools will take kids from whatever background. It can still persist if the school is oversubscribed and says that, by not allowing in a child of the same ethos as the ethos of the school and not discriminating in favour of that child, it would impact on the school’s right to maintain that ethos.That is still discrimination and I do not think it is acceptable. I have another amendment on religious instruction in schools which I will come to later and the same point pertains there. I have no problem with schools being used after school hours for religious instruction for people who share a particular religious view but I do not believe it is right that during school hours we have a particular religious view, which children have to either sit through even though they may not share it or they have to leave and are therefore made to feel different from everybody else. That is not right. For the school to have to say, following this legislation, that it will make other arrangements and state what they are is still not good enough. A distinction should not be made for children whereby a child is made to feel different because we have a particular set of values and ethos and because someone does not share it therefore he or she will be treated differently. That is discrimination. It is not right. It is not fair on children and it should not be allowed to persist. For those reasons, the Government should take my amendments seriously. There are other aspects to the separation of church and State in education. In passing I will again mention Clonkeen College, but the issue does not only concern Clonkeen College where the Christian Brothers are flogging off school facilities to pay their historical debts over child abuse. I got a lengthy email from Waterford today where people are saying exactly the same thing. The Sisters of Charity are flogging off real estate on school lands essentially to look after their religious order. The writer of the email asks why the hell the State does not step in and take over the schools and that from now on schools will be non-religious as they are being divested from religious control and that we will have a fair system which does not discriminate on the basis of religious ethos. We would then have a system where anyone who is in a catchment area would be taken by a school on a first-come, first-served basis regardless of his or her religious views or background or lack thereof or if he or she is of a minority religion. The time has come for change. There is no defence for fudging on this and for half-hearted measures.
