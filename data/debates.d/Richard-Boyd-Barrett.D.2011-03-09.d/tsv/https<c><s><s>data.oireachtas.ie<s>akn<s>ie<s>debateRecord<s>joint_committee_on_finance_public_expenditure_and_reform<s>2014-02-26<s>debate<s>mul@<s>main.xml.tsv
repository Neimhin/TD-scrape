RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses have justified their approach to this by saying they have a legal imperative to get the best value for the IBRC mortgage book and that if it was a condition of the sale that the purchaser was forced to sign up to the consumer code, MARP and so forth, it would potentially impact on what they might be willing to pay and therefore the public would not get the best value. Is that not essentially their argument?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the same time, they have never ascertained what the impact might be on what they might be willing to purchase. They never asked them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, the witnesses did not ask the bidders whether it would make any difference to the bids they might make.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it is complete speculation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can all take independent advisers with a pinch of salt at this stage. Is there not a big contradiction between that assertion, which has informed the witnesses' approach to this, and simultaneously trying to claim that a voluntary commitment, with no legal standing, is something from which we and the mortgage holders should take comfort? At one point the witness said he would stake his reputation on it. If they are voluntarily willing to abide by the codes and regulations, why would obliging to them to do so make any difference to what they are willing to pay for the mortgages?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a big contradiction in the witnesses' approach. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot tell us that if they forced them to comply with the consumer code and MARP, it would affect the purchase price they might be willing to pay and on the other hand say they will voluntarily do it anyway, so we need not worry and that nobody has anything about which to be concerned.The two things do not add up. Does Mr. Wallace not accept that there is a major contradiction in these two things?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why would it affect the purchase price?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The delegation cannot quantify what the difference in value is, yet they are telling us there is no difference at all from the point of view of the mortgage holders. That is what Mr. Wallace has implied because last night, in the late hours of the night, they had not signed up to some voluntary commitment. That is a big contradiction. It cannot be both things. Either the assurances Mr. Wallace has tried to give are worth nothing or it would have made no difference whatsoever if it had been made a condition of the sale that the purchaser had to sign up to the code.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although the special liquidators did not ask the purchasers and cannot quantify the difference, presumably.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not add up but I have made my point. I seek clarification on the issue of the mortgage holders being allowed to buy back their own mortgages in or around the same sort of discount the vulture capitalists will get when they purchase the mortgage books. Mr. Wallace has said it would have been too costly, taken too much time and so on to do it that way. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many of the people who bid for their own loans does he anticipate will get their own mortgages?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the reason the others are not getting it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have heard reports of people saying they were willing to discuss the matter with the special liquidators and possibly improve their bid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I refer to individual home owners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Wallace has said the reason the special liquidators are not doing so is due to cost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is nothing in the legislation to prevent the special liquidators from doing so. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this just a cold and calculated decision to get the most money back?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is cold and calculated from the point of view of the people who are now being handed over to people who are not regulated, can sell on their mortgages and where they have no legal guarantees they would be subject to the same standards and protections from which other mortgage holders benefit in banks that are regulated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Wallace has admitted there are review clauses spanning one year, three years or whatever in their contracts where the new purchaser could review a restructuring arrangement that might have agreed and, potentially, just tear it up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many are shorter and are subject to review for whatever the specified period is - one year, three years or five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever the timeframe is, they are subject to review. My next question is for the Department. Does it accept that mortgage holders have significant reason for anxiety, particularly when one looks at the attitude of banks that are based outside this country? They are not the banks we bailed out. Those banks have taken a different approach to the loans they own. They have displayed an attitude of getting whatever money they can regardless of the consequences for the person who had the loan and in a way that is not true because of the political and public pressure that might be on banks based here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For what it is worth, the dogs on the street could tell Ms Nolan differently and state there is a very different attitude.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Wallace mentioned a figure of 60% earlier when I was asking questions.  There was some confusion because Mr. Wallace thought my question pertained to all mortgages but I was primarily concerned with residential principal private dwellings and so on.  I am seeking clarity because given the rapid fire of questions backwards and forwards taking in the import of what Mr. Wallace said has taken some minutes.  Mr. Wallace should correct me if I am wrong but I understood he said 60% of all mortgages he had were sold back to the original mortgage holder.  Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the 60% figure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Wallace referring to the 33 borrower groups?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Wallace is referring to those which have gone through. These are not principal private dwellings. They are not residential mortgages. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, it would be fair to assume that most of these are commercial and property loans. Am I right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, Mr. Wallace has decided that if a person is a developer he can buy his own loan back, but if a person is a home owner dealing with the roof over his head for him and his family then he cannot. That is the recommendation Mr. Wallace has made in the best interests of the public.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say, if it is a commercial or corporate interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It says borrower groups here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are corporate and commercial loans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have been allowed.  They have been given the option to buy back their own loans and Mr. Wallace considers that is okay but he decided not to give the people dealing with the mortgage for the roof over their heads, their family home, that option.  Mr. Wallaceâ€™s decision is based on one law for the family trying to keep a roof over their head and another one for corporate and commercial interests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am absolutely confused. Mr Wallace has said PwC told him that having considered it all, with no models or figures, as we discussed earlier-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Wallace took that advice, without figures, without quantifying it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Mr. Wallace let me get the question out so that I can clarify-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about Mr. Wallace and the decisions he has made. He is dealing with all these portfolios. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He might be getting advice from all sorts of people but he says he took the advice of PwC, which told him he should not consider the option of selling back mortgages to individual mortgage holders in respect of family homes.  Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Wallace took that advice, saying it would be bad value for money and IBRC should not consider that option. Maybe he got advice on the other tranche of loans, commercial and corporate loans, from elsewhere, and decided it was something to consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the decisions Mr. Wallace made, one set of rules applied to people trying to keep a roof over their heads and talking about the mortgages on their family homes, and another set of rules applied to commercial and corporate loans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to make this clear for everybody.  An individual home owner dealing with the mortgage for his or her home cannot buy it back but a corporate or commercial interest might be able to buy their own loan back at a discount.  That is the decision Mr. Wallace made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the decision Mr. Wallace made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the problem. We have established the Government is disposed towards bringing in legislation that will make these loans subject to the consumer code, the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and so on. We do not know when but it has indicated it will do so at some stage. At the same time we have been told that it cannot be a condition of the sale because it will impact on the price. I do not understand how we can commit ourselves to do something down the road, which presumably will have the same impact on the price, when we cannot do it now because it will have an impact on the price. Why will it not impact on the price further down the road if it impacts on it now? I do not get it. If we can do it down the road, why can we not do it now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point I want to get at. It seems to me there is another option. I understand the mortgages for principal private dwellings have not been sold yet. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any reason we could not amend the IBRC Act 2013 to make it a condition of the sale of any principal private residences, and the mortgages pertaining to them, that they be subject to MARP and the consumer code?  Is there any reason that simple amendment to the IBRC Act 2013 could not be made and inform what the special liquidators do in the sale of that book?  Is there any reason that could not happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not if it specifies principal and private residences, which have not yet been sold because the IBRC has not sold any principal private residences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The IBRC has not sold them yet.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see the connection between the two things.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any reason it could not be done?  Ms Nolan has expressed her opinion on why it might be better.  We can agree to disagree but is there any reason it cannot be brought in, that the amendment cannot be made?
