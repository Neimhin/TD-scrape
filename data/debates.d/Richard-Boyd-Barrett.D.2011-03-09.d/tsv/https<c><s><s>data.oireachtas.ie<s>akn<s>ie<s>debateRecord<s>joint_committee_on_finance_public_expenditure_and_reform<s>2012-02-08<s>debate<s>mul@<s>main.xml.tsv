RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Reading chart No. 8, one would believe that the situation was improving.  The total level of household debt is declining, which must be a good development.  Does the new spending referred to in chart No. 5 refer to people taking out more personal credit?  It is decreasing, which one would also view as being a good development.If I understand the situation, the real problem is that the average level of indebtedness is increasing.  Is the figure in purple right?  Average indebtedness fell slightly, but is now on an upward curve.  From this, one might extrapolate that some people can afford to pay down their debts, having been impacted upon by the recessionary atmosphere and having decided to rein in their credit a bit.  However, large numbers of people are not in a position to pay down their debts.  They have lost their jobs and experienced income cuts.  Their situation is as bad as before or might even be worsening.  This is alarming.  Have I misinterpreted the chart?  After a slight dip, average indebtedness seems to be on a rising curve.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My questions are connected.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is connected to the next question.  I am giving an overview of how these matters connect with one another.  Would it be fair to liken chart No. 1 to a household version of the State's debt to GDP ratio?  When states reach the level we are expected to reach, namely, 118%, Europe tells them that they should be at 50% or 60%.  What is Greece at now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the personal household level, our debt to GDP ratio is a shocking 220%.  We are really in a bad way.  The figure for household leverage still seems to be on a rising curve.  It is higher than ever or at least as high as the worst point.  This indicates that, with the possible exception of a few people who still have money to make choices with, many people are in as bad a situation as ever.  In many cases, their situation is becoming worse than ever.  It is a significant problem.  The leverage ratio compared with Europe is astonishing.  Is this a reasonable comparison?  Our household leverage ratio is 220% and Europe's is 110%.  We are in a disastrous situation by European standards.  I have another question on a different chart, but will the delegates answer my questions so far?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take Mr. McNeill's point, but is it not fair to extrapolate from the figure for average indebtedness, which is high and on an upward trajectory-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. 5.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished yet.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The financial assets chart is interesting.  Will Ms Cussen clarify her statement to the effect that she can provide a distributional breakdown?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take Ms Cussen's point.  She can confirm something to me concerning a matter about which the ULA has been banging its drum for the past year.  The value of housing assets has fallen significantly, yet financial assets are rising.  If this is the case and the delegates are telling us that there has not been an increase in savings, given that most ordinary people are using what little bit of money they have to pay down their considerable accumulated debts, can we not assume that some group is doing well and its financial assets are increasing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is my assumption not fair?  The €300 billion in financial assets are increasing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Someone is doing well.  I would like to set out one instance that indicates to me that the cause remains with us.  A self-employed woman who has been working consistently recently married her partner who is a council tenant willing to give up his house to someone on the housing list.  The woman's house which is in negative equity is now their home.  As it is quite small, they decided to extend it.  However, when they applied to the bank for a loan of €10,000 to meet the cost of construction of the extension to make the house large enough for a family, they were refused.  The bank, having consistently refused them a loan, recently extended their credit card limit to the same amount.  This indicates to me that some of the banks have learned nothing.  They are continuing to extort money by way of high interest rates on credit card debt, rather than managing the situation.  What is the Central Bank-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
