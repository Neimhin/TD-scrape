Is that not a false dichotomy because as I listen more carefully to some of the points made, I find myself agreeing with both sides?  It has more to do with the number of factors.  It is a question not of whether this is a high or a low tax economy but about whom we tax and for what purpose.  How do we balance the tax system?  I would like Ms Burke to respond to this question.  I agree with Mr. Cribben that we have to put more money in people's pockets.  I have opposed the excise increases on alcohol and cigarettes because they are regressive, but, equally, when we are talking about tax relief, there is a big difference between giving tax to low and middle income earners who need extra spending power and to people at the very top end because even if they pay fewer taxes, they do not put the money back into the economy.  They will invest it in property abroad, buy more yachts or whatever else it is very rich people do with their money.

With regard to business, Ms Burke seems to be hinting at a more progressive rates system.  I am in favour of a more progressive rates system that distinguishes between the small and medium enterprise and the big multinational or in parking charges, which are regressive.  I agree with her on these points, but I do not fully understand why the logical follow-on would not be that we increase corporation tax or have a progressive corporation tax system, for example, in order that very profitable big corporations would make a bigger contribution, with progressivity at least in terms of small and medium enterprises.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An issue about which I am concerned and have flagged at the last two budgets is the attitude to the property sector, particularly real estate investment trusts, REITs.  These are contributing to what is now an increasing speculation and pumping up of the property area.  Mr. Talbot made a distinction between incentivising active as against passive investment.  REITs are a classic example of incentivising passive activity.  Big international investors with lots of cash are buying up what was initially cheap property and making a killing while driving up rents and property prices and creating a new bubble while we still have a massive housing crisis.  I believe we should get rid of REITs and any measures that incentivise property market speculation.  What are the veiws of the delegations on that?
