RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Higgins will go first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask about buy-to-let arrangements and tenants in cases of receivership.  While the set of problems concerning those who took out mortgages to buy their own homes has been highlighted, the plight of tenants who pay rent and have a reasonable expectation of security of tenure has not been highlighted to any great extent over the past year or two.  They find that because their landlord has gone bust, receivers move in and tell them they must leave, in many cases at very short notice.  This presents a big problem, particularly for families with children.  In the current market, it is very difficult in many cases to obtain alternative accommodation.  What is the attitude of the delegation to this?  The delegates said they will let the leases run.  Leases will have expired in many cases.  Typically in the private rental sector, one gets a one-year lease in the first year and no lease at all after that.  When the delegates say they let leases expire, does this mean, in reality, that people get a monthâ€™s or two months' notice in many cases when the banks' receivers move in?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Basically, as far as the bank is concerned, the criterion is the lease.  Could the delegates tell me a little more?  If I am reading the figures correctly, 2,675 buy-to-let properties are in arrears.  I calculate that in the case of 1,600 of these, letters have been issued relating to rent-receiver or legal proceedings of some kind.  This amounts to two thirds of the buy-to-let properties.  The tenants could face the possibility of eviction relatively soon.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I want to clarify.  I am dealing with cases on this issue.  I cannot recall whether any of them deal with Ulster Bank.  It is a pity I did not check before coming here today.  The people I am dealing with receive a letter telling them rent receivers are taking over and that they are out.  Under the residential tenancies legislation, there is supposed to be a four-year cycle once one is a tenant for six months, I believe.  The bank should have to honour that.  The banks can get around it by saying they are going to sell the property.  What is the attitude of Ulster Bank in such circumstances?  I want to hear that the bank's attitude is such that tenants will not be turfed out if they have nowhere else to go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to hold Mr. Brown to that over the next while.  Is the bank giving people back deposits where they are required to leave, for whatever reason?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, I will hold the delegation to that because not every bank is doing so.  Let me refer specifically to those who are in many cases forced into voluntary surrender, by circumstance or by the bank.  The cause remains to be seen.  I wish to ask about the unemployed, in particular.  People have lost their jobs and are dependent on social welfare through no fault of their own in most circumstances.  Are these the individuals who are facing voluntary surrender or legal proceedings, or is the bank doing deals for the unemployed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The bank has a solution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, these are points we will hold the delegates to over the next while.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My next point goes to the heart of many of the questions we are asked.  Is it the case that the bank will not force individuals, even those who are unemployed or on the lowest income, out of their homes if they are willing to engage with the bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to mortgage-to-rent arrangements, the delegates stated one has been concluded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many have asked for the option?
