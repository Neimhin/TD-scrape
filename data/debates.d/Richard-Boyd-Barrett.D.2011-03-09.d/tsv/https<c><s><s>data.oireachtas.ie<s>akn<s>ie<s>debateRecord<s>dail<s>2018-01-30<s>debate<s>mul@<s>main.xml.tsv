RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, it was positive to visit our troops. There is no doubt about their bravery and the importance of the work they do, but we really have to up the ante in our political criticism and questioning of what Israel is doing. As mentioned, there are many child prisoners, including Ahed Tamimi, while illegal settlement continues. Also to be considered is the strangulation of Gaza and the appalling humanitarian circumstances there. Specifically regarding our troops, I presume the Taoiseach is aware that there have been some worrying signs of what Israel is talking about regarding Lebanon. This month Brigadier General Manelis, the Israeli defence forces spokesperson, warned of a possible war, another war, between Israel and Lebanon. In the summer of last year which was, interestingly, the same time Irish troops were forced to go to ground in the buffer zone in Syria having been fired upon by certain rebel groups that are reputedly co-operating with the Israelis Israel was talking about the UN presence in southern Lebanon as being unnecessary, implying cover was being given to Hezbollah. Israel was making all sorts of excuses to criticise the UN presence in the region. This is the sort of stuff that preceded previous Israeli attacks in Lebanon where thousands of people have been killed, including UN peacekeepers on a number of occasions. Therefore, we need to be robust in our criticism of Israel's warmongering in this regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of the many pressing infrastructure needs the country has, the most pressing is being able to put an affordable roof over the heads of our citizens. This is vital from a social and economic point of view. Given that in the budget the Taoiseach committed, between the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and Home Building Finance Ireland, approximately €1 billion in supports for private developers to deliver housing, what, if anything, is the Government doing to ensure that we are going to get an appropriate return in terms of affordable housing? It amounts to public investment being given to private developers. When the LIHAF proposal was first introduced, for example, the Government announced that 40% of any development supported by LIHAF was going to be affordable. Within a month, that was gone. Now, there is no guaranteed percentage and no definition of affordability. All this money is going out but nothing is guaranteed. The same applies with Home Building Finance Ireland, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and NAMA land. There are no guarantees that for anything built, in some cases in particularly large developments, any significant or guaranteed proportion will actually be affordable. I wish to remind the Taoiseach that prior to the crash we were building 90,000 houses per year. They were unaffordable. That is part of the reason we had a crash. We can up the supply but if the prices being charged by private developers are unaffordable, it is not sustainable. What commitments are we getting on affordability?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We also get all our money back with social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To paraphrase Marx, a spectre is haunting Fine Gael - the spectre of the unfair property tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Karl. The spectre I refer to is the unfair property tax and the dramatic hikes because of property prices increasing by 71%. The Minister has acknowledged the folly of this unfair property tax by deferring the initial revaluation and is now talking about a cross-departmental review. Does he not think it is time to acknowledge that there is no way of tweaking the property tax that will make it fair because by its nature, it is regressive and will hit low and middle-income families?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In our area, people are already being crucified in many cases but they will be absolutely nailed to the wall if anything even approaching the increase in property values is translated into an increase in property tax. The point about this tax is that it does not take into account ability to pay. Even with the existing tax, there are 46,000 people who have been forced to defer because their income is not sufficient to pay the tax. That will jump through the roof. Already, there is a cohort of people who just cannot pay. Why is the Minister imposing a tax on people who just cannot pay? The pension, social welfare payment or low income of someone on social welfare or a pensioner who happens to own their house in an area like Dún Laoghaire or south Dublin will not be any greater because they live in an area with high property values. What is the Minister going to do to recognise that fundamental injustice?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me remind the Minister that at the time the property tax was brought in, the Minister justified it by saying there would be more money available for local services. Actually there has not been a cent more. The 25% cut in local government funding that preceded it was never replaced. We then had a property tax that reduced central Government funding on a euro-for-euro basis. We got no extra services for this but what we did get was an unfair tax. The Minister has simply not addressed the issue of unaffordability and the regressive nature of the tax. My proposal to the Minister is what we proposed in our pre-budget submission that the local property tax should be abolished for principal private dwellings and replaced with a landlord's tax. In other words, we should tax second, third, fourth or fifth properties and people who own property that is simply wealth and not the roof over their head. The Government could replace one with the other. That would be a genuine wealth tax which would not hit people on low incomes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a good idea.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are making a fortune.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit has always opposed public private partnerships as a means to build schools, housing or other vital infrastructure. What has happened with Carillion and has now affected Coláiste Ráithín, St. Philomena's, the Eureka secondary school, Tyndall College and the Carlow Institute for Further Education confirms what we predicted when the Government and the main Opposition party embraced the notion of public private partnerships. What happened with McNamara and the housing developments in this city has happened now with Carillion, and several other PPP projects, in that when the private for-profit entity goes bust or walks away, whatever it might be, we are left holding the can. It is not the private sector which takes the risk it is the school students who have been existing in poor school conditions for years, hoping to get into a new school building and then fall victim to private interests who are in the business not of delivering schools but of making profits and if they are not making profits they walk away or go out of business. That is the fundamental problem with PPPs. First, we need emergency legislation to get hold of those schools and ensure that the children can go into those building. The situation should not be allowed delay people going in and using those schools. We should recognise that we have to get those schools back into full public ownership so they are not controlled or dependent in any way on private for-profit interests. The Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the Committee of Public Accounts and any other relevant committees should now examine in detail what happened in the public private partnership in which Carillion was involved but also the public private partnership model must be investigated and examined to see whether, as I believe is the case, it is something that should be abandoned for the provision of schools and other vital infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a fundamental problem with the Minister's response. His statement that the private partner is taking the risk is clearly not correct. The risk is being taken by the students, teachers, schools and communities who cannot access the buildings they badly need and the building workers who do not know whether they will be paid. This case illustrates the fundamental folly of public private partnerships. The Minister put his hands up and said it was up to the private partner to sort out the problem as the State cannot do so. Is that supposed to serve as helpful assurance? The problem is that the State has signed away responsibility for delivering schools that communities and students badly need to entities that can walk away and stood to make a substantial profit. According to some reports, the consortium involved stood to make €150 million out of a deal involving an investment of €9 million. Deputies cannot find out the details of public private partnerships because they are subject to commercial secrecy. I repeat my call to have the Committee on Budgetary Oversight or Committee of Public Accounts investigate the details of this and other public private partnerships.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will speak to amendment No. 80 as it is grouped with amendment No. 74. My amendment gets to the heart of what the Mahon tribunal was all about. It was about corrupt payments to politicians for land rezonings and planning. It was a key issue that angered and scandalised people. Senior figures in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were accused of taking payments of one sort or another to influence decisions around planning, and these were confirmed in some cases. One of the key recommendations of the tribunal has not been included in legislation which was supposed to implement the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal which centred on corruption of senior people in the two biggest political parties in the State. It involved the brown envelope brigade, as they were known, and payments made in Conway's pub at the end of O'Connell Street to senior figures in political parties for planning permission and rezonings. These actions made a lot of money for a lot of people but the people of this country paid a bitter price for it. Among his many recommendations, Judge Mahon proposed that relevant political donations to public representatives who have a role in decision-making or who influence decisions around planning and rezoning be made public, but this is not included in the legislation. In the Bills digest summarising the responses to the various recommendations, it is suggested that the reason it was not done was that the implications and practicalities would have to be carefully worked through. I do not know why they have to be carefully worked through. We need to know if developers or other people with a stake in planning decisions or development are making donations to political parties. In my own short time as a public representative, I have experienced an instance of somebody with a development proposal offering to pay election expenses to one of our councillors if the councillor supported a particular development plan. It is outrageous but this is still going on. We need to know who is getting donations from developers and how this may relate to how they vote in development plans or how they make observations or otherwise exercise influence around planning because councillors do not have direct influence any more, though their observations can certainly have an influence. This amendment requires that there be disclosure of any donation of any amount in monetary terms or other form to any political party or individual representative in any county council or to a Member of Dáil Éireann that was made prior to the planning application, and this information shall be made publicly available by the authority. I do not see why we would not include this amendment, given that it was recommended by Judge Mahon. I would be interested to hear what the Minister and other Deputies have to say about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept that SIPO's regulations around political donations and funding are sufficient, as good as the work of SIPO might be. This is specifically about planning corruption. This was at the heart of some of the worst corrupt practices in the political system - how it corrupted planning and rezoning decisions to make fortunes for people, where local communities suffered the consequences and where major political parties were deeply implicated. To ensure this does not happen, the people in every local authority area need to be able to access easily all information pertaining to who has a stake, who has tried to exercise influence regarding rezoning and planning decisions, or where money has exchanged hands with politicians that may have influenced their planning decisions. People need to know that information. Otherwise they are not getting the whole picture. During my short experience as a councillor before being elected to the Dáil, I had reason to believe that money was at play with regard to one development plan with which I was involved, that developers were trying to influence councillors and that they were making donations to certain councillors who were supporting certain decisions. I believe the public has a right to know. No doubt, some of those councillors will defend their position and say it is legitimate, and we can argue that point, but I think the public has a right to know. I urge the Minister of State to accept the proposal from the Mahon tribunal. This is not a proposal from the radical left. It is the left in the Dáil inserting as an amendment what the Mahon tribunal proposed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister of State's response but I will press the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 80:In page 48, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:“(2) Section 38 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following new subsection after subsection (1A), inserted by the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010:“(1B) Prior to the planning authority giving its decision in respect of a planning application, the applicant shall disclose any donation of any amount in monetary terms or other form to any political party or individual representative in any county council or to a member of Dáil Éireann that was made prior to the planning application and this information shall be made publicly available by the authority.”.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much time do I have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Sinn Féin for tabling its motion on the critical issue of affordable housing. We support the overall direction and thrust of its motion, but we have some additional points to make on what needs to be done with public land in terms of affordable housing. We also have what I would say are slightly more ambitious proposals about what needs to be done with regard to private development to increase the proportions of both social and affordable housing. I will expand on that. Our amendment takes on board most of the Sinn Féin motion but adds a number of points. To the Government I would say that the broad thrust of our argument is that we must start off by recognising that the private sector is not in the business of producing not-for-profit housing. This is such a blindingly obvious point, but it is not taken on board in the policies of the two main parties. Let me repeat the point. Profit-based businesses do not do not-for-profit. That is not what they are designed for and plans to ramp up residential construction which overwhelmingly depend on the private sector will not deliver affordable and social housing in the quantities we need in order to deal with the crisis. To cite an example, one of the biggest developments which will be built in the State is Cherrywood. It will be virtually a new town. I am going to keep talking about it because it is important. NAMA sold the lands to Hines Real Estate Ireland for a song, which was disgraceful in and of itself. Now Hines Real Estate Ireland is offering social housing built on land sold to it by the State back to the council. Does the Minister of State know what price Hines Real Estate Ireland offered for the first tranche of 1,200 of what will be 8,000 units? This offer included a discount in light of social housing obligations under Part V. One-bedroom units were offered for €243,000, two-bedroom units for €358,000 and three-bedroom units for €442,000. That is at a discount on the market price. That offer comes to a total of €41 million.  Does the Minister of State see the point? The affordable mortgage scheme is useless to people who are trying to purchase houses that will be sold at that level. The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, was initially proposed to deliver affordable housing. The original Government proposal - its promise - was that 40% of any LIHAF supported development would be affordable and that affordability in Dublin would mean less than €300,000. Within one month, because of lobbying from the likes of Hines Real Estate Ireland, this proposal was abandoned. It is now gone. We do not know whether we will get any percentage of affordable housing in Cherrywood if affordable is to mean something that is actually affordable for people on average incomes. There is talk of as little as 2%. If one looks at the prices Hines Real Estate Ireland is proposing for the Part V 10%, however, none of it will be affordable. We are giving these guys LIHAF funding and getting nothing back. This is ridiculous. Our motion proposes that any LIHAF funding must at least guarantee that the Government's own original proposal of 40% of units being genuinely affordable to people on average incomes will be met. We are saying that the 10% given over in such developments under Part V is not enough. We need at least 20% social housing and at least 20% affordable housing on any private development of any description, because there is no point in building houses at those prices. It is worse than useless. Even if people can take out mortgages to pay those prices, they will be in debt for the rest of their lives and we will be facing into the madness that produced the last crash. We need genuinely affordable housing, not prices that are off the Richter scale in order to profit these guys. Similarly, all NAMA sites should be used to build social and affordable housing. Let me underline that I said both social and affordable. Nothing on a NAMA site should be sold at those kinds of market prices. It would be madness for the State to do that. No Home Building Finance Ireland supported development should be sold at those prices. All of it should be linked to affordability. Any Ireland Strategic Investment Fund supported housing development should be linked to affordability. If it is not, what is the point in doing it? There is no point. If those caveats are not put in, the only beneficiaries will be the private developers. It will be useless in dealing with our problem.  We need a mix of social and affordable housing on public sites, but affordable housing cannot be a Trojan Horse for the privatisation of public sites. Therefore, there must be an absolute condition that mixed tenure should first of all mean that the thresholds for eligibility for council housing are raised so that anybody who cannot qualify under the current thresholds up to low and middle incomes should be allowed to go onto social housing lists. That is how we get real social mix. We have to remove the stigma from social housing so that not only those on the lowest incomes are allowed to apply. Social housing should be an option for everybody. That is how to get social mix.  For those who do want to purchase, however, if the house is developed on public land, there must be a council first buy-back provision. In other words, if the house is being sold at any time in the future, it must be sold back to the council and there should be no capital gain above and beyond normal inflation. If it was bought at a discount on public land, it should be sold back to the council at the same level. It should remain affordable forever or revert to being council housing. Otherwise, it becomes a Trojan Horse for the privatisation of public land and public housing and actually depletes the stock of public housing, which led us to the mess we are in now. That must not be allowed to happen again. Will the Government please define affordability? What is affordable? If one is on €35,000 a year, what can one afford to borrow? One cannot afford to borrow the cost of anything available on the market in most of the major cities. Affordability must be linked to the real incomes of average earners who are not eligible for social housing. If those things are not done, this is all just waffle which will go nowhere and which will not deal with the crisis of affordability and the provision of social housing. Those are our proposals. I hope the Government will take them seriously.
