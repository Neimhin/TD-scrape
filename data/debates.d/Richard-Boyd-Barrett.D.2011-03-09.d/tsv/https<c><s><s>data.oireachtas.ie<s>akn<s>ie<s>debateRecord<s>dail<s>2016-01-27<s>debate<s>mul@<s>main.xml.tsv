RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is reported that of the 160,000 refugees the European Union has agreed to resettle, a pathetic 0.17% of them is all that have been taken, despite the quite vile hysteria whipped up by certain governments, most recently the French Government, about these desperate people fleeing the most desperate circumstances. In fact, Europe has done very little to implement even what it said it would do to resettle 160,000 people. Will the Minister confirm that fewer than 100 of the 2,500 this country was supposed to take in by the end of 2015 have come to the country? The figure I have heard is 32 and perhaps the Minister can give us the actual figure. When will we take our full complement of these desperate people who need our assistance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think comments such as those of the French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, regarding the threat of destabilisation across Europe because of the refugees, in which he also said that Europe was incapable of taking this number of people, were very helpful. We have had other far-right-influenced comments and statements by certain leaders across Europe. Much of what was agreed at the European Council seems to be about stemming the flow of people getting into Europe and putting up Europe's borders rather than assisting people. There are thousands of people in these camps in harsh winter conditions. Forty people drowned last Friday, including kids, off the Greek islands. This is horrendous stuff. I am not pointing fingers at the Minister, but it seems to me that the reason refugees are not going to certain countries, notably France and also Hungary, which has a particularly vile record, is that it is being made clear by certain European leaders that they are not welcome. These European leaders are essentially pandering to racism and xenophobia and creating hysteria when there should not be any. One point I like to make is that in the highest year of immigration into this country, during the boom period, more than 10,000 people came into Ireland in one year. Almost as many people came into this country in one year as Europe is planning to take in over the entire resettlement programme, and virtually nobody noticed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with the singer Manu Chao, but he has a song called "No Human Being is Illegal". That is the narrative we need to put out there. I do not even think terms like "flood" and "huge" are helpful. A very serious crisis has occurred in Syria, but the truth is that, because of the demographics of Europe and our ageing population, we need people to come in. Immigrants add, rather than subtracting, economically, socially, culturally and in every way. We have to be very forceful and robust in standing up to certain leaders and certain voices across Europe who are, frankly, misrepresenting in a racist, xenophobic manner and creating hysteria when none is required. Of course there are logistical questions, but I fear some leaders are moving towards "fortress Europe" policies that are directed more at keeping people in Africa or the Middle East. How the hell are Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which are much poorer than most of the European countries, able to handle it? I am sure there are problems for them, but they manage. We have to be more generous, we have to change the narrative and we have to stand up to the racist voices, including some of the European leaders, who are not being helpful in this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The teachers are to a very large extent the institutes. They are the staff who deliver the education. They are deeply concerned and I am utterly convinced by their concerns that this is being rushed for political reasons without proper consultation with them. Next week the TUI is out on strike again because the institutes have been savaged. Although I do not have the figures in front of me, if I am correct they have lost 34% of their funding. There has been a very significant increase in the number of students while funding has been cut. One can imagine, against that background, they are fairly sceptical about what on the face of it looks like something with which candidates can go back to their constituencies stating, "We are giving you a university." They know this is nonsense when their funding has been slashed, when the numbers have gone through the roof without additional staff resources and they fear that the institutes of technology could be seriously undermined and that the diversity of course offerings on a regional basis will be lost as mergers go ahead and institutes are subsumed into one another. What is special and unique and has been so successful about the institutes of technology will be lost. We should take their concerns seriously. It is entirely fair to state that this should not go ahead without the agreement of the teaching staff because without them one has nothing. Their concerns are legitimate. At this stage, the teaching staff's hope is that the Government will not sign off on this before the dissolution of the Dáil so there can be proper discussion and debate in the new Dáil. The Government should listen to that appeal and accept it so we can have a proper discussion on the concerns of the teachers on this.While the teachers are not against the idea of technological universities, as the Minister knows, they are very concerned about the context in which it is happening and they would like to be assured that it is not just about more cuts, rationalisation and even a push towards privatisation under the guise of upgrading and reform.
