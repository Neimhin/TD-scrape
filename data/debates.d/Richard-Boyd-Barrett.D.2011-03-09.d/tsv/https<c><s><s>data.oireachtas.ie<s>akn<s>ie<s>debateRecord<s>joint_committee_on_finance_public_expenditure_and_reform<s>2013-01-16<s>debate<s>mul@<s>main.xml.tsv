RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it fair to say that there is a strong thread of consistency between how the Governor is approaching the issues of national debt, the mortgage crisis and economic recovery? All of these matters are of interest to the Governor and he outlined in the bank's strategic plan his priorities. In terms of the Governor's approach on the national debt, the common thread is that he is really saying Joe Public must carry the can, fully and completely, there will be no write-down and there may be a little restructuring. When it comes to mortgage debt, the Governor states Joe Public must carry the can 100%, there will be no write-down and there may be a little restructuring, and in terms of the economic crisis that has resulted from all of that, Joe Public must carry the whole can. What unites his policy and perspective is the priority of protecting private financial institutions. That is the thread that runs through it all - Joe Public carries the can and the private financial institutions get protected. The best the Governor was offering is a little bit of tweaking in restructuring where that suffocating burden and price for an economic crisis caused by others will be strung out over a longer period.This is essentially what Professor Honohan is telling us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So there will be a write-down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the short time available to me I must ask Professor Honohan-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is simple restructuring, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is only restructuring, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no write-down. That is not even being discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy's presentation is a little like what his colleagues are complaining about, namely, bankers coming in here and stating they will not give any forgiveness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is exactly the same. I am making a direct analogy between the two and I am stating it is the problem. Professor Honohan is capitulating to a perspective which is that we carry the can for everything in terms of the national debt and we might get a little restructuring if we are really lucky, and in terms of mortgage distress the mortgage holders will carry the can for the whole lot and if they are really lucky they might get a bit of mortgage restructuring.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to pick Professor Honohan up on this because I have very little time. He stated if we gain blanket write-down to current market values across the board instead of the failing system of dealing with it individually, which has delivered nothing so far and even Fiona Muldoon accepts it delivers virtually nothing, that the public would have to pick it up. I will put another scenario to Professor Honohan. This year banks in this country will pay out €17.4 billion to senior bondholders. They already have this money because we put it in there and they will pay it out to senior bondholders. I propose they do not do so, and we could use the money to provide the write-down on mortgage debt. It would not require any further cost for the public or any further borrowing to add to our national debt. What is wrong with this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is money in the private banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This year we will pay €9.1 billion in interest and in addition the private banks, which we bailed out with money we gave them, will pay out €17 billion to senior bondholders. This is €26 billion. Our primary deficit this year is €3 billion. Is it not simply false to claim we will face a huge deficit cliff if we repudiate the debt and refuse to pay off senior bondholders and give a bit of relief to our economy and distressed mortgage holders? We have the money. We put it into the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Such as?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let them get burned instead of us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Against what I have proposed Professor Honohan stated dire consequences would follow. Does it worry him that an EU Commission report stated domestic growth is in deep trouble and if it continues to deteriorate and the unemployment situation does not improve, our debt may become unsustainable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could not be much worse for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to return briefly to the prospects for economic recovery. In the best case scenario set out by the troika and the Government, we are looking at a situation where at the end of this year there will be zero increase in net employment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not according to the medium-term fiscal outlook; it will be zero.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Their best projection is that by 2015 it might have dropped by about 1% to 2%. In the best case scenario, therefore, we are facing chronic mass unemployment for the next three years. If the European Commission is correct and things turn out worse in the domestic economy, it will be worse than that. Does Professor Honohan honestly think that is a serious perspective that offers any hope to the people of this country over the next three years? Does he really think that is the best we can offer as an economic perspective?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we not examine it instead of just ridiculing it? Given that we have detailed figures on the Government's perspective and the troika's perspective, and they are not exactly bright and hopeful, would it not be worth examining the alternative scenario rather than just ridiculing it as certain to bring disaster?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the downside.
