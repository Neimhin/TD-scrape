RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we allowed ask general questions about what the Office of the Ombudsman for Children does?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The main point made by the Ombudsman for Children in his submission is that he is worried about the fact the office is funded by the Department rather than the Oireachtas, and this needs to be addressed so it is fully independent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At present the Ombudsman for Children is not allowed to do anything about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And a remit to look at all issues to do with accommodation and administrative processes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Good luck with that. Can we do anything to help in this regard? We should be agreeing with the Ombudsman for Children; I certainly do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Until it is abolished completely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The role of the Ombudsman for Children includes generally monitoring the situation of children in the country and advising the Government on policy and legislation to ensure the protection of children. I wish to ask about the position of children in families being pushed through homeless services or having housing difficulties. Is this a significant feature of the complaints the Ombudsman for Children receives or a general concern of his? If it is not I strongly urge him to look at it because the situation is dire. Many families with children, often with disabilities and special needs, arrive to local authority offices facing homelessness and are told there is nothing for them and to sleep in the car for the weekend, or they are placed in completely unsuitable environments such as hotels or emergency hostel accommodation with people with drug problems. This week I spoke to a young woman with two young special needs children who was placed in a hotel. After she walked through the door, she was offered heroin by the first person she met, in front of her children. This is where the local authority put her. It is absolutely unacceptable for children to be in this environment. Does the Ombudsman for Children receive many complaints in this area? Does he have concerns about it? If so, is he making his views known? Should I encourage people to make complaints to the Ombudsman for Children about the situation, because it needs to be dealt with urgently? I am also greatly concerned about youth mental health services. Does the Ombudsman for Children receive many complaints in this area and is he concerned? The situation in this regard is also dire. There is a lack of beds for young people with mental health problems, often who are self-harming and possibly suicidal. They are either put in adult hospitals which are totally inappropriate, or told there is nothing for them and are given no supports or resources. I have a very worrying case of a mother who believes her son may commit suicide. He has been self-harming. She has gone to the HSE, and to everybody, but has been told there is nothing for her. I would like the Ombudsman for Children to respond on these two areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People should not be in this situation because there should be sufficient housing stock. However, given that a crisis does exist, a simple measure that could be taken is to allow self-referral for families in that situation. In other words, instead of being told by the local authority to move to some completely unsuitable hotel or hostel because the Dublin homeless service happens to have a contract with it, they would be told to find a suitable hotel if they cannot find private rented accommodation or council housing. Within reasonable limits, the accommodation might be more appropriate to children. That would save considerable heartache and prevent children from being endangered, which is the currently the case with many of the referrals made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Dr. Muldoon agree that it should be illegal for any State agency to put children in situations that are inappropriate or potentially dangerous, where they are vulnerable? Should we introduce legislation to ensure these situations cannot occur?
