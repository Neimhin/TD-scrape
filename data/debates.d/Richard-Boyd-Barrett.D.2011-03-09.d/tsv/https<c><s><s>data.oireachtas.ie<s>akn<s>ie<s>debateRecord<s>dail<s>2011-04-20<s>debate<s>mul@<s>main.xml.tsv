RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the fact that we will have an opportunity to discuss the Nyberg report today, although I cannot say I welcome its content. Given the media coverage today that the McCarthy report proposes the sale not of €2 billion worth of State assets, as specified in the programme for Government, but of €5 billion worth, and lists such bodies as Coillte, the ESB, and harbours and ports, is it not a matter of urgency that we debate the report before the Easter break? This is not about what happened in the past but what will be done to vital public assets in the future in order to pay off the bad gambling debts of bankers and speculators at the behest of the IMF. Could we have time before the Easter break to discuss this report and hear the Taoiseach's response to its recommendations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we start it tomorrow?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe the Deputy will tell us about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not really an answer. Reports have been circulating in the media about the Garda and a bill for €25 million for security for the visits. Nobody knows the figure — certainly I do not — but perhaps the Taoiseach knows whether that figure is part of such a cost or is the total considerably greater? Who will pay for it? Is it to come from the Taoiseach's Department?The public are entitled to know what the cost of such visits will be, given they are being slaughtered with cuts, left, right and centre. If the figure of €25 million, for example, is even close to accurate, let us think how many hospital beds could reopen and how many public amenities——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——or public services that were cut could be restored. Is it not merely rubbing the noses of the Irish public, who have been slaughtered with cuts, to invite one of the richest women in the world to this country for a jamboree or to spend millions on bringing over the American President when that President is involved in a war in Afghanistan, is arming and financing dictatorships in the Middle East, and so on? Is that an appropriate use of public money in these straitened times?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach may be aware the previous visit to Dún Laoghaire was accompanied by a protest organised by none other than James Connolly. It was a justified protest because the monarch represented and symbolised vast inherited wealth and the subjugation of poor people in this country. To bring it up to date, is it not incredible for the Taoiseach to say we will only know the cost of these visits afterwards, when people are being slaughtered with cuts, left, right and centre, with the loss of vital services? The vulnerable in our society——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach not have a responsibility to tell the public, before these visits, how much they will cost so that we can debate as a society whether that is the best way to spend that money rather than putting it into the services people need and into job creation programmes——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——rather than for a jamboree for one of the wealthiest women in the world and one of the world's most powerful men?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our harbour has not been sold.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A ballpark figure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wonder will they travel around throwing cake to the peasants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While everyone welcomes inward investment, particularly if it is ethical in nature and is aimed at making a serious contribution to our society, is it not a major mistake to bet the entire economic future of the country on the hope of such investment? A necessary accompaniment to this type of investment is a ratcheting down of taxes on business and wealth. This produces an unsustainable narrowing of the tax base, which lies at the root of our deficit problem. Is it not time to debate the sacred cow of low taxation on wealth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not also time to state that rather than just betting our economic future on inward investment, we must concentrate on developing an indigenous industrial base which is sustainable and which will not be vulnerable to the shocks and ups and downs that occur in the global market? We are aware that the latter is desperately unstable because it is driven by profit and competition rather than the best interests of ordinary people and society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Higgins is right to be hysterical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am Deputy Boyd Barrett. The Ceann Comhairle is Deputy Barrett.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I found the Minister of State's response rather depressing. It was the same stuff I had heard from Dublin Bus when I asked it about the savage cutbacks to bus services across Dublin. I remind the Minister of State that before the general election, a policy document suggested "the bus remains the only public transport option with the short and medium term capacity to meet the growing transport needs of an increasing urban population". It referred to the "need to dramatically reform our bus networks to increase capacity, frequency and attractiveness as a public transport option". It correctly pointed out that for every bus taken off the road, 90 cars went on the road. In that context, I ask the Minister of State to scrap the Dublin Bus network review immediately. Despite its innocent name, the review is nothing but a savage, unjust and counter-productive onslaught on bus services across the city. It will result in 200 buses being removed from the bus network and 200 jobs being lost. It will cause immense suffering among the elderly, the disabled, schoolchildren and low-income families. As part of the review, some 23 routes are being scrapped, while the frequency of dozens of other routes is being reduced. As a result of these cuts, there will be an additional 2,000 cars on the road. In their pre-election manifestos the Government parties stated we needed more buses to take cars off the road.I appeal to the Minister of State, if he is serious about his commitment to the bus network, to give a commitment to scrap the review immediately, reinstate bus services and reverse the cuts that have affected the most vulnerable people in our society, including the elderly. Perhaps he is looking for the money needed to reverse the €30 million cut in the Dublin Bus subvention. I have heard a figure of €25 million bandied about in the context of the forthcoming visits of President Obama and the queen. We should not bother bringing President Obama and the queen here. Instead, we should use the €25 million to increase the subvention to Dublin Bus. Would the money not be far better spent in that way?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Deputy suggesting the queen is more important than the elderly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She will not be using Dublin Bus.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State's offer and will take him up on it. However, this is a much bigger issue. Thousands of elderly people in Dublin, including those who are immobile or disabled, have been affected by cuts to many bus routes, including routes Nos. 3, 5, 10, 13a, 25x and 38c. There has been a disastrous attack on bus services, including Nitelink services, which are needed by some of our most vulnerable citizens such as young people and low-income families. I appeal to the new Government which before the general election correctly highlighted the importance of maintaining bus services to scrap the review which is nothing but a cover for cutbacks. It should reinstate bus services and stop the review now. The Minister of State has said there is no money to do so. While I accept the IMF stuff, I do not accept the rationale behind paying off bankers, etc. I have made a serious proposal. I ask the Minister to ask the Taoiseach not to spend €25 million or €30 million on——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask where is the money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister to ask the Taoiseach not to spend €25 million on the visit of two individuals to this country. The money should be spent instead on increasing the subvention for Dublin Bus and providing the funds required to reinstate bus services which have been cut across Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Nyberg report spectacularly fails to identify the causes of the financial and economic crisis in simple and straightforward language. Some €1.2 million was spent on producing 100 pages of insipid financial jargon and meaningless psychobabble that blames everybody and nobody at the same time and explains little or nothing about what created the financial and economic crisis. It is evident, however, that both the former ruling party, Fianna Fáil, and the new Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party welcome it precisely because it blames everyone and no one and tells us nothing about how the crisis started. As a result the report gives us no direction on how to deal with the crisis or its causes.The banking crisis did not result from herding, group-think or other psychological explanations and certainly did not come, as this report at times dangerously suggests, from the action of the majority of Irish people. It did not come from "misjudging risk", as the title of the most misnamed report I can imagine suggests. It resulted from greed. The report should be called "Misjudging Greed". The crisis came about because of the staggering greed of bankers, developers and super wealthy elites in this country and internationally who were cheered on by the political establishment on almost all sides, in both this country and the EU, where an economic doctrine of greed and profit was promoted. They were also cheered on in that regard by much of the mass media. The idea that all of us, or even the majority, went along with this nonsense is insulting in the extreme. Ordinary people knew this. They could see the madness as hundreds of thousands of profit-driven private apartment blocks and office blocks were shooting up all over the city while ordinary people looking for housing on housing lists could not get a house for love nor money. They knew this was mad and could see it as such, being driven by profit. Nonetheless, it was cheered on by the political establishment in this country and in Europe, was financed by the banks in both areas and cheered on by the mass media.The proof that no lessons have been learned about the real causes of this crisis, namely, the voracious, relentless greed of a minority in this country and across Europe, comprising bankers and developers, is that now, to punish these people, we talk about tinkering around with regulatory mechanisms. In reality, the real response of this Government to the greed of the people who caused the crisis was to pour €70 billion into the same banks that caused the crisis, thereby crushing our people with brutal cutbacks, austerity, mass unemployment and emigration. This Government refuses to reverse the policies of the last Government which caused the crisis in the first place.A further and even worse proof of the failure to learn any lessons from the crisis and its causes is the Government's plan, by selling State assets, to do to the real economy what was done to the financial sector. It plans to hand over those valuable assets to the same corporate vultures who caused the financial crisis. They can then do the same to the real economy as they did to the financial system. This is a recipe to keep going down the same road of disaster at the expense of ordinary people. It is a load of rubbish and we should point the finger at those responsible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the points have been made. It is extraordinary that the Labour Party would not wish to do something urgently about this unbelievable giveaway of natural resources. In responses I have heard so far from the Government, it seems to be hiding behind lame excuses, claiming the finds of billions of euro of gas and oil equivalent off the west coast are not proven and consequently this justifies the extraordinary licensing arrangements whereby those who will develop——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——our gas and oil fields will give no royalties to the Irish people. We will have no security of supply for any gas or oil that may be found off the west coast and even in regard to the taxes which are in place the companies will get tax write-offs and effectively will pay no tax whatsoever. One could not get a better definition of a giveaway.We are discussing a resource estimated to have a possible value of up to €800 billion or €900 billion at current oil and gas prices. It is extraordinary. Why do we have a licensing arrangement? Why do we continue to stand over such arrangements? When these companies find gas and oil we hand ownership over to them instead of having our own State gas and oil company which would retain ownership. Of course, we may need to have production sharing agreements or other arrangements with foreign gas and oil companies when we need their expertise but the notion of handing it all over to them is just extraordinary. The people of Rossport and Erris have suffered the consequences of Shell controlling the whole process.I appeal to the Government, for God's sake, to do something about this unbelievable giveaway of our natural resources.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are running the place already.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will be created through public works programmes.
