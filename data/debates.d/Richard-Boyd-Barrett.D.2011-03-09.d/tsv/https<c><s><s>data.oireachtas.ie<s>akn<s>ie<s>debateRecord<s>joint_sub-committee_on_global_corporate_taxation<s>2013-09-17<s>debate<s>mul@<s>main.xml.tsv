RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is what is coming up here matching with what we received beforehand? Is it the same?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do you have that quote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Professor Barry for his contribution. He set matters out in a very interesting and illuminating way. What this sub-committee is about is debatable. Is it about protecting the 12.5% rate, about understanding the corporate tax regime or about ensuring that we have a fair corporate tax regime? I would be interested in hearing Professor Barry's opinion on what this sub-committee should be doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Vice Chairman should not cut across me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is very illuminating for the people following these proceedings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my opinion we need to examine the position with regard to corporate tax because this country is in a dire state and desperately needs revenue. People who bear no responsibility whatsoever for the current economic crisis are being crucified to the point where it is unbearable. At the same time there is significant evidence that enormously profitable corporations are paying nothing or next to nothing as a contribution to the states and societies which host and facilitate them. We need to address that and discover whether we can rebalance matters in a fair way so that those who have a lot will pay more and those who have nothing or close to nothing will obtain some relief. I am of the view that this is why we are considering the matter before us. The moral-relativist argument put forward by Professor Barry to the effect that it is all very ironic that the Americans or the EU should point the finger at us simply misses the point. I take it as read that politicians in America engage in grandstanding and that they are hypocritical, deceitful and cover up what is happening in their own country. However, that does not in any way answer the more substantial question about whether our tax regime is fair and just. Neither does it indicate whether that regime facilitates aggressive tax avoidance on the part of multinational corporations. If there has been a shifting of position by Senators Levin and McCain in the US, this may largely be explained as being opportunism and grandstanding on their part. There is, however, a much more fundamental reason for the shift to which I refer, namely, that they are being forced to address this question. This arises because ordinary American people and their counterparts in other countries are - faced with the global economic crisis - examining these things and demanding answers in respect of them. Whether they are American, European or Irish citizens, they are asking "How the hell is it that we are being screwed to the wall when these corporations are making billions and, apparently, paying no tax?" Is that question not the starting point for a serious discussion rather than pointing to hypocrisy on the part of American politicians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that argument and Professor Barry outlined it clearly. In fairness, he was very objective but he did make one moral value judgment when he stated while it may make sense for larger economies to have higher corporate tax rates, it does not make sense for smaller economies to have them. That matter is very much open to question and debate. I wish to put a direct question to Professor Barry. I was the first person to reveal - via replies I received to parliamentary questions I tabled approximately one year ago - startling facts about how little effective corporate tax is being paid by corporations in this country. The figures contained in the replies to which I refer and which emanated from the Department of Finance indicate that €70 billion was made in pre-tax profits by the corporations and that - following the various deductions, the application of reliefs, etc. - €4 billion was paid in tax. This means that approximately 6.2% was paid in corporation tax. The latter is the effective rate - not 11.1% or 12.5% - and it happens to coincide with EU Commission figures which indicate that our implicit rate of corporation tax is 6.8%. Notwithstanding the browbeating I received for revealing this information and references to the World Bank's measurement for effective rates which indicates a rate of 11.1% for Ireland, has Professor Barry not effectively admitted that I was right? Is it not the case that the real effective rate - and not one based on that which might apply to a mythical medium-sized company that produces ceramics - in terms of the level of profits made and how much tax paid is more in the region of 6% to 7%? Is this not borne out by Department of Finance and EUROSTAT figures and by Professor Barry's friend, Professor Devereux, in the second column which, I presume, involves a different calculation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the concept?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is empirical evidence, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would say that what we need-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Professor Barry has the reference for this, and for anyone who wants to seriously examine this, it is the CTS 1 table from the Department of Finance. People should also examine the CTS 3 table, which gives some of the headings under which the taxable profits of €70 billion are written down progressively such that they end up at €4 billion. That would be under headings such as trading losses, which allows an incredible €21 billion to be deducted from the figure, moving losses around from one part of a company to another, extraordinary losses appropriate to the trade and credible group relief charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I am saying is the figures are enormous and they need to be examined closely. I do not know what lies behind each of those. There is another heading, that of other deductions, which is baffling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is our job to examine the impact of these reliefs and if they are being exploited. Research and development is a good idea in principle, but what is being actually classed as research and development? Is it being abused?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that not a reasonable question given the fact that Professor Barry is stating objectively that highly paid lawyers and accountants are finding every possible loophole they can? They are pushing the law to the absolute limit. In those circumstances, do we not have to examine all these elements? Another major issue-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a subject to debate. Professor Barry spoke about closeness to markets and so on as part of the reason for that. We are part of a very big market, the European Union. It seems obvious that part of the reason American companies base themselves here is that we are an English speaking country within the European Union and we have a well educated workforce which speaks English. That is as much an attraction as anything else. I suggest we focus on the large companies, such as Google and so on that Professor Barry mentioned, and the use of new technology, as I understand it. I was told by somebody who used to work for Google - I would like Professor Barry to confirm it - that it sells advertising from a building on the quays, its Dublin headquarters, to Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It makes enormous profits from those advertising sales but a charge is levied by the Google Ireland holding company which is not tax resident, and that charge, conveniently, is almost exactly the same as the amount of its advertising profits. Given that our tax law does not deem that holding company to be tax resident in this country, it does not pay any tax on work that was done here but people in that building on the quays sell that advertising. That is tax dodging. The simple way to close it down is to say those people are selling advertising from here, generating those profits from here and that we do not deem it acceptable that this holding company is not tax liable as a way of dodging tax. We consider any company that is incorporated here to be tax liable here and we will enforce the 12.5% tax rate in respect of it. Surely that is the simple way to deal with what is a blatant tax dodge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Professor Barry for his interesting submission which got into the meat of this important issue. However, is he not understating the strategic importance of Ireland? Setting aside the tax issue, where else would Google and Facebook seriously go to access the European, north African and Middle Eastern markets other than an English-speaking country? It seems to me that they would not do so. Given the nature of their products, it is simply inconceivable that they would try to sell them from anywhere else other than Ireland, England or Scotland. That is the pattern of that particular type of investment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just one more sentence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In addition, there is a connected point. Professor Barry has accepted that the 11.1% is based on a hypothetical middle-sized company. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Professor Barry has told us they are Professor Devereux's data but he has not told us the source of the data.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept the figure provided because I have seen the Department of Finance figures and know the European Commission position. I think it is in the region of 6%. However, setting aside that figure, does Professor Barry accept that there is a very significant gap, even if it is 11.1%, between Ireland's effective rate and that of most other European countries?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the strategic and language advantages and the fact that our rate is so much lower than in the remainder of Europe, is there not scope to increase the tax take from corporations without risking a flight of investment capital out of Ireland? It seems to me obvious that there is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are buying jets with the profits.
