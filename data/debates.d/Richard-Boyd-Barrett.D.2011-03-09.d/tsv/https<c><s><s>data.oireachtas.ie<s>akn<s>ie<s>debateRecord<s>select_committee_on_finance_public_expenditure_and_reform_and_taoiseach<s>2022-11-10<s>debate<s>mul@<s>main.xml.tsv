RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:
“Reports
2. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the cost to the exchequer of abolishing the USC and replacing it with a High Income Social Charge of 10 per cent on all earnings over €90,000.”.Once upon a time, Fine Gael was for the abolition of the universal social charge, USC, because the party recognised that it was an austerity tax introduced following the economic collapse in 2008. It was a hefty burden and imposition placed on ordinary workers to pay for an economic and financial crisis that was not their fault. The Government has since abandoned, or at least Fine Gael has, the commitment to get rid of the USC. It is something that, justifiably, still provokes much anger among ordinary workers, because they are still paying what is, in effect, an austerity tax. It is our view, therefore, that the USC should go for those earning less than €100,000 annually. We have long held this position.  We do believe that we must pay for these things. We are very financially prudent on the socialist left and we believe that if something is going to cost the State revenue by reducing the tax burden on ordinary workers, then it must be paid for in some other way. We believe it should be paid for by introducing a higher-income social charge on those earning more than €100,000, as well as other measures that we proposed in our alternative budget. These included the introduction of new taxation bands for those earning more than €100,000. This is how the deficiency in lost revenue could be fairly paid for. Earning more than €100,000 is a major privilege. Our view is that people earning this kind of money, and more, should pay a higher tax contribution to alleviate the burden on ordinary workers, who are still suffering as a result of the introduction of the USC. It is even more the case now, obviously, with the cost-of-living crisis people are facing. I will conclude by remarking on one point that is not directly relevant to this legislation but that is relevant in the round because any tax measure must be related to tax equity and fairness in the tax system. It is interesting to note that income tax receipts amount to €30 billion in revenue, I think. I think it is the biggest tax receipt the Government has. I do not know what total income earnings are because I did not have time to fish out that figure. It is considerably less than, for example, total corporate earnings in any given year, but the tax contribution of the corporations is much less than €30 billion. Income earners pay €30 billion in tax, but the Government is projecting there will be €20 billion in tax revenue from corporations, even though the corporate sector earns much more in gross earnings.  In other words, and to cut a long story short, workers earn less and pay more in tax, whereas corporations earn much more and pay less in tax, overall in the round. This is wrong as well. Often, the beneficiaries of big corporate profits are precisely these high earners who get additional income from what they may derive from having shares in companies and so on and so forth. We are trying to redress the imbalance in this regard by alleviating the tax burden on ordinary workers and replace it with higher taxes on the highest earners, as well as through the introduction of a whole range of other measures that we propose to try to redistribute wealth through the tax system and to close the gap between ordinary workers and the very rich in our society. This is the logic of our proposed amendment and we think this should be examined in a report by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will reply to the Minister's point in response to our suggestion of a higher income social charge to replace revenues from the USC, which People Before Profit believes should be abolished because it was an austerity tax and an unfair imposition on workers that has massively increased the tax burden on ordinary workers ever since it was introduced. Notwithstanding some reductions and tweaks, the tax contribution of ordinary workers jumped significantly as a result of the USC. That burden is overwhelmingly carried by ordinary workers. We want to remove that burden but we need to replace it. As I said, and I will make it clear to the Minister, we are not only proposing a higher income social charge in order to replace those revenues. In our alternative budget, we also argue for additional tax bands for those who earn in excess of €100,000, as well as the higher income social charge. The Minister may have read our proposal. In fairness, I think he reads our budget submissions. We propose to make up the €2.5 billion gap there would be after we introduce the higher income social charge by having four new bands on those higher earners. These are a 50% rate on earnings between €100,000 and €150,000, 55% on those earning €150,000 to €200,000, 60% on earnings between €200,000 and €275,000, and 65% on earnings more than €275,000, which would raise an additional €2.5 billion. That is how we intend to do it. Our alternative budget also goes into a whole range of other measures to target the wealth and income of the very highest earners, as well as increasing the tax contribution of the major corporations. For our part at least, we fully intend to balance the books but redistribute the tax burden in order to create greater equity in the tax system and to reduce the gap between rich and poor. I wanted to say that for the record. I will point out that there is also a significant inequity. The elephant in the room is the huge gap between the tax contribution ordinary workers make relative to the income they earn, as against the tax contribution corporations make relative to the income they earn. There is a huge gap. The Minister has projected €20 billion in corporate tax receipts this year. I know he does not have all the figures and they are delayed by a year or so, but insofar as he is able to project €20 billion in corporate tax receipts for 2022, I am curious to know, and I assume he has a projected figure for, what the gross trading profits were that he extrapolated from for 2022. The last available figures indicate that those profits were €193 billion up to 2020, which was a massive jump of approximately 140% over the past decade. Presumably, the Minister had some sort of projected figure for what gross, pre-tax trading profits were that could lead him to project €20 billion in corporate tax receipts. What he will find, however, if he does have that figure, is that the gross pre-tax earnings of corporations dwarf the total amount of income earned by ordinary workers. The tax contribution of corporations is €20 billion whereas the tax contribution of workers in terms of their income is €30 billion. To put it simply, workers, collectively, earn less and pay more than corporations by a very considerable margin. It just seems like basic fairness and justice that the cleaner who works at Google should not pay more, proportionately, of her income in tax than the shareholders in the corporation that is making extortionate profits. That is what tax justice means to me and that is the logic behind our proposals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a fair point. Largely, the discussion has been aired. I do not think our proposals are in any sense magicking money out of the air. We think it is entirely legitimate and justified to replace the USC, which was an austerity tax. Commitments were given to replace it, which is still a reason for very considerable anger among ordinary workers who saw their tax burden increase very significantly. That is a fact. The amount of tax paid by ordinary workers dramatically increased on foot of the USC. It still significantly dwarfs the tax contribution of corporations in the total amount paid. That is also a fact. I contest what the Minister said about the percentage that corporations are paying in tax. I am curious to see the projections for 2022 if the Minister can provide them. The most recent figures, which are those for 2020, show €193 billion pre-tax profit for corporations, while the total of corporation tax paid was €11.833 billion. That equals 6.1%, not 10%, 11% or 12.5%. As the Minister knows, there are myriad tax reliefs available. The Committee on Budgetary Oversight is examining those reliefs at the moment. I call it the shadow budget of tax reliefs, credits and breaks from which corporations benefit. Those are never properly examined or listed in the budget documents. They roll over, year after year. Some of those arrangements may be justified but many of them are not. Some of those arrangements are never properly examined in respect of what benefit they are serving or what objective they are realising. One dramatic example in this year's budget to which I have pointed is the shocking increase in intra-group transactions. Single tax relief in the amount of €35 billion. It is, as we all know, about profit shifting. It is about one subsidiary of a big IT company charging another subsidiary whatever it wants to charge for the use of its own intellectual property. That allows such companies to shift their profits. We all know that is the case. The Minister says that adopting our proposals would scare the horses and do untold economic damage and so on. Some of us challenged the double Irish loophole, which was the previous mechanism through which many of these profits were shifted, and that was closed eventually. Did that closure have a disastrous impact on the amount of tax revenue collected? The situation was quite the opposite. When the double Irish loophole was closed, the tax revenue to the State from the corporate sector increased. It was a part of a more general move across the world that the Minister is not taking into account. There is a growing awareness that these multinationals are making obscene profits and that there is a problem with this at many different levels. We are seeing one possible fallout from that in all the redundancies that are being made at the moment. Elon Musk, a man driven by ego and greed, can just decide that thousands of people are going to lose their jobs. That is the price we pay for letting these companies get that rich and for whole economies to be dependent on them. There is a long-term price to be paid, as well as the growing and gross inequality in the distribution of the world's wealth. Unless that is addressed in a serious way, there will be far more untold consequences. I do not think we should give corporations all these tax breaks and reliefs. We should make them pay a minimum effective rate on their pre-tax trading profits. Before they get any reliefs, deductions or allowances, they should pay at least the 15%. I would go higher, frankly, but that would be the minimum I would suggest. They are not paying anywhere near that level of tax. The taxable profit is far less than the pre-tax profits because of all the reliefs, allowances and deductions they can make. They can effectively write their own tax bills. Our tax code allows for that. The situation for corporations is in stark contrast to that for, say, a cleaner who cannot do the same thing. The Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, conducted a study on wages last year that might be worth looking into. These are the things that could be looked at in these kind of reports. The NERI study suggested that the gap between the lowest percentile of workers in this country in the context of earnings and the highest percentile is far greater than in any of the other high-income European countries. There is a very considerable difference. The gap is approximately twice the size of the gap in Sweden and some of the other Nordic countries. It is even greater than countries such as the UK and Germany. There is excessive inequity between the lowest and highest earners in this country and that needs to be addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is to be pressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cannot vote. I am not a member of the committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will cite an instance of that because it is always worth thinking about real people. Private security workers have become very active around their low pay. The committee will be aware of an employer - I probably cannot mention him but his name is well out there - who is trying to block a very minimal pay increase for private security workers. The current minimum level of their pay is below €12 per hour. The increase they would get under the employment regulation order, ERO, would bring it very slightly over €12, but only marginally. When we consider what private security workers did for this country during Covid, and what they do every day, we see that they are an example of the hidden heroes who did not get much air play during Covid. They provide security on public transport, at hospitals, for lots of public buildings, and in a whole range of other areas including supermarkets. They are on absolutely pitifully low pay. We could help them by providing for a dramatic increase. We could overcome the attempt by their employers to block the miserable little pay increase they were supposed to get under an ERO - and we could save the private security workers all of this campaigning - by having a fairly dramatic increase of the minimum wage to a living wage. Our view is that it should go to at least €15 per hour. The Minister will probably think that is going way too far. I would say it is the minimum people need these days to be able to survive and sustain themselves, and even at that they will be struggling. At the very least, it should be increased to the official level of the living wage. All of the words about the rewards we were going to give to workers when we realised how important they were during Covid are meaningless if we do not increase the minimum wage to some kind of actual living wage. This needs to be far in excess of what we have done with the minimum wage increase, which is fairly derisory, if we are honest, against the background of the current cost-of-living and rental crises. I put this to the Minister. I give a particular shout-out to the security workers in Unite who are campaigning around these issues and insisting that they should be paid decent pay for the work they do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no problem with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would say the Department of Finance has a very particular responsibility to the residents and owners of apartment complexes that have fire or other building defects, and where the costs they potentially face are very significant indeed. They bear no responsibility whatsoever for the costs and defects affecting the apartments. Why do I say that? Previous Ministers for Finance - I acknowledge that it was before the time of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe - had given very significant tax breaks and tax incentives to encourage the property madness that was the Celtic tiger. One feature of that gold rush to make money in property was the abandoning of proper standards and building controls. Consequently, it is a fair assessment to say that almost anything that was built in the Celtic tiger period, not just multi-unit but especially multi-unit complexes and big estates, are very likely to be suffering from fire defects, lack of proper fire breaks between apartments in multi-unit complexes and between houses, other structural defects and failures to apply proper building control standards. I would say we are talking about tens of thousands of units, and many of the people affected do not even know. All of the property incentives put in place by previous Ministers for Finance were very much part of that . In this regard, I believe that the Department has a particular responsibility to assist the people affected by all of this.Just like the families affected by the mica issue, who are asking for 100% redress by the State for damage to their homes that was not their fault, all those affected by failures to put in proper fire breaks and implement proper building fire controls, and by other building defects affecting their homes, should get redress. The responsibility of the Department of Finance also goes beyond that, certainly in respect of one case that I have raised with the Minister. Indeed, I suspect there may be quite possibly more, because many of the residential developments - estates or multiunit complexes - that are likely to be or known to be affected by these building defects may have been handed over to NAMA, which is a creature of the Department of Finance.  Carrickmines Green is one such example of that. Indeed I have submitted questions to the Minister on it and I have raised the issue in the Dáil on a number of occasions. At the end of this month NAMA is taking the residents and owners of Carrickmines Green to court because they do not want to sign documents or leases. The Department should be aware of the details I have submitted. I do not expect the Minister to know all the details now. NAMA is trying to put pressure on these owners and residents in Carrickmines Green who cannot sell their homes. They cannot get insurance or it costs an absolute fortune to get insurance. The cost has gone up exponentially because there are not proper fire breaks in the whole place. They are living in an unsafe building, but it has been taken over by NAMA's receivers and the receivers are now taking them to court because the receivers want the right to sell some of the units, even though they have not been remediated. NAMA's receivers will not remediate the people still living there and will not pay for the remediation to put in the fire breaks. They expect the residents and owners to do it, but they also want to put pressure on the same people to sign documents so that the receivers can sell other units which also have not been remediated. It is very questionable, to my mind, among other things. There is a slight caveat in that the details of this are complex, but I have submitted them. The residents' appeal to the Minister, very specifically in this regard, is to tell NAMA to tell its receivers to stop treating people who have building defects in their homes, through no fault of their own, in this scandalous fashion. It is outrageous. It is particularly outrageous because in other developments where NAMA was in some way involved, remediation was paid for. There is not even consistency in this regard. It is very shoddy treatment. I suspect the Minister is going to tell me that NAMA has its own mandate, it is not up to him and the receivers are acting on behalf of NAMA. I do not really accept that. I had many problems, from the beginning, with NAMA's mandate. NAMA is a creature of the Department of Finance. It seems to be that there should be intervention from the Minister for Finance with NAMA to say that it must treat these people properly. If receivers are involved, NAMA effectively therefore owns these places, and it should remediate. It should not be putting pressure and bullying the residents and owners in this way. It should be offering remediation.  I want to put that to the Minister as well as generally supporting Deputy Nash's proposal for a report in this area, which in my opinion should lead to a position of 100% redress for all those affected. It is a matter of urgency because, of course, there are many people out there who probably do not even know that the places they are living in are not safe. Some of them have discovered that. There was a very nice man who passed away a few years ago called Noel Manning. He was a fire expert. I remember him taking me to an estate on the north side of Dublin, which I will not name here. He had arranged with some of the people who lived out there to show me the defects. He was trying to blow the whistle at the time on the extent of defects in estates, from a fire safety point of view. The defects were not just in this estate; he had seen them everywhere and he was trying to blow the whistle. I raised some of the issues in the Dáil over the years. He said this stuff was rampant. In everything that was being built during this period, there were no proper fire breaks, the standards were inadequate, and the standards were not, in any event, applied. It was just absolute cowboy stuff. There was a gold rush to build stuff as quickly as possible regardless of proper standards. If they have not already discovered it, there are a lot of people out there who will discover that they are facing very big bills as a result of all this. I support Deputy Nash's proposal, but I also have a specific ask that the Department of Finance should see its responsibility for the reasons I have outlined. I also ask that it intervenes with NAMA, where it has involvement in this through ownership of estates or anything it has in its hands, or where receivers are acting on its behalf, to insist that it should not be treating people in this way. It certainly should not be taking them to court. It should be financing the remediation of these people's homes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have never accepted the argument about the independence of NAMA. The mandate of NAMA was set by Government and by legislation and Government can change that mandate. On other matters, I long thought it should change that mandate but this issue is a very big one and everybody acknowledges that. It is not certain precisely how we would go about giving redress to people; it could be through tax credits for example. I am more for direct expenditure than tax credits. It still merits making a report and that is why I support what Deputy Nash is trying to do with this amendment. We need to examine very quickly how we will ensure that there is 100% redress for people who have dangerous fire defects to their homes, water ingress problems and other structural building defects which will cost a lot to remediate. We must do this to prevent people from failing to get insurance at all or from having to pay extortionate insurance premiums. It would also pose serious difficulties for people being able to sell the homes they have paid for. These are serious issues that are blighting the lives of a lot of people. There are a lot of people who do not know they have these issues but who will find out at some point. We should start to go out proactively and find these places and find out where else is likely to be affected. I suspect the numbers will be pretty staggering when we find out because these builders were let run riot during a certain period in this country. Where NAMA is involved there should be a specific Government mandating of it to ensure that NAMA or anybody acting on behalf of it has specific instructions on the way they behave and what they are trying to do. In his answer the Minister said that NAMA has to obtain the best achievable financial return from its acquired assets. That is one of the phrases he used in his response to me. I hope that is not interpreted by NAMA as absolving it from putting money into ensuring that the places from which it is trying to get a return are safe, that it does not want to pay the costs of making them safe because it would eat into its ability to get the best financial return. That would be outrageous if that were the case. In the same way we charged NAMA - not enough but to some degree - with ensuring a certain amount of social and affordable housing would be delivered. We said that notwithstanding NAMA's overall imperative to get a good financial return we wanted it to identify a certain amount of social housing. That was part of its mandate. It should be part of its mandate to ensure the proper treatment of people where they have acquired properties and are in this situation. Those people should be treated properly and NAMA should be responsible for the remediation necessary of those houses. The Minister may have an update, which is very recent because some of the things he said were not in the previous reply. I take that on board but it would be highly surprising to me if the remediation the Minister suggested is full-scale remediation of the building defects because there would be no court case if that was the case. The reason the residents were not willing to sign some sort of release that NAMA's receivers were looking for them to sign is because that was their only leverage on NAMA to finance the remediation of the defects in their buildings. That is why there is a court case. They were holding out on financing the remediation, even though, and this is where the inconsistency comes in, in other neighbouring estates close by, for some reason there had been remediation and it had been financed. Why they were holding out in this case I do not know. Perhaps it is inconsistency between the receivers but that should not be allowed to happen. I ask the Minister to look into this a bit more and to look into it with NAMA to see what can be done to make sure these residents are not being put through the ringer or forced into court unnecessarily. I ask that NAMA would have an overall approach of saying that if it has acquired a property or the loans attached to it then it will make sure that remediation is done and paid for and that the residents are not put on the hook for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is proposing a specific tax exemption on the one-off payment for people where there was an illegal or incorrect registration. Does it have an end date? I ask the Minister to repeat that date. He said it was subject to possible review if further illegal adoptions were revealed after that date. I think he gave a date of the end of this year. I ask him to repeat that date.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that. It is to exempt that payment from tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does what the Minister is proposing here in the Finance Bill also have a cut-off date - the same cut-off date?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister decides that further ex gratia payments will be made beyond that date, will the tax exemption also carry on for those?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the Finance Bill point of view that is fine. The exemption will continue. It seems very odd to have a date at the end of September 2022 for deciding who is eligible for the ex gratia payment. It is very likely that some people will discover that there were illegal birth registrations after that date. The Birth Information and Tracing Bill is only really happening now and many people still do not have all their information and records and will not know whether they might have been the subject of an illegal birth registration. It is clearly not the direct responsibility of the Minister for Finance. However, it does not make any sense. I accept the Minister has put a caveat on it, but that seems entirely arbitrary. It does not seem to make any sense that he would set that date. Surely anybody who is found to be at any point - certainly in the next couple of years or so - the subject of an illegal birth registration should be entitled to that ex gratia payment. I understand, at least, that the section in the Finance Bill does not have a cut-off date.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we know how much money has been paid out under the scheme? I know it is not the Minister's Department that has the information. I also accept that the amendment relates to a tax exemption. As a matter of interest, however, does he know how much was paid out under the Covid-related layoff payment scheme and precisely what were the conditions of entitlement for the payment? The reason I am asking is partly because it was something the Debenhams workers were asking about. As the Minister will be aware, those workers were laid off during that period and had a long battle. They got nothing from the company and were only entitled to statutory redundancy pay, which, if I understand it, is exempt from tax. Is that right? The Minister is proposing that the Covid-related layoff payment also be exempt from tax. I am just curious, because it is something that the Debenhams workers have been looking at in the context of whether they could access it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the figure on how much has been released?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An amount of €10 million has been released.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A very small amount.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is difficult to understand the commitment of the Minister and the Government to the help-to-buy scheme, because it is not just the political Opposition that has been critical of it but pretty much every mainstream economist and economic thinktank. Just about everybody is saying this does not make any sense and that it will contribute to house price inflation. Like Deputy Doherty, I hate the term "deadweight", one of these technocratic phrases that are thrown around without people knowing what they mean in many cases. In any event, the money is not really getting to the people who need it, and it is difficult to understand the Minister's commitment to it. People are caught in an absolutely desperate position between, on the one hand, rents that are off the Richter scale - my area is especially blighted with this, given rents there are the highest of anywhere in the country, with average figures, which increase every month at this point, running at about €2,500 a month - and, on the other hand, taking a risk of buying a house for in excess of €600,000 in my area, where house prices are also among the highest anywhere in the country. This applies even to the affordable housing. I cannot wait until we see the figures for affordable houses in my area because they are, effectively, just a discount on the market price. Even in places such as Cherrywood, where the State has put a lot of money into the largest residential development in the entire State, we still do not know, years after lots of local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding has gone in, how much affordable housing we are getting and how much it will cost because we cannot square the circle with the level of house prices in the area. Any discount, even a substantial one, on those kinds of market prices is still going to be totally unaffordable, and that is for the "affordable" housing where the State has put in a lot of money to finance infrastructure and so on. That is the background. The problem is house prices, the cost of housing. Taking steps that encourage people to get onto the ladder for mortgaging themselves up to the hilt for house prices that are off the wall echoes the madness that led to the most recent crash. When we add to that interest rates beginning to rise and expected to continue rising, these are the ingredients with which we could see a shocking repeat of what went before, with all the consequences that would entail. What has to be done, and all resources and tax measures need to be applied to this, is that we bring down the cost of housing. Anything that is not doing that or, worse, that is driving up the cost of housing is a mistake, even if people in their desperation think this is a way for them to get onto the ladder. The question is whether they are going to be caught, as so many people were the last time, with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough. The point has been made.
