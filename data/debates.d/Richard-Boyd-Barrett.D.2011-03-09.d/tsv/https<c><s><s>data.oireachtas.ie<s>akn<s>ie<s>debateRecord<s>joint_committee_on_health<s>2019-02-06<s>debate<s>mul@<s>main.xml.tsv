RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister put out a comforting narrative at the outset about the general situation in the health service but to my mind it would clash fairly strongly with the perceptions that people have about what is happening in the health service in general at present. Would people not be correct to be pretty sceptical? The GPs are protesting outside because we have a crisis in general practice. We have a national nurses strike over pay, recruitment and retention. We have a national ambulance strike which we do not seem interested in resolving. We have a desperate trolley crisis and hundreds of thousands of people on hospital waiting lists. We have a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, which is 50% understaffed and a major crisis in community mental health. We have a CervicalCheck scandal, a €600 million overrun in the health budget and the cherry on top, from a Fine Gael Government that prides itself on prudence and fiscal rectitude, we have a cost escalation for this project going from €400 million when Fine Gael came into power to €1.4 billion for the hospital itself, and €1.7 billion in total. At an elementary level, is it not a shambles, that this has happened collectively for the years of Fine Gael Government from the time of the then Minister, James Reilly through Deputy Leo Varadkar to the present Minister? That is not improvement. We are actually reaching the worst point of a crisis in the health service at just about every level. Is that not a reasonable comment, given what is going on? Is that not a reasonable perception that the public would have at present?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, having waited two and a half hours and now getting five minutes, I will ask a couple of direct questions.Does the Minister believe it is appropriate to use PwC, to which he has essentially batted off the incredible escalation under Fine Gael management on the national paediatric hospital project from €400 million to €1.4 billion? Now he is batting off the answers to all of these questions, as well as essential responsibility to PwC, when it has been the auditor of BAM, the contractor at the centre of this issue, for nine years. PwC has received €30 million in fees from BAM. It also works for the HSE. Can we honestly put faith in it to do this task and not fear a serious conflict of interest? This is particularly relevant, given that ordinary people believe they have been had. A company comes in with a bid which turns out to be a gross underestimation of the actual cost of the hospital. The ones who are going to look into how it happened are the same people who audited the company, BAM International, or whatever it is called, for nine years. Moreover, it seems no one was made aware at the time - Ministers included - that there was a gap of €130 million between the BAM bid and the next bid. Were the Ministers made so aware? No one said the gap was a little odd. If it was €10 million or €15 million, it might be credible, but there was a gap of €130 million between the lowest bidder and the next bidder and no one thought it a little odd. That is extraordinary, especially when BAM had a record of cases in which the company had significantly overrun, both in this country and internationally. As that has been well flagged in the press, I do not have time to go into it, but no one raised the need to look into it.  Did anyone do the basic things? For example, in talking about windows, did anyone ask what cost BAM had included for them? What costs did it include for wires, bricks and all of the different components? How did these costs compare to those included in the next bid and the one above it? Was there a significant gap between them? If so, did no one ask whether it was a little odd? 
I realise the Minister is not supposed to be over every single detail, but the then Minister responsible – it was probably the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, at the time – should have been aware at least of the difference and the dichotomy between the bids. He should have called for them to be checked and sought a forensic analysis.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will stay for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that hold, even though PwC worked for BAM for nine years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a one line question for Mr. Woods about something he said. If I heard him correctly, he said the board knew about the escalation from €61 million and had received a figure at a meeting in September. Is he saying the figure of €450 million was known at a meeting in September but that it did not get to the Minister until November? If it is true, it is shocking. I am pretty sure that is what I heard Mr. Woods say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should see that report.
