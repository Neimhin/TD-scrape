RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman. To be honest, I must apologise as well as I have to go back over to the Dáil. We are bouncing back and forth. I heard all the presentations at the outset and People Before Profit will support all the demands the groups are making.I thank Tiománaí Tacsaí Na hÉireann, the NPHTA, the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation and the Taxi Alliance of Ireland for all their work in representing taxi drivers. One thing that I cannot understand, and I think the committee should ponder, is why it is that an ordinary car can stay on the road if it passes the NCT, but a taxi that is perfectly okay to drive has this arbitrary nine-year rule imposed on it. I support drivers on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the difference? I want the committee to ponder that fact. It is completely unfair. There is no reason for it. I cannot understand the reason for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It makes no sense to me, and I hope the committee will take that on board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be very happy to attend if I am not doing something elsewhere. I will do everything I can, as I have tried to, for the taxi drivers on these issues. I am sure the representatives here can say it, but I want to reiterate to the committee the fact that the concern about the taxi advisory committee not being fit for purpose has been raised repeatedly with the Minister. If all of the representative groups are making the same point for a long period time, somebody has to take notice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What they are looking for is a direct line to talk to the Department and to the Minister on an ongoing basis. That is the way to address issues both for the drivers and for the public, rather than having to do through this body that is just not functioning for the industry, or for anybody really. That is important. On the issue of EVs, the point has been made to me and the committee that drivers cannot get the vehicles. It is one thing having the grant, but drivers cannot get the EVs. Do the witnesses think the Government should play a more proactive role in actually trying to secure the vehicles for drivers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From hearing the representatives and from being aware of their grievances over the years, I am aware that one of the fundamental problems is that in the mindset of those who look at public transport, the taxi drivers are just not seen as part of the public transport system in the same way as other parts of the public transport system. There is a sort of seriousness about buses, trains and trams, but there is a sort of disregard for the taxi driver. Is that what the representatives feel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from that, I agree completely with the points made. It is ironic that complaints are now being made that there are not enough taxis, to which the witnesses have responded. All of a sudden people are asking where the taxi drivers are, when nothing has been done to support the drivers and the industry. Indeed, things have been done that have driven people out of the industry and have made it an unattractive option. Would the witnesses say - because I would - that if it follows that the taxi sector should be taken seriously as an integral part of an integrated public transport system that is vital for all sorts of things, including taking people to hospital, serving those with disabilities, getting people to school in certain situations, tourism and all the other roles that drivers play, it would also follow that there should be subsidies for taxi drivers in a properly regulated and run industry? Every other part of public transport is subsidised to ensure that it is there. Should there not be some sort of subsidies as part of a properly regulated industry? Similarly, the absolutely wrong way to go would be to introduce Uber, which is the opposite of that. That is just creating a cowboy situation where we are imperiling the health and safety of the travelling public and showing utter disregard for the people who are seriously providing a proper industry, such as taxi drivers.
