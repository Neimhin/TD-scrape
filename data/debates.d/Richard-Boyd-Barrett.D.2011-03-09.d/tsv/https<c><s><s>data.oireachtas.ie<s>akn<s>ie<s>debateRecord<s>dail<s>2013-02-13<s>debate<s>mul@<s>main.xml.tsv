RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of us were less than impressed last week with the hype with great fanfare around the so-called deal on the promissory notes. Some 100,000 people took to the streets at the weekend who clearly did not believe much had changed for them. This morning Professor Patrick Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, reminded us that household financial distress was at extraordinary and unprecedented levels, yet today we understand the Minister for Finance will publish a Finance Bill that will still require hundreds of thousands of families to pay a tax on their family home that they simply cannot afford. There will, I understand, be no exemptions for the unemployed, pensioners, the 160,000 or so people in mortgage distress and workers who have had their incomes savaged such as the fully qualified nurse who as reported in the newspapers today is unable to pay her bills and a pensioner in my constituency who tells me that, despite having an income of just €200 a week, she is facing a bill of €800 a year in property tax when in March the demands drop. Very simply, if the deal on the promissory notes was such a wonderful achievement, as the Taoiseach claims, and, as he also claims, is going to leave us with €1 billion more in 2014 and 2015, can he announce today that, as he now has the money, he will abolish the property tax and not force the unemployed, pensioners, those in mortgage distress and others struggling to pay their bills to pay a tax on their homes that they simply cannot afford? If it was a real deal, the Taoiseach could afford to do this. He should make that commitment and promise and give a little hope and relief to ordinary people.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach hates to admit it, but it is the only thing that gets results.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it going to be the end of anything?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Finance Bill is being published today. Where are the exemptions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, the truth about the deal becomes clear. It is not going to make a whit of difference-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to the people who are being hammered by cuts and on whom it is now planned to impose a further burden amounting to hundreds of euro a year by way of property charges. I know damn well that the Finance Bill under which this burden is going to be imposed was passed at the end of last year. However, given that the Taoiseach claims that we have saved ourselves billions of euro, why will further exemptions not be announced by the Minister for Finance today to remove from the property tax net pensioners, those on disability allowance, those who have lost their jobs, those whose incomes have been savaged-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----such as fully qualified nurses who cannot pay their bills? Why are there no exemptions or relief for them? Is that the truth about the deal made last week and the so-called exemptions being announced today, namely, that there is nothing for the people who are being hammered?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the best the Taoiseach can do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Along with many others I have raised the fact that the exemptions proposed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in the finance Bill are inadequate and they do not deal with the distress-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The finance Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to finish because he has allowed everyone else go on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You have, actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If those in the Opposition are going to propose amendments allowing for further exemptions for those in mortgage distress, those who are unemployed and other groups whom we believe cannot afford to pay, will the Taoiseach give a commitment that those amendments will not be ruled out of order and that we will be allowed to put forward those amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his State of the Union address yesterday President Obama, who is not a radical left winger, argued strongly against the Republican majority in Congress which is seeking further spending cuts. He argued that spending cuts would be a disaster for the American economy and that what was needed was a stimulus and certainly not retrenchment.Is he not right in this regard? He does not go as far as I would prefer but he is at least moving in the right direction. This is in sharp contrast to what is being done in Europe, which is all about retrenchment. If stimulation for the European economy is needed, it will have to come from private or public investment, or increased consumer demand. Increases in consumer demand are being prevented by the debt burdens people face as well as high levels of unemployment and further austerity measures. Public investment is prevented by retrenchment and austerity, while the private investment on which the Tánaiste and other European leaders seem to rely is not forthcoming. What is the Irish Government going to propose during its Presidency in order to break this stranglehold? Surely the only way we can do so is by forcing the financial institutions to take a hit and lifting the debt burden over people in order to stimulate consumer demand. We need more public investment financed by higher taxes on the corporate sector.
