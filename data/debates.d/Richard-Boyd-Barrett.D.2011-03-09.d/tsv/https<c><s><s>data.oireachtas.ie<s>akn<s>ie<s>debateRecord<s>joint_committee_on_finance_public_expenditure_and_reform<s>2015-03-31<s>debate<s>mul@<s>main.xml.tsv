RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for my late arrival. One has to bi-locate and tri-locate in this place when one is in a small party. Having listened to some of the discussion, I have not fully developed an expert understanding of what is being discussed so I am on a learning curve. However, I would be very anxious and suspicious about all of this. The labyrinthine and opaque world of international finance is quite terrifying.Its capacity to unleash devastation on economies, really out of the blue as far as ordinary citizens are concerned, is a big problem. That the vast majority of participants in the economy can suddenly be devastatingly affected by the ebbs, flows and shifts of international capital is one lesson we should draw from the recent bubble and burst. Private capital moves into areas where it thinks it can make a quick buck and it moves out just as fast when over investment in those areas leads to a bubble and a crash. So one gets over-investment at one point and then an investment retrenchment and flight at another point. On the face of it, this is just facilitating that process. It is actually making a bad situation worse. If one can pin point who are the investors and if there is a relationship between the investor and the enterprise, then one feels there is some transparency and maybe some potential to control investment. What we seem to be talking about here is facilitating anonymous investment from people who happen to have savings or accumulated capital, all over Europe, in different places, and who then throw their money into some vehicle, which will then invest it on the basis of getting a maximum return at any given point in time in another place. So there is no relationship at all between the real economy and the investor. To my mind that is just what led us into the mess in the first place. So, sell me this, but I really do not see the advantage of it. Can I put it to the witnesses, the problem which lies at the back of this, so far as I understood from the finance representative who was before the committee earlier-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----is the pretty big retrenchment in investment, here and generally across Europe in the aftermath of the crash? Those with money are very nervous about where they put it and they do not really want to invest it in the real economy. So we try to cajole them into investing in the real economy. To facilitate that and encourage them, and I heard mention of capital gains taxes and all that kind of stuff, we end up incentivising them and I really worry about that. There is another way to deal with the problem of loads of privately accumulated capital and savings sitting there not invested in the real economy unless it is no risk and absolutely guaranteed to make a big profit - I thought capitalism is all about risk, but it appears it is not. Private capital today is the enterprise of investing and ensuring no risk. I believe we actually need to address the fundamental problem of risk averse private capital resulting in no investment. What we need to do is take some of that money back from them and into the hands of public authorities, controlled by the people, in order to have democratic investment decisions. That is the problem we grapple with - too much money concentrated in the hands of too few people.
