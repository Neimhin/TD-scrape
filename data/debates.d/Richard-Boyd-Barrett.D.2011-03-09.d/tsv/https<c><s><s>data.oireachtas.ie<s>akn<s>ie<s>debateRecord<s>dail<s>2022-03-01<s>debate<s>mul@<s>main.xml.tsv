RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not agreed. I asked for a debate on the Amnesty International report which indicts Israel for crimes against humanity and that argues for targeted sanctions against Israeli officials guilty of crimes against humanity and perpetrating what it describes as an apartheid regime for systematic breaches of international law.While the Government has granted that debate, it has put it on Wednesday night at 9 p.m. and has given very little time for it. That also suggests to me that while the Government is in favour of sanctions against certain warmongers and crimes against humanity, it is not in favour of supporting the recommendations from Amnesty in regard to crimes against humanity committed by Israel. Will the Government allow for a proper debate at a proper time on Thursday for this critical debate about the Amnesty report on Israel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are warmongers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach forgotten about Afghanistan?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are asking for a bit longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Half an hour on Thursday. It is simple.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Half an hour extra on Thursday. That is not a lot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is being disingenuous because he does not support sanctions against Israel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are asking for half an hour on Thursday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So are crimes against humanity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean that they could come in if there was time on Thursday?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except in Yemen and Palestine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach only talks about some bad guys.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are shocked at the extent of the pay and pay increases for the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the pay level for the head of the HSE. How can the Government justify that when at the same time it is willing to stand over the fact that ordinary workers in the health service, in education and in local authorities are held down to 1% or 2% pay increases when inflation is running at 5%? Following a briefing at the Department of Finance today, the breaking news is that the Department is estimating that as a result of the situation in Ukraine and the decision to impose sanctions, we are looking at 7% inflation for the coming year. Working people are being hammered with the rising cost of living, which will go up further, yet the Government will keep their pay increases at 1% or 2%. Would workers not be right to put in pay claims to insist they get pay increases at least to the level of the cost of living and inflation increases that are being inflicted on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach referred to the NESC report No. 28, which came out in December. One of the things to which that report referred was the issue of incorporating social and economic rights into policymaking. Today, the Minister referred the issue of housing to the Housing Commission in respect of a possible referendum. I want to pin the Taoiseach down as to what his view is on this issue. People Before Profit put forward a constitutional amendment Bill, which was passed by the Dáil, seeking to incorporate the right to secure, affordable housing into the Constitution, and for the State to prioritise resources towards the vindication of the right to housing in the midst of an absolutely dire housing crisis. That would then give protection to tenants facing evictions by vulture funds or would give us the power to take over vacant properties that could be used to house people affected by the housing crisis which, arguably, the Constitution currently prevents although, frankly, that is an issue of dispute. It would allow us to bring in rent controls without any threat of legal action. Is that what the Government is actually going to do now? In fact, the aforementioned Bill that was passed by the Dáil would achieve this. Is the Taoiseach in favour of putting the right to secure, affordable housing into the Constitution to vindicate that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell Coillte to stop selling the forests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry for standing up at the wrong time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Eager.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach’s Department's strategy statement lists a number of priorities. Priority E is, “Strengthening Ireland’s place in Europe and the world”. In the context of the current crisis, invasion and war in Ukraine, I want to know what that means. What is our role in this? Obviously, all of us believe that Putin should be stopped, that he should leave Ukraine and that his invasion is inexcusable. Yet, I worry deeply about the comments by the Tánaiste earlier, which were about closer co-operation with the project of European militarisation and about the comments made by the Taoiseach, in which he essentially absolved NATO as some sort of defensive alliance-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and which failed to acknowledge, for example, that it conducted a bloody invasion and occupation very recently in Afghanistan and that it bombed Libya. I wonder is the Taoiseach's opposition to warmongers like Putin selective insofar as we seem to oppose some warmongers but not others. We had briefing today with people from Yemen. They asked why no action is being taken over the role of the United States, Britain and France in arming the Saudi dictatorship to allow it to conduct a disastrous war that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Yemen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yemeni lives are less important.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, because they are selling guns to the Saudis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We cannot but call out the Government's double standards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach support Amnesty's recommendations for sanctions against Israel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	NATO is not their friend.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:To insert the following after "good offices to search for a peaceful settlement""— further calls for Ireland to provide increased humanitarian aid for the people of Ukraine and for Ireland to offer refuge for all people fleeing the war;— further condemns the arrests and persecution of anti-war protestors by President Putin and the Russian state; salutes the bravery of the growing anti-war protests in Russia; and calls for support across the world for further mobilisation of anti-war movements in Russia and worldwide as the best hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and avoidance of the risk of war between major powers;— further notes the risk of nuclear conflict out of Ukraine and calls on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to de-escalate its military presence and withdraw battlegroups and missiles in Eastern Europe; and— further reaffirms that Ireland is a militarily neutral State, that it will maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances, that it will not participate in any war or armed conflict nor aid foreign powers in any way in preparation for, or in the conduct of, war or armed conflict, including through the mechanism of the European Union, without prior assent of Dáil Éireann"The situation developing in Ukraine is both horrendous and quite terrifying. The assault by Putin and his forces on Ukraine is barbaric, foul and obscene and must be condemned. It comes from a regime that has a long and brutal history of warmongering and despotism, whether it is suppressing dissent towards the regime by the Russian population or the bloody wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Moldova. I was at the United States Embassy protesting last night. I recalled the fact that in 1999, I stood outside that same embassy with very few people, it should be said, protesting against the Russian slaughter in Chechnya which claimed the lives of 50,000 to 80,000 people, but was little remarked on in the western world at the time. It is vitally important we extend our solidarity to the Ukrainian people whose suffering is unspeakable. We must do absolutely everything to extend humanitarian assistance, solidarity and support to Ukrainian people and defend, absolutely, their right to resist this brutal invasion of their country. We believe the Government's motion is one sided because it does not, as our amendment does, allude to hope in this rather dark and grim situation - the Russian anti-war movement of ordinary Russians that has exploded on to the streets. It proves that huge numbers of Russians do not stand behind Putin and oppose everything he is doing. We must do absolutely nothing to undermine that movement of opposition to Mr. Putin but, rather, do everything we can to support and nurture that heroic resistance. Most important, we must not pour petrol on this dangerous fire which could be inflamed to the terrifying, unthinkable point of the use of nuclear weapons, or deliberate or accidental catastrophes at nuclear power plants in that area. It is critical we warn against any escalation. As a neutral country, we have to be proactive in arguing against forces that wish to escalate this situation or seek to use it to encourage militarisation, war and arms expenditure as a solution to the terrifying and dangerous situation we are witnessing in Ukraine. That is why we think it is critically important to mention NATO. That is not to excuse Putin's behaviour. However, it was absolutely inevitable after the eastward expansion of NATO and the act of recruiting countries into a nuclear military alliance with a bloody history in Afghanistan and a history of bombing in Libya and whose major powers have been and are, as we speak, guilty of engaging in warmongering around the world. They are not the allies of the Ukrainian people and, most certainly, should not be the allies of this country, as a neutral country. Our job should be to argue against warmongering; involvement in military alliances, the arms industry and military expenditure and to urge peace and dialogue as the way to settle conflicts. I cannot help-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, Deputy Coveney, will have his chance. I cannot help but call out the double standards, unless the Government will surprise me tomorrow. Instantly, it wants to and has imposed sanctions against Putin for crimes against humanity, which he is committing. They are crimes against humanity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to hold on and not to interrupt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amnesty International is calling for sanctions against Israel for crimes against humanity and today we had a briefing from people from Yemen who talked about the direct involvement of the USA in supporting Saudi Arabia to commit crimes against humanity in Yemen. There is not a word about those things, but active support for the countries that do it or at least trenchant opposition to sanctions. Double standards will not help the people of Ukraine or help to end the scourge of war and militarism.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There have been no sanctions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No sanctions.
