RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to revisit the sale of Ardmore Studios. I will be blunt in stating that the sale stinks to high heaven. How much did the State get for the sale of its one third share in the company? I have heard the sale price was €6 million and the sale involved the State writing off €7 million in debt owed to it by Ardmore Studios. This would mean we gave the company away and then gave the purchaser €1 million. I hope that is not true. The House, members of the public and people working in the film industry need to know what is going on here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be honest; this is a load of rubbish. The public is having the wool pulled over its eyes. Ardmore Studios are located on a large piece of real estate. A recent attempt by the current chief executive officer to have part of the site rezoned for residential development was blocked by Wicklow County Council. One property expert estimated that if Ardmore Studios were rezoned for residential development, the site would be worth approximately €100 million. I would like to know if it is true that the Government was advised on the sale of this very valuable property by a director of Savills, the property people, who is now on the board of the company that took over Ardmore Studios and has a record of trying to rezone the site. What guarantees are there that film production at the studios will continue? Only one of seven stages at the site is being used, while films are being made in buildings owned by the National Asset Management Agency, including a factory in Tallaght and the former John Player factory on the South Circular Road where a dispute is taking place and four workers were recently sacked for kicking up about conditions. Films are also being made in the Dublin sport hotel, while Ardmore Studios are empty. This stinks, yet the Minister cannot answer my question as to whether the State wrote off €7 million in debts held by the studio.Is the Minister seriously suggesting this House does not deserve to know that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public has a right to know what is happening with the expenditure of public money. The Minister is just not answering the questions. It is reported that Ardmore owed the State €7 million. According to the Irish Film Board's accounts, I suspect that this figure included moneys given by members of the board to themselves when they were working in Ardmore - people like Kevin Moriarty, the former CEO, who got €594,000 in two different loans. Were these loans ever paid back? No, I think they are part of the €7 million debt. Somebody else-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People on the board who were also working in Ardmore effectively gave themselves loans for a studio that now sits empty. The CEO of Ardmore prior to the sale attempted to rezone the land for residential development and will remain the CEO with the new purchaser and the Minister is telling us that Ardmore is secure for film production in the future when they have already tried to rezone it for residential development. Sure, Wicklow County Council blocked it but why did we sell to people who have shown a record of wanting to run the place down and possibly get it rezoned for residential development? The Minister cannot tell us about the €7 million owed to the State in loans that were given to Ardmore. It is extraordinary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The owners can push.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Comptroller and Auditor General should investigate the circumstances of the sale. That is how serious I think this is. This is a piece of real estate that, if it were developed residentially, would probably be worth about €100 million. The Government cannot tell us how much it was sold for or confirm the reports that €7 million of debt was written off. That is not acceptable. I told the Government a few weeks ago, and it was confirmed last week, that there were major problems in the places where films are actually being made - not in Ardmore Studios where they should be made but in the John Player factory, for example, which is a NAMA building. Four workers were sacked last week because they had protested about health and safety conditions in a derelict factory. That is not surprising, really. What are they doing making films in a derelict factory when there is a purpose-built studio down in Bray where they should be making them? Does the Minister not think it is all a bit strange?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are currently three people working full time in Ardmore because it is sitting empty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Meanwhile, in Dublin, there are three films being made, one in a derelict NAMA factory where, as I said, four workers have just been sacked because they protested about the conditions under which they were working. Another film is being made in an old factory in Tallaght for some bizarre reason, and there is a film being made in the former Dublin Sport Hotel. All of these are getting public money, our money, coming from the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is also a reported €7 million gone into Ardmore. Is this not a bit odd? We are pouring all this money into the film industry and into Ardmore and there is nothing happening in Ardmore. It is happening in NAMA factories where workers are out protesting over the conditions they are employed in and then get sacked for doing so and have now been replaced by contractors. Where is the accountability about the expenditure of public money to ensure that our investment actually results in the development of a real industry with proper employment for those who work in it and where we have some idea what the hell is going on? Instead, millions in public money is going into the hands of private interests, whether they be production companies or a studio built by the State which the Government has now handed over to private interests, with what? Just their word that they will make films there when the place is sitting empty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has got a lot of investment in the last while.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government might as well be in a spaceship somewhere off in the stratosphere for all it seems to understand what is going on in the film industry. The Minister said Ardmore needs investment. Maybe it does, maybe it does not. According to the report, it has an investment of €7 million. Does the Minister believe it needs more investment than the John Player factory or a factory in Tallaght or the Dublin Sport Hotel? Why are films being made there? The same chief executive officer, who has made efforts to rezone Ardmore for residential development but was blocked by Wicklow County Council, is still running the place. I pointed out that I have heard Savills, the property people, are involved in all of this. Unless I am mistaken, Savills is not interested in making films but in making money from real estate. To my mind, this stinks to high heaven. The Minister is not answering the questions. Public moneys are spent on derelict factories, on the John Player factory, the Dublin sport hotel and on Ardmore, which sits empty, yet the Minister cannot tell us anything about what is going on. Instead, she just promises us that it will all be okay from the spaceship in the sky.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all for the film industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is public money going into it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In what is a pretty well worn pattern, we had yet another announcement, which was the umpteenth announcement, yesterday by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that purportedly will help to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis and, in particular, the issue of private rented accommodation. Twice yesterday during Taoiseach's Questions, I asked questions in an attempt to interrogate these proposals because they are nothing more than another half-baked, futile exercise in closing the door after the horse has bolted. They are pure tokenism, which will do nothing to address a housing and homelessness emergency that is spiralling out of control. I hope I might get the answers today from the Taoiseach that I did not yesterday. What is the point of bringing in legislation, even with criminal sanctions about which I am happy, which will limit rent increases to 4% annually when rents are unaffordable anyway and the level of rent is such that nobody on a low income or dependent on housing assistance payment, HAP, or even those on a reasonable income such as teachers, nurses and so on can afford them? Average rents in parts of Dublin are €1,800 per month. In south Dublin, average rent is almost €2,000 per month, which means someone needs €24,000 a year to secure an average rental property. That is impossible. What will the Taoiseach do about that? This is only if someone can secure accommodation at those rents given landlords will not even look at those on HAP. I am dealing with constituents who have come to my office with lists of between 80 and 100 properties that they have viewed trying to find accommodation that they can afford but it is impossible. All this leads directly to homelessness. None of the loopholes relating to substantial refurbishment and moving relatives in for the sale of properties, which are being exploited by vulture funds and landlords, is being addressed. Landlords are using them to evict people. Nothing has been done about affordability. Emergency legislation is needed. Earlier this week, a scandal was revealed yet again. The Sunday Independent revealed that Christian Carter who had previously been caught with 70 people in a five-bedroom house in Cabinteely had seven other properties with up to 30 people living in some of them following an investigation by the newspaper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has been named in the national newspapers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about emergency legislation to deal with sublets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the legislation and, more important, the policy action to reduce rents to affordable levels and to provide affordable accommodation to those who need it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are paying rents, like Tara Nic Chormaic, the nurse who wrote an open letter about how she cries at the end of a 39-hour week because she has €6 left after she pays her rent. That is how people are paying while others cannot even get these properties. I am proposing as an absolute minimum a complete rent freeze. A 4% increase on an unaffordable rent of €1,900 or €2,000 a month is not payable by people on HAP or by teachers, nurses and ordinary workers. What will the Taoiseach do about that? I would go further, as is the norm in many European countries, and have rents set by local authorities based on square metreage at affordable levels. What is the point in the Minister's proposed legislation given the RTB only has 55 staff and cannot even enforce the current legislation? The Taoiseach is saying they will launch investigations, which is just nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to stop rent increases, bring rents down to affordable levels and stop vulture funds sitting on empty properties. As I told the Minister earlier this week, Cerberus is sitting on 27 empty properties in Sandyford while Apollo Global Management is sitting on empty properties in Dún Laoghaire. Nothing is being done about this. These speculators are dictating what is going on in the housing market. If the State takes those properties back for public use, that is how the Government will secure additional properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said at a minimum a rent freeze and affordable square meterage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I too am very glad to offer my condolences to Susan and all of Peter's family on his passing. I pay tribute to him as a public representative, a Deputy and somebody I got to know quite well in my time here. I had heard about Peter Mathews before I met him. I remember receiving a telephone call before either of us was elected when I was told there was a fellow called Peter Mathews who had some really good ideas that I would like about what was going on with the banks and the bailout. I was told that many of those ideas would chime with my own. I saw him once or twice on the Vincent Browne television show. I was surprised in a way when I saw him pop up as a candidate for Fine Gael, as he was certainly not somebody who was toeing the Fine Gael line. I say this without making a partisan or political point. He was absolutely committed to putting across things as he saw them and with a particular passion about the banking crisis, the bailout and the costs he saw being inflicted on the people of the country. That fed into a particular passion about the housing crisis and the impact he saw as directly connected to the policies on the bank bailout. Despite the fact that he came from a very different part of the political spectrum, we had many discussions and conversations. We were on the finance committee together and, as Deputy Brendan Howlin mentioned, we travelled to the Bundestag. If I remember correctly, he certainly offered to pay to travel to the Bundestag because only a limited number could travel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know if he had to do so in the end, but he was absolutely determined to go. He was particularly incensed in his very pleasant way that the German budget committee got to see our budget before we did. He wanted to take up the issue and did so very passionately with the budget scrutiny and finance committee of the Bundestag. As others mentioned, he was constantly referring to Susan. On one occasion I had a chat with him when Susan was in the car. He was travelling to the west and referred constantly to Susan beside him. His love and passion for her and the family were self-evident.  Peter was completely non-partisan in his desire to debate issues, regardless of where one was on the political spectrum. It was a regular occurrence for him to send a text message after a Member had made a speech stating "well done". He wanted to discuss it and analyse the ideas in it afterwards. That is an unusual type of politics and politician; he was somebody who did not feel constrained by party allegiance and was willing to debate and disagree with people on all sides, including in his own party. I radically disagreed with him on some matters, most notably on the issue that led him to leave Fine Gael - abortion. I have no doubt that we would now be debating very robustly our different views if he was here. As said by others, his views were always genuinely held. He was driven by conviction and a decent and honourable human being. He is a loss to this House but much more to his family. I again offer my deepest sympathy to Susan and his family. I am sure he will be long remembered in this House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 526 people on trolleys today. As was mentioned, we have had up to and more than 700 people on trolleys on certain days. Having more than 500 people on trolleys on a daily basis is becoming the new norm, which is shocking. St. Vincent's University Hospital ran out of trolleys this week. People had to be accommodated on seats because they could not even get a trolley. That is how bad it is. We have 502,482 people on outpatient waiting lists. I will give the Taoiseach an example of what this means. I know of one lady who needs a knee operation. She will have to wait a year and a half for her operation and she cannot work as a result of needing the operation. She is employed but cannot work. She will be dependent on social welfare for a year and a half. How many of the more than 500,000 people on outpatient waiting lists are also costing the State social welfare expenditure in addition to their not being able to get urgently needed treatment because of these waiting lists? Are there any radical plans to deal with this? I point to the issues that are being screamed at the Taoiseach. If we are going to open the beds we need, we must pay the nurses if we are to recruit the number that are necessary. That means giving the pay equality for which nurses have been asking. Tara Nic Chormaic's letter, which I quoted a few times this week, referred to the pay issue and the housing issue. Unless pay is increased and the Government provides affordable accommodation, we will not be able to recruit the nurses we need to open the beds to deal with these crises.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a secret.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	More than 100 years ago James Joyce, in his novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, described how a priest, Fr. Arnall, gave lectures to schoolchildren about the evils of the flesh and how they would suffer hellfire and damnation if they in any way gave into feelings of sexuality or even acknowledged it. In that chapter he brilliantly counterposed the denial of sexuality enforced by the Catholic Church which induced feelings of guilt and so on with the completely distorted view of it. He used the symbol of prostitution, with women being seen as sexual objects. In the chapter he captures what would later happen in this state when the Catholic Church was given control of schools and the education of young people. It had really dire consequences as it helped to create a culture where it was legitimate to treat women as chattel, lock them up and treat them as sinners and fallen women, etc. if they had sex outside marriage. It carried right through to the despicable texts we saw exchanged between the rugby players, which appalled everyone. They demonstrated the objectification of women and their sexuality. There are many complicated reasons for the rotten record the State has in its treatment of women, the prevalence of sexual violence and the high rates of suicide among LGBT and transgender people. The rates are way higher in this country than anywhere else. The role of the church in denying young people in this country proper sex education because of its ethos is absolutely critical. It is frankly worse than ironic and terrible that Fianna Fáil acknowledges that there might have to be change in all of this-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but it does not think it should be legislated for. The party has no problem whatever in legislating to allow the church to discriminate in the Equal Status Acts or specifically allow the particular religious ethos of schools to be rammed down the throats of young people. That seems to be allowed by Fianna Fáil, but we cannot insert a requirement in urgently needed legislation to ensure young people are given an objective education about sexuality. We can consider the dire consequences of failing to do so. Deputy Mattie McGrath has said we should have objective education about sexuality and so on but not at the expense of ethos. The problem is that ethos denies objective education about sexuality, LGBT matters, issues of consent and contraception. Certain facts are just left out. If education is partial, leaves certain elements out and twists and distorts them because of ethos, it is not objective. It is distorted and partial. The evidence is clear of the negative impacts on young people and society as a whole. It is particularly clear for women, children and so on arising from the domination of religious institutions. To my mind, it is absolutely right, proper and urgently necessary to insert in legislation a specific requirement to ensure the key issues of consent, LGBT rights, sexuality and contraception are addressed in the education curriculum.
