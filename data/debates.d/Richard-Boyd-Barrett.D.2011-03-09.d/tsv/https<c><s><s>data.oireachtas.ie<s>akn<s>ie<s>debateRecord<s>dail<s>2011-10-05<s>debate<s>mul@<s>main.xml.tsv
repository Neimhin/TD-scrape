RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do.  The eurozone economy is plunging yet further into crisis.  The more certain countries impose their stupid policies of austerity and bank bailouts the worse it gets.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, lives in a land of delusion and thinks the Irish economy can thrive when the rest of the European economy is going down the toilet.  Faced with this unprecedented crisis all we get is an hour and a half to discuss the situation.  We need much more time for a full and proper debate on this most serious crisis which will effectively determine the future of our economy and society for years to come.  We should be given a little more time for a proper debate on this matter than the Taoiseach has allowed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are in New Zealand, Canada and Australia.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some six hours will be devoted to the Second Stage debate on the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill 2011 this week and the Taoiseach is only allocating 90 minutes for the debate on the crisis in Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will be seeing a few more of those in the coming months.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the figure €2 billion or €5 billion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On promised legislation and promised debates,——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——I must correct the Taoiseach because before the summer break he promised we would have a chance to debate the sale of State assets.  I ask him to keep that promise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What sort of debate is it if we do not get a chance to debate in this House the merits or demerits of selling off the family silver——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——before the decision is made?  Can we not have a democratic debate before a decision?  We want to know if Bertie Ahern will end up owning the forests in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very hard to get straight answers about the outrageous plan to dispose of State companies and State assets, in part or in whole.  As I understand it, and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, there is no specific requirement in the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding that we sell State assets.  It says that the Government will consider options for an ambitious programme of asset disposals based on the programme for Government.  Will the Minister clarify that it is his Government that wishes to privatise these assets?  It is not a specific demand of the EU-IMF.  The Government wants to do it, but it wishes to put the blame on the EU-IMF for carrying through this deranged proposal to get rid of this country's family silver.  These are precisely the assets we need to invest in to maintain and create jobs and to fuel economic growth.Will the Minister clarify that issue for Members?  Will he also clarify whether we are talking about €2 billion or €5 billion of State assets?  The report suggests it wants €5 billion of State assets.  Is the Minister now saying €2 billion will be used to pay the bankers' gambling debts and that some or all of the rest of the €5 billion, which he may or may not be considering, will be used to invest in jobs programmes as he has suggested?What justification can the Minister or the troika, if he is saying it is it which is making this demand, give for privatising successful State companies, such as the ESB, or other State assets?  It is a drop in the ocean in terms of the debt.  It will make very little difference to the debt.  What is the rationale for selling off the family silver other than for corporate vultures to use the economic crisis, facilitated by the Minister, to asset strip this country of vital State companies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is not answering the question.  What is the rationale which the troika or he is putting forward for the sale of State assets?  How is it of benefit to this country and its prospects for economic recovery or growth?  I cannot see any other logic behind the demand of the EU-IMF, or the Minister's support for the sale of State assets in the programme for Government, other than asset stripping.  The Minister is not saying how it will benefit us.Is the Minister aware that when state companies in Europe are privatised, in particular energy companies, investment in them falls because the private shareholders in them demand dividends on their shares?  It does not lead to increased investment in the economy or jobs growth.  It often goes in the opposite direction.  Is that not the real danger if we go down this road?Will the Minister please define what the hell a non-strategic State asset is?  How can the ESB be in any way described as a non-strategic State asset?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did it work with the banking sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question partially relates to an earlier question and also follows on from the Minister's response.  Has he carried out any serious assessment of whether bringing in private capital into the strategic infrastructural investment programmes is effective and will lead to higher levels of investment, job creation and growth?  The ICTU and UNITE, among others, which studied those matters are strongly opposed to the Minister's plans to privatise in part or in whole companies such as the ESB.  They indicate that where State enterprises are privatised elsewhere in Europe once private capital gets involved the level of investment falls because giving a return to shareholders starts to take priority.  Has the Minister carried out an assessment in that regard and how can he guard against that likelihood?  Do we not have our own history of Eircom and broadband to bear out that fact that once the private sector gets involved, investment in developing infrastructure falls rather than increases which defeats the whole purpose?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about what is happening in Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is ideology.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Print a few punts up in Sandyford.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Deputy Keating's question.  He is pointing to an important issue — the obscene salaries of many people in the top echelons of the civil and public service, who are paid with public money.  I do not know if he agrees with me when I suggest his proposal could be extended to cover the obscene salaries at the top of the corporate and private sectors.  The Minister and the Government should explain why some sort of super-wealth tax cannot be imposed on people at the top of the public and private sectors at a time when many people are being slaughtered with the universal social charge and various cuts and attacks on their incomes.  We need to ensure high earners take some of the pain from people who simply cannot afford it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an outrage that a 65 year old woman, Teresa Treacy, has been languishing in jail for several weeks because of the ESB's bullying and determination to run overhead power transmission lines through a farm and forest land that she has nurtured and given much of her life to developing.  All she is asking, as she has made clear to the ESB for several years, is that the lines be placed underground.  It can be done and has often been done in many other places throughout Europe.  The lines are simply placed in a trench.  There would be less damage to the environment and fewer health and safety implications for people living in the vicinity.  It would solve the problem.The only excuse being provided by EirGrid and the ESB is the cost.  I have two points to make in that regard.  First, Teresa Treacy has agreed to waive the compensation to which she is entitled for having the power lines run through her land.  Second, why does the CEO who I believe earns about €800,000 a year not cut his salary by, say, €200,000, to cover the cost of placing the lines underground, where they should be?This is a fully State-owned company.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to intervene to get this women out of jail immediately.  I asked the Department of Justice and Equality on Thursday last week whether members of United Left Alliance could visit Teresa Treacy in Mountjoy Prison, but we have been given the runaround for almost one week.  Will the Minister assure us that we can get into the prison to visit her?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To add to what Deputy Higgins said, I cannot believe the Minister of State is hiding behind legal waffle.  This is a fully publicly owned company under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.Consequently, he can intervene and tell the ESB to put the cable underground.  It is as simple as that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course he can.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is typical.  It is a publicly owned company.  Who else runs it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is just nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is trying to wash her hands of it, like everything else.  The Minister should intervene and tell the ESB to put underground these cables.  It is as simple as that.Incidentally, the suggestion that Members were told by Mountjoy Prison that they were obliged to submit anything in writing is not true.  The deputy governor, John Quinn, told me he had contacted the Department of Justice and Equality, the matter was being forwarded to that Department's Secretary General and that it would revert to me about our request for a visit.  They never got back to us.  There were no telephone calls or e-mails or anything.  We are getting the run-around because they do not want people to highlight the case of Teresa Treacy, even to the extent of a few public representatives visiting her.  The Government should take its responsibility for this matter.  It should act by putting pressure on the ESB to get Teresa Treacy out of jail and to get those lines underground.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ESB can commit to her——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——that it will not rampage over her land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course it can.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we share time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the last thing I want.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree.  On the point of order, it is news to us that we could not share time because normally——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Clearly, it was not passed on to anybody because the other parties in Opposition are also——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I finish my point?  First, it has not been passed on to us and we were not aware of it.  The normal procedure for these debates is that it is stated that main spokespersons will make statements and that they can share time.  That is what normally goes into the order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At what point do we shout that the emperor has no clothes?  The European empire that is the troika of the EU, the ECB and the IMF, has no clothes, or to put it more accurately, it has not got a clue.  Everything it has done over the past two years and everything it has dictated, which it claimed would improve the situation, has made the situation worse.  That is blatantly obvious for everyone.  The more they ram austerity and bank bailouts down the necks of countries like Ireland, Greece and Portugal, the worse the situation gets.  It gets worse for the people in those countries with more unemployment, more cuts in services, slashing of incomes, and more attacks on the vulnerable.  The immorality and the hurt of it are obvious, but even in economic and financial terms, it clearly is not working.  The more they say the action is to contain the crisis, the more the crisis spreads.  The more they say that the action is designed to restore economic growth, the more we get economic contraction.  Is it not obvious?  The more they have rammed this stuff down the throats of the Greeks, the worse the position in Greece has become.  It now threatens to spread into France and Italy.  What will those two countries do but the same thing?  The banks will be recapitalised at all costs and who will pay?  French working people will pay through more austerity, economic contraction and suffering.  Italy and France will not be able to pay their debts and the holders of their bonds will be faced with the same crisis six months down the line.  When will someone shout "Stop the madness"?  The answer is obvious and every sane and sensible commentator agrees on it.  Despite this, the Government continues to live in cloud cuckoo land and tries to suggest to members of the public that we can insulate ourselves from the current problems because there has been a small number of tiny improvements in the books in a small number of export related areas and we will all be saved by export led growth.  To which countries will we export when the European economy hits recession and contracts, as it is starting to do?  We will not have anyone to export to, certainly not at a level that would pull us out of a recession while austerity destroys the domestic economy.   Let us tell the truth and strike out in a different direction.  Let us stop the austerity and the bank bailout and do what the Greek people are doing, namely, fighting on behalf of society and for fairness and pointing towards a fair way out of the economic crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There would have been another few bob gambled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister explain his remarkable comment that there should not be a write-down of our debt burden?  Is it not a fact that being a good boy in the class and submitting to the austerity poison being inflicted on us to pay back bankers' debt has not worked?  This can be contrasted with the resistance of the Greek people, where there is a 21% write-down in their debts, with talk of further haircuts on the debt.  That is because the Greek people are fighting back and the Government is finding it difficult to impose austerity.  The people are out on the streets and the result is a write-down on the debt.  The lesson is that all the bankers' gambling debts are to be paid if one is the best boy in the class and does what he is told but there is some write-down if the people get on the streets, fight and stand up to these dictators in the European Central Bank, the EU and the IMF.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not kill people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did the Greeks get a write-down?
