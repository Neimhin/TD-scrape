RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not have much to add. I agree with everything the IHREC representatives said. I thank them for coming in and for their continuing work and I also welcome the IHREC's statement on family hubs. They are right in saying that we cannot allow them to become some sort of permanent solution to the housing emergency, particularly following the report that we have the highest proportion of women in homelessness in Europe. That prompts a question. Where does scrutinising and proofing the budget proposals from an equality perspective begin and end in the context of wider policy? I refer to things that might not be in the budget itself but which have equality or inequality implications. This is one that must be looked at. There is no doubt that in recent years women and children have suffered disproportionately from policy decisions in the area of housing, social housing and social housing supports. How does one navigate the line between politics proposals, where something needs to be addressed, and scrutinising what is being proposed by the Government in the budget or at budgetary committees? Recently, I have worked on another area of discrimination, namely, motor insurance premiums, which hit certain categories of people in particular. Discrimination is rampant against older and younger people, and other categories of driver. Could the witnesses comment on that? We are just getting this budget scrutiny process up and running. We have had a shorter run-in this year and it will not be finished, with a comprehensive last word completed, for the forthcoming budget. There are practical constraints for the 2018 budget. Is it the case that the main task of the IHREC is to ensure that there would be an equality statement in the budget and that this issue would be brought to the attention of the line committees?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one final specific question. Does the IHREC have an opinion on pay equality and the pay inequality among public service workers and if this falls foul of the standard of equality one would expect in employment? It is now illegal to pay people differently for doing the same job based on their sex, yet we have institutionalised inequality in having three different pay scales in the public sector. It is the legacy of the financial emergency legislation and austerity but if some might claim justification for this at one point, for two people to work side-by-side on different rates now is an equality issue. That discrimination is not based on sex, although it probably hits women workers worse. While it is not gender-based discrimination per se, it is an arbitrary form of discrimination based on when a person happened to commence employment.However, it is an arbitrary form of discrimination. Based on when a person happened to commence employment, that person will be on a different payscale for the rest of her life. With all the talk of pay restoration, there is still no commitment to eliminate that pay discrimination. Is that covered by equality legislation?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the National Women's Council for their contributions. I have a question about the relationship between the micro and macro in assessing budgets, making recommendations or scrutinising and proofing things. It is one thing to look at a particular measure and ask if it impacts negatively, positively or not at all on the level of gender equality or some other index, but a more comprehensive proofing might look at the macro consequence of making particular choices. If there is â‚¬350 million of fiscal space and the Government decides, following the intersectionality argument, to give a big chunk of it to tax breaks for women CEOs in multinational companies, as against spending it on employing people in the health service which would be more likely to impact on employment opportunities for women workers, would the National Women's Council see it is part of its equality-proofing role to assess the relative impact of one choice over the other in those terms?
