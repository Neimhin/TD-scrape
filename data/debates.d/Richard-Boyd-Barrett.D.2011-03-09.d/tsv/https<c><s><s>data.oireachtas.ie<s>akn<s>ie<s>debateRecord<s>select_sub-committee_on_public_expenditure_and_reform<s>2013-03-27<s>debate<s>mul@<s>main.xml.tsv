RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I utterly oppose this Bill and the mood that lies behind it. It is wrong to sell State assets in general. Why would we give away an asset, particularly at a time when the State and the economy are in such difficulties? The national lottery has generated enormous revenues for the State over many years and it has supported a wide range of good causes. I see no justification for changing something that has worked so well. The only justification the Government has provided, aside from the real motive of further the asset stripping of this country under the austerity programme, is that the money we get upfront might allow us to fund the new children's hospital. I do not accept that argument for one minute. Just over one year's average revenue from the lottery would pay for the hospital. Clearly we would not take an entire year's revenue but â‚¬50 million per year could easily be earmarked from the money allocated to good causes under the current model. Spread over five years, that would cover the cost of the new hospital. There is no need to do what the Minister proposes in order to finance the children's hospital from lottery money. It is in effect a giveaway that will change the entire dynamic. Camelot or whichever entity buys it will not be interested unless it can benefit from the transaction. In moving from a set fee structure to a profit line for an entity such as Camelot, the citizens and people who buy lottery tickets and the good causes they finance will be the losers. An Post will also be a loser.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister uses the argument of economic circumstances to justify many things. He then goes on to make the argument that this is good legislation because it will inject dynamism into the lottery for the times we are in. The implication is that the current lottery model is getting a bit tired and could do with an injection of new life. The amount of funds generated by the current model and the fact that it has remained broadly steady despite the catastrophic collapse in the economic and financial circumstances of this country is an indication of the resilience and strength of that model and a reason not to change it. The excuses for doing what is proposed are spurious because what the Minister suggests he wants to achieve can be achieved by the current model. Talk of raiding existing revenue streams to finance the children's hospital is loaded, alarmist language which seeks to deflect from the fundamental criticism we are making, namely, the national lottery is supported by the public in this country because it funds good causes. I am not a fan of gambling. I do not believe it is particularly good to encourage it. However, the national lottery is at least an outlet for gambling that in the greater scheme of the gambling landscape is a more benign form, the revenues from which go towards good causes which, largely, benefit the socioeconomic category that tend to be the ones spending money on lottery tickets. I do not accept the Minister's justification for this. The Minister suggests we can achieve both aims by privatising the lottery. I believe we can do both by retaining it as it is. Regardless of how the Minister spins or tries to justify this, it is privatisation. Currently, An Post, a State-owned company, is the parent company for the lottery. That is going to change.It is highly likely that, as a consequence, we will have Camelot or some similar outfit, which has absolutely no loyalty or allegiance to or interest in the concerns or needs of the citizens of this country, taking it over. We will move from the payment of a set fee to the introduction of a profit line, which is what it says in the Department's statements. Something gives there because, as Deputy McDonald said, these guys will not come in for the good of their health; they want something. What they want is the profit line. Something will give in a context where that profit line is introduced. I do not see any justification for this and I utterly oppose it. The Minister should not repeal the Act put in place to underpin the lottery as currently constituted, which is what this section is about. It is not necessary and it will not help us in any way justify what the Minister is doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister was probably saying that himself at the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept what the Minister has said. The Minister is putting the licence for the national lottery on the market, if nothing is changing what is the selling point? Why would a purchaser make a large upfront payment? If there is nothing in it for the purchaser why would they bother buying it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An Post was paid a set fee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not because one is a moving profit line.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difference is that there is a moving profit line. That means the whole dynamic of the lottery will change. If nothing is changing why do we need to introduce new legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, I have made my points, but may I add a further point? May I raise the issue of the regulator?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment for all the reasons that have been stated already. I have a question about the troika. The Minister stated he had discussions with the troika about this matter and that he had secured the ring-fencing of this particular disposal and that it would be treated differently from others. Will the Minister elaborate on the discussions? How it is being treated differently? How does it relate to the overall commitment and requirement of the State to dispose of assets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is meant by section 6 (1), which states: "There shall be a National Lottery held on behalf of the Minister..."? I am not being facetious but I did not know that the Minister was so hard up that he needed a national lottery for himself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will it be held on the Minister's behalf?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, if they are going around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is it? Will the Minister explain it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Consistent with my opposition to the Bill generally, I oppose the section. A regulator is needed where one was not needed before. A separate body is required because whereas the Minister was previously a shareholder of the national lottery, he will not be under the new regime. That is proof that this is privatisation. One considers the experience of two sectors where regulators failed disastrously. The Financial Regulator failed utterly to deal with a deregulated financial services and banking sector. When concerns were expressed about the liberalisation and deregulation of the banking sector, great assurances were given by the Governments of the day that the Financial Regulator was keeping an eye on things. The Financial Regulator, however, went native and failed completely to rein in the vultures and the financial and banking sector. Another example is the Taxi Regulator. The deregulation of the taxi industry has been an utter disaster. The Taxi Regulator, as any taxi driver will tell one, has failed catastrophically to deal with the consequences of the deregulation of the taxi sector. Both cases represent examples of neoliberalism gone mad, but here we have it again. It is sad that we should be doing this. It is indicative of the fact that the lottery is being privatised that there is a need for a regulator. It is more than likely that we will have another useless quango that is supposed to rein in what is likely to be a big push to expand online gambling by whatever private operator takes over. Judging by the past experience of regulators, we should not expect too much from the new regulator. It is another reason the Minister should retain direct control whereby whoever holds his office is accountable at some level to the public and the Oireachtas. The appointment of a regulator pushes things at one remove from direct accountability.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is correct to point out that the failings in the financial and taxi sectors were not solely the fault of the regulators. However, they were also not simply due to policies or light touch regulation. There was a deliberate policy of deregulation of the financial sector. That was not only the cavalier attitude of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy. A general policy of deregulation and privatisation was favoured or dominant in a range of sectors. I put it to the Minister that it is not possible to deny he is committing an act of deregulation and privatisation if he is moving from a situation in which he is the regulator and shareholder in the national lottery, alongside a State company as the other shareholder, to one where a body at one remove from direct accountability becomes the regulator and the State is no longer a shareholder. I do not see how he can sustain his argument. The reason he sets out for a new quango is because something that was significantly under his control and subject to a degree of public accountability will now be controlled by some private and almost certainly external commercially driven entity. This has to be controlled and regulated, particularly in a sector in which one has to be careful. Gambling should not be allowed to run riot. If the running riot of certain elements of the financial and banking sector caused serious problems, allowing gambling to run riot would also be potentially dangerous for society. I am worried that the regulation will be at a further remove from political accountability, and for that reason I oppose the section and everything related to it in the Bill. Even under the current Government, how often do we get answers when we raise questions about the taxi or financial sectors? We are told it is the regulators' job to deal with the issues arising. The terminology used when Departments reject our parliamentary questions is that they are not in their remit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking directly to the issue. The Minister is well aware that we are told the issues raised are not in the remit of Departments and we are directed to the relevant regulator. The reason the citizen has come to the politician is because he or she cannot get an answer from the regulator. The fact that the new regulator will be funded by a private company, even though part of the problem in the financial sector was that the regulator went native, causes one to ask serious questions about how this could be construed as a good thing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to the discussion we just had about the failures of regulation in the past. The Minister explained it by saying the attitude of the Government of the day was the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was exactly what I was talking about. If the Chairman would let me finish-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Notwithstanding the Chairman's attitude, I will make the point I was going to make, which is that the Minister acknowledged the problem with regulators can be that the Government of the day, which writes the legislation for a regulator, can often be at fault in the failures of the regulator. In so far as this section sets out the framework around which a regulator can be made accountable for what he or she should do and can be removed from office if he or he is not doing it, it states he or she can be removed if he or she is unable to carry out his or her duties due to ill-health or if there is misbehaviour, but it does not mention circumstances in which he or she is not regulating properly. It should be more specific in terms of what we consider the effective functioning of the office and if he or she is not doing it properly. There is no provision for removing the regulator if he or she is not regulating as he or she should be. I do not how one would word that. I do not have a wording off the top of my head.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One is allowed raise issues on Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am substituting for someone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am making the point now. There are no limits on my making the point now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then I do not understand why the Chairman is cutting across me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will respect the Chair if the Chair is being fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the ruling of the Chair?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am allowed to make a comment on this section and on the possible need for it to be expanded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just did so. I said that as far as I was concerned-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do. I wanted to continue a couple of minutes ago. I am making the point that this section seems to have a very narrow set of reasons for removing a regulator and none seems to relate to the potential failure of a regulator to regulate properly. Maybe the Minister will think about that, as I will do. That is something at which we might look before we conclude the Bill.
