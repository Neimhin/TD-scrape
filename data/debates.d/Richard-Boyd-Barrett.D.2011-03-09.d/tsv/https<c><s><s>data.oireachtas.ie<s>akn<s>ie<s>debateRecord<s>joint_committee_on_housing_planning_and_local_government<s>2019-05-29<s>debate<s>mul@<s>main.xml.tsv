RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief. I will give credit where credit is due. These are very good regulations that will make a difference. What the Minister has done is quite radical so I say "fair play" to him and his officials. The one question I have concerns proof that somebody is actually living in the principal private residence. This concerns the potential for abuse. The Minister mentioned bills as documentary evidence that the person is living there. That would not prove that somebody was living there. The person could easily not be living there but the bills would still be in his or her name. The Minister has to think a bit more about how we establish whether somebody is living in his or her principal private residence and is not abusing the new regulations. Will the Minister comment on that? Other than that, fair play to him. He needs to do far more on all the other aspects of the housing crisis but in this area-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make a point on the back of that. It is directly related to that. I do not know if it is within the Minister's remit but some very good suggestions prompted me on this. I received a few calls recently from people who had Airbnb-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have heard of tourists who thought they had booked a place for a short-term letting here arriving at the houses of people who were not letting the property at all. It involved fraudsters identifying particular houses. One person had about three in about two months. It was in my area, although I cannot remember which part. People, including families with children, were arriving in the middle of the night telling the resident that they had rented his or her house when the resident did not have a clue. It was quite extraordinary so somebody needs to pass it up the line and something needs to be done about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said earlier I would give credit where it is due so I am more than capable of doing so. When it comes to dealing with the wider housing and homelessness emergency, however, I am truly in despair at the failure of the Minister's policies in my area. The failure of those policies presents an appalling vista. Next year, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will, at best, deliver six new council houses. The Minister said all of this takes time and things cannot be done overnight but claimed the situation would improve and as we get nearer to the end line of Rebuilding Ireland, the output of directly provided council housing would ramp up relative to the reliance on the private sector. That is not happening in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown where things are moving in the other direction. The council will provide six new council houses next year. How can the Minister possibly claim that is a serious attempt to address the housing crisis in Dún Laoghaire? It is shocking that there will be just six new social houses provided. While some units may be provided by approved housing bodies and under Part V, the council's housing output next year will amount to six units. That is significantly lower than the number provided this year, which was pathetic compared with demand. The Minister should not say that it is the council's fault or that the Government is doing its best to put pressure on local authorities because Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil council. I did not hear the Minister's response to the question on the reliance on the housing assistance payment as I had to pop out for a minute. Some 70% of people in receipt of the HAP in Dún Laoghaire are making top-up payments compared with a national figure of 50%. It is absolutely shocking that people are paying hundreds of euro over and above what they are supposed to pay. Does that not prove that the HAP is not equivalent to directly provided council or social housing? The Minister has always claimed the two approaches are simply different ways of delivering the same thing. If 70% of the people in the HAP scheme have to make top-up payments, they are clearly completely different. People on the HAP scheme are prey to private landlords and the extortionate rents they are charging. Moreover, the local authorities are now facilitating this extortion by approving situations where these massive top-up payments have to be paid. In some cases, the council has even suggested that people use their child benefit to make up the difference. People are now using child benefit to make up the difference between their rent and the housing assistance payment, which is directly leading to impoverishment and money being taken away from children. On another matter, one which we knew was in the pipeline but is now an accomplished fact, as I discovered last night, DLR Properties Limited, a corporate subsidiary of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, yesterday completed the handover of part of the Cherrywood development known as TC3 to Johnny Ronan, a private developer. How can the Minister excuse that sale?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will refer in that case to a well-known private developer, one of the people who helped with the Celtic tiger crash, who is now gaining control of a significant portion of the Cherrywood development in exchange for an office building that will generate revenue for the council when what we need is housing. It is unbelievable that the Minister would allow this to happen. This is a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil council. We opposed the setting up of that corporate subsidiary as we believed the democratically elected representatives of the council should make decisions about these matters. However, this corporate subsidiary, which is dominated by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, has been allowed to hand over what is known as TC3 to a private property developer. This shocking decision will not deliver any of the desperately needed affordable housing. The Minister stated that the standards and quality of social housing that is being delivered must be maintained. Allow me to give him a newsflash on what is actually happening because it drives a coach and horses through his claims about social mix and the integration of people from different income streams. Cualanor-Honeypark, one of the biggest developments, was in the hands of the National Asset Management Agency but is now back in the hands of private developers. We have just discovered, on foot of representations from residents, that all of the houses built for social housing under Part V were built to lower specifications than the private equivalent in the same development. That is housing apartheid. The residents are now suffering the consequences with noise pollution and so on between units. At every level, the social houses were built to a lower specification. The attitude taken was that these were council tenants who could, therefore, be given lower quality housing.How does that tally with the Minister's claimed aspiration for a social mix and placing people from different income brackets in together? Those people who cannot even get on a housing list because their incomes are just above the threshold are completely in no man's land, in particular in areas like mine. I have repeatedly asked the Minister when he is going to raise the income thresholds for people who have been waiting ten or 12 years and are being whacked off the list because they get a job or a pay rise. They are trying to do well. They are not dependent on social welfare as some people might have to be. They are working and they then lose their ten or 15 years on the housing list. This is happening every week. I have asked the Minister again and again to do something about this but we are told it is being looked at and that there is a review. We are told there is this, that and the other. A whole generation of people who are working are in no man's land. There is nothing for them. There is no affordable housing and they cannot get on the council housing lists. Nothing is happening. What is the Minister going to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our councillors were there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have no choice but to protest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am delighted to see those houses but they are about ten years too late.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are great.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask a couple of supplementary questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to go to the loo as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before it broke and became a big story in recent weeks, we had been campaigning on the basis that the site was perfect for public and affordable housing and that providing same would revitalise Dún Laoghaire, which desperately needs families and so on living in its centre. Instead, the site is going to a property developer who is just looking to maximise the profit that can be squeezed out of it and these boxes with fold-out beds for which the developer will charge €1,300. I will provide some local knowledge to what has become a national debate on the site. People across Dún Laoghaire and from all sectors of society are raging about the proposal. It is an absolute abuse of the strategic housing development process. That one can bypass the normal planning process to do this is shocking. This is not meeting the area's housing needs. No one asked for something like this. People are asking for decent quality housing for families and individuals who cannot get anything because it is unaffordable in Dún Laoghaire, where the average property price is in excess of €600,000, rents are well over €2,000 per month on average and virtually no public housing is being provided. It is shocking. We submitted an objection to this development. As I did last week, I ask the Minister to examine whether allowing something like this is an abuse of the strategic housing development process. The Minister did not comment on the question of whether it was appropriate in the current climate for a local authority, which is under his remit, to be exchanging land that could provide hundreds of desperately needed housing units in Cherrywood for office blocks. In the teeth of this crisis, is it appropriate that public land that could be used for housing is being given to private property developers? I believe it is shockingly inappropriate. Will the Minister please comment? The Minister did not comment on my point about the Part V example that I gave. The Minister is not aware of that particular example, but if my assertion is correct and Part V social housing is built to a lower standard and quality than private development in the same housing development, does he view that as acceptable? It is not acceptable and represents housing apartheid. There are two tiers of housing standards. This increases the stigma and so on associated with social housing. I ask the Minister to please comment.
