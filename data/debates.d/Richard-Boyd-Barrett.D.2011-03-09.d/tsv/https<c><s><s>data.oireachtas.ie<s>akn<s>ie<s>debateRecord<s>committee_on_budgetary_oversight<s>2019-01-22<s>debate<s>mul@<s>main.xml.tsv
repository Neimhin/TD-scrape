RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I might pick up on that point first because I have read the analysis. The Deputy rightly posed significant questions about the film relief and put the caveat that while the section 481 relief should be extended for certainty in the industry, it needs to be monitored and scrutinised. It should be monitored and scrutinised closely. He alluded to the need for that to happen. Mention was rightly made about training. Beyond having a specific minimum number of trainees per production, the relationship between this significant expenditure and the training, accreditation and qualification of trainees is unclear. I put it to Ms Donaghy, and she might give an opinion, that there is no connection at all because there is no accreditation process or qualification process.There is no tracking of trainees with the result that we do not know whether they progress from one production to another. Perhaps Ms Donaghy can comment on employment in the same regard. Section 481 requires the provision in exchange for this very significant tax relief of quality employment and training but we, again, have no real tracking of the former. A great deal of dispute arises on estimates of how many jobs the relief is responsible for with figures proposed from 17,000 to practically zero. It is a pretty big spectrum of opinion. There is a significant difference between 17,000 jobs and almost none and we need to get to the bottom of that. It is an actual condition of the relief, after all. Can Ms Donaghy confirm the analysis in the report that the Department has made it somewhat a condition of continuing the relief that these things will be looked at? If so, I agree completely. Does she accept that we do not really have a handle on the extent to which it is contributing to meaningful training connected to career pathways and tracking employment? Even the people who receive the relief have been on television to say nobody expects job security in the film industry. They say things like "You are only as good as your last job." That might be fine for them as they are in receipt of the relief, but for those who work for them and who do not have a job when the production is over or any idea of whether they will be employed on the next one, it is not so good. It does not add up to fulfilling the criterion of quality employment when even the people who are getting the relief describe the employment they give as totally precarious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but I ask how we are monitoring that stuff and who is monitoring it exactly. There are a number of different groups involved in this in terms of the application of law, including Revenue, the Department of Finance and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Arguably, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a role too. I will finish my question on film on the following point. I asked the Minister directly whether the quality employment and training condition require at a minimum the application of employment law and he said "Yes." However, there are allegations that employment law is not being applied and, in fact, there are WRC rulings against some of the production companies which are getting money where they have been found to have breached the rights of their employees. Nevertheless, they are still getting the relief. How do we police that? Is it right that they should continue to get the money when they have been shown by the WRC to have actually breached the rights of some of their workers? In one case, a company has even refused to pay the fine imposed by the WRC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is directly related to the relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And RTÉ.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a brief supplementary on those. What Ms Donaghy says is important and confirms some of the things I have asked, as have others, on this. Submissions were made to the arts committee at the beginning of last year where the people in receipt of the relief and who are the main beneficiaries and promoters of continuing it gave evidence to the effect that there were 17,000 jobs. We discover now that it is 3,000. The fact that the Department has the figures indicates that it is being taken seriously, but it is a major issue and I hope it is scrutinised seriously. The report confirms that the shadow or full economic cost of the relief was €315 million between 2015 and 2017. That is nearly €80 million a year. The full economic cost is considerably higher than the nominal figure of the relief and the number of jobs generated is far below the number claimed by those in receipt of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, but it is a serious matter for us as a scrutiny committee and for the Department.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I definitely want to come back in. One issue I asked the PBO officials earlier, which is more general, was about the fact the estimate for tax expenditure was €5 billion. Even under the corporate tax tables produced by Mr. Seamus Coffey - I think they are taken from Revenue - the allowances and deductions for 2015 are multiples of that. In 2015, there was €66 billion of allowances and €30 billion of deductions. That is €96 billion of allowances and deductions, which is a hell of a lot more than €5 billion. Will the witnesses explain that discrepancy because it seems to me there is a lot more than €5 billion worth of stuff to look into?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My notes are scrawled all over it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that this list?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a disjunction between the way Ms Donaghy's description and the Revenue document, to which I referred, which lists all these various reliefs, expenditures and credits. We all need to sing from the same hymn sheet. If different people are defining items in different ways, it is hard to get a grip on it. I should have said initially that I commend the witnesses on doing all this work. There is significant detail in the analysis they did of the reliefs. Revenue has to do considerable work to compile all this but the witnesses will appreciate it is difficult for us to make head or tail of it if there are different definitions. Without asking the witnesses to make political judgments on these matters, would it be fair to say that it is open to political discussion as to whether some of these items should be classed as expenditures? For example, I presume a company can write off the cost of purchasing a large number of company cars for its employees but a PAYE worker cannot submit a claim for tax relief on the basis they have bought a car as a means by which to get to work. The owners of that business get a tax benefit that ordinary workers do not get and one could argue that the worker should get that tax relief. There is much to be debated. Is that not a fair comment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be fair to say that under those headings one can have items that might have been considered okay as benchmark items but suddenly they are not considered okay because somebody is doing something under that particular heading? Most notably, I point to intangible assets where suddenly they were purchased by one part of a multinational by another part of its operations and then there was a major ballooning of that tax relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Regarding a general comment Mr. Cullen made, if I understood him correctly, did he go as far as to say he prefers or that it is easier and more transparent to have direct expenditures rather than tax expenditures, or that at least we need to compare rigorously one versus the other to establish that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the tax relief on research and development an example of that? It benefits a small number of large multinational corporations which are making enough money. The comparison would be to ask what would happen if there was not this review and instead we gave the amount to the universities. Is that the type of scenario to which Mr. Cullen is referring?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To return to the issue of film relief, who exactly is policing compliance with the conditions in section 481 relief in terms of quality employment and training? Given the various issues that have arisen and the analysis and information the Department has gathered, is it a fair comment that the witnesses have concerns about this relief and what it is or is not producing in terms of those criteria which are attached to that relief? Would Mr. Cullen go so far as to say that? I do not know where the line is between policy-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why I said that but it seems the analysis is indicating that. Is it now the disposition of the Department that there are big questions in this respect that need to be seriously examined and that there are not even clear criteria as to what is quality employment and training and that needs to be examined? Are the figures we are getting from the beneficiaries of this relief accurate? Is their analysis of the sector and the benefits of this relief accurate, and how do we judge that? Does Mr. Cullen get my point? Does Mr. Cullen consider it a serious matter? Who would act on it if somebody was breaching employment legislation with this money? Is it fair to say it would be a cut and dried breach of the conditions if somebody had been shown, for example, by the State industrial machinery legislation to have breached a worker's rights?They clearly have not given him or her quality employment and training. What are the consequences, if any?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who decides the consequences?
