RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 10, lines 20 to 23, to delete all words from and including “, or” in line 20 down to and including “€60,000” in line 23 and substitute “and has an aggregate income that exceeds €65,000”.This is an attempt to shift the balance of taxation from those who cannot afford it to those who can. The universal social charge has imposed a devastating burden of reduced income on low and middle income earners in a way that has not only put many of the people concerned in a perilous financial state, adding to the difficulties of paying mortgages and bills, but has also had a devastating effect on their spending power and, consequently, the domestic economy. The first amendment is aimed at trying to relieve the burden of the universal social charge on those on low and middle incomes, that is, those earning less than €65,000 a year. The second suggests the new rate for pensioners should only apply to pensioners earning in excess of €65,000. I wish to make one point to which the Minister and the Government have never really responded. At some level, they would accept that income cuts for low and middle income earners have dampened or damaged the domestic economy, but they see it as a necessary evil and suggest there is no real alternative. What I am trying to point to is that, if we shift the burden to higher earners, it will, first, provide great relief for those who are suffering and simply cannot afford these cuts in their income, and, second, impose higher taxes on those who can afford them and, therefore, not do as much damage to the economy. When people have higher earnings, they have money they can save. As we know, savings in the State have actually increased and, as they are clearly not being made by low and middle income earners, have been accumulated by higher earners who do not need the money to survive and put it in the bank. If what we are trying to do is release funds back into the economy, it is far more logical to tax those on higher incomes than it is to tax those on low and middle incomes. I doubt very much the Minister is going to accept my amendments, but I would interested to hear his response to my argument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That confirms the estimate of the cost we included in our pre-budget submission of removing the universal social charge from those earning under €65,000. We said it would cost €2.5 billion which is slightly higher than what the Minister is suggesting, although I thank him for the confirmation. However, we also pointed out that by putting extra taxes in whatever form - the universal social charge in this instance which gives me the opportunity to make this point - onto those earning in excess of €65,000 it would bring in the same amount of €2.5 billion. Ideally, as we proposed in our pre-budget submission, this would happen through the income tax system by increasing the effective tax rates on a sliding scale. The effective rates currently run from approximately 31% for those on €100,000 a year up to approximately 42% or 43% for persons earning €5 million to €6 million a year. Therefore, if we were to increase the 31% rate to 33% or 34% and the 60% rate for those earning millions every year, we could capture the €2.5 billion. This would be to the advantage of low and middle income earners who have been hammered by the universal social charge and it would also put billions of euro back into the economy, stimulating growth in the domestic economy, creating high street demand and boosting the small and medium enterprise sector which is on the floor. That would boost economic growth, whereas imposing the same tax burden on those on higher earnings, while I am sure they would not like it, would not have the same damaging effect on the domestic economy as the policies pursued by the last Government which are being persisted with by the Minister. The Minister says the cost would be great. I put it to him that taxing low and middle income earners in the way he is doing and leaving them in a position where they have virtually no disposable income is the key factor in crippling the domestic economy. This measure is directed at trying to relieve the pressure and transferring the burden onto those who could afford it. As we know from the figures for savings, such individuals are saving their money, not spending it; therefore, they could afford to carry a significant additional tax burden. I do not know why the Minister does not acknowledge this fact. Whenever we talk about increased taxes on higher earners, he talks about taxes on jobs. I put it to him that the universal social charge in the way it is being levied is a tax on jobs. It is the key tax that is preventing the domestic economy from recovering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will respond to the Minister's points and will not drag the matter on indefinitely. These amendments, both those that were accepted and those that were not, all point to one of the key issues, the universal social charge. Let us be clear - this is one of the measures that has hurt people most and devastated their income, what they take home in pay. Therefore it is worthy of discussion.The amendments we are discussing are linked with other amendments which have been excluded and disallowed. On the one hand, it is about relieving the burden of the universal social charge on those on low and middle incomes, while, on the other, it is about transferring that burden to those on higher incomes. The Minister's response is to repeat his dismissive arguments about there being no pot of gold. He is correct, there is no money tree in the back garden, which he might bear in mind when it comes to the property tax. The proposition the United Left Alliance has put forward calls on the Minister to find €2.5 billion by imposing a sliding scale of higher taxes, either through the universal social charge or having a higher income tax rate for those earning in excess of €100,000. My amendments sought to remove the burden from those earning under €65,000. Alternatively, the sliding scale of increased taxation starts at €100,000 and moves up to those earning €8 million and €10 million, of which there are several hundred people. I know this because the Department of Finance gave me a breakdown table of earnings in answer to a parliamentary question. Its tables are very helpful because all one has to do is adjust the percentage of the effective tax rate for each bracket and the table clocks up the changes. It is possible to get €2.5 billion from this group, not from the beanstalk or the money tree in the back garden. The tax tables provided by the Minister show that increasing the effective tax rate imposed on those earning €100,000, 31%, and the very highest earners on millions of euro a year, 42%, will raise revenues. While the Minister claims the existing rate is progressive, I am arguing for it to be more progressive and that the sliding scale should go from 33% up to 65% at the very top end. Would those in that bracket like such a measure? No, they would not. Would it be good for the economy? The answer is yes. It would certainly be very good if the burden was transferred from the backs of low and middle income earners who, in turn, would have more disposable income and could boost demand. When the Minister claims the economy is growing, will he, please, be fully accurate? The domestic economy is not growing and growth in the economy as a whole is marginal to say the least. In fact, the domestic economy is still going down. Shops and other businesses are still going out of business. Even if the best case scenario materialises with economic growth, the Minister's projections for unemployment show we will still have over 400,000 unemployed at the end of 2015. His claim that the imposition of the USC has nothing to do with the suffocating of demand is simply not true. Deputy Pearse Doherty is right that we need a serious debate about this matter. I am not saying we have it all right. The Minister, however, is simply not willing to discuss in a serious way a radical shift in tax policy. EUROSTAT's figures provide detailed breakdowns of the taxation burden in all member states.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but this is about the argument about the USC. The figures show that Germany and Sweden, the two economies that have proved most resilient in the face of the current recession, have much higher rates of income tax, particularly for higher earners. They have not seen the dramatic collapse of growth or rise in unemployment that we have. There is a serious argument for shifting tax policy in the direction we have laid out in the interests of fairness and a more sustainable economic model.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in amendment No. 3.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I want to bring the amendment back I have to withdraw it. Is that right? Do I move it and then withdraw it? Is that how it works?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I want to bring it back on Report Stage-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is difficult for the Minister to sustain the argument that his approach to these matters is in the round progressive against a background whereby we have a month-on-month deterioration in the financial situation of low and middle-income households. The most stark testimony of this is the Irish League of Credit Unions surveys, which have shown dramatic increases even over a three-month period in the severity of the financial situation of hundreds of thousands of families in the country.Tax policy cannot be separated from policy generally or from all the policies that affect people's financial situations and, consequently, the wider economy. It is clear that low and middle-income people are being driven under and are in severe financial distress and that this leads to devastation of the high street. The Minister uses a mantra he should be forced to justify more often, saying that all of this is being done because to do it in the way we suggest - by increasing the tax burden on those on higher earnings - would be a tax on jobs. His mantra is that doing it his way is the way to create jobs and to encourage foreign direct investment. Will he please give us some evidence to back up those assertions? This is at the heart of people's concerns and is what our tax policy should be geared towards. Is this policy helping to create jobs and is it facilitating greater investment? I am sorry to say the Minister has not provided, nor can he provide, any evidence to back up his assertions. The Minister has pointed to a marginal increase in investment in the private sector. However, in the round, investment has collapsed by over 60% since 2008.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not rhetoric. The Minister suggested this tax policy was good for investment. I am simply pointing out that it is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like the Minister to sustain his assertion that his approach to tax, whether in the form of a universal social charge or not, is good for jobs, despite the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that it is stimulating employment. Employment is on the floor and I see no increase. I just do not understand how the Minister can continue to put forward those assertions without any evidence to back them up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my point. There is no point in going over this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on. There are two things I cannot let pass. I do not know whether the Minister has the list of committee amendments in front of him. It shows clearly that I submitted amendments to seek to get the money from elsewhere. They were ruled out of order. The particular method employed essentially provides for a sliding scale. It is not about hammering people as soon as they get over the €100,000 threshold. It is about doing it on a sliding scale. I am looking for the incremental increases to be organised on a sharper basis than is currently the case. We do not have a third band. I am proposing that the universal social charge be organised on the basis of a sliding scale of several bands. This approach would probably be more effective in the case of income tax. I am proposing it in the case of the universal social charge because that is what we are dealing with in this section. Under my proposal, a person on €150,000 would pay 12%, rather than 10% as proposed by the Minister, a person on €200,000 would pay 17%, and so on and so forth. It goes up to the extent that a person on over €350,000 would pay 20%. We could keep it going by tweaking and calibrating it until we get the €2.4 billion. The Minister could provide for this. The money is there. It would be a sharp increase, but it would not be a question of slaughtering people as soon as they exceed the €100,000 threshold. I think the Minister should be accurate in his responses to the alternatives that are being proposed. I would like to make another point to the Minister in this regard. Figures can become somewhat meaningless at a certain level, particularly for those of us who spend a great deal of time looking at tables. The Minister probably does this as well. In the real world, there is a big difference between €100,000 and €120,000. It is massive. The Minister is absolutely right to say that someone who is on €101,000 a year could face quite a tough situation if they have four kids and only one person in the house is working. The circumstances of someone on €120,000 are quite different. The additional €20,000 is another person's annual wage. That is what people at the lower end are getting paid for an entire year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excuse me. If the person is on €140,000, that is another big difference. It is not about saying a tax rate of 90% should be imposed as soon as a person's earnings exceed €100,000 per annum. Why is the Minister resisting the idea of, and the viability of, a progressive sliding scale that would capture more revenue in a fair and sustainable manner? The Minister has not really given a response to that question. I think it should be debated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This relates directly to the universal social charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not making the same points over and over.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point and that was the understanding under which we were all operating. Maybe that is something we could change. Will somebody explain what the motion was yesterday because we were labouring under the illusion that it had something to do with this process?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to comment on section 5. I thought we were dealing with the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we comment on the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That flew through.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman. We are all sympathetic to not disadvantaging small and medium-sized enterprises and people engaged in research and development in those areas. There is a concern about the potential abuse of the research and development tax allowances in general. What if there are disadvantaged small and medium-sized enterprises? Could the provision be more specifically directed at them and not inadvertently give further advantage to larger and very profitable corporations to further reduce their tax liability to a significant extent? Some of us have significant questions on those allowances. Larger corporations seem to have lobbied extensively for changes in allowances which tend to, in the net, benefit them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I, too, am opposed to this section. When others and I referred to this measure on Second Stage, the Minister's clinching argument for justifying it was that some would end up better off than if they were in employment. As has been pointed out, many may not be paid by their employer, but even if they are, I do not see this as a problem. It comes down to whether we give full recognition to mothers and the service they are doing for society by having and looking after children. It relates to the unfairness and cruelty of cuts to child benefit; the recognition which previously was given to women having and raising children as a contribution to society is now being withdrawn. This is unfair, anti-women and anti-family. The Minister should be upholding and expanding that recognition to acknowledge what women do for society. The role of women, being the key carers of children, is already undervalued. These benefits were given in recognition of that role and now the Minister is eroding them. This measure is not justified and the Minister should withdraw it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot of points have been made but the central one is that the Minister is failing to recognise that having and rearing children, which women do, is work. The Minister has referred to it as being "out of work" and that it is anomalous to be out of work and getting as much or more as one would get if one was in work. Having a baby and bringing up a child is work. It is perhaps the most important work that is done in our society and the most valuable to the society as a whole. It is entirely right and proper that women should be acknowledged in every way for that with any financial assistance they can get. If women need time off their other job - which is the right way to put it - to have babies and look after them in the early months, it is entirely right and proper that they should be slightly better off and that the Minister should not undermine that marginal advantage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point that this has been championed by the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, but there should be joined-up thinking when it comes to the impact of all measures, particularly education. The Government's constantly stated commitment to education, reskilling and retraining as a key part of getting people back to work, preparing the economy for recovery and gearing up people for new industry or enterprise that we hope to develop or attract investment in does not tally with making it more difficult for people to access education. The two points run directly counter to one another and there is no doubt any additional cost for education is a disincentive for some people to access third level education. There is a significant phenomenon of people dropping out because they, or their families, cannot afford the cost of third level education. Whoever is responsible, collectively, this is a retrograde move that does not help people trying to access education and it does not help our hopes for economic recovery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for leaving the meeting but I have caught up with the main train of the discussion. The Minister has not taken seriously the issue of the public good is served by ensuring people go to third level education and the damaging effect this measure may have in disincentivising people from entering education. The Minister is cutting off his nose to spite his face with short-term savings to the Exchequer but long-term damage to the capacity of the economy to recover. This involves investing in the most important resource that we need to recover, namely, human beings being educated, trained and skilled and able to contribute to generating wealth in the economy. There is simply no way around the point we are making, which is that this is damaging not just to the individuals involved and their families but also to the stated objective of Government. I am not in favour of tax incentives but the Government is. If I had my way, there would be no fees whatsoever and education would be a right not a privilege for everybody because it is for the good of society. It would be paid for through progressive income tax and increasing corporation tax. The Minister is not interested in taking that road. Let me give a good example of the point I am making. The reason the late, and in my case lamented, Hugo Chavez went to Cuba to avail of its health services is that in Cuba, which is not a perfect society, the Government understood the need to invest in the health service. Cuba has a state of the art health service even though it has a relatively underdeveloped economy. The basic principle is to invest in health services because they are important and they do not put any obstacles to people accessing the health service. It seems to me that principle applies to education. Even if it is the Minister's chosen preference to have fees and to put obstacles in the way of certain sectors of society accessing education and instead to incentivise different sectors of the economy, which is one of the favourite buzz words when it comes to capital in particular - we must incentivise research and development, the big investors, major capital investments - can he not see that what he is doing is inconsistent with that policy? Surely one of the most, if not the most important groups to incentivise are young people being incentivised to enter third level education, for their good and for the good of the economy? If we have people dropping out of third level education, it will do medium to long-term damage. In fact it will do immediate damage and it will also do medium to long-term damage to the capacity of the economy to recover. Let me respond to Deputy Twomey's point, there were fees when I was in university but luckily in my case my parents could afford them. If that group can contribute to the collective education system they should through income tax but what is being proposed will hit a group that are just over the thresholds. It will hit people who are on the margin of whether they can access education. This measure will hit that group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is €600.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An increase of €150 per year for four years of education.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister asked a question and I am telling him the answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Per year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us go all the way up to fourth level.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister could simplify this difficult problem by adopting the Cuban model of education.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we do not sell our forests off to a Swiss bank, we will be able to grow some more money for the State. On a serious note, the Minister's last point is a telling one. It relates to the earlier discussion on the need for joined-up thinking. The Minister is absolutely right at some level. His argument that this amount of money is not much would be acceptable if we could have this discussion in isolation from the discussions on all the other cuts that are having a particular impact on this sector of society. It is a question of the cumulative hit. I have heard the horror stories of students - and anecdotal evidence from their families - who are struggling to stay in university. That is not made up. It is the reality. I had meant to make another point to Deputy Twomey. When I was in college, it was easy to get work off-campus, but it is extremely hard to do that now. Students are being affected by all of these things. It is very difficult for students to get part-time jobs to keep them going while they are in college. That is the reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an issue in which I have a big interest. It is absolutely right that there should be a review of it. I do not agree with Deputy Michael McGrath's view that we should be cautious about this. We need to uncover what exactly is going on with the corporation tax rate in this country. As I have made clear to the Minister in numerous questions I have put forward and as I have made clear to his officials during some informal discussions, I am baffled as to how, on the basis of the latest available figures, we can go from having €70 billion of pretax profits to €4 billion in actual tax paid and claim that we have a 12.5% rate or, as the Minister has done in responses to my queries in this regard, maintain a claim that the effective rate is 11.9% when basic arithmetic would tell us that €4.2 billion as a percentage of €70 billion is about 6.2%. This is further confirmed, as I posed in a question last week, by EUROSTAT figures comprising detailed figures on tax throughout the European Union, to which I would draw the attention of everybody, particularly the Department. EUROSTAT refers to what it calls the implicit tax rate. "Implicit" is its word for effective tax rate. It is calculated on the same principle, namely, what are the pretax profits, what is tax paid and what is the latter as a proportion of the former. It has a 6.8% implicit rate for us, as it set out in the figures I have to hand, and not 11.9%. It is extraordinary that the response I got to a question I put forward is that we cannot calculate the effective rate. I ask the Minister what sort of answer is that. We can calculate the effective rate for everybody else and hammer them with taxes, charges and all the rest of it but it appears we cannot get a straight answer on what is the effective rate, even though the evidence is staring us in the face that the effective rate is half of what the Minister claims it is and figures from EUROSTAT, which is not a left-wing think-tank as far as I am aware, suggests that it is much lower. It is interesting to note the various figures and our rate compared with that in other countries. I do not have all the figures to hand but Sweden has an effective rate of 21%, 22% or even higher, Britain has an effective rate of 24% or 26%, and Germany has implicit or effective rate of 17.1% according to the EUROSTAT figures. By whatever way we define it, our effective rate is a fraction of what is being charged in the rest of Europe.  There is no evidence whatsoever to sustain the argument that a low corporate tax rate is central to our economic prosperity, success and to our encouraging investment into the country. The argument is repeated ad nauseam as a mantra even though it has had no effect. We have maintained this low corporate tax rate in good times and in bad and held it as being sacrosanct, something that cannot be touched. It did not stop us getting a property bubble, it did not stop the crash and in the following five years it has not helped us to recover. I heard the Tánaiste repeat on a radio programme that our policies are about facilitating investment. Where is the investment? In reality, the investment has collapsed and there has been no recovery of that investment as a result of us protecting the corporate tax rate. If one was to do a fair study of what is going on in the rest of Europe, one would find that the pattern, probably with the exception of the Netherlands which has a low implicit rate like we have, is that the countries that have fared best and proven to be most robust and most resilient in the face of the current downturn have been those that happen to have considerably higher effective tax rates than we do. They have not suffered a collapse in investment, employment or growth. There is simply no evidence to sustain the claim that a low corporate tax rate is the key to anything and certainly not the key to their economic prosperity. The argument put forward is that by varying or touching the rate, and Deputy McGrath seems to suggest we should even be careful about talking about it, which I find astonishing, and that seems to be the Government view as well-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy more or less said that in saying that we should be careful about producing papers on it. Let us take it that the gap in the rates between us and comparable countries in Europe, indeed the majority of countries in Europe, including Britain with an effective rate of 24% or 26%, is as is suggested in the EUROSTAT figures. Britain is our nearest neighbour and probably our biggest competitor for US foreign direct investment as an English speaking country within the European Union. The idea that if we varied our effective rate by a few points there would be a massive migration to Britain of the investment currently coming to this country cannot be sustained because the gap in the rates between us and them would still be very considerable. I am sure the Minister does not agree with that and clearly Fianna Fáil does not agree with it, but it does bear a proper analysis. Let us have scrutiny of this and let us get behind these companies' amazing allowances that see their tax liability written down to the extent that it is. Let us at least get to a point where we can agree on the effective rate. The figure the Minister quoted in his response to the question I asked on this, as one calculation of the effective rate at 11.9%, was introduced by the Adam Smith Institute. That is from where that figure came. The Adam Smith Institute has a particular bias in this regard because it does like high corporate tax rates. Of course, it will say effective rates are very high but EUROSTAT has indicated that our rate is half of the rate quoted. Let us have a serious analysis and debate on what is the effective rate and what would be the impact, extra revenue generated and overall effect on the economy of raising the rate. Then we can have an informed debate, but let us end the situation where corporate tax is a sacred that we cannot touch when everybody else is being hammered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unfortunately, as I had to attend another committee, I had to run in and out. We should have a discussion, which the Minister seems to be acknowledging. I diverge from the views of my other colleagues on the committee in that I am convinced that the effective rate, if not the nominal rate, must increase. I find it unacceptable, when everything else can be attacked, that the one thing we must defend is the corporation tax rate. Even the language used is that we must defend ourselves against an attack on our corporation tax rate. I find this deeply problematic and it must be scrutinised. I take on board some of the points the Minister is making and understand there is an international system of allowances and deductions. However, no matter how one computes it, there is still a marked divergence between the effective rate here and elsewhere. When the Minister references the European-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to make one point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very tight. When the Minister references the European Commission which has a figure of 14% because it is a party to the EUROSTAT figures, they are referring to taxes on capital. However, when they talk about corporations, the figure is 6.8%. If one looks at Germany, for capital it has a rate of 20.7% and 17.1% as the implicit rate. We need to get behind these figures. What is the corporation tax rate and what are the overall taxes on capital? It is slightly different if that is what the Minister is talking about. One could make the same argument about income tax. One could talk about the effective rate of income tax, but we should not forget that stealth charges increase the overall burden of taxation on the individual. As one can start playing with figures, we need to have a detailed discussion where everything else would be up for grabs. There is no one area that should be off limits for discussion purposes or that we must tiptoe around. That discussion needs to happen urgently, given the financial problems the country faces.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The following is generally applicable and certainly applies in this case. Anything that assists in creating employment is a good thing and one would not want to do anything that would damage the likelihood that a new company would be able to continue and generate employment. There is also the problem of companies becoming profitable very quickly and then failing to pay their fair share of tax. How does one distinguish between these things? One thing to consider might be the profitability of a company. Restricting the tax relief to a small enterprise which is making a small profit could make the difference between that enterprise employing a further person or not. It can be a different matter with a much larger enterprise which is making larger profits. Making distinctions in our approach to taxation and taxation reliefs might be something to consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Mathews asked a very specific question but I want to speak to the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have very much time. I have learned a lot about the REITs and they are very interesting but I am alarmed.I would like to hear the answer to Deputy Doherty's question on the corporation tax rate, as yet again we seem to be going down the road of reducing corporate tax liability in order to encourage investment. Have we not heard that before? The Minister seems to be suggesting this is a prudent form of speculating in property as opposed to the more imprudent forms of speculation in property that we had before. I would need to know a little more to have confidence that this is not another new model for a property casino. Is there any reason that it could not become that?
