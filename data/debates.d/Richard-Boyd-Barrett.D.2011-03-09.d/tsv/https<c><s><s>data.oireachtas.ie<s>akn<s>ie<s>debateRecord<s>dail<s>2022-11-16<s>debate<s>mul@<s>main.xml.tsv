RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the most depressing aspects of being a Deputy is dealing with the hardship and despair of people suffering from the housing crisis and the fact that they just do not know what to do. This week, I had two families in tears in my clinic. They felt absolutely hopeless owing to the prospect of their being made homeless with their children. They were worrying about the mental health impact on their children, who were on the floor with depression at the prospect of being made homeless. In addition to addressing all the policy issues related to delivering affordable and public housing and stopping evictions, many of which the Government will not address, could the Taoiseach, at a minimum, provide better Government information on what people should do so they will have a place to go? I suggest that we develop a housing hub or portal as part of the GIS. It should be widely advertised on radio and television in order that there would at least be a place for people to get information on what they should do in a crisis and how they should access affordable housing or cost-rental accommodation. It should deal with all the frequently asked questions of people in acute distress because of the housing crisis, giving them a place to go. I will set aside the wider policy debates, which we have had many times. At the very least, the Government could vastly improve the information it makes available to people, particularly those in desperate circumstances.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The SDGs are an internationally agreed set of progressive goals and aspiration. Goal 16 relates to justice, strong institutions and access to same. I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government's commitment to CETA threatens access to justice. He should not throw sand in people's eyes with talk about who is for free trade or trade generally. I am for fair trade, by the way, rather than free trade for the sake of it with no regard to whether it is fair or not. I am absolutely for trade that is mutually beneficial. The issue with CETA is the investor court system, which has not been implemented. The Taoiseach says trade with Canada has improved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fine but we do not need this body standing above normal institutions for justice and favouring multinational companies and threaten access to justice for ordinary people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decision of the Putin regime to sanction the Taoiseach and other Ministers is a further worrying sign about what is happening to our reputation as a neutral country.It has implications for our Defence Forces whose safety when deployed on missions is also linked to our reputation as a neutral country. We all condemn Putin's bloody war and the escalation we are seeing at the moment. However, the Government's association with and echoing of the NATO line, abandoning a position of neutrality which should be about upholding opposition to war and military solutions in dangerous conflicts like this, is undermining our neutrality and our international reputation as a neutral country. Ultimately it is endangering the Irish Defence Forces.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are now seen as protagonists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have respect as a neutral country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying the Taoiseach is now a protagonist in a war.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except in Palestine, western Sahara, or Saudi-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are consistent principles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have taken sides in a conflict between military blocs.
