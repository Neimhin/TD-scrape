RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has claimed repeatedly that it is legally prevented from cutting the obscene pensions of former politicians and top civil servants. As we speak, however, the Government is moving to tear up an agreement made with public sector workers that was supposed to run until the middle of 2014, and is demanding further drastic cuts in pay and conditions for public sector workers who have already been hammered with cuts in their pay and conditions in the last four years. Even before the Croke Park agreement, public sector workers lost between 15% and 20% of their pay in levies, cuts and the universal social charge. Under the Croke Park agreement, public sector workers have given back €1.5 billion in savings through redeployment, linking increments to performance, changing shift patters, reducing the pay of new entrants by 10% to 20%, cutting pensions to career average earnings, increasing the retirement age to 68, reducing numbers, supposedly by 18,000 initially but now up to 35,000, and by endless other cuts in pay, conditions and allowances. Now, on top of that the Government wants another €1 billion in cuts. Does the Tánaiste realise the proposed cuts in premiums and allowances will mean a 10% cut in pay for nurses, firefighters, gardaí and other public servants? Does he realise the additional five hours work per week proposed for public servants is an effective pay cut of 12.8%? Does the Tánaiste not understand that tens of thousands of public sector workers are among the 180,000 who cannot pay their mortgages and who are now to be hit by €1,000 extra in interest payments per year, home taxes and water charges?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Tanáiste, as leader of the Labour Party on the hundredth anniversary of the 1913 Lockout, is it not a monstrous betrayal by the Labour Party of the traditions of that party and its founder, James Connolly, to be asking further pay cuts of nurses whose take home pay is approximately €25,000 per year-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or newly-qualified teachers whose take home pay is €21,000 per year-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and those demands being made by Ministers who are on €140,000 a year? Would James Connolly not be spinning in his grave at what the Tánaiste is trying to do to these workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Tánaiste seriously talk of respect when Ministers who are earning €140,000 a year, several multiples of what teachers, nurses or firefighters are earning, are asking those workers-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to take even further cuts in pay and conditions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to workers, who can barely make their mortgage payments, who can barely pay their bills. How are they supposed to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How are those, who are already in mortgage distress and in arrears, supposed to pay their mortgages? How are they supposed to pay the home tax the Government now wants to impose on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Ceann Comhairle not understand the subjunctive? I asked the Tánaiste how are they supposed to pay their mortgages and their bills, or the home taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What makes the Tánaiste think-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the Government can justify another-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After you cutting across me, a Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excuse me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, it was a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle stated it was not a question; it was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the Tánaiste-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Tánaiste answer the question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pay cuts.
