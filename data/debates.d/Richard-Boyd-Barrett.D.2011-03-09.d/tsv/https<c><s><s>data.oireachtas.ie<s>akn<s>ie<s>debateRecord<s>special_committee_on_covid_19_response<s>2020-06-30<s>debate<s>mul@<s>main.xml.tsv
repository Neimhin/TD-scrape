RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Moran and his colleagues. All present agree on the need to inject money into the economy, SMEs and the pockets of workers in order to get the economy moving again. It would be useful, particularly in light of the worrying indicators from around the world and possibly even in Ireland in the context of the pandemic, for those representing the business sector to clearly acknowledge that although all of that is true, public health must come first. Mr. Moran and other business representatives should make that statement. That is particularly important given that although many, if not most, SMEs are compliant with the public health guidelines, there may be, for obvious economic reasons, pressure on them to cut corners on public health guidelines or, indeed, to accelerate the lifting of restrictions to the detriment of protecting public health. It is important that Mr. Moran address that issue. I hope Mr. Moran will agree that the wage subsidy scheme and income supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, should be maintained for as long as is necessary and until we see recoveries in the affected sectors where people are facing mass lay-offs and unemployment. That may be the case in several sectors for the foreseeable future. The supports are necessary for the sake of the workers, but also in order to keep money flowing through the system. I ask Mr. Moran to make a clear statement on that issue.  I wish to tease out something I thought I heard Mr. Moran state earlier. He made an argument for grants rather than loans because he does not wish for companies to be indebted. That is a reasonable point, but do we not have to be careful to ensure that it is directed at those who really need it, rather than having those who do not need it profit from it? There are probably not many SMEs registered offshore. I do not think offshore companies should get grant supports. Rather, they should have to repay any support they receive. I acknowledge that many businesses are in real trouble, fighting for their lives and in need of support, but should there not be a clawback mechanism for the State when it comes to companies benefitting from State support that are profitable or using the money for non-essential expenditure?Should there be a quid pro quo such that if we give a company money, we can be sure that the chief executive of that company is not paying himself an extortionate pay rate or salary and those payments would be capped? Can we ensure they are not abusing schemes in terms of laying workers off or making them work longer hours and so on? There have been a number of reports along those lines, where people at the top are benefiting from the schemes and doing very well, while workers they employ are often not being treated so well. We need to be sure the supports are going to the people who need them. I ask the witnesses to comment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman and the committee for agreeing to my request to have this session and to get EPIC and the National Campaign for the Arts in before the committee. It is hugely important that their voices are heard. The terrible irony of the current situation is that society has never before needed the arts, music and culture more than it does now to sustain itself in a difficult time. It has now realised the value of the arts, music and culture, even through their absence, because people are missing going to gigs and live events. Their value and importance have been underlined tenfold by the current situation but the arts are facing an existential threat to their existence and all of the people front of stage and behind the scenes are also facing such a threat. The witnesses have made their case fantastically well and I hope the Government listens in terms of how important it is to sustain them all through this situation, however long it lasts. Many of the economic arguments have been made and I do not want to go over them because the witnesses made them so well. I would like them to talk a little bit about the human impact of all of this on the artists and the people behind the scenes whose livelihood is now threatened in a fundamental way. In some of the Zoom meetings we all attended recently people were pointing out that, pre-Covid, musicians who play in the pubs, such as those in Temple Bar, would have been paid €130 for a two-hour set. As we speak, they are being told they might get €30 for two hours. That is not sustainable and it is incredibly demoralising for those musicians. They need the payment and they need a guarantee now that the pandemic unemployment payment will be maintained until their livelihood can recover. That is just one example I can think of. At the meeting we had online, Bressie spoke about the mental health impacts for people of having mortgages and bills and not knowing what is coming down the line given the current situation. I would like all the contributors to talk about that mental health impact, the anxiety and the human consequences for people front and backstage. The other area I want to ask about is the role the witnesses envisage for public service broadcasters, the national broadcaster, in all of this. One of the comments made repeatedly at the meetings was that we should have a minimum amount of original domestically produced content on the national broadcaster to encourage original content production, performers and so on here.Perhaps the witnesses could comment on that demand. I refer also to funds for the production of original content. Could they say a little bit more about payment for online work? That featured quite a lot in the meetings we had.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank all our guests for a very powerful presentation. There seems to be a sympathetic ear from all members, and I hope we can discuss how the committee can put forward recommendations arising from what our guests said. The point made by the Chairman is a very good one. It is a bit baffling that for us to engage with NPHET and the Health and Safety Authority to ask the simple question of whether 50 people in a venue-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That may be so, but I think the Government is possibly taking advice from public health authorities. It is something we could try to get the bottom of and see what the rationale is because there does not seem to be a consistent one behind that. That change would make some difference but it still would not solve the industry's problem until we get back to normal. Is that correct? The industry certainly has my support and, judging from the response, there is a great deal of support from other members. I want to commit to pushing the committee forward as much as possible on our guests' behalf. I turn to a broader question. The arts and live entertainment are such a central part of the cultural fabric of this country and they are so beloved of everybody in the country. They are badly needed, as we have seen more than ever during this crisis even though most people know it anyway, yet it is such an overlooked sector and it is so far down the pecking order when it comes to getting support. It is a curious irony that that is the case. I hope that this meeting and our guests' campaigning, which has been fantastic, will start to remedy that, but I am curious as to why it is the case and what our guests' views are as to why that irony exists. Something that is so important and valued gets so little support and is often far down the pecking order when it comes to issues that are considered important by the political system.
