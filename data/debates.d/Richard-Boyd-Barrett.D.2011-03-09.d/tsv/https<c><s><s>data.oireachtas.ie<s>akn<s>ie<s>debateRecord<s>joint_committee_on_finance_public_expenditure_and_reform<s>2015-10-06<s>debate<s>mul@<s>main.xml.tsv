RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	China is moving in a scary direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be fair to say that most of things that are leading to an apparently positive picture on paper of the economy are external, be that the favourable exchanges rates, lower energy prices, lower interest rates, quantitative easing, or the US measures taken over recent years? Mr. McCarthy might when responding to that question also comment on the effects in this regard of the increase in property prices and the development of the property sector. Are we just bobbing around on a sea of external factors with little control or influence over them - and, equally, are we, for the same reasons, extremely vulnerable to all sorts of external factors over which we have absolutely no control?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that point, are the good news stories we hear from Government and the Department of Finance about all how all is going well, which encourages confidence and spending, based precisely on what Mr. McCarthy just said, and nothing else?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that point, are there any indications of whether personal indebtedness is on the increase again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. McCarthy including in that inflation in property prices?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not. Perhaps Mr. McCarthy will explain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That, I know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Arguably, all of that is largely inspired by external factors. However, that is for another debate. On capital expenditure and the recently announced capital plan, what is the percentage of capital spending pre-crash versus proposed capital spending, on an annual basis, under the current plan? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the figures pre-crash.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So the amount is well below previous public capital investment. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question was about the pre-crash period. It is well down, I think. Mr. McCarthy does not have the figures off-hand. Is that the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I completely disagree with Mr. McCarthy on that point. This is one of the questions I wanted to put to him. What does he have to say about the housing crisis at the moment, as a macroeconomic problem? It seems to me that we need major investment, and not only from the point of view of the people who are homeless on the streets. I imagine it will start to become a problem in terms of foreign direct investment as well if people cannot afford to live here. Average rents now in Dublin for two-bedroom accommodation are approximately €1,700, €1,800, €1,900 or more, perhaps €2,000. What proportion of an average income is that? To my mind, there is a major macroeconomic imbalance if the cost of accommodation is perhaps half or more than half of the average income. Does Mr. McCarthy not consider that this is something we should be concerned about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. McCarthy would be concerned about it. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does Mr. McCarthy think can be done about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nevertheless, Mr. McCarthy is concerned about it. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am keen for Mr. McCarthy to comment on one last aspect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have many questions, but I might come back in later. We were doing some work today on the question and tonight in the Dáil we will be discussing corporate taxation. I noticed something last week when I was looking at the Department of Finance study of the effective rates of tax in this country. The deductions on total profits in 2006 came to €5 billion, off approximately €69 billion in gross profits. Has Mr. McCarthy noticed that too? By 2011 - the latest available figures - deductions amounted to €21 billion. I understand the Department of Finance paper indicates that much of the figure is made up of royalties. Does Mr. McCarthy find it alarming that, according to the paper, the royalty deductions which reduce taxable profits increase dramatically, from 10% of total profits to 33% of total profits between 2006 and 2011? Did he not consider that somewhat concerning?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To summarise the position - this follows on from some of what Mr. McCarthy and Senator Sean D. Barrett said - we have seen a big jump in corporate profits. We have some of the highest growth levels anywhere in Europe, but because of fiscal treaty requirements, particularly as they relate to the debt burden, there is very little latitude to do anything. In fact, we are, effectively, debarred from translating buoyant economic growth into investment in the economy or redistributing the dramatically increasing profits through various means. Is that, more or less, the picture? We are not allowed to do this and will not be allowed to do so for whatever number of years because of the fiscal rules. We are, therefore, in a straitjacket. We see massive profits and economic growth, inflating wealth which is probably concentrated in a few hands and which we are not allowed to put back into the economy through public spending, capital investment or anything that might benefit the people who have been hit the hardest.
