RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My group has not spoken.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to be helpful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To save time and, hopefully, for us not to be forced into a vote which would actually be a waste of time at this point, if it is only a minute in the difference, why will the Government not just agree to the original proposal, which was ten and five minutes? With due respect to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, I do not agree with the splitting of seven and eight because it will just mess things up from our point of view and from some of the smaller groups' point of view. For the sake of a minute, will the Government just do the ten and the five which was originally proposed. The time difference is so small and we would be wasting it with a vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. The Solidarity-People Before Profit group wrote to the Business Committee to state our view that time should have been made available this week to discuss the significant concerns regarding health and safety in schools, particularly in the context of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland ballot. It expressed concerns about the failure to apply the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control close contact protocols when it comes to positive Covid cases and raised other issues pertaining in particular to the health and safety of 800 teachers with underlying conditions. The Taoiseach may have seen the principal and deputy principal of a school in Luttrellstown who featured on a news programme last night. They pointed out that they did not understand the way in which the Covid-19 contact tracing and testing regime in schools was operating. These are serious matters to do with the public health effort and the health and safety of teachers, pupils, their families and the wider community which need to be discussed in detail and debated in the House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was asking about Wednesday. Wednesday is what we are talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked specifically about Wednesday and a debate which is of considerable public health importance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not give an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is not allowing a debate on that at any point, is it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. Same point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That has nothing to do with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are any of the additional staff brought in to deal with Covid-19 addressing the issue of the recruitment of front-line workers necessary to deal with the crisis or the issue of the conditions and pay such workers have to accept? I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach a few times but the more I raise it, the more shocking and extensive are the emails and contacts I get from people. For example, a number of weeks ago I raised the widespread issuing of zero-hour contracts to contact tracers by CPL. I have got a slew of emails since I highlighted that scandal, which was apparently a mistake although I will tell the Taoiseach in a minute why it was not. I will give the Taoiseach a flavour of what I have been told by the people who are becoming contact tracers, nearly all of whom are science graduates, it is important to say. The issues they have include not being told if they were to be paid for training, which had so far taken 11 hours for one person when they contacted me; being asked to work before being issued contracts; being treated as if in employment while without pay or contracts; being directed to spend their own time practising and learning at home; being given zero-hour contracts; a lack of a human resources presence or anyone to whom to address queries; poor pay at €24,000 per annum; and a lack of sick pay and supports despite the potential for mental health issues for contact tracers highlighted by the training. These are taken from one email from one person. I also get emails from people who work in testing who are also on zero-hour contracts. All the phrases that were in the mistaken contract are also in contracts issued to people working as medical scientists in laboratories who have been carrying out testing since March. These are also highly qualified people who are on the most rubbish contracts one could imagine. I have also been contacted by other medical scientists telling me that they are applying for jobs but cannot get them at a time when we are saying that such people are needed in the laboratories. They are having to sign on for social welfare even though the testing system was unable to function for two weekends because there was not enough staff. Despite this, qualified people looking for these jobs cannot get them. There is also the matter of student nurses, to which the response has been most unbelievable. I brought up with the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago the matter of student nurses not being paid for working on the front line in hospitals. Does the Taoiseach know how many people watched the video of our engagement on that matter? It was 250,000. There were a slew of comments thanking God that somebody had raised these student nurses' plight because they are working for nothing. This is how we are treating those on the front line. This is how we are addressing the issue of building up the permanent capacity we need to deal with Covid-19.They have rubbish contracts and student nurses are being exploited, and we are not even employing qualified people who are desperate to work in the testing and tracing area. What is going on? Is there any sense of awareness of these matters in the Taoiseach's Department or the Cabinet subgroup? Will the Taoiseach address this as a matter of urgency? I do not see how we can deal with Covid-19 with such a state of affairs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have also raised this issue repeatedly with the Taoiseach. I go so far as to say that the failure to have an all-Ireland integrated strategy to deal with Covid-19 amounts to sabotage of the efforts necessary to deal with the virus. That is how high the stakes are, and all the public health experts, infectious disease experts and epidemiologists understand that point. It is simple to understand that we have a serious problem if we are operating two different strategies, two different timescales and two different approaches. Nothing is more important than addressing this issue. During our earlier debate on staff involved in testing and tracing - I hope to God they are not on agency contracts in the North - I should have concluded my reference to an email I received from a contact tracer by saying she finished off by stating "the bad treatment and lack of pay are making me seriously reconsider undertaking the role, or, if I do, I will almost certainly jump ship as soon as I am offered employment where I am actually valued". That was on foot of one of these CPL contracts. If that is the attitude of the contact tracers we are recruiting, it does not bode well for when things really get serious. We need, therefore, an integrated approach. What tangible moves has the Taoiseach made to achieve that and what responses is he getting? I am also curious about what is going on in the Northern Ireland Executive regarding this situation. We will have a serious problem on 14 November when restrictions are lifted in the North, given that the situation is worse up there. It will be a serious problem for the efforts we are making down here to drive down the infection rate. It is a matter of urgency that we renew our efforts to have a co-ordinated, aligned and integrated strategy in our public health efforts. Has the Taoiseach contacted the authorities in the UK concerning the value and imperative of having an all-Ireland strategy to deal with Covid-19?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question, which I asked the last time, was on whether the Taoiseach actually talked to Boris Johnson and the British authorities about the imperative to have an all-island approach to Covid-19. What is their response to that? Are they indifferent or dismissive? From an infectious disease point of view, it is an irrefutable fact that to operate on an all-Ireland basis in dealing with Covid-19 would by far be the best and most effective way to deal with it. Will the Taoiseach elaborate a little bit more on what the response has been, if the Taoiseach is making the case which he says he is? As the Taoiseach said, it is not about grandstanding, it is a practical imperative. I believe him, as that is what he said, but what response are we getting other than, as the Taoiseach said, it is two different jurisdictions? Is that code for the Taoiseach being told that they do not care about the need for an integrated approach on an all-Ireland basis because these are two different jurisdictions and they are not co-operating on that basis. What is the block?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I understand correctly, when Maitiú Ó Tuathail contacted the Tánaiste and asked him for the contract, the Tánaiste did not check with the IMO, the Minister for Health or the Department of Health to alert them to the fact that he intended to give it to Maitiú Ó Tuathail. Could he explain why this was the case? Presumably the Tánaiste knew, if Dr. Ó Tuathail was contacting him, that he could not get the document through other channels. He was coming to the Tánaiste and the Tánaiste did not check with the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Department of Health or the IMO whether this would be a problem for them. It must have occurred to the Tánaiste that it might indeed be a problem, because if it was easily accessible, Maitiú Ó Tuathail would have got it. Was it possibly that the Tánaiste intended to give it to a friend, whether he was a good friend or not? Has that not something to do with the reason the Tánaiste did not check with the IMO, the Minister for Health or the Department of Health, because the intention was to give it to a friend? Is that not the problem here, and quite a damning problem, that the Tánaiste was doing something behind the backs of the other Government members and the group with which the Government had negotiated a contract and he did not really want to let them know what he was doing because he was giving the document to a friend?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did it occur to the Tánaiste that he should have asked the Minister for Health, the IMO and the Department of Health before giving the document to a friend? Did that not occur to him at all?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To follow up on that, the Minister said earlier on this that it was education not work so we should not pay them. We should be clear that this departs from what the Government was forced to do in March and April when it had to acknowledge they were actually working and pay them at the healthcare assistant level.The idea that the student nurses who are on placement at this time are not working is a nonsense, when there are 500 to 600 healthcare workers out for more than 14 weeks with long-tail Covid, of whom the biggest cohort comprises nurses and midwives. Nurses and HCAs make up the largest cohort of workers being hit with Covid infection and they are working in a highly dangerous environment from an infection point of view. There is no question that the student nurses are working. In fact, they are being exploited and our hospitals would not be operating without them. The idea that they are exclusively on some sort of educational placement is not accurate. Their placements are part of their education but they are working. Indeed, they are being exploited because they are not being paid as they were earlier this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised this issue with the Taoiseach on 20 October. It might be of interest to the Minister to know that the video of that engagement has been watched 250,000 times, which is very rare for any video of proceedings in this House in which I am involved. That was the scale of the response from student nurses. In that engagement, the Taoiseach said the following:...I will engage with the HSE and the Minister for Health on student nurses working on the wards in the current context. As they were earlier, they should be paid in accordance with the agreement arrived at earlier in the year. I will follow up on that.When we put the points to him regarding the situation of the student nurses, he agreed that they should be paid at the previous rate. For the reasons Deputy Gino Kenny outlined, they cannot get other jobs. There is no question that they are working, in a context where they are replacing the hundreds of nurses who are down with Covid. That is why they are working. The Minister can call what they are doing an educational placement - it is, in a certain sense, education - but he cannot deny that they are also working. They cannot engage in any other work and they must be paid, not exploited, for the work they are doing.
