RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The pre-condition for well-being of the people of this country is for them to have a secure, affordable roof over their heads. One of the standing scandals in that regard, besides the abysmal failure of the Government to deliver new public and affordable housing, is the inability to deal with the utter scandal of vacant and derelict properties the length and breadth of the country. They are sitting there torturing people who are actually in need of housing as they lie empty but could be used to house people impacted by the housing crisis. The measures that the Government has taken to deal with this have been self-evidently not working. The answers to a number of parliamentary questions - as the Taoiseach may have seen, they got some coverage in the newspapers in the last day or two - are pretty stark. There is now €14.3 million outstanding in vacant site charges. There is €7.9 million outstanding in derelict site levies. In 2020, €378,000 was collected in derelict site levies out of €5.4 million that was levied. On the vacant site levy, it is even worse, with €21,000 collected out of €11.8 million levied in just one year. Only seven councils sought to bother to impose the vacant site levy, and 14 councils did not bother to impose the derelict site levy at all. My question is very simple. First of all, judging from these figures, how is it that there is no serious intent whatsoever to actually pursue the vacant and derelict site levies? Is it not self-evidently the case that this is not enough? They are not working and we need much more radical measures, such as robust use of compulsory purchase orders, to get hold of vacant and empty buildings to use to address the housing crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will be meeting with European leaders in Versailles to discuss the impact, including the economic impacts, of the war in Ukraine.  Many people in Europe quietly want to use the war in Ukraine to boost up military spending and make our relationship to NATO a closer one and yet the Taoiseach uses excuses about Europe to say he can do nothing about rising fuel and energy costs because Europe would not allow it.  Europe is happy to co-ordinate on militarisation but not so happy to co-ordinate on protecting working people in Europe and in this country against the rising cost of fuel and energy which is going to immiserate them.  Should the Taoiseach not be going to Europe, as part of this European semester process, to say that we need radical emergency action and we want the licence to introduce controls on the price of energy and gas, and not just petrol and diesel?  What about gas, heating oil and all of the things that were immiserating people before the war in Ukraine and will do so to a greater extent as that war unfolds?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly what it is doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has been pushing to do this and now it is using the war as an excuse to do it again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We sell arms to some of these countries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been protesting about Putin long before the Taoiseach.  Our comrades are anti-war protestors in Putin’s prisons at the moment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach joking me?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are the ones selling arms to Saudi Arabia not warmongers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on. Give me a break.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is shocking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It sells arms to dictatorships like Saudi Arabia.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Considering the crippling increases people are seeing in the prices of petrol, diesel and, more generally, fuel and energy, the proposed measures are fairly pathetic. Taxi drivers, about whom I have talked to the Minister many times and who got very little during Covid, are a good example of how we are just going out of the Covid frying pan into the Ukrainian war fire, with its associated impact on ordinary people who have suffered a lot and will now suffer again because of the rising cost of fuel. The measure will go nowhere near compensating a group of people who have suffered massively over the past two years and got very little help. It is utterly piddling. For the people who, prior to the Ukrainian crisis, were reeling from the increases in the prices of home heating oil, electricity and gas, which have spiralled, the proposed measure does nothing at all. The prices are continuing to spiral. We were consistent at the beginning in saying what we think should be done. We were alone in saying it a few months ago but I note that others are now starting to agree with us. There are powers in the Consumer Protection Act 2007 that could be used. We have said this repeatedly and have been dismissed repeatedly, but maybe, finally, this idea will be listened to. The powers in the Act allow the Government, in abnormal circumstances, to declare an emergency in the supply of particular items and to control their maximum price. If this is not the abnormal circumstance envisaged in the legislation when it was drawn up in 2007, I really do not know what is. The abnormal circumstances were very much present even before the Ukrainian crisis because we saw multiple increases in the prices of gas, oil and electricity. Now, however, we have got another crisis on top of a crisis as a result of what is happening with Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine. The Minister's officials briefed me along with a couple of other Deputies a few days ago on the potential impact on inflation and they said something quite shocking. I said it in here a couple of times but it has not got much of a hearing. I was genuinely shocked when the officials said the projected inflation rate prior to the Ukrainian war, which according to the EU was 4.6% for the coming year, would have another 4% added to it. Therefore, the Minister's officials told us they project a near doubling of inflation. Inflation heading towards 9%, and maybe higher, is very serious. It is serious if it is even close to that. Against that background, the measure proposed is not enough and is pathetic. The Government should use the emergency powers available to it. It would be a matter of a stroke of a pen for it to introduce the maximum caps. The Minister says the goods are internationally traded but what is rather embarrassing for him to mention is that we get most of our gas from the Corrib field and can produce huge amounts of electricity ourselves, including renewable electricity and hydroelectricity. Owing to our decision to allow these to be traded at market prices and to give them away, in many cases to private companies, we are crucified. We do not have to be because we could nationalise them. We could take them back, run them on a not-for-profit basis and not sell them off to private developers or private energy companies that are willing to profiteer and are profiteering. That could be done on a European level. The Minister is going on and on about how great the European Union is and how it is now co-ordinating its actions in respect of Covid and the Ukrainian war. It seems we can do anything at this stage on an all-Europe basis. Is there any chance that the Minister, when meeting his European partners at the Versailles meeting to discuss the impact of the Ukraine crisis, might suggest to them that they could cap the price of energy and the profits being made by BP, Shell and all the rest of them, which profits have gone through the roof in the past year, even before the Ukrainian crisis, and which will go up more as a result of it? Shell's profits have risen in one year from €4.8 billion to €19 billion. It is incredible. BP's profits last year were the highest in eight years. It is making an absolute fortune. Another irony, which I do not have time to ponder in all this, concerns how much the military and militarisation, on which the Minister is now promoting further expenditure as a response to the crisis, contribute to the consumption of these scarce energy resources and the global warming that is choking the planet.Yet, the Government wants us to increase it more. Brown University in the US produced a report recently, pointing out that the biggest single source of greenhouse emissions in the world is the Pentagon. It is also the biggest single consumer of oil and petrol. As is the case in Europe or any of the big military powers, that vast majority of that is used to move troops and military forces around the place. Perhaps the Government could discuss how cutting back on militarisation and expenditure on war, weapons and armies might actually reduce the unnecessary consumption of fuel, reduce the damage being done to our environment and even make the world a slightly more peaceful place where we are not faced with the possibility of war in Europe.
