RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government will have pensioners afraid to turn on any appliances.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has stated that there is no question of the privatisation of water.  Given that commitment, what legislation will the Government bring forward to insulate the State from the requirements of EU law which necessitate that any revenue-producing monopoly must be subject to EU rules of competition and, therefore, deregulation and privatisation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, this is about legislation.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to copperfasten the Taoiseach's commitment that there will be no privatisation of water given EU law?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is to do with legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am simply asking what legislation will be brought forward.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not trying to bully anybody.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is very difficult to understand.  The Minister seems to be saying that a downgrading of growth projections does not have consequences in terms of likely increased austerity, and he seems to be very sanguine, if one likes, about the downgrading of growth projections.  Does the Minister accept that downgrading the growth projections has something to do with the extreme depression in the domestic economy resulting from the impact of austerity?  The Minister suggests that the key issue is what occurs in the rest of Europe and in our export markets and so on.  Is the point not that growth projections are now being downgraded because the same austerity is being imposed in those countries, shrinking the potential markets for our exports?  This appears to be confirmed by emerging figures for January and February which suggest that our trade surplus has reduced substantially in these months.  Are these not worrying indications that austerity is simply not working, that it will kill off growth and that it will require yet more austerity from the Minister and other Governments throughout Europe to meet their targets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the basis of what the Minister is telling us it is difficult not to see this entire negotiation and the debate around it as a complex accountancy trick to convince people that progress is being made on this issue when, in fact, very little is happening.  If I understood correctly, he said we do not have to borrow the €3.1 billion this year but that this will have an effect on our deficit to the tune of some €90 million.  Will the Minister clarify whether that is the consequence of this rather complex arrangement?  If our deficit is increased as a result, does this mean there will be a corresponding requirement for additional cuts in expenditure in order to meet our deficit target of €8.6 billion?  Setting that aside, does he accept that whatever deal he is pushing for will make absolutely no difference in terms of the austerity being imposed on ordinary people?  He is essentially confirming the Government's commitment to pay Anglo Irish Bank's €30.6 billion in gambling debts, plus interest, while merely expressing the hope that this interest, pending negotiations, will be somewhat reduced over time.  Not only has he confirmed the Government's intention to repay all of the bank's gambling debts but the period for which the Irish people will be subject to austerity, which is further enshrined in the fiscal compact, will be extended.  The reduction in our debt to GDP ratio which is required under the compact will be affected by the fact that this €3.1 billion is simply being kicked down the road.  Does the Minister accept there will be no let-up in austerity but instead an extension of the period of austerity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister's claim that we can cover the €90 million deficit increase as part of the swings and roundabouts of the budgetary position not slightly disingenuous?  He is saying on the one hand that there is no impact and, on the other, that there is an impact but it can be covered.  Another way of putting this is that we would have an extra €90 million if this were not done, which would necessitate fewer expenditure cuts.  This means that however the Minister frames it, come the next budget, €90 million less will be available for expenditure on public services and the people.  Furthermore, no matter how the Minister might construe it, will taking on this debt burden not have an extremely suffocating effect on the overall economy?  In the Minister's discussions with the troika, have its members given him an explanation to the question asked by Vincent Browne among others?  What justification, moral, economic or otherwise, have they given to the Minister for asserting the people of Ireland are obliged to pay back the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister even asked this question and has the troika given him an answer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was done by a discredited Government, which bankrupted the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will the Government know unless it asks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we take a hard line with the ECB?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Simply do not pay them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bring down their banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister seems to be basing his outlook on a defiance of gravity.  At some point, the revising downward of forecasts for growth - such revisions are pretty much universal at present - has an impact on actual growth.  The Minister appears to be stating that despite this and an analysis which he says he takes seriously and which projects a reduction in growth - this will eventually translate into a reduction in growth in our customer countries and in our economy - that growth is actually going to somehow continue here on foot of measures the Government is introducing.  However, the fiscal advisory council has stated that this is not going to happen and that regardless of what the Government does growth is going to slow down, both here and in our customer countries.  Is there not a sort of blind optimism on the Minister's part in respect of or a refusal to face what is clearly coming down the tracks?  I take the point that we cannot solve matters on our own but does this not prompt him and European leaders to question the entire policy that is being pursued?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why then sign a treaty that will prevent us from participating in demand-led initiatives?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Donnelly and Halligan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One must spare a laugh for the last contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is ironic that the Government was visited by the vice president of the Chinese dictatorship, which is brutally suppressing democracy and civil rights, and it is putting out the begging bowl to that regime while willing to disregard the rights of the mass of Chinese people suffering under that dictatorship.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is appalling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am against the Chinese dictatorship.  Is the Deputy against it?  He is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He should spare me his nonsense about a concern for democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This fiscal treaty is based on dishonesty and stupidity.  The dishonesty comes from opinion on the causes of the crisis in the first place, which it is claimed the treaty is trying to address.  Any honest assessment of the beginnings of the crisis would indicate that the European Central Bank's interest rate policy of pumping cheap money into the peripheral countries, with a mantra of competition and deregulation of financial markets, were two major causes.  This treaty does not address such issues at all and instead the compact is dictated by precisely the ECB and EU authorities who promoted the policies that caused the crisis.  It is also being promoted by political parties, such as Labour, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who told us during the debates on the Lisbon treaty that we should vote for those changes because they would give us jobs and economic stability.  It was precisely the policies of the ECB as set out in those treaties and the policies of deregulation of markets, including unrestrained competition in those markets, that led directly to the crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This treaty continues with the same failed doctrine and dogma which is being promoted by the bodies which told us the untruths that led to such disastrous consequences.  There is a major issue of credibility for the people on the "Yes" side who told us all those untruths during the debates on the Nice and Lisbon treaty debates, including the European authorities, the ECB or the political parties, such as Labour, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We opposed the last treaty because we knew and clearly stated that it would produce the crisis that it subsequently did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The dishonesty continues with the German Finance Minister who said, in trying to promote this treaty, that it is undisputed among economists worldwide that one of the main causes, if not the main cause, of the turbulence not just now but in 2008 was excessive public debt everywhere in the world.  Is that true?  The Minister knows it is not, and the figures bear it out, especially in Ireland's case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In 2003, Irish central Government debt to GDP was 34%; in 2004 and 2005 it was 33%; and in 2006 and 2007 it was 29%.  That is almost half of the debt to GDP ratio demanded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will have a chance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is he telling us untruths?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not excessive debt or deficits that caused the crisis.  They are now telling us that these were the causes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have quoted him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister accepts this.  Why are we bringing in a treaty focusing on those issues rather than the actual causes of the economic crisis?  In order to pay back bankers, speculators, German and French banks and bondholders, we must meet deficit and debt targets; it is to recover gambling losses at our expense.  The consequences will be devastating if we must meet these targets.  After we get out of the troika programme, we will need approximately €6 billion in austerity cuts and measures, and if this fiscal compact kicks in by 2015, we will need approximately 5% cuts in spending annually for four years in order to meet targets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will have devastating consequences for our economy.  The Deputies opposite do not like the truth or the facts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All of these cuts will be dictated by the European Commission if we step outside the targets.  The Commission will dictate timescales and the size of cuts.  They are unelected bureaucrats who caused the crisis in the first place.  The Government wants to give them power to dictate the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a disaster.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have stopped the bubble economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy would want to work on his maths.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are enlightening them.
