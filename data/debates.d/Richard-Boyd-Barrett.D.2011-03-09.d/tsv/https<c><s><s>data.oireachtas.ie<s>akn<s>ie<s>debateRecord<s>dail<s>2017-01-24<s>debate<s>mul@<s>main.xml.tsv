RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a point of order, the next set of questions is actually about the question we have just been dealing with. There is no need to extend the previous session.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In these negotiations, there is a big difference between asking and telling. Frankly, I do not think we should be asking. People in Ireland, Britain, in the North and in the South of this island say they want to maintain the common travel area. It should simply be told to the European Union that that is going to be the situation and that we are not accepting anything less than that. I believe we should say the same thing about any question of reimposing a hard Border between North and South. It is just not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have an unacceptably high level of low-paid workers, the second highest in the OECD. That is bad enough. The Minister's failure to do anything about low-hour contracts compounds it. What makes it even worse is that people who are on low-hour contracts and might be entitled to FIS often cannot get it, given that employers will not fill out the Part 8 form. The lone parents group, Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, has asked the Minister to get rid of the form and allow for other ways for workers on low-hour contracts to prove they were working and fit the criteria for FIS payments. I am asking the Minister again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's answer does not address the issue I raised. As SPARK made clear to the Minister at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, many employers of employees on low-hour contracts will not sign these forms. People have come to my clinic to make the same point. The forms require employers to indicate that somebody works a minimum of 19 hours per week. Low-hour contract employers should be banned. However, given that the Minister will not ban them, they will not fill in a form in which they commit to employing people for 19 hours per week. Consequently, people who are entitled to FIS and who desperately need it given that they are on low-hour contracts and on low pay, cannot get FIS. The Minister needs to do away with the Part 8 form and allow for another mechanism by which these workers can demonstrate that they fit the criteria of working the hours required. The three-month rule is a problem. Given the precarious nature of their employment, many of these workers will not necessarily fit into the rule. The jobseeker's allowance payment available to people who work three days does nothing for workers on low-hour contracts who work four or five days but might work only four hours per day. They cannot get jobseeker's allowance and, if their employers will not fill out the form, they cannot get FIS. The problem must be addressed for the sake of low-paid workers, many of them women, who need income support.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would. If employers are not willing to fill it out, then people entitled to the payment are not able to get it. There are other ways in which employees could prove entitlement, such as the use of payslips and so on, which would allow them to demonstrate they have been working. There is a three-month or more requirement. The Minister could have the option for it to be weekly, fortnightly or monthly assessed, where employers might be more willing. For example, an employer could state the person worked for a week for the required 19 hours or for the required hours in a month, because they might be reluctant to commit themselves for the year. Of course, that is a separate issue as employers should not have people on these low-hour precarious contracts. Given the Minister has not banned these practices, there should be some mechanism which allows employees to prove in another way that they fit the criteria. Alternatively, we could change the assessment to allow it to be done on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, where the employer might be more willing to sign the form stating this person worked the required hours over a period.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That abuse goes on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to share time with Deputy Mick Barry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty and his Sinn FÃ©in colleagues for tabling the motion. As previous speakers said, it is scandalous that significant numbers of families lost their homes because of the practice of multiple banks to fail to give them the tracker rates to which they were entitled. It is shocking that the banks moved against these families on the basis of their inability to pay mortgage rates they should not have had to pay. As we have heard, immeasurable anxiety and hardship were needlessly suffered by over 11,000 families, perhaps up to 15,000, in these circumstances. The measures being proposed in the motion are absolutely correct and I support them fully. People need compensation and redress. The investigation has to be concluded and the banks that acted in this manner need to be held to account. We need to get to the bottom of how all of this happened in the first place and ensure it will not happen again. There must be severe penalties for financial institutions that can impose this needless suffering. As I said, I agree completely with the motion. I do not have the same expertise on this issue as Deputies Pearse Doherty and Michael McGrath who have been following it at committee level, but I cannot help having an enormous sense of frustration that all of this has been done by the financial institutions we bailed out. This is one of multiple wrongs these banks have done to mortgage holders and the more general population as a result of what happened in 2008, which resulted from their greed for profit. It is difficult not to conclude that the immoral greed for profit of these institutions which propelled the entire economy over the cliff almost a decade ago is also the reason this specific issue has arisen. Even now, eight years on, up to 15,000 families are suffering needlessly. The Central Bank has still not got to the bottom of the matter and the Government is standing idly by. It is allowing the issue to drag on, while the suffering continues. I cannot help feeling extraordinary frustration about the Government's failure to act as we suggested when the crash hit. Many mortgage holders are still in mortgage arrears and being threatened with repossession as a result of the Government's refusal to nationalise the banks we bailed out. Rather than taking control of the banks we bailed out which are continuing to inflict this suffering, the Minister is standing back and saying it is the responsibility of the Central Bank to act and that he can do nothing about the commercial activities of the banks.  I agree 100% with the motion. Frankly, everything that has happened in this case and more generally makes clear the need to fundamentally change the banking model and take banks into proper public ownership.
