RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot of questions have been asked. I refer to amendment No. 52 and to amendment No. 61 in particular, which also relates to directives. I note that we now have policy statements, guidelines and directives. Before all of that, we have plans. I am trying to understand the relationship between these different things and the precise hierarchy and relationship between them. It is fair to say that with all these different mechanisms for dictating by the Minister - because the Minister has the power to do these things - there seems to be a lot of power and many different avenues provided by the Minister to change things as they as move along. As we will see in the next grouping, there is a requirement to comply with these policy statements, guidelines, and directives, if I understand correctly. We have sought to delete line 35 in the subsequent group of amendments that we will deal with shortly. These mechanisms will be available to the Minister to direct and to give guidelines, that is, issue instructions and give the Minister a hell of a lot of power. One would worry about that sort of arbitrary power being given to the Minister. While we may have great confidence in the Minister of State sitting here in the room with us, who knows what sort of Minister we might have in the future. Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point is important as well. Rightly and understandably, there is a huge need to address the climate crisis but the biodiversity crisis is not mentioned as often. In fact, when one thinks about it deeply enough, a collapse in ecosystems could probably damage our ability to sustain our existence on this planet sooner than climate change. The collapse of whole ecosystems could have disastrous and unknown consequences, because everything is connected. We all depend on these interconnected chains called ecosystems. The marine, marine life and marine biology are all critical to our existence on this planet. There is a lot at stake, therefore. By requiring public consultation on all of these things, we are ensuring that it will not just be a hell of a lot of power concentrated in the hands of a single Minister but that everybody, including all stakeholders and society generally ,would have a voice in this. The Minister would have to meet many checks and balances in the objectives in developing the marine. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to be nice in what I say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State knows quite well that we are not talking about typos and that our concern is that guidelines which could have a real, substantial and material impact should be subject to a requirement for public consultation. It is a similar idea with directives. I am looking at this stuff and trying to get my head around it. There are some people watching this and trying to get their heads around it. It would be useful for the Minister of State to give some examples of what these cases might be. What would a policy statement, guideline or directive look like? That is so we can understand exactly what we are talking about. It seems that guidelines are pretty important and that a directive is also pretty important. If they are going to have a substantial impact on marine planning and development, it is absolutely reasonable to ensure the public can have its say. That should not in any way take us outside compliance with directives and other elements that protect the marine environment and public interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State did not respond to the point I raised on the relationship between statements, directives and guidelines. Nor did he give some instances so that we understand what we are talking about. People listening to this will just go-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case, the Minister of State should give us an instance of a guideline. Give us an example of the sort of guideline that might be issued so that we know what we are talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order and with all due respect, we are trying to get to the bottom of what a guideline is. This section is dealing with guidelines and our amendments refer to the importance of setting out the need, explicitly, for public consultation on guidelines. It is entirely relevant in that context for people, including me as somebody who is supposed to be scrutinising this legislation, to be absolutely clear what exactly we are talking about when we talk about guidelines and what the difference is between a guideline, a directive and a policy statement. It is absolutely a legitimate question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is precisely the point I was trying to make earlier. The Minister of State's answer to the distinction between guidelines and directives was that the former set general parameters and that where there are specific objectives, there is a directive. Section 7(3) refers to "specific marine planning policy requirements". That sounds like a directive with which compliance is required. I do not see what the difference is between that and the directives in the section we will deal with later. It definitely does not sound like a guideline.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the amendments try to ensure the Oireachtas and its committees are fully alerted to any guidelines or directives being developed; the individual Members of the Oireachtas and committees have the right to put forward resolutions on those and any such guidelines have to be voted on by both Houses and there is full notification of the public and the Oireachtas on all of these. As for my suggestion, on which the Minister of State seemed to look somewhat favourably the last time, in addition to what we have proposed in these amendments about newspapers and other forms of publications, one can take it as a standing request from me to consider radio ads for all of these things. When we are discussing the notification of the public, we need to think about other means of getting over the fact the public just do not know. They do not see these newspaper ads and so on. The point is to let everybody in the Oireachtas and the public know; ensure the Oireachtas votes on it and has input into these guidelines and directives and the public is aware of them and has opportunities to make its views known. That is the logic of these amendments and they are reasonable suggestions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or even a provision whereby it would be open to the Dáil to ask for a debate and for the issue to be decided. There may be matters that do not require this but directives and guidelines should, at a minimum, be discussed by a committee. There are matters that the Business Committee is happy to have a committee deal with, while there are others regarding which it is not satisfied to have a committee alone deal in the belief that they need to be discussed and passed by the Dáil. Sometimes it is agreed, even by the Government, that there are matters of great enough significance to warrant that, but it is not required as a matter of course. The Department and Minister of State should consider that. We are in new planning territory. We are trying to build a planning and development regime from scratch in an area where there was nothing. There is a need for checks and balances when starting from scratch in respect of an important area, the maritime area, and we must ensure that we do not make the mistakes that were made on land in the past. The checks and balances we are requiring a reasonable. If our proposals are a little over the top or onerous in the view of the Minister of State, could we make provision for at least a committee to have some role and afford the Dáil the possibility of debating these matters and, where necessary, resolutions, when it deems it important?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate what the Minister of State is saying and that he is taking on board our concerns. It is rare enough for me to praise the Government, but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The new thing that we have had in recent years of Government of Ireland announcements on the radio has been helpful in alerting people to things that are happening, because many people in this country listen to the radio. I appreciate that the area of communications and media is a rapidly evolving one and that we must be open enough to ensure that we are speaking to all the relevant demographics and constituencies that access their information through different media. Those radio advertisements have certainly been helpful. We will consider what the Minister of State said before Report Stage regarding how we could make suggestions then, but hopefully the Minister of State will take on board what we are saying as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To summarise, the points have been made on the policy statement, the guidelines and the directives. The Minister of State's response, essentially, is to say that this is dealt with in section 31, and that our concerns around the public consultation, the screening for strategic environmental assessments, SEAs, and the compliance with all of the relevant directives are dealt with in section 31. There is no point in repeating ourselves, but I believe that we need to look to see if we are completely happy that it is all covered off under section 31. That is probably the job we have to do between now and Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not saying I agree. I am listening and I am going to digest what the Minister of State is saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hear the Minister of State's argument that section 31 covers off all of our concerns, and this then applies to all of the things we have talked about including the statements, the directives, the guidelines. I see that we are coming up to another aspect which is a "direction". It should be very interesting to debate what is the difference between a directive and a direction, but we will move on to that one. The Minister of State's argument is to repeat these endlessly for each different stage and step and part of this process. I do not quite see why the Minister of State used the word "inoperable". The Minister of State might just say "unnecessary". I am not quite sure how the amendment would make the Bill inoperable. Perhaps the Minister of State will explain why it makes it inoperable. Surely the Minister of State is saying that it is not necessary because it is all covered under section 31. If everything we are looking for is under section 31, it is there already and what we are proposing is superfluous. This is what I thought I heard the Minister of State saying and now-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State clarify from what point of view does it not work? Is it the point of view of coherent legislation or the point of view of actually-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree. To clarify our question, why would the Government list in section 31, as it has done, the birds and habitats directives but not the marine spatial planning framework directive?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get that. Let us say we conceded-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, there is a history in this country of non-compliance with certain directives. Let us not say that because directives exist Ministers and Governments comply with them because that is simply not true. We know there have been failures to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but there have been failures to transpose and failures to comply with directives. We have suffered big fines and there have been big oversights with respect to real things that have happened in the real world. There were subsequent acknowledgements we messed up and failed to comply. Some of these issues are outstanding. This is not a small matter. I understand the marine spatial planning framework directive is referred to in the Schedule. I get that. Let us say we concede the Minister of State is correct - I am not saying we are at this stage but we hear him - and there is no need to repeat endlessly the need to comply with everything as it is covered anyway. We are asking why, if it is all covered in section 31, would the Government not have that list once in section 31, which includes the reference to the other directives alongside the ones it has put in there, namely those on birds and habitats. That is a fair question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a related question. This gets to the nub of it. If we got clarity on this we could move through this Bill much more quickly. Is it correct that these directives would require that before consents for development are given, the directives are fully complied with, which is what Europe wants, and then we can move to the issue of applications, consents, enforcement and all the rest of it but in the first instance we must have a plan, which must be compliant with the various directives? Rightly or wrongly, we have a concern that there may be development consents given where those plans are not fully in place. In particular, the relevant projects could get consents when plans are not in place. How would that stand in respect of the directives? That is one of our central concerns and one of the central concerns of people looking in here. If we could get clarity, it would help. Have people reason to be concerned? The ideal would be to have the marine plan, which is similar to a development plan. We know what can be done here and there and people will only be allowed do things in those places. Once this is up and running fully that might be the way it is going to be but in advance of that people do not necessarily have to be subject to a plan. If that is the case then that is our concern. Clarity on that would help us a lot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A framework is not a plan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A framework is vaguer than a plan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect, it is an advance on nothing. It is an advance on the Foreshore Act, yes. I fully accept that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fully accepted. However, it is still not as specific as a DMAP or another plan with an acronym might be. Therefore, there is more flexibility for things to happen than there might be under a more specific plan. There is a difference between a framework and a DMAP. I am concerned that, if someone can get a development consent on the basis of a fairly general framework, it will be an easier threshold for a developer to pass than a DMAP or a more specific spatial plan under which we had decided that an area was protected, developers could do something in another area, etc. The framework does not go to that level of detail, yet we are envisaging that we will have plans that are that specific. Indeed, good and sustainable planning requires that level of specificity. This is the nub of our concerns.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Minister of State is saying seems reasonable but I would like some clarification. Is he envisaging the possibility that an illegal decision that might be taken in Europe about compliance with a particular directive might not be covered off in the policy statement because it is new?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a matter of interest, does that imply the necessity to review the policy statement subsequently?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It essentially implies a review of the policy statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe my question was answered on Second Stage - I cannot remember - but why are we so far behind everyone else in terms of marine protected areas? How does the rest of Europe have so many more marine protected areas? Is there a reason for that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That did not quite answer my question. I am genuinely asking for an explanation. This is not a critique of the Minister of State, as his is a new Government, but I am curious. Perhaps the officials know the answer. How are we so far behind in terms of marine protected areas?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I get a brief explanation on what subsection (2) means?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is all I wanted to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This applies to licences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is planning permission. It does not in any way relate to the surveying activities.
