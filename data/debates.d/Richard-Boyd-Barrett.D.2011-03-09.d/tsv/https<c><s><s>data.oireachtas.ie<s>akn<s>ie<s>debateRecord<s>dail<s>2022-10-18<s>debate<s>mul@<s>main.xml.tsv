RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not good.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has been dragged kicking and screaming into introducing an eviction ban.It is still not clear from what the Taoiseach has said - from the wording he has articulated - whether people who have current notices to quit will be protected. If they are not, his proposal is almost useless, frankly. Will he clarify that those who have current notices to quit, who may be overholding and have nowhere to go, and who are facing the imminent prospect of homelessness will be protected by the ban he is introducing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the case that anybody who has a notice to quit now will be evicted?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody else is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did listen. Everybody is trying to understand what the Taoiseach is saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People facing evictions deserve clarity from the Taoiseach. We have asked three questions today and we still do not have clarity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to get a straight answer from the Taoiseach and I would appreciate one. The Government would have had to vote on the Solidarity-People Before Profit eviction ban Bill next week but now it has announced that it will bring in an eviction ban. The situation is still not clear, however, and I ask the Taoiseach to please clarify it. I have been contacted by families for whom this is a very important matter. They have received notices to quit before the date of the legislation coming in. Will they be protected from eviction over the next few months? Furthermore, as a matter of policy, will local authorities be told to purchase the homes of people who are threatened with eviction? If that is the case, will the homes of people threatened with eviction who are over the social housing income thresholds be purchased as well?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So those who get notices to quit beforehand will not be covered. Can the Taoiseach just clarify this, for God's sake?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will not give a straight answer. It is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the people who have notices to quit be covered - "Yes" or "No"? It is a simple question. The answer is "No".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Jesus Christ.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just looking for an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am still trying to get an answer out of the Taoiseach on question relating to the eviction ban. I do not understand why he will not give a straight answer. Will he please tell me if people who have current notices to quit, prior to the legislation he is promising being brought in, will be protected from eviction over the winter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just so it is clear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach clarify whether it is now policy, one that we have been asking for for two years, that the Government will purchase homes where families are threatened with being evicted into homelessness? The Government should go further and proactively purchase developer projects where new houses are coming on stream so that we can get more than 10% for social and affordable housing as well as purchase sites, which should never have been sold off by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, for the delivery of social and affordable housing, given that the Government's Housing for All targets are failing catastrophically. Will the protections for tenants generally apply to those above the housing income thresholds, which the Government has refused to raise?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Were the tenants in situ?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were calling for it for a long time and the Government ignored it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not happening in my area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of people who are paying multiple tariffs on gas and energy and are on district heating systems compared with those who are being massively ripped off on conventional contracts with energy companies, what will the Government do? For example, I met tenants from the new and much-trumpeted cost rental development on Enniskerry Road. They were delighted to get cost rental apartments, only to be shocked to discover that they are paying a tariff that is about four times what everybody else is paying and, as we know, everybody else is being ripped off on energy prices. People are looking at bills of €600 that are unpayable and they are also on pay-as-you-go contracts. This is a real concern for them. What will the Government do to make sure that people who are on district heating systems will not be paying tariffs that are multiples of the rip-off prices everybody else is already paying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just come from UCD, where the first person I met was a lecturer who said how worried she is about the college's ability to retain and recruit PhD students because of the financial pressures they are under. I was at Trinity College for the student walkout organised by the Union of Students in Ireland the other day. I met undergraduates who were furious that effectively nothing has been done for them in the budget. I met postgraduates. This week, I met psychology students. Some are funded, some are not, and all of them said that it is nearly impossible for them to complete their studies because of the financial pressures they are under. What will the Minister do for students?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Government did was a drop in the ocean. It is telling that we had some of the biggest student protests for a long time after the budget. They were not happy. I am relaying what those students expressed to me. Some PhD students get no stipends. Some get miserable stipends of a few grand. Even those who get €18,000 have to work all the hours that God sends. They find it difficult to study or they have to have a second job, which makes it almost impossible for them to complete their studies. A lecturer who used to lecture me in UCD said they are worried about UCD's ability to recruit and retain postgraduate students. That is serious when we have chronic skills shortages in a number of areas across our society and public services. We are making it extremely difficult for people to get postgraduate degrees, to do doctorates and so on. That is the point. We now have increasing numbers of students saying they will just leave the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still think the Minister is missing the reason they are protesting and why they are so angry. People who are on poverty stipends, who have no stipends, educational psychologists who have no funding and clinical psychologists who have a little funding are on such low incomes that they have been doubly hammered in real terms by the cost of living and the housing crisis. It is becoming unbearable for them. What they got in the budget was a drop in the ocean. It does not compensate for how much worse things have got for them over the last year and a half, particularly with the low incomes they have. I am telling the Minister that we have to get rid of the fees for postgraduate students. It makes no sense to put financial barriers in the way of people reaching their maximum potential in education. Why are we still putting up barriers, making it difficult and putting them in a situation from which many drop out or then decide to leave the country?
