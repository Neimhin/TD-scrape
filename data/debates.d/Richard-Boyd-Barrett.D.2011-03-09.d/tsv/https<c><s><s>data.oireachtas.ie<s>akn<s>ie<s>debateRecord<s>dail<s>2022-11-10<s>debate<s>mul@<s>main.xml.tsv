RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have in front of me a litany of complaints from local constituents over bus services in their area. There are horror stories about the failure of buses to turn up at all or on time, in particular Go-Ahead buses. We have had similar complaints at the transport committee, at which Go-Ahead and Dublin Bus appeared today. I put it to the Minister very simply that the reason this is happening is the inability of bus companies to recruit and retain bus workers. That is because the pay and conditions for bus workers are so poor and because of the pressure of competitive tendering imposed by the NTA, the Minister and successive of Ministers for Transport.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even the WHO has said that being a bus driver is one of the most stressful jobs. I think it is the third most stressful job you can have. With traffic congestion in Dublin and so on, that is made even worse. Competitive tendering is creating a race to the bottom and Go-Ahead Ireland is the worst offender. It haemorrhaged bus drivers over the last year because pay and, particularly, conditions, including lack of work-life balance and long shifts, were so bad. That is also causing problems for Dublin Bus. When Dublin Bus workers rejected by 85% an attempt to further deteriorate their conditions, work-life balance and shifts, what was the main selling point of the company in trying to ram that deal down their throat? It was the need to compete with Go-Ahead Ireland. That is what they said. Go-Ahead Ireland is leading the race to the bottom. Competitive tendering and privatisation are creating the conditions where bus drivers do not want to join these companies. People do not want to be bus drivers because the pay, conditions, work-life balance and shifts are so flipping awful. That has to be addressed and privatisation is an obstacle to that. Go-Ahead Ireland exacerbates it and the ordinary user of bus services faces the horror stories I have in front of me concerning the 175, the 17, the 75 and the 114 not turning up, turning up hours late and so on.
