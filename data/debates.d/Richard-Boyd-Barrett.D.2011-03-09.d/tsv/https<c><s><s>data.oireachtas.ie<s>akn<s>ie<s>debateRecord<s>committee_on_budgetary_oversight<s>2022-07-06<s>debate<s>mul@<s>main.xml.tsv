By the way, I commend the ESRI on its recent housing reports. I know it was a different team of people but they are very useful analyses of what is going on with the housing situation. We in People Before Profit are of the view that we should control some of the prices of things that have increased very substantially; food and energy being two Dr. McQuinn cited as having seen disproportionately high increases, which are really hammering families and, as he pointed out, the less well-off in particular. We have seen very significant increases in other areas, however. Of course, even before this inflationary spiral we are seeing now, perhaps Dr. McQuinn could comment on this, it seems fairly clear that the cost of many things people depend on was already higher in Ireland than it was in most of the rest of Europe. Our energy prices and childcare costs are considerably higher than the average in Europe. Our house prices and rents are very considerably higher and have seen much more dramatic increases over quite a long period than the rest of Europe. Why would we not, therefore, try to control the price of some of these things, particularly if the ESRI seems to be suggesting that this inflationary spiral may be temporary? The ESRI seems to be saying the supply chain bottlenecks related to Covid-19 and then the sudden bounceback of the economy and the Ukraine crisis. Those are both kind of temporary things. If it is temporary, why would it not be a good idea, which we think it is, to control some of these prices now and set maximum prices on certain things in order that we do not get a continuation of the inflationary spiral? If there is concern that people will start to put in wage demands, for example, that would, to use Dr. McQuinn's term, reinforce inflation, would it not it be entirely logical to try to actually control some the key areas in which we have seen prices go through the roof to prevent that inflationary spiral being perpetuated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is in effect what we are doing. Does that not mean that we are chasing inflation and reinforcing the spiral? The ESRI paper from about a month ago identified the fact that the failure to raise the income thresholds for social housing is denying housing assistance support to people who should have it and would have in the past on the incomes they are earning. I agree that, in the immediate term, they should get those supports, but does it not mean we are chasing inflation? Rather than controlling the price of housing and rent, we are perpetuating or reinforcing the inflationary spiral. To me, it would be far preferable to control the prices. The witnesses refer to distorting the market but are we not dealing with market failures? Rent and housing is clearly a market failure. Some people may say - and I think it is possible but am not sure if the current Government's policies will achieve it - that at some point we should be able to address that market failure by building enough houses. In the interim, if the choice to deal with the crisis that situation has produced is between chasing extortionately high levels of rent and house prices or controlling them until we get the supply right, surely controlling is a better option. On energy, I take the witnesses' point that at European level they should do it. There is profiteering going on. If they can organise sanctions at European level, they should be able to organise controlling energy prices, though there is not much sign they are willing to do it. The French have put a ceiling of 4% on energy price increases. They are not worried about it. Is that not a reasonable response, rather than forking out huge amounts of money chasing excessively high prices?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think we agree we should increase investment on direct construction of public and affordable housing. I am specifically thinking of rents, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Right, sorry. Just specifically on rents, I believe people who should be entitled to the housing assistance payment are currently not, as the ESRI paper suggested; however, that payment is not the ideal way to address the problem. Would it not be better if the rents were lower and we could control them so did not have to spend as much on subsidising rents?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On wages and incomes, the witness alluded to the danger of potentially reinforcing the inflationary spiral. I hope he would agree that it is clear that wage demands or increased social welfare or pension payments have not created this crisis. They are lagging well behind the rises in the cost of living. At present, workers, pensioners, students and everybody except the corporations, which are doing very well, have seen income cuts in real terms. If income and pay increases do not at least keep pace with the cost of inflation, is there not a danger that this would be more damaging to the economy? I am not suggesting that there should be pay or income increases way beyond the rate of inflation, but is it not the right thing to do and in the interest both of alleviating hardship and also not damaging the economy, particularly the domestic economy, to ensure that incomes and wages keep pace with inflation? If they do not, as is currently the case, there will be less purchasing power and that will hit the domestic economy and potentially tip us into recession.
