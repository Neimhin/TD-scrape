RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking whether the Minister of State will consider bringing in more serious penalties and excluding contractors who do work paid for out of the public purse through public procurement or contracts where those companies are found to have been substandard, negligent in their work or engaged in fraudulent behaviour. I am thinking of issues like schools that were built in a substandard fashion without proper fire safety measures, bogus self-employment on public contracts and, we may discover, the outsourcing of cervical smears.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask whether companies found to be guilty of those sort of failings should be excluded from further public contracts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That looks good on paper, but is it happening? For example, I remind the Minister of State about Western Building Systems and the company that built 31 schools. A report into fire safety issues resulting from substandard building in an audit of five schools initially, which we were supposed to have had by now, revealed they were found to be fire safety defective. A report was to be prepared on all the other schools built by Western Building Systems, but I do not believe it has been produced, even though it was promised we would have it by now. I do not know if this has come into the public domain yet but Western Building Systems built a college of further education in Whitehall as long as ten years ago that is lying empty as we speak while homeless families are being accommodated in police stations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extraordinary that such companies are still being awarded public contracts. All firms that were found to have been involved in bogus self-employment arrangements, such as the JJ Rhatigan dispute----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think this is happening and that there is proper enforcement of this. The Office of Government Procurement and the Minister of State should be putting pressure on the relevant Departments to ensure this happens. I mention Western Building Systems, which built a school in Whitehall that I understand has been sitting empty for perhaps a decade because it is structurally unsound. We then discovered that five of the schools it built were fire defective. We are then told there will be a report into the other 30 schools it built. That report was promised in September to be out in six months but it is not out. All of this suggests to me that there is not a seriousness about getting to the bottom of why companies in receipt of public money are doing substandard work. We are not bothered to look into it and we are not excluding them from further public contracts. I mentioned bogus self employment. We hear the advertisements at the moment, and it is good the Government is raising the issue, but there have been widespread examples of contractors doing work for the State where they were found to have been, as in the case of Rhatigans, engaged in bogus self employment.
