RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their contributions. I ask them not to take my comments personally. I know they are mandated in a particular way. I am one of the people who voted against the LDA to whom Deputy McAuliffe referred. I am very concerned about the announcement today and about particular elements of Mr. O'Rourke's opening statement in that he referred repeatedly to cost rental and affordable housing on public land. He made no reference to social housing other than previous work with approved housing bodies. This confirms my worst suspicion that Government policy, and not the LDA's agenda, is essentially that cost rental will replace differential rents and traditional council housing. This worries me. Cost rental will be based on the costs of construction, if I understand it correctly although it has still not been fully fleshed out and anything the witnesses can say to flesh out further what it will mean in terms of rent would be helpful. Certainly in the examples I have seen so far the rents are far in excess of what they would be for a council house where it is linked to income. It is approximately 15% of income. The cost rental delivered on Enniskerry Road in my area is €1,200 a month. This is completely unaffordable for many individual workers in particular. I am very concerned. All of the lands identified in the appendix are public lands. There is a substitution effect, for want of a better phrase. Even if the agency is not, as others have referred to, grabbing land off the local authorities there is a substitution effect. We have been campaigning for 16 years to get public housing on the Shanganagh site and there still has not been a sod turned. Only some of it will be differential rent council housing, which is traditional council housing.The rest of it will be cost rental. We do not know what that will be but it will be certainly be more expensive than traditional council housing. There will also be affordable housing. The key difference here is that the two latter categories, which the LDA mentions repeatedly, are linked in one way or another to market conditions. Mr. O’Rourke kind of made reference to that in his speech when he said we need strategies to deal with it. However, given construction cost inflation, do we not have a big reason to be concerned both about the LDA’s ability to deliver, given that it is outsourcing or tendering out, and about what the actual end cost will be and, consequently, the rents that will be charged? Is there not good reason to be concerned about those matters? A co-operative housing project in Loughlinstown collapsed because the preferred tenderer said it could not deliver because of rising construction costs. It now has to be tendered out again. Our view, in that context, is that the strategy to deal with that is to have a State construction company. I would much rather if the LDA was a State construction company, which was not dependent on a difficult public procurement tendering process, when construction costs, as Mr. O’Rourke alluded to, are heading upwards and there is significant volatility in that area. I would like the witnesses to address that. We are now looking at a mandate to take large swathes of public land and whereas previously, we would have delivered differential rent in traditional council housing, we will now have a regime of so-called affordability in which rents will be much higher than traditional council rents. As I said, there are also serious concerns about rising construction costs, the LDA’s vulnerability to market conditions and, ultimately, the vulnerability of either the renters or purchasers to rising costs. This is because the house price or, in the case of the cost-rental housing, the rents will be linked to market conditions in some shape or form. I would be interested to hear the LDA’s response to that. Will the LDA explain the delay with the Shanganagh site? Why is there a delay? We were told the Shanganagh project would be on site by the end of 2021. It is still not on site. What is the delay? At what stage exactly is the project? Can we be sure that the covenant for 200 social, 200 cost-rental and 100 purchase homes will be rigorously maintained? Will social will mean "social" in the traditional sense of council housing, with rents of that type? All the sites the LDA identifies in the schedule are public sites. It states it is also assembling privately-owned land that is not being developed but should be developed. Will it name those sites? How much work is being done in that area? That is a big area and I would prefer if the LDA was doing more of that and letting the local authorities develop public land. To what extent will the LDA go after private land that is being hoarded or sat on and should be developed for public and affordable housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To follow on from Deputy Gould's question and my own earlier question, I am worried about the levels of rent in cost rental. The statement Mr. O’Rourke made about 75% being what the LDA will deliver as cost rental concerns me, as I said. This is land that, if it was developed under the old model, would be 100% income-based rent, based on the differential rental scheme. This is not for the LDA and it is Government policy, but there is a substitution effect where land that used to be available to everybody on a differential rent basis will now be more expensive and it will be cost rental. However, what will that cost rental rent look like? Mr. O’Rourke is saying that the Government will decide that and the LDA will do its best to make it as affordable as possible, and how cheap it can make it will depend on Government support and so on. I am not clear what that adds up to. To be concrete about it, can Mr. O’Rourke at this stage tell us what the cost-rental rents will be in Shanganagh, the first site on the LDA’s list and the one that is closest to starting? It is still not clear to me precisely when it is going to start. He might be able to tell us precisely when it is going to start and precisely why there are still delays on the original commencement which, as I understood it, was supposed to begin in 2021. Can he tell us, even at this stage, what the rents will be for cost rental in Shanganagh? Can he tell us anything about what the prices under affordable purchase will be in Shanganagh? As he will be aware, our concern is that, given they are linked to local market conditions and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown now has the highest house prices in the entire country at €590,000, even a 30% or 40% reduction on that would still be completely unaffordable for people. Is there anything he can tell us to give us comfort that cost rental is not going to be a very considerable mark-up on what we would have got if we had just built social housing there, and that the affordable housing will actually be affordable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to tell Mr. O’Rourke the average house price is €590,000. It is shocking. I know he is from the area. As a supplementary question, I understand the agency is bound by its mandate but Mr. O’Rourke’s answer is very revealing and, frankly, alarming. I do not blame him for that but it really is alarming. We have the biggest and only large development site planned, it is the first one on the LDA's list and we have been fighting for 15 years to get public housing on it, yet we still do not have an answer on when it is starting and we do not know what the affordable rents will be or what the prices will be. I genuinely do not blame Mr. O’Rourke but I blame the Government. That is worrying. It is not a great start.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps Mr. O’Rourke or Mr. Coleman will comment on it. This really is the truth about cost rental, namely, we cannot control the rents for cost rental on public land. We cannot control them because they are linked to the cost of construction and the LDA does not know what the cost of construction is going to be and it is dependent on the market to dictate that. That is a fundamental break from social housing. We can tell what the rent in social housing will be. Regardless of market conditions, we can say the rent will be 15% of a person's income, whatever their income is. Now, we are unrolling 75% of public land under the remit of the LDA where we will not be able to tell. Unless there is something Mr. O’Rourke can add to this, what he seems to be saying is that the LDA will not be able to tell us what the rents will be and that the market will dictate it. That is worrying.
