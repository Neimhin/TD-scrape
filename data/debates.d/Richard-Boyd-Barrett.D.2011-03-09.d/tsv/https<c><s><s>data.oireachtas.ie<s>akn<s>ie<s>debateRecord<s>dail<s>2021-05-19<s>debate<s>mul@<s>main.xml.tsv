RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's announced proposals to deal with the activities of the vulture and cuckoo funds are hopelessly inadequate, completely pathetic and not a serious attempt to deal with these cuckoo funds at all. In reality, the Government is beholden to these funds and deeply implicated in having brought them into the housing market. The 10% stamp duty will not act as a disincentive. These firms have the funds at their disposal to outbid ordinary working people. The provisions will not apply to apartments, which is where most of these funds are active. The planning regulations, similarly, will not apply to apartments or to all the strategic housing development planning permissions that are in play, a flood of which have gone through recently. These proposals are therefore not a serious attempt to deal with this issue and, to use a phrase the Taoiseach often uses, they will not deliver one extra affordable house for working people or make the unaffordable rents in the housing sector affordable. Neither will they deal with the scandal that was revealed at the weekend. The explanation for the Government's not taking serious action against the vultures and cuckoos is that the State is up to its neck in investing in these cuckoos through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, formerly called the National Pensions Reserve Fund. I have just discovered that this includes investment in Bartra's co-living proposal in Dún Laoghaire. The State is building box apartments with Bartra. It is investing in short-stay aparthotels. This is unbelievable. Then in many cases these properties will be leased back to local authorities or they will fund the profits of these investors through HAP payments, 40% of the revenue from which goes into the pockets of corporate landlords. The paper I am holding shows what these funds are saying about the profits they can make through leasing deals with the local authorities. The crowd behind this paper is called Housing Together. It boasts of Government-backed leases of ten to 25 years, unrivalled covenant strength, net initial rental yield of 5%, being ideal for investors seeking high income at low risk, the opportunity to lock in rents linked to inflation, no management of tenants, no rental collections or chasing arrears, no internal maintenance, no voids, no letting fees, no advertising costs and no ongoing refurbishment costs. Why? Because the local authority will pay for all that and at the end of the 25 years, the vulture fund, not the State, will own the property. We are, therefore, paying for this, the vulture funds and the cuckoos are running off with the profits and we have nothing at the end - no security, no affordability and no affordable rents. It is a scam and a swindle of Mafia-style proportions. Why are we not paying to build our own stock that is actually affordable for ordinary working families?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the private sector should look after itself. The Taoiseach is absolutely right: the State is the main mover in the housing market. While it is spending €3 billion, the problem is it is spending it on lining the pockets of the vulture funds, the cuckoos and the speculators. The vast majority of the money the State is putting in, which the Taoiseach just described, is going on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing payments. It is not going into building our own stock of public housing because the State only managed to build 2,000 of its own local authority houses, while there were 15,000 new HAP tenancies last year with more on RAS and leasing arrangements. Now it gets even worse; the State is working with private developers to deliver the tenements of the 21st century, co-living, which the Government claims it has banned, but the State is investing with these private developers in it. If we are paying for it anyway through tax breaks, through RAS, HAPs and leasing, and through investment from the strategic investment fund, we should cut out the bloodsuckers, cut out the middlemen and invest in providing our own stock of public and affordable housing. By the way, as the Government has not built a single affordable house, the Taoiseach should not peddle that myth.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, is there a list of which amendments are ruled in and out of order?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a list of amendments but it does not state which are in and which are out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like it noted that People Before Profit proposed three amendments to the Government's motion, all of which have been ruled out of order. For the record, I should say what they were. First, we proposed that the stamp duty should be 90%, not 10%, as the Government is proposing, or 15% or 17%, as the other Opposition parties are proposing. We need not just to disincentivise funds or make purchasing a little more costly but, rather, to exclude them completely from the market in order that they cannot bulk-purchase houses, price people out of the market and control the prices and rents therein. Second, we proposed that the threshold at which the higher stamp duty kicked in would not be ten properties, but two. In other words, there could be no multiple purchases by these profit-hungry funds. Third, apartments should be included. The Government will not accept any of these amendments, of course. With this motion, it is simply responding to the fury that people felt as a result of seeing these cuckoos swooping in and purchasing whole estates. The Government had to be seen to be doing something so it has engineered to do the absolute minimum, no doubt in deep consultation with the very cuckoo funds and vulture funds it is supposed to be trying to deal with. The Government is not planning or even attempting to deal with the cuckoo and vulture funds because it is up to its neck in this with them and has been since at least 2011 or 2012, shortly after the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government came into office, when it held multiple meetings with them to invite them into Ireland and informed them of the tax benefits they could have by investing in Irish property, paying no tax on their rental revenues or capital gains, and when the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, sold off property worth more than €40 billion with the Government's active encouragement. The same funds that were invited in by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government are now being given the opportunity to move into other sectors of the housing market. The extent of what is happening is terrifying. One would think the Government had learned its lesson when all these policies led to the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State, with rents and house prices going off the Richter scale and 80% to 90% of workers being priced out of the purchase market or asked to pay rents that no worker can afford of €2,000, €2,500 or €3,000 per month, but what is happening has actually got worse. I will elaborate on a point I made earlier today. People should google Housing Together. Its website reads:A Unique Opportunity For Investors Seeking Capital Growth And Secure IncomeGovernment Backed Residential Property InvestmentBy the way, this relates to the provision of social housing. It is about capital growth and secure incomes for investors. So far, Housing Together has bought property worth €50 million and leased it to local authorities at extortionate rates. As I recited to the Taoiseach, Housing Together boasts that it will achieve an annual average yield of 5%, high incomes at low risk, the opportunity to lock in rents linked to inflation, no maintenance, no voids, no letting fees and no advertising costs.It further boasts, giving examples, that, say, a 25-year lease on a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin will net investors €15,279 a year in rent. At the end of a 25-year to 30-year lease, they will have made €475,000, which is a yield of approximately 7.8%, and they will still own the asset. The State will have paid through the nose and these people will have made an absolute fortune. More millionaires will have been made who did absolutely nothing except invest in "Government-backed investment opportunities". At the end of it all, the State will own nothing. The funds can flog the assets off and the people in so-called social housing can be ditched, just like the HAP residents in St. Helen's Court face being thrown out because a vulture fund decided it wants vacant possession to drive up the value of the property. That will be happening on a mass scale because of Government policy. At the other end of this twisted equation and heist, we have the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, investing in the funds that are doing this kind of thing. When the Government says we need these funds financed, I say we do not. We are already financing them through the ISIF, HAP payments, lease payments, RAS payments and the tax loopholes that allow them to pay no tax. They run off with the asset and the profits and we get nothing. We get neither affordable rents nor affordable housing. Why do we not use our capital to invest in public and affordable housing that is genuinely affordable, that we will own at the end of it and whereby the profits, instead of going into the pockets of these bloodsuckers and vultures, go into the coffers of the State and the people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should note for the record of the Dáil that a whole series of other amendments were submitted and were ruled out of order, including three proposed by my party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the problem. You try to put in an amendment that will actually achieve something and it gets ruled out of order.
