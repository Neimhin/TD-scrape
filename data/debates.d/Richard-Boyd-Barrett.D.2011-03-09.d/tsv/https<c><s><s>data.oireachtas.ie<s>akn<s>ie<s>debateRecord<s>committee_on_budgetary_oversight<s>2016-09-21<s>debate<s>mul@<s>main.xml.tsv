RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and his team. In light of everything the Minister has said and some of the discussion we have had here today, are we not heading into a do-nothing, change-nothing budget? When people shout out on behalf of particular sectors, the Minister acknowledges that in an ideal world we would have greater spending or investment in those sectors but he goes on to say we do not have the money because we are working within the envelope or the fiscal space. He says we are not going to have the funds to put into everything that should be funded. I do not think that is a very happy prospect, especially in light of the legitimate claims for extra investment or expenditure under a series of headings. I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to this. In most cases, such extra spending would actually be good for the State, from a financial perspective, in the medium to long term. Are we being constrained by fiscal space to the point where we are not capable of doing things which would be good in the medium to long term but which we are not allowed to do because of the short-term cost involved? To me, that is just bad economics. It is not good for the future that we are in this straitjacket. I will give an example. The Minister and everybody else says that even though we should move towards funding the arts to the tune of 0.6% of GDP, which is the EU average, we cannot afford to do so. By the way, we were the only people to allocate extra money to the arts in our budget submission last year. We know from the contribution the arts make that there is a sure-fire return at every level from investment in the arts. The costs that ultimately arise in all sorts of areas like crime and policing are the knock-on consequences of children and young people not benefitting from investment in areas like the arts in their local communities. I could also speak about the benefits of such expenditure for our reputation in the arts and for tourism, etc. It is a sure-fire winner. I will mention housing as an another example. The Minister can come back to me on this. As a result of the constraints on having an upfront, major, direct public programme of building local authority houses, as we used to do once upon a time, the vast majority of the Government's housing plan - between 70% and 80% of it - depends on sourcing social housing from the private sector via the housing assistance payment or leasing arrangements. The Minister will argue that the Government cannot afford to provide entirely for local authority housing, as we are suggesting, because that would breach the expenditure limits and we do not have the money to pay for it upfront. I suggest that such an approach will prove to be completely stupid in the medium to long term. If we do it our way, there will be a greater upfront cost, but the State will end up with an asset and the rental revenue from that asset will come back to the State. If we do it the Government's way, most of the rental revenue that is going to derive from the State's investment in social housing, but not local authority housing, will go out. In the end, it is not very good economics. The rental revenue is not going to go to us. It is going to go to the vulture funds or private developers from whom we lease stuff, for example, under the Part V arrangements, or the new 30:30:30 arrangements I understand we will have on public land. That is what the housing plan is saying. Previously, public land was used for 100% public housing. Now it is going to be used for 30% public housing and 60% private housing. We will be leasing it back off the vulture funds and private developers. Rather than investing in something that will lead to money coming back in the medium to long term, we are providing for a system in which money will be going out every year. I do not think that is prudent. I think it is stupid. This stupidity is being imposed on us by those who are obsessed with staying within the fiscal space. I would like to mention a few other areas, such as forestry, that I do not have time to go into in detail. I do not understand why we do not have a massive afforestation programme. We would get a sure-fire return if we were to upscale our efforts in that area. The Swiss invest in banks, forests, chocolate and a few other things. That is seriously what they do. Banks buy up forests as a sure-fire investment. When the last Government was considering the sale of our forests, banks were trying to buy them. We are not able to expand our forest estate. I would like to comment on this. As far as I am concerned, it is madness that Coillte is essentially constrained by European rules from expanding our forests. This country's approach to public transport seems to involve its delivery by means of privatisation. If we are going to deal with the threat of climate change and get more people to use public transport, surely we need lower fares and a model of public transport that is not driven by profit. That means a higher level of subvention for public transport and cheaper fares. This is essential if we are to avoid the penalties about which Deputy Ryan spoke. That would be a critical start. We need to invest in the public system. That means a higher level of subvention. Instead, we are relying on the privatisation model. I could go through a whole series of other examples, but I do not have time to do so. We are told that we spend more than any other country in the area of health. I want to know how much of that is going to the private sector. I suggest the amount is very significant. If the money going to the private sector were stripped out, it would be evident that it is not the case that more money is being invested in this country's public health system than in the health system of any other country in Europe. In such circumstances, we would probably find that the level of investment here is about the same or possibly even less. A huge amount of money is being sucked out of the system by private profit-taking. I will conclude by asking why we cannot expand the fiscal space. I would say there are many ways of doing this. I know the Minister will not accept some of my suggestions. He will not break the fiscal rules. He will not agree not to pay back several billion in interest on loans next year. We believe such repayments are odious. The Minister could look for extra tax revenue from sectors that can afford to pay more. If we do not take such measures to expand the fiscal space, every one of the key sectors that is being short-changed will not get the investment or expenditure it needs. That is just a fact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not if it constrains us from doing what we need to do in housing, health, public transport and the environment, etc.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not if it constrains us from doing those things.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think we should tell the EU we need to do these things and if it is not willing to let us do them or it is going to constrain us in doing them, we cannot be part of such a Union. We could see how it responds to that as a start.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly what the Government threatened when the EU dared to touch the 12.5% corporate tax rate. I think it was the Minister who said that could be the one thing that would drive him out. The tragedy is that the only time the Irish Government, and the Minister specifically, threatened Europe with the possibility of leaving or proposed the idea of telling Europe we might leave under certain circumstances was when it dared to touch the 12.5% corporate tax rate. I suggest we should take a similar approach on grounds that would be more meaningful to the majority of our citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is correct. It was Brian Hayes, MEP. I apologise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was the only thing the Government got tough with the EU on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax wealth and capital more. Let us be specific.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I delve deeper into the question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I started off by saying that because of these constraints, we are not able to make what any person would conclude to be sound investment for the medium and long term. That was my point. The Minister is acknowledging that investment in the arts is good and brings a return but that we may not be able to do it. The same argument could be made about third level education. Everybody is shouting for it. The Minister will say that he acknowledges it would be a good move to invest more in our universities and in our schools but that we may not be able to do it. We certainly have not done it in housing, and it is questionable whether we will be able to do it, but fiscal rules were cited as a reason we could not do the large-scale direct public programme for which some of us have been asking. We cannot do it on housing, the arts or forestry, which never gets a mention but is very important. We cannot do it under all those headings, even though there is an acknowledgement that it would be sensible and sound in the medium to long term. Is there not something wrong with that thinking? That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. We have-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In every single one of those, we have to give something away in terms of public assets in order to get the investment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are having to give something to the private sector in O'Devaney Gardens. We discussed this with the Minister the other day. In terms of the planned sites which are publicly owned, in order to get a small bit back we are having to give away a public asset, and the revenue-generating potential of that public asset, because of the constraints the Minister is willing to accept, or possibly because of an ideological predisposition. That is bad economics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public housing stock will be less at the end of it. In the medium to long term, the public housing stock, as a proportion of housing stock, will be significantly less.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just one brief comment on that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is to do with the cheque book.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mentioned this earlier. It is the question of raising the level of subvention to public transport to European average levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For what it is worth, the bus workers believe the low level of subvention is what is at the back of this dispute. I just want to put that on the record. My question concerns the public sector pension levy and restoration in that regard. In my opinion, it is legitimately a very sore point with public sector workers that, as well as everything else that was imposed on everybody - the USC, pay cuts and so on - there was also this public sector pension levy. I know there has been some restoration for the lowest paid. The question is whether the Minister envisages lifting the burden of this really punitive austerity levy off the backs of those earning under €70,000. I am not urging him to do it for the higher paid, but for the low to middle area of the public sector, as the emergency is over, they should not have this punitive levy continuously imposed on them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister might send us the graph.
