RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pass on my condolences and sympathy to the family of the late former Deputy Peter Mathews. I was shocked to learn of his passing, which is a terrible loss for his family. He was a very decent and genuine man. The Taoiseach will be familiar with the case of Ava Barry who suffers from the debilitating and traumatic condition of Dravet syndrome which causes regular traumatic seizures. Ava's mother, Vera Twomey, believes she has been forced to commence a 250 km walk from Cork to Leinster House as a result of a decision by the Health Service Executive to refuse to license medicinal cannabis based products for her daughter, despite the fact that an Irish registered doctor made the application on behalf of the family. This underlines the need for Deputy Gino Kenny's Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill to be passed as a matter of urgency. It appears a legal chill factor is preventing the licensing of products that would make a major difference to young children such as Eva and many others who are suffering from chronic pain and severe medical conditions. I want to know about the process regarding the legislation because we are in uncharted territory with this Opposition Bill and whether it will proceed to Committee Stage. We need a commitment that it will proceed to Committee Stage-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am referring to a Bill and asking whether it will proceed to Committee Stage. I ask the Government not to seek in any way to restrict access to these products for Ava Barry and others with chronic health conditions who urgently need products to which they are being denied access.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I agree with the Taoiseach on one matter. We need to maintain a robust stance that there should be no return to the Border between North and South. I might underline that point for our colleagues in Sinn Féin, who seem to dispute People Before Profit's absolute commitment to that. We believe there should be absolute resistance at any attempt to reimpose a border between North and South. Is it not the case that the Brexit phenomena and Donald Trump's ascension to power and the policies associated with it highlight the need for an existential choice for this country, and indeed for many other countries, in terms of whether we join in the turbo-charged race to the bottom that Trump and the right wing of the Tory party are leading in terms of reducing corporation tax which so far both the Government and Fianna Fáil, and now even Sinn Féin in the North, supports; that it is a disastrous model the most extreme expression of which is President Trump which will have a disastrous consequence for the economy; and that we need to reject that model and set out clearly that we are in favour of a more sustainable and fairer economy where the multinational corporations pay their fair share of tax so we have enough to create jobs and provide public services and strategic investment? Do Brexit and Trump not highlight the need to break from that race to the bottom, if we are to have a sustainable economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pay tribute to the determination of the Tesco workers to face down what was a deliberate attempt at union busting by one of the most profitable companies in the country. Through their determined action, their willingness to escalate the dispute and moves toward escalating the dispute, they have shown that people power and workers' power work. That lesson is critically needed given the similar orchestrated attempt to attack workers and trade unions in our public transport system. Again, the public is being treated to a diet of frankly disingenuous nonsense about the viability of the company when what is happening is that subsidies for public transport are being undermined and private operators are being cosseted and promoted by the National Transport Authority with the assistance of the Government to undermine workers' pay and conditions in Bus Éireann and the public transport system generally. They should use the same tactics to win their battle as the Tesco workers used.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The contagion of people power and workers' power is spreading in a very positive way. We saw this with the Tesco workers able to face down this bullying highly profitable multinational, which called the workers' bluff and have come off the worst and I am very glad of that. As Deputy Barry said, the Government should take on board this lesson for what is coming down the line with the Bus Éireann, because just like with Tesco we are getting a false picture of what is happening. Bus Éireann is effectively trying to rip up the terms and conditions of bus workers and the Government is trying to slash public service routes to benefit private for-profit bus companies, giving them more subsidies for the free travel pass than Bus Éireann receives and slashing public service subsidies year after year, so the Government should take a lesson from the Tesco workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are very strongly opposed to this Bill. The so-called knowledge development box is being sold as a reasonable incentive to small and medium-sized enterprises to develop our innovative edge. The implication is that the scheme will have a positive benefit on the domestic economy. This is the view expressed by the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party. I do not know what the Labour Party's position is as it is not represented in the Chamber. We will see what its Deputies have to say on how the knowledge development box will benefit small and medium enterprises. The most recent figures available on the level of tax the corporate sector pays on gross profits refer to 2014, although I understand figures for 2015 will be available soon. The figures show the corporate tax code is full of loopholes that are being used to rob taxpayers of vital tax revenues that could be used to develop infrastructure and fund our universities, the most important locations for the types of innovation and technological developments that would benefit the entire economy. They are also being used to rob the State generally of the revenues it needs for investment in strategic enterprise and industry, infrastructure, public services, technological development and upgrading the education system to make it the real driving force of innovation.  What is being sold as something that is good for the economy and innovation is in reality a massive tax break for profit interests and members of the public need to know the scale involved. The 2014 figures show the corporate sector benefits from tax loopholes worth €35 billion. Gross pre-tax profits for corporations stood at €95 billion in 2014. However, after what are described as deductions and charges, the figure decreases to €65 billion, with further deductions of €4 billion made through another series of loopholes. This means the taxable figure is reduced by €35 billion through loopholes or tax breaks that do not benefit the economy or society. Before considering the introduction of further tax breaks, we must address the current loopholes that have created a gaping hole in the potential tax revenue of the State. Incidentally, the figures I have cited were provided by the Revenue Commissioners.  Large multinational corporations are engaging in aggressive tax evasion or avoidance, whichever term one wishes to use, and some major domestic interests are also benefitting from tax loopholes. It is now proposed to introduce another loophole. The idea that the purpose of the knowledge development box is primarily to benefit small and medium enterprise must be set against the definition of a small and medium enterprise. According to the legislation, a small and medium enterprise is a company with an income arising from intellectual property of less than €7.5 million and global income of less than €50 million. These are not figures we associate with small and medium enterprises. The companies involved will not be corner shops or start-up companies in the local enterprise centre. To set income thresholds of €7.5 million domestically and €50 million globally is to stretch the definition of a small and medium enterprise. Many large companies will benefit from this measure.However, the bulk of small and medium enterprise in this country will not gain from it. The same old crowd will benefit. What is not clear is how the big multinationals who exceed the thresholds in terms of their global incomes will be prevented from benefitting. We are well aware that they can massage their incomes, and have done so, such that they pay no tax at all or pay less than 1% in tax. They are well capable, through the internal allocation and movement of profits, of reducing their incomes in order to avoid paying tax.  Leaving that aside, in terms of the thresholds, where are the safeguards to ensure big companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook and so on do not set up a number of small companies, or put in place arrangements with small companies that they help to set up, and channel innovations through them? It seems there is nothing to stop that. I suspect that is exactly what they will do. The one thing these companies are very innovative at doing is avoiding tax. They have shown a remarkable ability to navigate around tax codes, usually with the active collusion of the political establishment, as happened here, and possibly, on the part of Revenue, in terms of what happened in the Apple case, although that is not yet clear but certainly has to be examined. We will learn more about that from the investigation into the Apple case but that there was political collusion in terms of tax avoidance of that I have no doubt. That there was collusion in some form or another with Revenue in terms of these tax rulings is a possibility, at least. This is what we are dealing with. Against that background, we are introducing another tax avoidance loophole-incentive based around the notion of intellectual property.  In regard to "intellectual property", it was stated that we are in the world of intellectual property now because of technological invention. This is a very old idea. The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, as somebody who comes from the left should understand this point. The idea that the entrepreneur's idea is the generator of wealth is not a new idea, rather it is an old idea, and a very right wing idea. The workers making the products do not matter and neither do the people in the call centres selling them. They are irrelevant. There is little value put on them but a lot of value on the person with the brilliant idea yet the person with the brilliant idea gets away with paying no tax while the poor workers producing or selling the products pay taxes at levels that are a multiple of that paid by these brilliant entrepreneurs. Where do most of these innovations come from? When one traces them back one finds that some of the biggest and most profitable companies in the world have effectively stolen the ideas for which they hold patents and generate huge profits from public institutions, such as, in the case of America, the military, or in our case, the universities. That is an important point. In Ireland much of the innovation comes not from the military but from our universities. When one traces back the origins of these intellectual properties which have made huge profits for private companies one finds that many of them were developed in universities rather than by the brilliant entrepreneurs who end up with profits that are incomprehensible and on which they pay no tax.  As a student of literature I must point out that up until the poet Wordsworth there was no notion of copyright. Wordsworth was one of the people who championed the notion of individual ownership of ideas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes but in a lot of societies and, to my mind, the more progressive societies, the idea that anybody individually owned an idea was considered nonsensical, and it is nonsensical because ideas are generated by society. People often claim the credit for them or they have the machinery to take out patents on them before anybody else and so they claim they own the idea. Now, we are proposing that such people will not have to pay any tax on the enormous profits they generate from supposedly their ideas. As I said, ideas are generated out of societies collectively. I am against this proposal. I reiterate that every tax break given to for-profit entities reduces the amount of revenue the State has to put into the universities. I am for innovation, and very much for it. Our universities are starved of money. That is where the money needs to go. All we are doing is making things more difficult for our universities. Grants for postgraduates were cut and have still not been restored. These are the people who come up with ideas but we cut their grants and increased their fees. Funding for many of our third level institutions has been cut over the past eight or nine years. If we continue to give away billions of euro every year via tax loopholes to these companies we will have less money to put into the universities that could champion real innovation and socially useful innovation. What is a socially useful innovation? For a private company the criteria in terms of an innovation is will it make money and not will it benefit society? Our money is being used to provide tax breaks. Do we want these resources to be given primarily to people who pursue profit or would we rather them go into public institutions that have some semblance of what is in the best interests of society as a whole, be that in relation to the development of renewable energies, new technologies or strategic industries that will benefit society? It should be the latter yet they are being starved. We are joining in the race to the bottom and it makes me weep. We have been warning - the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, was with us on this for many years - that Ireland is leading the race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxation, not in terms of the 12.5% rate but the average 6% rate that companies actually pay. Interestingly, the same percentage is chosen for the beneficiaries of the knowledge development box. As we know, a combination of small and medium-sized enterprises are paying 12.5% as against the big profitable corporations, which pay 2%, 1% or even less than that. In some cases, they are paying less than 1%. We led and continue to lead that race to the bottom, but we are now being out-flanked by the maniac Trump who wants to reduce it even further and by Prime Minister, Theresa May. In the North, Sinn Féin and the DUP have jumped into this space, with Sinn Féin calling for a 12.5% rate in the North and the DUP calling for a 10% rate. Where does it end? Every time we give away money like this there is less investment available for the universities, public infrastructure, public services and so on. It is madness. We are handing over control of science, innovation and the economy and, increasingly society, to a tiny group of multinational corporations that are ingenious at making money and avoiding tax.They are robbing other people's ideas and making money out of them. Moreover, they want to take over our universities and hold them hostage. Increasingly, they can because underfunded universities that do not get enough funding from the public have to go cap in hand to the private corporations begging for some money for research. The companies say they can give it as long as the research benefits them. That is what is going on. There is a creeping corporate takeover of our third level institutions. Some buildings in the third level institutions are named after billionaires in this country who in many cases became billionaires through aggressive tax avoidance. There are buildings named after Michael Smurfit, Anthony O'Reilly, Denis O'Brien and so on. Is this really what we want? It is certainly not what I want. I do not believe it is the basis of a sustainable economy. Responsibility for the sort of technological advancement and investment in science that we want is being handed over to people who see only dollar signs or euro signs. I absolutely believe we should reject this. We oppose this, full stop. It is part of the race to the bottom. Even in its own terms, which I have said we reject, how can the Government stop the big companies setting up small front companies and exploiting the system? I do not believe it will be able to. What does the Government mean when it says €7 million and €50 million are small sums? I could count on one hand — or probably on one finger in my constituency — the number of small enterprises that have an income of €7 million or €50 million in global profits. That is not small. Therefore, there is a sleight of hand. It will benefit the same old gang, who are already ripping us off at an astronomical level. I do my best to ring the alarm bells about this stuff. This is an important debate. It will probably be ignored in the media narrative. These are very serious issues that need to be discussed. I do my best to ring a few alarm bells. We will see how that pans out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise to Deputy Mattie McGrath as I must leave.
