RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly agree with the Minister's sentiments about so-called experts in the media. They drive me bonkers. When we oppose measures such as a property tax, the universal social charge and water charges the Minister states we do not have alternatives to propose. When we call for big programmes of investment in social housing, which would deal with the threat of a property bubble, the Minister asks where we will get the money. Our view is that imposing higher income taxes on those earning more than €100,000 would yield a great deal of revenue, put money back into the economy and not really damage the economy because it would be taken off high earners who have enough to manage anyway. Will the Minister respond to this, particularly in light of the written question to which I received a response yesterday, which was based on a draft proposal. It showed that, according to the Department, if we had a 50% band rate on earnings between €100,000 and €140,000; a 55% rate on earnings between €140,000 and €180,000; a 60% rate on earnings between €180,000 and €250,000; and a 65% rate on earnings over €250,000 it could yield €922 million a year. These are akin to income tax rates in places such as Scandinavia, and what existed in much of the world in the 1960s and 1970s. I do not see any reason we cannot do this as an alternative to hitting low and middle income earners again and again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a fairly standard answer and is fairly non-illuminating. Preparations are being made for the budget and already very harsh measures have been imposed on low and middle income earners among whom there is growing poverty. There is also the growing phenomenon of the working poor and huge numbers of people at the low and middle end have no incentive to work. What incentive do low and middle income workers have to work at present? Their take-home pay has been hammered. They will be hammered with increasing water charges, property taxes and bills. Faced with this and as demonstrated in the response to the written parliamentary question I tabled, if we had a series of bands of taxation to be imposed on earnings of more than €100,000 it could yield €922 million. Imagine the relief that could give to low and middle income earners and the investment we could make in social housing. Why will the Minister not consider it given the very cruel choices he may have to make in the budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need an honest debate. The bulk of the new burden we propose would be on the 10% or 15% of people on very high earnings. It would finance real relief for the vast majority of people who earn between €30,000 and €60,000. They have been hammered with the universal social charge, property tax and water charges, which are regressive and disproportionately hit people on low and middle incomes. These are the real people and the Minister knows it well as he talks to them on the doorstep. The idea the majority of people on the doorsteps to whom he or I speak earn in excess of €100,000, €150,000 or €200,000 is nonsense. I do not understand why the Minister is not willing to impose an extra burden on them rather than continually hitting low and middle income earners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not earning €100,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In so far as there has been any movement on this issue, credit has to go to the people of north County Mayo, the Shell to Sea campaign and the many other campaigners around the country who supported their battle and sought to expose the scandal of what has happened in north county Mayo, Shell's treatment of the people of that area and the scandalous giveaway tax and licensing terms established by Ray Burke, Bertie Ahern and Frank Fahey. One only has to mention these names to understand why our tax and licensing regime gave away our offshore gas and oil reserves. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has repeatedly stated that our reserves are unproven but the estimates that have been produced by oil companies through geological and seismic studies, as well as actual finds, indicate potentially substantial reserves. There are gas and oil reserves off our shores and at some point they will be exploited. When people justify the very low tax regime that applies and the system of concessions that gives exclusive rights to private oil companies to develop fields and take ownership of the oil and gas produced, they say that our resources are unproven or not commercial. What is deemed commercial will vary over time but we know that oil and gas prices are going to increase. Oil companies, like developers of land, sit on finds until they deem the time is optimal to exploit them and profit from them. How much information is available to the Minister and the Department about what has happened in respect of drilling and the capping of wells by oil companies? The companies know what is going on down there but I doubt that we know. People who worked on these drilling operations have told me these companies are a law unto themselves and nobody is representing the State in finding out what is going on. As I previously noted, Statoil took away a full tanker of oil from its Connemara field. The Minister acknowledged this but none the less he repeatedly claims there is no proven reserve at that field. The Government has been forced into addressing this issue because of people's protests. While some improvements have been made, major problems remain. Norway established a state oil company that was involved in the process at every hand's turn and, even before the discovery of Ecofisk, declared sovereignty over its resources and decided to ensure that its citizens got the maximum benefit from them. Sometimes we will have to do deals with international oil companies because we do not have the expertise or money for the initial investment.The problem is the regime still being proposed is one where they have all the control and get allowances and tax deductions. That means despite having headline or nominal rates, the companies can write off large amounts of losses and costs in different ways so the effective tax take would be minimal and almost unquantifiable. On examining our corporate tax regime generally, one would be very worried. There has been a marginal improvement but it falls way short of what it should be. We need a State oil and gas company and it should be involved in the development and production of these resources. Under no circumstances should the fields be given away to private oil companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief as it was unfortunate we could not finish this the other day. I characterise the nuclear industry as humanity's self-destruct button. It is a time-bomb that could go off at any stage. Britain is substantially expanding its nuclear power industry and the nuclear arms industry is a major threat. We are still unsure how to handle the transport and disposal of nuclear waste as it is extraordinarily dangerous. The prospects of any nuclear accident are terrifying. I wonder about society's amnesia when it comes to disasters such as Three Mile Island, Fukushima, Chernobyl, Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It would be terrifying if any of these were repeated and for this reason a dedicated, independent body of experts monitoring nuclear issues on the international stage, in so far as they affect Ireland, is critically important. It is unfortunate that a Bill that aims to ensure greater safety in the nuclear industry at an international level is rolled in with a proposal to liquidate the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and incorporate it into the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. I think this threatens the role and independence of the institute and could expose it to resource and staff problems. It was wrong for these two aspects of the Bill to be rolled together and it is unfortunate the Minister of State refuses to accept compromise amendments proposed by Deputy Catherine Murphy and others with concerns on this. I feel there is no choice but to oppose this Bill, though I agree with some of its provisions. The decision to dissolve the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland into the EPA is a mistake.
