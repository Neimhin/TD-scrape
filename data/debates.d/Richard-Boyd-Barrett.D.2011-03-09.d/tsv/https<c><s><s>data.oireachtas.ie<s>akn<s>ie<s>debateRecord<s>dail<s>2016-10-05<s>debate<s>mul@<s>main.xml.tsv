RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will they all be local authority units?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am seeking to ascertain why the Minister, who says he is committed to delivering social housing to deal with the housing emergency, is proposing to give away two thirds of public land - I refer to land on which 100% council housing would previously have been developed - for private housing that is called affordable rental or affordable. If I understand this correctly, two thirds of any publicly-owned site will be developed by the private sector and will not be used for council housing. I will refer to some individual sites when I ask my supplementary questions. If we need to get large quantities of council housing quickly, why are we proposing to privatise two thirds of publicly owned sites?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I beg to differ. I think it is precisely ideological. I will give the Minister an example. The site of the former prison at Shanganagh Castle in Shankill is owned by the council. Some 550 units can be built there. In the past, 550 council houses would have been built there. As a result of the Minister's proposals, some 180 council houses will be built and the other houses will be designated as affordable housing and affordable rental, whatever they are. It is clear that it is a public-private partnership. I understand that the same thing has happened at Oscar Traynor Road in Coolock. It is happening all over the place. At the same time that a site where 550 council units would once have been built is being developed in a way that will give us just 180 council units, the NAMA development at the former DÃºn Laoghaire Golf Club site, which would have given us 320 social units if the 20% rule had been in play, is giving us just 160 social units as a result of the Minister's decision to reduce the 20% requirement to 10%. The private developers are gaining everywhere. They are gaining on the private developments and they are now gaining on public land. People on the list are asking why 550 units were not provided, instead of 180, which is what they are going to get under the Minister's plan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two major sites are being developed in my local area at the moment. In the case of a development of 1,800 houses, there will be just 180 social houses as a result of the Minister's 10% rule. There is private housing. I want people who want private housing to get private housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are getting just 10% for social housing. The balance could be redressed at the next big site, which is publicly-owned, so that we get more social housing, but that is not going to happen. We could have got 550 council houses at that site, but instead we are going to get 180. If there are 180 council houses at one site and 180 council houses at the other site, that means there will be 360-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Deputy not to intervene. Some 2,000 private houses are being developed at these sites. The proportion of social housing is falling all the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is going to accelerate that by allowing two thirds of public land to be handed over. When he says this is a matter for the local authorities, is he telling me that my local authority can choose for all of those units to be social housing? Under the public private partnerships, will the actual title to the land be handed over to the private developers in the case of the so-called affordable rental or affordable housing? I want to know whether it is going to be privatised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It means people on the list will be waiting longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is just a cover for privatisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my opinion, the dirty little secret about Rebuilding Ireland is that the majority of the so-called social housing the Minister intends to deliver will, in fact, be private housing. It will not work in the form of HAP. I was doing a tot on the graph on page 46 of the Minister's Rebuilding Ireland - an Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness. Approximately 80,000 of the social housing units the Minister plans to deliver between now and 2021 involve HAP. Then the Minister adds to those another 8,000 to 9,000 in leasing and another few thousand in RAS. I have made the point it will not work. Will the Minister tell me how much it will cost the Exchequer annually to fork out the money to those private landlords?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not getting an answer. My figures were broadly correct. That scale of outsourcing of social housing to private landlords will be ramped up again and again to a total of 111,000, as outlined by the Minister, through the HAP scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing. That is what he just said. That will happen between now and 2021. That is set out in Minister's graph. Stop shaking your head; you just said that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am looking at the Minister's graphs and at the figures he just gave me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not answer the question regarding how much it will cost. If I picked him up wrong there, correct me. Under this plan, how many houses will be delivered up to 2021 by the HAP scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and long-term leasing? I ask him not to tell me that he does not have estimated figures of how much that will cost the State. I can tell him that it does not take a rocket scientist to work out that it will cost us a fortune. That is as against directly building local authority houses, council houses that people who are on the local authority housing list want, which would generate a rental stream for us and mean that the State would have an asset.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to correct the record with respect to an earlier remark. I want to stress that we are in favour of affordable housing; we are not against it. The Minister will not be able to deliver that unless he does what the Keane report proposed in the 1970s, which is to take control of all building land and make sure that we set the prices because the last affordable housing scheme failed catastrophically. It did not deliver any affordable housing because prices in the market went through the roof. The question is how do we control the market. The answer is that we build more social housing. That would provide low cost housing and it would also keep a lid on the market as a whole. Will the Minister answer the question about how much will this cost? It is obvious from what he is saying and from his report that the amount of money that will be going out from the Exchequer will increase exponentially over the next five or six years. I put it to him that would be money going out the door when he should be putting the money into local authority housing, which we would then own and from which we would secure rent. In the long term it would be better in that we would have better quality housing and it would represent better value for money for the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only some do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are there no costings?
