RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tairgim: "Go léifear an Bille don Dara hUair anois." I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."People Before Profit-Solidarity has put forward this Bill which seeks a referendum on the insertion of neutrality into the Constitution. Many people believe Ireland's neutrality is protected in the Constitution because there is a long understanding and overwhelming support for the idea that Ireland should be neutral but, in fact, that neutrality is not protected in the Constitution, and we believe it is seriously under attack. Successive Governments have sought to undermine that neutrality most egregiously with the decisions of previous Governments to allow millions of US troops to go through Shannon Airport in order to prosecute bloody and unjustifiable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a war based on a pack of lies about weapons of mass destruction that led to the death of 1 million people, directly and indirectly, and essentially destroyed Iraqi society, damage from which it will probably not recover for decades if ever. Ireland facilitated that even though it is supposed to be a neutral country. We facilitated the outrageous practice of rendition, better termed as kidnapping and torture by the US, whereby they send Gulfstream jets around the world, kidnap people they consider to be a threat to American security, without due process, and take them to black sites around the world and torture them, often in despotic, brutal regimes that allow the US to carry on this practice. Most recently, the Government sought to exploit the terrible crisis in Ukraine, what is undoubtedly a bloody imperialist and murderous war that has been initiated by Vladimir Putin. The Government and the wider European political establishment are seeking to exploit that terrible crisis in order to justify moving towards greater EU militarisation, the establishment of a European army, and closer alignment with NATO. The Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, said recently that neutrality is a policy issue that can change at any time. The Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, said, "I think we’ll need to think about deeper involvement in European Defence." The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has suggested that we need to spend more resources on defence as well as co-operate with other EU countries and partnerships with NATO in some areas. That is what he was reported as having said at a meeting he attended in the United States. He can respond to that suggestion during the debate. He has also said that we may get involved in the expanded rapid reaction force of 5,000 troops, which is essentially the embryo of a European army. Ireland's neutrality and the struggle for an independent Irish republic are one and the same, they always have been. To move away from Ireland's neutrality is not just some sort of interesting tactical or strategic choice. It is, in fact, a betrayal of the essential struggle to establish an independent republic, going back to Wolfe Tone, who first advocated for both Irish independence and neutrality, and to James Connolly and those who led people out in 1916 and the entire Irish revolution. As soon as the First World War broke out, James Connolly established the Irish Neutrality League to argue that Ireland should in no way be a participant or supporter of either warring side in the First World War. At the time he wrote something that echoes strongly today. He wrote:Should the working class of Europe rather than slaughter each other for the benefit of kings and financiers, proceed ... to erect barricades all over Europe, to break up bridges and destroy the transport service that war might be abolished, we should be perfectly justified in following such a glorious example and contributing our aid to the final dethronement of the vulture classes that rule and rob the world.Brilliant and so correct. They had vulture funds robbing the world then, just as we have now. Connolly was clear. As soon as that war broke out, when people in Irish politics, in the Home Rule Party, argued that Irish people could be, and they were, slaughtered in that war Connolly said "No". He said that Ireland opposed both sides in that war. In fact, it was the outbreak of the First World War, which led to the slaughter of 14 million people, that prompted Connolly to say that we had to have a rebellion in Ireland, not just for independence but to strike a blow against empires and the slaughter of the First World War. The Irish revolution was significantly accelerated by the conscription crisis of 1918. Upon the end of the war, the Irish revolution was part of a series of revolutions across Europe, in Russia, Germany, France and so on, against the war, a slaughter that was ended by the revolt of working people against all the warmongers of Europe. People Before Profit-Solidarity believe we have to uphold that tradition which is now under serious threat. Neutrality does not mean indifference. Neutrality means standing against warmongers and empires and standing with the oppressed. If we throw that away, we will throw away what is the identity that was the struggle for the Irish Republic, and we will do so at our peril. We should not do that and I hope the House will support the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has nothing to do with insulting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's representation of its position on neutrality and this Bill, as well as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael's representation of their position on neutrality, is dishonest and misleading from beginning to end. The position on this Bill is dishonest. This Bill is to create a conversation and debate for the entire country about the position on neutrality. We need to do that when there is a greater threat of war globally than there has been for many decades, between powers that have nuclear weapons. The Bill proposes to maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances and not allowing our territory to be used to prosecute war or to transport personnel or war material for the purposes of war. It prevents us from adopting a decision by the European Council to participate in a war. We can only participate in a war, with the assent of Dáil Éireann, if we are attacked ourselves. That is what the Bill proposes. I believe it is in line with the wishes of the vast majority of people. It is certainly in line with the traditions of James Connolly, who helped to found this State, and of Wolfe Tone. It is in line with the tradition that established this State, in opposition to the slaughter of the First World War and the colonial domination of the British Empire. That is what it proposes to do. In answer to Deputy Berry's question, we do not believe in any way that it inhibits our proud tradition of peacekeeping or humanitarian assistance for the oppressed or people suffering around the world. Any concerns about that could be addressed by changing wording on Committee Stage. We are open to amendments on the wording, but the key principles of this are copper-fastening our military neutrality and not being involved in military alliances. The dishonesty of this Government is that while it has to pay lip-service to neutrality, in reality it has eroded, breached and undermined our military neutrality as have successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments . They are now seeking to use the terrible crisis and Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine to do something they have long tried to do, which is to move closer to EU militarisation and to the NATO military alliance. That is the truth. By doing that, they are betraying that proud tradition of opposition to imperialism. Putin's war in Ukraine is disgusting, imperialist and bloody. He should get out of Ukraine. We have been consistent in opposing Russia's imperialist adventures in a way that our Government and the European Union have not. We opposed Russia's involvement in Afghanistan and in Chechnya, with the bloody levelling of Grozny. Only a few months ago, we opposed the Collective Security Treaty Organization, CSTO, which is Russia's version of NATO, intervening against workers in Kazakhstan. We opposed Russia in Georgia, Syria and everywhere it has gone, because Putin is an imperialist and a warmonger, and Russia has a long history of imperialism. We are consistent, as was James Connolly, with the tradition of neutrality, in opposing all warmongers and imperialists. The Government is silent on that. If CSTO and Russia are imperialists, so are the powers that dominate NATO, which the Government is silent about. In the NATO war on Afghanistan, tens of thousands of people were slaughtered and blown up with drone missiles at weddings, in buses and so on by NATO forces. The US and UK led a war in Iraq, which directly killed 500,000 people, as Deputy Gino Kenny just said. It indirectly resulted in the deaths of more than 1 million people. It completely destroyed the infrastructure of Iraq and destabilised the entire Middle East. The disaster that we have seen in Syria would not have happened if not for the US and UK-led war in Iraq. Recently, Amnesty International and UN Human Rights Watch confirmed something that Palestinians have been saying for decades, that we have said to the Government and European Union for years, that Israel is an apartheid state involved in ethnic cleansing and committing crimes against humanity. No sanctions were imposed on it by the European Union or NATO. It is quite the contrary. The powers that dominate NATO arm Israel to the teeth, even though it is guilty of committing war crimes on an ongoing basis, for 70 years, against the Palestinian people. The war in Yemen is conducted by Saudi Arabia. The Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, sends people from Ireland every year to develop trade relations with the most despotic dictatorship in the world, in Saudi Arabia, that has been at war for seven years in Yemen, killing 377,000 people, including 10,000 children, and has brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation according to the UN. It is armed by the US, the UK and France. They are directly involved in that war.Are there any sanctions against them? None. Why? Because it is in US interests to support the Saudi dictatorship as part of its project of controlling and dominating that area for the purposes of oil. I could go down through the list. The Government is silent on those things. That is what neutrality means. It means not being silent. It is not about being indifferent; it means being consistent in opposing oppression, imperialism and war-mongering rather than being selective in the way the Government is. The Government is against some wars but for other wars if its allies are involved in them and arming people to conduct those wars. This is now more vital than ever, as two nuclear powers engage in a stand-off. Why would we be involved in any alliance with powers that have nuclear weapons that could destroy the world? Now more than ever, we need to protect neutrality and have a constitutional referendum in order to secure that neutrality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not if they cannot pay their rent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The DAA, in order to deal with the deficit of private security which meant massively long queues in the airport over the weekend and likely to continue, is offering jobs where applicants have to be available for 40 hours per week but are only guaranteed 20 hours, coming out with €283. That is an absolute insult. It follows hot on the heel of meetings I have had with private security workers, of which there are 16,000 in this country. They will be organising a protest when the Dáil comes back on 27 April because they are so angry at the low levels of pay. These workers worked all during Covid on the front line. Their employers are resisting a miserable increase in the employment regulation order, ERO, to €12.05, which in any event is pathetic. This highlights how shockingly badly private security workers, who work everywhere including public transport, education, airports and hospitals, are paid. What does the Government intend to do about the shocking pay and conditions of private security workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The world is rightly disgusted at Putin’s bloody invasion of Ukraine and it is right and proper that we should be as generous as possible in our solidarity with the Ukrainian people fleeing Putin's bloody war. I want to commend groups like the Red Cross and the many individuals who have offered accommodation, many of whom have gone out to offer transport and other assistance in the Ukraine to help Ukrainian people exit this disastrous war instigated by Putin. We have a huge task in terms of accommodating the people who are coming in but, frankly, this should be the moment when we take the sort of radical measures we should have taken long ago to address the housing emergency in this country. One of the things we learned during Covid, and we may learn it again, is that when the Government actually wants to have an emergency response, it is capable of doing so. It is absolutely right that we should have an emergency response to the disaster in Ukraine. However, in the St. Helen's Court complex, where people have been threatened with eviction by a vulture fund and where, sitting alongside the place people are being evicted from, there have been for the past two years 15 empty apartments that the vulture fund has just sat on, which should have been used to house people, someone said to me: “Maybe, finally, the Government will build some houses for us.” In other words, they were not in any way hostile to Ukrainians coming in and they absolutely recognise the need to be generous, but they simultaneously ask if this means we actually could have the wherewithal to make homelessness a thing of the past and take the sort of radical measures to get hold of empty properties being sat on by speculators, land hoarders and so on to house everybody. We should have done it long before now and this should be the moment when we do it. The other thing I want to comment on is this. If we are rightly opening the door and our hearts to people fleeing from Ukraine, it has also essentially revealed a double standard in terms of providing refuge to people fleeing war. We learn, with Ukraine, why people flee their homes. It is because of war and, immediately, we recognise they do not want to leave home but they need assistance. Was that any less true in Afghanistan, except it was a US-led war? Maybe that is why we had a different attitude. Was that any less true in Syria, which was a Russian-led war? We were different in terms of our treatment of Syrians. Do we show the same generosity for people fleeing Somalia, which the US bombed in the past few weeks? There is a different standard. Those double standards will come back to haunt us. Those double standards are apparent in our different responses to the politics of Putin’s imperialist invasion. It is an imperialist invasion but so was the US-UK-led war on Iraq. What is the support for Israel, which Amnesty is now rightly condemning as guilty of crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people? We do not impose the same sanctions on them, we do not criticise them in the same way and we certainly do not offer the same level of solidarity to the Palestinian people. Is this going to be the moment when double standards are abandoned and we oppose all warmongering in the same way and show solidarity to all people fleeing war, regardless of their colour or creed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I learned a couple of things when I was in Palestine when I was about 18. First, I learned that Israel is an apartheid state and that we need to do something about it. While I was there, I was working in the desert growing tomatoes, melons and all sorts of other crops. An interesting point that has always stuck with me is that each morning when the farmers were producing the tomatoes for the European export market, we poured into big vats the contents of massive bags of chemicals whose purpose was to keep the tomatoes solid so they would still look good at the other end when transported vast distances to Europe. The nice tomatoes — beautiful tomatoes with no chemicals — were produced for the local market. They were absolutely gorgeous. They did not look exactly the same as the ones on the shelves here but they were the tasty ones. There were no chemicals in them at all. I learned something else in Israel: the rotten melons produced by the Israeli farm were sent to Gaza. There is a very important lesson in that experience. It relates to the discussion Deputy Bríd Smith and I had with farmers the other day. The matter has been highlighted by the Ukraine crisis. We believed we were feeding the world but discovered we were not when the Ukraine crisis arose. We rear many cows and export them and many dairy-related products but we could be in danger of not being able to feed ourselves, or even the cows, because we do not grow enough grain, vegetables and other foods. That we import these products and that they are transported all across the world means more chemicals and plastic, the emission of more fumes, more waste and more destruction of the environment rather than diversifying agriculture to produce food locally so we do not need loads of chemicals and plastic packaging. Diversifying agriculture would give us food security, reduce waste and give a more certain existence to farmers and others, but we would have to support our farmers in doing so. That is the logic of the way neoliberal capitalism operates. I know people do not like it when we use these slogans, but that is the truth. Capitalism specialises in the production of cheap products on massive scales for exports to the market, not for production for need at a local level. The consequences for the environment are disastrous. I will give another simple example. When I and the Ceann Comhairle were young, we used to get milk delivered by milkmen in glass bottles. We left the empty bottles out every day and they were reused over and over again. When I worked in the Netherlands, the same was done with beer bottles. When people bought Heineken or Amstel, they had to bring the bottles back to the shop where they bought them. We bought more and got money back when we brought the bottles back. The bottles were used over and over again. Then we got Tetra Pak, which involved massive amounts of carbon that are a complete waste of resources. That happened somebody was able to make money out of it. It was all about the commodification of these things rather than doing things in a rational way. It is all very well talking about the circular economy, which I am in favour of, but I want to stress that we are letting loose the forces that are destroying the circular economy. We have to give local authorities the necessary staffing, resources and infrastructure required for a circular economy. The Minister of State knows this. In our area we do not have anything near like the numbers of staff in the cleansing department that are needed. People have to have a massive fight to get a bin anywhere. We do not have anything like the resources necessary in local authorities to provide for the recycling, reuse and so on that we would need to have a meaningful circular economy.
