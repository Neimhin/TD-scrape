I am trying to double job. I appreciate the enormous contribution AHBs make to providing social and affordable housing. I do not doubt their motives and the good work they have done. However, I am worried about their campaign. I understand they are in a dilemma that is not of their making. They are responding pragmatically to a dilemma created for them, essentially by the fiscal rules. The reclassification we need is in how social and affordable housing is treated by the fiscal rules. We would be far better advised campaigning on that than campaigning for it to come off balance sheet. I am deeply concerned about that. I know why they are doing it and I do not doubt their good motives, but fundamentally I think they are making a mistake. As the witnesses have put very starkly, the chickens are coming home to roost on the folly of the fiscal rules, which now essentially prevent states building public and affordable housing using their own money and their own resources. It is shocking that if Brexit hits us hard or some economic downturn hits us, the State could be prohibited from building public and affordable housing. We need to say loud and clear that it is outrageous and unacceptable. Because we are in that space, the housing bodies are being put under pressure to find other forms of financing and essentially fragment the social and affordable housing system, which fundamentally has to be about subsidised housing and has nothing to do with the market. Surely that is what public and affordable housing is about.I would like to hear our guests' views on that. We discussed with the NDFA the dilemma that Clúid, I think, has in Enniskerry.

That is the pressure they are put under. Said pressure is going to be exacerbated. The more housing bodies have to do to get this off their balance sheets, the more they potentially come under pressure from private financial lenders on which they must rely in order to improve their balance sheets. While I do not doubt the bona fides of the AHBs, there are questions regarding their becoming corporatised in other jurisdictions. I was in a bar in Dún Laoghaire when I was approached by a man who told me that he is involved with a hedge fund in New York that is considering moving into social housing in Ireland. The alarm bells started ringing as to what its agenda is in wanting to move into social housing. By moving into this space, housing bodies are opening up the danger of affordable and social housing becoming corporatised where profit motives come into play. I know that the bodies represented here today do not have them, but I fear that is the door they are opening. I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. A serious debate is starting on how capital expenditure generally is treated under the fiscal rules. It is not working. It is not necessary to be a left-winger; very mainstream people are saying there is something wrong with how they are designed and particularly with how they treat capital expenditure. Nowhere is this truer than in the area of public and affordable housing. We need to say that. I am sure many people in Europe will back us up in stating that these rules need to change because they are pushing us towards the privatisation or worse the potential extinction of public housing as we know it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is very positive. It does not surprise me that Mr. Dunne would say that and it echoes the points I put to him. It is important that that statement comes out. What the witnesses have said here is very stark and very worrying. We must say in the loudest possible way that the Government must go to Europe and make it a priority that public and affordable housing would be treated differently under the fiscal rules, because otherwise we could find ourselves in a position where we are not allowed to spend money on public and affordable housing. That is just unacceptable. Arguably, about 70% of people are being left out of the market and there is no chance that the private market will deliver for them. That number is rising, whether it relates to affordable, public or intermediate in terms of controlled rents. That is the space we are in. The proportions in Rebuilding Ireland are the opposite way around in what it hopes to deliver, as was noted in the opening statement. Would Mr. Dunne agree that is a message? Perhaps the witnesses are careful about what it tells the Government to say and do, but we really need to send out that message. I am concerned about the pressure the associations are under. I qualify everything by acknowledging they are trying to do the right thing and have a record of doing so. In my area, Dún Laoghaire, it seems that, whether it is the local authority, the Government or whoever else is making the decisions about whether things should go to approved housing bodies or the local authority, a big and growing proportion seems to be loaded on the AHBs. Certainly in my area, there is a reluctance on the local authority's part to do it. I am worried that the pressure is building. Does it put the associations under new pressures? It seems that it does.  A big issue in public housing provision is welfare related matters. Local authority welfare teams are under-resourced and barely able to cope. I suspect that the AHBs have even fewer resources to deal with welfare issues. One ends up with tiers of support because of the pressure being exerted and the lack of resources. It all becomes more fragmented. There is even a problem in arranging transfers. One association might have particular housing stock that has one or two bedrooms and there is the question of whether someone who has children can secure a transfer. It proves difficult because the system is fragmented. It is a big problem and I am interested in learning how the delegates see it. There is a need for much more integration and consistency in the provision of support and resources. There are those who are above the thresholds which are ridiculously low and who are caught in no man's land. Last week I put the following point to representatives of the National Development Finance Agency. They did not disagree, although it was obviously difficult for them to say things, that affordability should be based on a proportion of income and that the affordable scheme should be back fitted to ensure that would be the case, rather than being dependent on site-specific costs, specific servicing costs or whatever else. It is crazy. Something is either affordable for ordinary people on average incomes or it is not. Surely it cannot be dependent on peculiarities, geographical position or specific site characteristics or from where the finance is coming.
