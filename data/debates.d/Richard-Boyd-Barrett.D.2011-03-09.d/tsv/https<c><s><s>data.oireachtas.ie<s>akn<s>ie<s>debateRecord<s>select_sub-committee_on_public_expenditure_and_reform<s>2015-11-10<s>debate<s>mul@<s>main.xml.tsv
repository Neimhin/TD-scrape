RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To amplify the same argument, there is no emergency anymore. In fact, the only emergency is in the areas of housing and health. One could argue there is also an emergency in terms of poverty and deprivation, given that these conditions have increased exponentially. Any of the crises that has developed is linked, at least, to income cuts, of which the FEMPI legislation was a significant element in its imposition of reduced incomes on low and middle income earners and the knock-on effects on the economy and society. I did not agree with that income slashing, even during the crisis; I believed it was counterproductive and made a bad situation worse. Whatever about the justifications for it at the time, it seems that there is absolutely no justification for continuing emergency legislation that preserves many of the cuts and the deterioration in pay and conditions imposed under a heading, "Emergency Measures". It keeps them in place. It only partially gives back to people what they lost and still withholds a great deal in terms of pay and conditions. People lost vast amounts. I do not see how the Government can justify doing this. If anything, now is the time to give back what was taken in full because of the enormous sacrifices people made in the context of an emergency. The Government's attitude and response will determine how people will view what the recession meant because the Government narrative is, "We did not really like doing this, but we had to do it because it was an emergency".  Another widely believed narrative, to which I subscribe, is that the Government and the European elites generally pursued a strategy of "Never waste a good crisis" to get through measures they would unable to if they did not declare an emergency or if there was not an emergency atmosphere and will keep as much of it in place for as long as they can-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should look at the facts. A useful document was handed to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough. However, given that most of the amendments have been ruled out of order because they would impose a charge on the Exchequer and that we will be unable to speak to them, we might as well set out our stall.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is true. IMPACT Dún Laoghaire branch produced a leaflet with a table showing how much public sector workers at different pay levels had lost during the emergency years annually and overall. A worker on €30,000 lost €16,000; a worker on €40,000 lost €27,000; and a worker on €50,000 lost €38,000. Under the Lansdowne Road proposals provided for in the legislation €4,000 would be given back against the figures of €16,000, €27,000 and €38,000. That is pathetic if there is not an emergency which the Government claims is the case Does the Minister recognise the increasing consensus among a cohort of analysts, economists and so on who consider income inequality to be the major contributory factor to economic instability and crisis? He may be familiar with a brilliant paper by Paul Sweeney, entitled Wage Drift, which I read recently. It outlines the reduction in the share of total national income, GDP, represented by labour and wages, as opposed to capital, and shows that Ireland is one of the worst countries in this regard. We have had one of the greatest reductions in the OECD in wages' share of the national economic cake since the 1970s. Surely that is another reason the Government should radically reverse the cuts in income. This should be done not only because it is unfair to people who have made such sacrifices during the so-called emergency.It is also sound economic policy to give something back to workers, to narrow the income inequality gap that has grown and to rebalance wage share in terms of the wider economic cake. Does the Minister not agree that needs to be done as a matter of urgency? It is not what has been done in this budget and this legislation does not do it in anything other than a tokenistic way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will correct the Minister's interpretation of what I said. I was not applauding the Government for getting us to where we are now. I made exactly the opposite point, which was-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. I am saying it has nothing to do with the wage gouging and income gouging that the Government engaged in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. It relates to the ups and downs of the global economy, and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The measures the Government took under the guise of financial emergency measures made the situation worse, prolonged the crisis and worsened the impact of the crisis on the economy and our citizens. My take is that it made things worse. The reason Greece is worse is not because the Greeks did not do that but because they did. They had even more extreme emergency income and wage gouging and that is why their economy collapsed. The IMF acknowledged that it got its multipliers wrong in this regard. It admitted the extent of the adverse impact on economies as a result of slashing the incomes of low and middle-income people was much bigger than it anticipated using its multipliers. The logic of admitting that is that cutting pay for low and middle-income people was the wrong thing to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I gave the figures. To cut a very long story short, at the end of the period envisaged in this legislation covered by the Lansdowne Road agreement between now and 2018, someone who was earning €30,000 in 2009 will still be earning less than they earned in 2009. It is the same for those on €40,000 or €50,000. At the end of this so-called restoration of pay they will be earning less than they were in 2009. Nine years after the crisis they will not have had their pay restored, which represents a massive gouging of income at a time of growth in the economy. When those two things are put together, it means that the benefits of the economic growth are not going to low and middle-income people but are going elsewhere. We have considerable evidence of where they are going which is that the wealth of the richest in Irish society has grown exponentially during the period of the so-called emergency and is continuing to grow. The millionaires and billionaires have got richer during this period. I agree that we should collapse the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation. It would be very good to have to give a €2.2 billion injection to low and middle-income earners and would be good for the economy, not bad for the economy. I accept it would have to be taken from elsewhere and the place to get it is from those at the very top who have massively increased their wealth and assets during the crisis. That would be fair and it would also be a good economic move because it would address the issue I raised with the Minister of wage drift - the reducing share of the national economic cake that is going to wages. The Minister did not respond to that point, but it is a fact. Is that something the Minister wants to do? Paul Sweeney, among others, has said that that reduced share of national income that is going to wages is a very bad thing and needs to be reversed. Does the Minister recognise that? If he does, the Government would need to take radical emergency measures in the opposite direction. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not drifting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am responding to the Minister's-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It turns on the question of whether it is an emergency. The Minister has not responded to this. Is it an emergency? Are we in the emergency, out of the emergency or on the way out of the emergency? If the Minister is claiming we are out of the emergency, why do we have an emergency Bill? Why is the Minister retaining a range of the elements he put in place for cutting wages with most of those cuts remaining place? We have not mentioned the deterioration in conditions, the unpaid work, the increase in working hours, the reduction in the annual leave allowance, restrictions on flexi-time, the new sick leave scheme, halving entitlement to sick pay, the power for the Minister to freeze increments. Why do all those remain in place if we are out of the emergency? Yet the Minister is retaining them in this legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Wealth and capital tax increases.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will send the Minister a copy of our budget submission.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister knows then what I am proposing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not as fanciful as the Minister's talk of a recovery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To what section is the Minister referring?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the thrust of the amendments. It is important to say that in proposing such amendments, or supporting them in my case, although they are in line with my party's broad policy on these matters, there is no vendetta against politicians, Ministers or those earning over €100,000. It is about saying a person who earned €30,000 in 2009 will at the end of this deal still earn less than €30,000. At the end of it he or she will earn €29,500. Similarly, on restoration, a person earning €40,000 will receive €2,000 out of the more than €4,000 that was taken from his or her annual income. A person earning €50,000 will see a restoration of €2,000 of the total of €5,825 taken from him or her. These figures have been provided by the IMPACT trade union. The people on these incomes are the very ones who cannot afford to pay their rent or bills or who are suffering mortgage distress. They are the victims of the housing crisis and their need is greater. Faced with the options available, should it not be a priority for the Government to give back as much as possible to the people in question who lhave difficulty in paying their rent and bills. I do not exaggerate when I say I am dealing with low paid public servants who have been made homeless. That is what is happening. It is against that background that I say the following without hostility or vitriol towards a politician earning €89,000, or a Minister who has voluntarily but not statutorily been excluded. The same applies to a consultant earning over €100,000 a year.Given the choice of giving pay restoration to those who, let us be honest can manage reasonably comfortably, as against people who cannot pay the bills or the rent, I know where our priorities should be. I am convinced our priority has to be to put people back in a position where they can simply make ends meet. That should also be the Minister's priority. I accept there is a difficulty with consultants but when one listens to what they are saying, the majority say the problem is the disaster in the health service. It is stress that they cannot bear. They do not know what to do, or which way to turn because things are such a mess.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure pay has something to do with it but there are bigger contributory factors at play. When one is at that level of pay it is not only about the pay levels because they are adequate to keep a roof over your head. I do believe most doctors in Ireland want to get out of the country but a combination of issues is leading them to leave.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. Much of it has to do with the complete mess in the health service. The other side of the coin in the health service is the nurses. We have a huge deficit in nurses. They are on the low to middle end of the pay scale. Getting them to return to Ireland has to do with both the crisis in the health service and what they are dealing with and also pay, for very good reason. This is a basic consideration. If one were a nurse in England or elsewhere, one would look at what is on offer in Ireland and ask whether the salary would cover accommodation costs. That is the key point to consider. Can the rent be paid and the answer is "No" for people on low and middle incomes. That is what the Minister needs to address.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister mentioned section 6A.(7) and stated that once the pay restoration brought a person's pay above the pay level they were at when the emergency measures were introduced, ,then the increase would take effect, in other words the person would start to move into plus territory over and above what they were earning in 2009. Is it not a fact that for vast numbers of public servants who are on low and middle incomes, none will move into the plus territory by the end of 2018, which is the end of the Lansdowne Road agreement? My reference for this point is the table produced by IMPACT. I know it is different across the public sector but clearly this table shows that in 2018, people on incomes of €30,000, €40,000 and €50,000, which are the examples given, will still be earning less than they were earning in 2009. The legislation may indicate otherwise but it will not happen in reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the figure I have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am referring to figures that I was given here. The Minister said the pay cut was €2,600.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In total, it was €2,600 by 2010. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was €1,500.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but when one adds subsequent measures - I am looking at the list which includes the pension levy and pay cuts - the total offered in the figures is €2,600 as the total reduction on an income of €30,000. By 2018, they will only have received €2,000 of this back, which means that they will still be €600 short.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the the figure I have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment is in my name and those of Deputies Stephen S. Donnelly and Mary Lou McDonald. It seeks to delete the references to withdrawing increments which is allowed under the original Act. In his response the Minister said the trade unions were fully entitled to say no-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and that should not be punished or have the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads in the form of the Minister having the power to withhold increments to which its members were entitled. To refer back to our last discussion, what may explain the difference between the Minister's figures and those provided by IMPACT is precisely the issue of increments being withheld. This adds substantially to the loss people suffered as a result of the emergency measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pardon.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They had average figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One must average.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The provision on the withholding of increments should go. Workers are entitled to receive their increments; as I mentioned earlier, it is not just about pay. Restoration is also about other things done in the rubric of emergency measures. It is not just about the Minister's approach to negotiating with trade unions. Let us be honest. Everybody who ultimately signed up to the agreement would prefer if all of the financial emergency measures in the public interest cuts, curtailments and reductions were restored. That is what they want. The Minister convinced them or their trade union representatives-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that, but the logic was that something was better than nothing. The Minister should not tell me that they would not prefer to get back everything that they lost or that they are happy about the things that they still have not got back and will not for some time. That would be to construe they vote in a way that does not match reality. What is the Minister's justification for continuing to withhold increments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just because the Minister says that does not make it true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not disparage them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about my amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I wish to comment on the section and that particular aspect of it. If there was no Landsdowne Road agreement, this provision would expire and the Minister's capacity under this legislation to withhold increments would not exist. That was the basis under which certain trade unions took the view that the road to the restoration of pay and conditions was not to sign up to a deal which would extend or continue those constraints. They were right to adopt that position and the Minister is wrong to continue with them. We have already dealt with the issue of pay but on the issue of increments, what is the justification for the Minister having the power to withhold them from anybody? That is my question because I do not believe there is any justification for that. The Minister has put his argument as to why he cannot give full pay restoration. I do not accept his argument but we have already had that debate. Will he explain why, in addition to not giving full pay restoration, he also believes it is acceptable and legitimate to withhold increments if workers do not agree with him and to hold that over them, effectively, as a threat?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, the Minister is not answering my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is repeating what he said earlier.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister still has not really dealt with the specific question I asked about increments. He has made a general argument and wheeled out the usual talk about fantasy economics. We can both trade insults forever but I am asking a question about increments. We have already dealt with the argument about pay and now we are talking about increments. This is about the Minister continuing to give to himself the power to withhold increments and I do not believe that is justified. I do not believe it was justified back then but we can set that aside. What justification is there now for the Minister giving himself the power to withhold increments if people do not come to a particular agreement with him? It is interesting that the Minister used the word "discipline", particularly given that he mentioned earlier that he comes from a trade union family. He is now talking about disciplining trade unionists and workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the word he used-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister might respond to a specific point on increments. If he withholds those increments, the affected workers will be an increment behind for the rest of their careers.That is a form of punishment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am confused as to why amendments Nos. 18 and 19 were allowed but these have not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we speaking on the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I convey this point on behalf of teachers but it probably relates to others who had expectations under the Haddington Road agreement that were not met as a result of the Lansdowne Road agreement. They would see it as the power to withhold things they understood they would get under the Haddington Road agreement. The example given is of teachers who received an annual payment of €1,592 for supervision and substitution that was withdrawn under the Haddington Road agreement with the understanding that it would be reinstated after three years. This Bill now gives the Minister the power not to give it back to them unless they sign up to one of the sectoral agreements. How would the Minister respond to that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister saying there was not an understanding in the Haddington Road agreement that this payment would be restored?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the duration of the Haddington Road agreement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will consult and return to the Minister on Report Stage.
