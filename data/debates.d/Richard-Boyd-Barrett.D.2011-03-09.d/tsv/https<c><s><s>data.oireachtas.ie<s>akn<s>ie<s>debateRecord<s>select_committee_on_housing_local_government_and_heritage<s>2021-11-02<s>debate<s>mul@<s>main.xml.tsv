RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of this series of amendments is to ensure that we have a proper planning approach, that is, a plan-led approach to the development and protection of our marine area and resources and, in particular, to ensure compliance with the marine spatial planning directives and the protections and requirements of those directives, which are about having a proper planning regime for managing our marine resources. Last weekend, I took the time to read the December 2020 report entitled Building Offshore Wind by the lobbying group on behalf of the wind energy industry. I did so in advance of a public meeting we held on this issue last night. It might be of interest to the Minister of State that the meeting was packed with people who are very concerned. The overwhelming sentiment at the meeting was that we absolutely need to develop offshore wind and address the climate crisis but there is deep concern and anxiety that we do not have a plan-led approach but, rather, a developer-led approach. The detail of the report by Wind Energy Ireland, WEI, which has been lobbying very hard, is damning in this regard. In the document, WEI explicitly states on several occasions that we need a developer-led approach and rails against a plan-led approach. It explicitly states that private developers and the industry should decide site selection. This is a key issue. It came across very strongly at the meeting last night that if the industry selects the sites, then we can forget about the maritime area regulatory authority and all this legislation because there actually is a momentum under way which determines the outcome or is very likely to do so. This industry is explicitly saying it should decide how we do the development offshore and that we should not plan. However, the directives insist on planning and a plan-led approach. That approach should start with the selection of sites but that is not what is happening. It is not what is happening with the designation of projects. WEI is lobbying for a new category, one that does not appear anywhere in the directives, whereby the industry selects the sites. Let us be absolutely clear that what is of concern to us and why we are trying to lock in specific protections and a sustainable approach that is contained in the marine spatial planning directives and the various directives such as the habitats directive, the birds directive and so on is that we have a plan-led approach. That means plans that take into consideration all of the environmental concerns and that the concerns in respect of sustainable and appropriate uses of the marine area should determine where things happen. Our concern is that is not what is going on. What is actually going on is that the industry does not want a plan-led approach and it seems that it is being facilitated in that regard, particularly under this notion of relevant projects. They are getting a special pass. The industry explicitly opposes a plan-led approach. We want this locked into the legislation to apply to all parties. We want it to start with the issue of site selection and go all the way through the process that there is a plan-led approach which is about appropriate development that ensures we protect biodiversity and marine resources and put things where they should be put rather than where developers who are concerned with profit want them. That is the logic behind this. It starts with planning, which is in the EU directives. A proper and appropriate plan-led approach, not a developer-led approach, should be locked in to the whole process from beginning to end. That is our concern. Anyone who reads the comments of WEI will see where our concerns come from.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State giving us a cast-iron guarantee that development consents will not be given until we have plans that designate what is and what is not appropriate, which areas of the marine are appropriate for particular types of development? Consents should not be given until applications have, if you like, gone through the proper process of environmental impact assessment, full compliance with the habitats directive, the birds directive and the marine spatial planning directive. In other words, we must ensure we have the plan first. We need to properly and forensically assess these matters to protect biodiversity, fishers, our coastal amenities, areas that need special protection and so on. Will the Minister of State guarantee that development consents will not be given until mapping of the marine area has taken place? Decisions must be made on the basis of proper marine spatial planning that complies with all the relevant directives and environmental impact assessments. Consents should not be given otherwise. Decisions must not be made by developers. Is it potentially the case that sites which have been selected by the developers themselves will get development consents prior to all of those assessments? That is the key question and what we need to know. I hope the Minister of State will give us assurances and we will not have huge developments that effectively become a fait accompli before we have done the mapping of what needs to be protected, what is sensitive, and all the screening, if you like, for environmental impact assessment that should take place if we are not going to repeat the Wild West approach to development we have sometimes taken on land. Those are the assurances we need. The reason for these amendments is precisely because we are trying to lock that in. In amendment No. 79, for example, we suggest that in accordance with Article 8 of the marine spatial planning directive, we should "identify the spatial and temporal distribution of relevant, existing and future activities and uses in the marine waters of the Marine Spatial Plan the competent authority is preparing". We want the thing mapped out. Where is it appropriate to do certain things and where is it not? We should ask has there been a proper process in making those decisions before we start lashing out development consents for big industrial development in our marine areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public feels developers are always not one but ten steps ahead in terms of knowledge of plans. It is felt that the public is the last to know about anything and, insofar as consultation takes place, it is a tick-box exercise. It is minimal and, as we noted earlier, often happens around August or December. People find out at the last minute that they are to be consulted and there is a feeling that many things are faits accomplis. There is a need to tightly define and ensure the most thoroughgoing, rigorous, open, transparent process of public consultation and participation. I hate the world "consultation". There should be public participation in the planning of our regulation and management of our marine area and resources. People want that and they want to be confident. What is set out in the directives, the Aarhus Convention and so on is precisely that. The definition of sustainable planning and development is that the public is part of it. The public is not incidental to planning and development but a critical part of it and often has the greatest knowledge. We will move onto MARA and the personnel who will oversee these things but who are the experts? One of the key groups of experts is the public, most often, or the stakeholders in a particular area. They are often not seen as such, but as a pain in the neck to be overcome, certainly by developers as demonstrated in some of their documents. We are trying to ensure that public involvement is thoroughgoing, that the public know and that there is no question of people not knowing.  The Minister of State looked favourably on the suggestion that we move from traditional newspaper media to radio advertising and stuff like that and hopefully that will be reflected in Government amendments before we get to Report Stage. It is so everybody knows something important is happening that affects the marine area where they operate or that is close to them. That is what we are looking for and no vagueness or get-out clauses, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan pointed to. That is the logic of these amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very keen that the people who may be listening in to this debate will understand. We are genuinely interrogating this because we want to understand fully and for the legislation to be as good as it can be. When a development plan is being put together there are people in the council department, for example, who may have developed a knowledge and experience over many years in the particular parts for which they are responsible for the drafts. There is a certain experience and knowledge and so on. Then there is the established process, which we are always trying to improve, of public participation in that. We are in new territory here. One of the things I was very struck by in the industry lobbying, or their vision document, is that essentially they were saying "we have the expertise and nobody else has the expertise". This was their justification for having a developer-led approach: "we know the stuff and nobody else does". The question is about who the competent authority is and what sort of expert advice they will depend on for the drafting of plans. This notion that developers are experts - and one can see why they would want this - and that everybody else does not really know what they are talking about is not the way things are going to be. As we have said, the huge amount of knowledge and expertise we actually need to input into maritime spatial plans is that of the real stakeholders: the people who know the area, the people who live in the area and people like the fishers and others who know a particular maritime environment.  I echo the questions about the public participation statement and seek some elaboration on that. It is stated the Minister may, by regulation, specify those requirements so the Minister of State might explain why this is just "may". The logic of our amendments is to try to tie down the requirements in terms of public participation in the development of marine spatial plans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to hear the Minister of State's response on that. I have a supplementary question but he might answer those questions now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. The Minister of State is lauding the public participation process he went through and I take him at his word at some level. I was not particularly aware of how it all went. I am not commenting on the process. The people I am speaking to, however, who have a concern in this matter do not understand how the relevant projects got slipped in on that basis to the national marine planning framework. There is much concern and anger about that. Following from that, is it the case the extended public participation in the development of marine spatial plans is done and dusted for six years?There is serious concern about the inclusion of these relevant projects in the national marine planning framework in advance of the sort of detailed marine spatial planning we need to have in advance of major developments in the marine. That is the concern. If it were six years, a lot can happen and a lot of damage can be done in six years. Another matter of considerable concern is the potential for Ministers to walk away from public participation statements that is created by the use in the Bill of language such as "may" and changes as "considered necessary or expedient" in respect of revising statements and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Article 9 of the MSP directive states, among other things, that "Member States shall establish means of public participation by informing all interested parties and by consulting the relevant stakeholders and authorities, and the public concerned, at an early stage in the development of maritime spatial plans". It goes on to state "Member States shall also ensure that the relevant stakeholders and authorities, and the public concerned, have access to the plans once they are finalised." That is pretty strong. Section 17(1)(a) specifies that the competent authority has to comply, or ensure compliance, with the requirements of MSP directive, but, for some odd reason, the strong statement in Article 9, which insists on a certain amount of public information, is omitted. There are other articles but Article 9, the one that is strong in the directive and which is on public participation, is omitted. While section 17 outlines that the competent authority must comply, or ensure compliance with the requirements of the directive, the section on giving effect, section 18, is a bit wishy-washy, in our opinion. That is the concern. The Minister of State has not really explained why Article 9 is not explicitly referred to so as to let us know what the competent authority must ensure compliance with in respect of the directive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an impressive document. Well done to the officials. We have a sense of humour too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it online but I have not had a hard copy. I prefer hard copies. A framework is not a plan. My concern is that six years is a long time before we have a proper plan with all the public participation, the environmental assessment and, as has been mentioned, the marine protected areas. Why six years? Can the Minister of State explain why we have this figure of six years, particularly because the concern is that a framework is a little vague whereas a plan is not so vague?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A framework is not a plan. That is the concern.A framework is a framework for planning; it is not a plan. That six-year delay in having proper plans is a concern.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment is also in my name.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 84 is a technical amendment, so I am talking about amendment No. 85.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As has been said, many potential implications arise from the development of the marine area. All the relevant organisations, bodies and stakeholders should be consulted in any review of a marine spatial plan or the national marine planning framework. We mention in this regard examples such heritage, which is incredibly important. One of the things pointed out at a public meeting last night was that there are many wrecks on the Kish Bank, where the construction of the Dublin Array offshore wind farm project is planned, including the HMS Leinster. In the area of heritage as well, Dublin Bay is also a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, designated biosphere, and, again, this is the area that will be impacted by this proposed development. Therefore, we must examine all the possible impacts from every conceivable stakeholder perspective. We have listed in the amendment all the relevant Departments to ensure that there is compliance with the various directives relating to habitats and birds, environmental impact assessments, etc. Perhaps the Minister of State or his officials could answer one question that I was asked in this regard. I did not know the answer when the query was put to me. Will the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have a role in assessing reviews of plans - in the context of the plans themselves - regarding proposals for development and the impact of any such development? I am curious because this question was asked and it seems like a good one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 96 proposes to delete section 19(1), relating to a marine spatial plan to which Chapter 4 applies. It states that section 19 is not to apply to plans to which Chapter 4 applies, relating to the requirement to lay the intended development plan before the Oireachtas.I would like to understand the rationale for that. I am guessing the Minister of State will say it is because it is the ones that are dealing with local authorities and where they intend to make plans. I would like to hear his explanation. I cannot see any reason to accept the requirement for the intention to make a marine spatial plan before the Oireachtas. Regarding amendment No. 97, the Bill requires that an intention to make a marine spatial plan would be laid before the Oireachtas and will have regard for recommendations of any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but it does not go as far as ours does in requiring that all committees be notified. That is quite important in that the impact of marine spatial plans can cross many areas. I suspect that many committees that might have an interest in the stuff we are discussing here are not even aware of how it may potentially impact them or for that matter how the national marine planning framework may impact things that are of concern to them. The requirement to alert all Oireachtas committees to any intention to make marine special plans is important so that they have the opportunity to give input into those and those inputs need to be taken seriously. There is a wider requirement for the public to be notified of any intention to make marine special plans. We should be thorough in ensuring that the public is made aware of that and has the opportunity to give input to such plans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As soon as this legislation is passed, can a public body seek to be designated? For example, if a local authority decided that it wanted a particular marine area, would that be limited to the nearshore area? If that area went beyond the nearshore, since it still had an interest could it request to be designated to develop this more localised form of plan? What happens if multiple public bodies have an interest in a particular area? How does that work? The Minister of State mentioned the energy regulator, heritage bodies and local authorities. They might all have interest in the same area and all wish to develop a DMAP for the same area or for areas that overlap. How will all that work? I ask the Minister of State to elaborate a bit on that. Can a body seeking to develop a DMAP for a particular area start to request designation to develop a DMAP as soon as this legislation is passed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What happens where different bodies have different interests or remits?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister would adjudicate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On my question with regard to a local authority, I take the point that if it is beyond the nearshore area it has to go before the Oireachtas. Is it conceivable that a local authority could seek to be designated to develop a plan, even for an area that is outside of the near shore activity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It might well be the case that there would be two local authorities interested. Taking Dublin Bay as an example, there would be at least two Dublin local authorities that might have an interest in such a plan. How might that work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that provided for?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it possible the local authorities and other bodies could come together to do a DMAP?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are semi-State agencies public bodies in that sense?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like first to hear the Minister of State's answer to Deputy Ó Broin's question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand. I would not mind hearing the Minister of State's response. Is that okay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is possible. Following on from that, as soon as this legislation is enacted there could conceivably be a massive race between various bodies to grab areas for DMAPs, depending on what their particular interests are. In fact, I am tempted to participate in that race in respect of certain areas. Is it a case of whatever body gets in first gets the area? If a particular Department, and the one mentioned is the very obvious one, states that it wants to get these projects through and it applies to be the competent authority for the development of that DMAP, which it might well do for that area, is it a case of "on your marks, get set, go" to grab particular areas? The local authority might state that it is concerned about the thing just out here, and that it is in a race against the Department that is primarily about advancing, for example, offshore wind. Is that the sort of scenario we could, potentially, face?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everything is in the NMPF. That is good on one level, but people might say that particular bits of the NMPF, such as the visual, tourism and heritage aspects, are in line with the DMAP they want for a particular area and they want to vindicate the objectives of the NMPF, but it might be, rather, precisely to prevent certain other types of usage taking place in particular areas. By the way, that might not be a bad thing, in certain cases. On coexistence, co-location and all of that, is it a requirement that every objective of the NMPF is in every DMAP for every localised area? Surely, it is not, because then there would be a requirement, for example, in every DMAP-designated area, to have a bit of this, that and the other thing, when it might not be suitable in certain areas to do certain things as against other things. I ask for a little clarification on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Minister makes the adjudication, if there are different people who have an interest in being the competent authority, does he or she have to take that discussion on the adjudication into the Oireachtas? Does the Minister have to consult the Oireachtas or the relevant committee before making an adjudication? If, for example, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is looking to do a DMAP and another Department is looking to be the lead body, or there are a few bodies and the Minister has to make that adjudication, does the Minister just make that decision or does he or she have to consult with the Oireachtas at some level?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not necessarily consult-----
