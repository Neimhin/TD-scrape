RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last February, the current Minister for Finance rightly stated that it was neither morally right nor economically sustainable for taxpayers to be asked to beggar themselves to make massive profits for speculators.  This is the moment in which the Government betrayed the aspirations of the people who voted for it.  Precisely that which the Minister said was unsustainable and morally wrong he now intends to do at the behest of the IMF and the EU.  He will continue the bailout of bankers and speculators and at the same time beggar ordinary workers, the poor and the vulnerable.  We are going to rob the National Pension Reserve Fund of money that could be used for jobs programmes and we are going to sink into an unsustainable morass of debt that will enslave our society for years to come.We were told these actions, unjust as they may be, would avoid the nationalisation of the banking system and get credit flowing to the economy.  It has achieved neither objective, however, and we now own the zombie banks and the economy is starved of credit even though billions of euro are flowing into the coffers of the speculators and bondholders who helped to create this crisis in the first place.The plan for Irish Life & Permanent just about sums up the affair.  We will pay €4.3 billion for the zombie part of that institution while selling off the profitable divisions which made €160 million last year.  This is not a bailout; it is collusion between the EU, the IMF, the previous Government and, tragically, the current Government to asset strip the country under cover of the economic crisis.  It is a burial rather than a bailout of our economy and society.  We have almost gone beyond the point where it is worthwhile to appeal to the Taoiseach to stop the madness but I will make a last appeal to him to stop the bailout of bankers and bondholders and the immiseration of the people.The people will have to take matters into their own hands.  We should do what the people of Iceland did when their Government refused to listen to them and attempted to implement measures such as the Minister has just announced.  We need to take to the streets to stop the madness of this bank bailout.  I appeal to people who are angry at the thought that further billions of euro will be used to bail out the bankers and bondholders to take to the streets at 6 p.m. next Wednesday to protest outside these Houses when the Technical Group puts down a motion calling for a referendum on the madness of this bank bailout and the IMF deal.  People power will be required if we are to stop this insanity.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In Irish Life & Permanent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has a profit of €160 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Its pensions division is profitable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Government parties said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to express the strongest concern about CACI (UK) Limited, the company administering the census under way in the State.  A census gathers comprehensive sensitive and personal information about every citizen and we should ensure this information is secured by those carrying out the census and that it is in the hands of a body that has no questions marks over its integrity.  CACI has serious question marks over its character and integrity on two fronts.First, the company is linked to CACI in Virginia, in the USA, which has defence contracts with the US military relating to interrogation.  Its staff were involved in interrogation in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.  Serious allegations of torture have been made by victims, and lawsuits are pending against the company because of its involvement in the horrendous atrocities that took place in that prison.  To avoid prosecution on these matters, CACI has claimed immunity in the US on the ground that it was working for the US military.  On 11 September 2009, a US court of appeal ruled that the company fell under the US military chain of command and thus has government contractor immunity.  In other words, a company that is under the American military chain of command according to the US courts is organising our census.  I find it worrying that such a company will have access to the most comprehensive and sensitive information about our citizens.When this issue emerged while a census was being conducted by the company in Scotland, the Registrar General accepted there was a serious problem because the USA PATRIOT Act 2001 gives the American Government the right to demand or to take, even without its knowledge, any information it wants from any American company.  The Registrar General acknowledged this was a serious problem.  If the US Government wants our census information, it can simply demand it of CACI.  This is aside from the company's involvement in the horrors at Abu Ghraib prison and the fact that victims of that horror are trying to take legal action but are being blocked at every level.Amnesty International and other human rights organisations have conveyed serious concern about CACI's human rights record.  This is not acceptable.  What guarantees will the Government give that this comprehensive sensitive and personalised information about every citizen in the State is secure?  A declaration signed by the company means nothing in the context of the USA PATRIOT Act and the abominable record of CACI.  What will the Government do about this serious issue?
