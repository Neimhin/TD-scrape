RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for their attendance. I always find our engagements interesting. The council's reports contain weeks of reading. The information is always interesting. I want to follow up on the questions asked by Deputy Humphreys by asking about alternatives that could be considered. I apologise for not being here for the entire meeting as I wanted to be. I was in and out of the Dáil. When we propose alternatives to property taxes or cuts in public expenditure, for example by suggesting that the rate of tax imposed on those on higher incomes or corporation tax should be increased, we are usually rubbished as living in cloud-cuckoo land and told we are engaging in fantasy economics. The debate does not go much further than that. Frankly, that does the debate a disservice. What would the witnesses say in response to the proposition that we need to look at alternative scenarios, particularly given that pretty mainstream people - even bondholders quite recently - are now saying that austerity has reached its limits and is potentially becoming counter-productive as it is applied across Europe? One of the big trading houses - I think it is called Pimco - recently said that the effect of austerity on growth is worrying. This is one of the entities that is dictating our future. The same people who panicked because we were not imposing enough austerity are potentially going to panic because we have imposed too much austerity and it could cripple growth. Is the council looking at alternative scenarios as part of its monitoring of our macroeconomic strategy? What would it say? Our view, following on from what Professor Barrett said, is that all taxes are taxes on income. What would the witnesses say to that? We do not think there is a dichotomy between fairness and economic efficiency. We would say that if something is fair, by definition, it will be more efficient. What would the witnesses say in response to that proposition? We are dealing with human beings rather than with abstract categories. If one is fairer, one will motivate people to do more and to generate more economic activity and growth. If one is unfair, one will demoralise and depress people and, in the process, depress the economy which they comprise. In light of that analysis, should we not explore whether we should use redistributive taxes such as corporation tax and higher income taxes to take back some of the money that is locked up at the top of the economy and put it back into investment, growth and employment measures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not asking the witnesses to agree with me. I am merely asking whether we should be looking at these scenarios.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to elaborate on this question a little. Maybe others would like to comment. I take Dr. Donovan's point. The lines begin to get very blurry when one examines the matter a little. It seems to me that the council believes it has a role in examining what might happen if we do not make the adjustment. It considers whether we might meet certain targets. The issue of unemployment is considered when it is making its projections. It looks at what certain decisions might do to the rate of unemployment. That is where it begins to get tricky. I would argue - it is just my view - that if we took an additional €4 billion in tax from the corporate sector instead of taking it from low and middle income workers, and if we invested €4 billion in public works programmes to develop renewable energy, forestry or generic medicines, to give three examples, this would be a far more efficient form of expenditure and would have a positive impact on our deficit, unemployment, etc. Why would the council not look at that, given that it looks at why we must make cuts in public expenditure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to ask two more brief questions that require very short answers. Maybe I will get an opportunity to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue of housing was raised. Evidence is emerging that we have a shortage of housing in areas of housing need. This is about to create a problem, not from the point of view of those who want houses, which is my concern, but from the point of view of the impact this shortage could have on the economy. Is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council concerned about his looming problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, on projections for unemployment, which I could not find among the tables, is it the case that if we continue to pursue the current adjustment path, unemployment will be approximately 13% when the programme expires in late 2015? In other words, if we meet all the targets and everything goes well, we will still have more than 400,000 people unemployed. Is this a concern for the council to the extent that it may perhaps consider the issue? How is the sale of State assets connected to the arithmetic the council is monitoring? I am delighted that none of the sales of State assets committed to under the troika programme has been realised. What requirements are there in this regard if we are to meet the targets set out by the council? How soon must these asset sales take place to keep everything on track from the point of view of the council?
