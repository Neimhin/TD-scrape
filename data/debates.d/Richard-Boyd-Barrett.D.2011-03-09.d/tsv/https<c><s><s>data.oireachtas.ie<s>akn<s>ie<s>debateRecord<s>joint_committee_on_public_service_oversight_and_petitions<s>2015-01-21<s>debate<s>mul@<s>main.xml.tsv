RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a Dáil vote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Gaynor saying that only 1,400 people-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise to Deputy Harrington, but this is interesting. Effectively, 1% of the workforce goes into retirement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Gaynor for his petition and submission and for raising what is an important debate, certainly one that has educated me - I apologise for being a little bit late, but I had to attend something prior to this meeting - on many aspects of what is quite a complicated situation, given the many different types of pensioner. We need to have a serious discussion on this matter. For those of us who are at an age when, having not done so to date, we must start thinking about such issues, the debate Mr. Gaynor has raised will be helpful. I am sympathetic to what Mr. Gaynor is saying. His main point seems to be that a private sector employee who has worked for all of his or her life and made contributions will be substantially disadvantaged compared with a public sector employee who started working before certain dates. Incredibly, the issue to do with Ministers is sickening. I do not know how Mr. Gaynor is not in a rage about how anyone elected before a certain year was ring-fenced. Was it 2004?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is unbelievable. Apparently, what is good for the goose is not good for the gander. We should be outraged and insist that people receive equal treatment. Whatever about the situation in future, which is something that we need to discuss, it is outrageous that politicians would insulate themselves from the changes they were making. I accept that the new kids on the block got hit as well, but rightly so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the people who are still sitting in the Dáil, some of whom are Ministers, there can be no reason for specifically insulating themselves other than the fact that they had expectations before the changes were made, but tough luck to Mr. Gaynor and other private sector workers who will just have to suck it up. It is extraordinary. I thank Mr. Gaynor for highlighting this issue. Despite the circumstances, he has been calm in putting it across. He should be outraged. He is seeking equality for private sector workers caught in this unfair and discriminatory position. Essentially, they should also be ring-fenced against these changes, after which we could discuss the issue. I agree with Mr. Gaynor, who probably knows much more than me, but I always revert to a point. It relates to one of my strongest memories from sixth class or first or second year in school in the early 1980s. The geography books of the time claimed that, due to advances in technology and how it would be labour saving, more wealth would be produced and productivity would increase, but that the amount of labour people would have to do to produce that wealth would be considerably less. According to the books, there would be shorter working lives and a shorter working week, meaning that society's main problem would be what to do with all of that leisure time. This was completely logical, yet we have got ourselves into a situation-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----where the exact opposite is happening. It is extraordinary and bizarre. The books were being rational in claiming that our working lives and week should be shorter. That was the expectation in the late 1960s right up to the early 1980s, but we have gone in the opposite direction. People living longer is now a problem and a cost, and we must make them work longer. Where did all of the wealth that was produced as a result of the increased productivity go? The amount of wealth that our society has produced has increased exponentially, so we should be able to afford people living longer. It should not be a problem. Mr. Gaynor is correct in that is it not a problem objectively. Rather, it is a problem because the system is structured incorrectly and the people who benefited from the exponential growth in wealth are not the ones who did the work and made the contributions. We must debate this issue. To be clear, Mr. Gaynor is proposing that we revert to the 65-year mark and that we should not entertain an increase in the working lifetime unless that is what individuals want to do on a voluntary basis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does Mr. Gaynor hope we will do now? I agree with what he says. He raises important issues that we - not just the committee but the political system and our society - must confront. What does he hope will come out of this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are also receiving jobseeker's allowance at the same time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it included?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been contacted by a couple of people who have been caught in having to sign on for the year between their 65th and 66th birthdays. Has Mr. Gaynor a view on that requirement? It seems preposterous that people are put on jobseeker's allowance for that year. They must go through all the hoops to get jobseeker's allowance, with labour activation, questions about whether they are looking for a job, and all the rest.
