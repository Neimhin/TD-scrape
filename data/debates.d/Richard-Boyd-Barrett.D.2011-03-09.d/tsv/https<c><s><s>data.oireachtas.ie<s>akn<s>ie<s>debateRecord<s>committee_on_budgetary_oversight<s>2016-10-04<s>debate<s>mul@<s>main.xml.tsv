RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which graph are we on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a nagging feeling about this whole session. I am wondering exactly what we are doing here. I know that all this technical work has to be done. When the witnesses say that the risks are all tilted on the downside, it is at that point that I begin to wonder the extent to which all of this goes out the window if certain of those risks materialise. What precisely are we supposed to do about the risks? I understand that the witnesses cannot veer into policy but maybe they can talk to me a little bit about precisely what their role is in setting out risks and how far they go in suggesting that we have to respond to certain risks. Perhaps the witnesses could talk a little bit about that. I agree with the witnesses. I believe the external risks and I would say the internal risks are very significant. They could throw all these projections out the window. The witnesses might correct me if I am wrong but would it be fair to say that when the crash came in 2007, all of the projections prior to that happening did not in any sense predict what then actually happened? When we talk about the downside risks, I wonder about all of this. I am reading that Citibank has put a percentage - I do not know how it is worked out - of 65% on the likelihood of a recession in the US this year. In the next year, it is saying that there is a 100% chance of a recession in Latin America. The Bank for International Settlements is saying that we are perilously close to another major slowdown. The IMF has made five different revisions, I think, to its growth forecasts and all are downwards. What are we doing about these risks and how do we protect ourselves? It is a kind of ideological point of "told you so" but I am going to say it anyway. Secular stagnation, in my opinion, is what Marx called the long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall and it is materialising. It is about the ratio of capital to labour essentially appreciating. For that reason, I think that stagnation is going to continue and we are going to move into it. Will the witnesses talk a little bit about what exactly their role is in guarding against the risk? Also, one of the most shocking things the witnesses said was that five firms account for one third of all exports. That is just shocking. The jump in the GDP figures of 26% which has spawned the term "leprechaun economics" is further confirmation of just how vulnerable we are. Five firms account for one third of exports. There are gross distortions in the growth figures. Is this a risk? It strikes me as a risk. When we are talking about downside risks, that seems to me a very extreme risk.If I understand Mr. McCarthy correctly, he is saying that, overall, there will be a slight increase in wage income.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can he tell us anything about the distribution of that income? Average income can mean very little when we are talking about people at the top doing very well but people at the bottom not doing so well. What does it really tell us and can Mr. McCarthy tell us any more? My reading of the economic growth, and I suspect the feeling of many people, is that the benefit of economic growth is going largely to the better paid and better off. Indeed, according to a paper I am reading, the share of gross income of the top 10% of earners increased from 34% to 39% over the last five years and, over the same period, roughly half the increase in total income, which was €21 billion, also went to that cohort. Other figures suggest the bottom 50% received a tiny proportion of the growth in GDP. Has Mr. McCarthy anything to say on this? Are there tables, figures and statistics on the distribution of wage growth, income growth and GDP growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the share and distribution of income, wealth and growth over time, there has been much debate about whether it is regressive. It depends on one's definition of "regressive". That is one debate. However, one way to examine these matters is to chart things over time, examine what proportion of income is going to capital and labour and whether that changes over time and look at the distribution of income and wealth and see whether there are shifts and changes in it. Does the Department keep such tables and does it monitor that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that trend continuing? Perhaps Mr. McCarthy might put a figure on it. My understanding is wage share has dropped by approximately 20% in favour of profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In respect of corporation tax, one of the arguments about Apple at the moment is that if we were allocating profits fairly they would not be allocated here but to where the intellectual property was developed. On the other hand, Mr. McCarthy says we are going up the value chain because representatives of some of these companies walk into the companies registration box and, with the stroke of a pen, relocate intellectual property assets. They are not actually relocating real economic activity - they are just doing an accountancy trick. This may benefit us but is not about the movement of real economic activity. One cannot have it both ways. Either we are entitled to the tax from the €13 billion because the profits were booked here or we are not entitled to the stuff the company is relocating here. There is a bit of a dichotomy in this respect. The company may now feel under pressure as the mood music changes and it is no longer sustainable to avoid tax in the aggressive way they have been doing. It may now have decided that the Irish tax jurisdiction is better from its point of view than the US, where it would be paying 37%. However, it raises the question of how a company books intellectual property profits. How does it cite them? It strikes me that we are talking about accountancy here, not real economic activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. McCarthy suggested that the movement of the intellectual property had something to do with the knowledge box initiative of the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was the IP ever in Ireland? Is it in Ireland or is it an accountancy trick?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was never there, though.
