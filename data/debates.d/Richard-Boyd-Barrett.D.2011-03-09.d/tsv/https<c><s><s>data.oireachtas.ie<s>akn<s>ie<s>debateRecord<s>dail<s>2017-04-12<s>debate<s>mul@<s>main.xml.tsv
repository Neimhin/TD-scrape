RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The majority voted for those who promised to get rid of water charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to be honest and say I am sick and tired of hearing the Taoiseach or representatives of the Government say it takes time to fix the homelessness and housing emergency. I came into the Dáil in 2011 and brought in with me, probably for the first time, dozens of families and individuals, including children, who were facing housing emergencies at that time. I warned the Taoiseach that his policy of moving away from direct council housing construction towards reliance on the private sector would generate a crisis. Today, again, there are approximately 25 households, individuals, families and children in the Visitors Gallery. They are just the tip of a very dire and desperate iceberg of misery, anxiety, insecurity and suffering because of the abject and total failure of the Government's policies on housing and homelessness. I want the Taoiseach to look those people in the eye and tell them that his housing policies are working. Tell Sinead and her three year old daughter, who was told a few weeks ago to go 12 km into town with her children to a hostel where there are active drug users. She then had to fight to get into a hotel and last week was taken into hospital with stress because she is still homeless. Tell James and his family - a mother and their five children - who have been homeless for the past six months, whose daughter has special needs and who are being pushed from one hotel or emergency accommodation to another. Tell Richard, who is recovering from addiction and who is only offered hostels where drug use is rampant despite letters from his doctors about his mental health issues. Tell Peter, who is drug free but who is in emergency accommodation with active drug users, whose mental health is seriously at stake and who was recently hospitalised. Tell Carrie, who has been homeless for a year and is forced to share a room with three people who are smoking heroin. Tell Tom, who has been homeless for five years and who had to lodge court papers against South Dublin County Council because it took him off the housing list and took away his time. Tell Amanda and her two children, Sarah and Eamon and their four children, Samantha and her three children, all of whom had HAP tenancies - the Government's great solution and the centrepiece of its housing policy - and who are all now being evicted by landlords who want to pull out of the HAP arrangements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell Antonia, whose father has motor neurone disease and who - along with her father - is about to be evicted at the end of this month and has nowhere to go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell Anna, who is living in a boxroom at her parents' house, sharing with her 14 year old niece, her two year old daughter and a three year old son. The list goes on. I will be writing to the Taoiseach with all of these cases.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should please tell them what he is going to do for them and that his housing solutions are working for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am afraid the Taoiseach is in denial. This is not about the collapse in 2008; it is about a policy decision the Taoiseach's Government made in 2011 at which time he said the new policy represents a fundamental reconfiguration of the landscape of housing support in Ireland. The statement went into detail. The Government was to stop building council housing and rely on leasing arrangements with the private sector. That is the root of the problem. It has been a disastrous failure. The plan of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has not broken from that. It has, in fact, expanded that misguided, disastrously-failing policy, which is resulting in people in HAP tenancies – the centrepiece of the Taoiseach's strategy – now being evicted from the supposedly secure social housing the Taoiseach said the policy would provide for them. There is ridiculous box-ticking with the objective of getting everybody out of hotels by July. Does the Taoiseach know where they go? They go onto the street or into hubs in town that are full of addiction and drug use. The strategy is failing disastrously and the Taoiseach will not admit it. Will the Taoiseach do what Mr. Edmund Honohan advocated and start a compulsory purchase programme to buy empty properties and buildings to house the people in these circumstances? Will he order NAMA to immediately stop selling off land and property-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and use all its resources to provide social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will he ensure that people in the HAP programme have secure accommodation and that local authorities will be obliged to keep them in permanent and secure housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Otherwise, the weasel words mean nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I went a few seconds over.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Micheál Martin went eight minutes over.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I have a response?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is selling the land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a lack of supply of council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Six years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One very important part of our infrastructure is ports and harbours. I want to know if the Government has discussed the very long-running saga of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. The Harbours Act, brought forward by the Government, suggests that the harbour company will be transferred to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. This has still not happened although most other harbour companies have been transferred to their local authorities. This is because a harbour company quango and its very highly paid executives have frustrated the process by refusing to co-operate with the local authority in a due diligence examination of its financial situation. A risk assessment arising out of the due diligence process has identified a whole series of very serious financial risks. The company is refusing to give the information coming out of the risk assessment on those financial risks to the local authorities, to public representatives or to anybody on the grounds of commercial secrecy. This saga has gone on and on and yet we have had crazy plans for cruise ship berths costing millions of euro. We have a beautiful amenity which is just sitting there and rotting while the harbour company quango plays games with the local authority. Will the Cabinet committee discuss this and will it ensure that the Harbours Act is acted upon so this quango is dissolved and we can have real accountability over this critical piece of infrastructure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an infrastructure question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pull the other one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those in Fianna Fáil have exposed their true colours. They are for water charges. They sign up with the troika for water charges. They commission reports from PwC detailing the plan for water charges. Then, a mass movement is mobilised on the streets against the charges. Then, they are against water charges. Then, the pressure comes on from Fine Gael and they want to leave back doors open for the return of water charges. By the way, that is the definition of the much misused term "populism". That is what populism actually means.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It means saying what suits people when it suits them, as opposed to the words of people who are accused of being populist and who have a consistent principled position of opposition to water charges. I am referring to people who stick to that position and who build movements to vindicate that position. The same people have forced at least some of that position on a reluctant and resistant political establishment made up of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Every concession that has been wrought reluctantly from the twisting, turning and back-sliding Fianna Fáil or from Fine Gael which has at least been consistent as it has always wanted water charges and privatisation and has been pushing for these for at least a decade has been wrought because of the mass popular movement. Of course, that is what both those parties are afraid of. They are fearful of the example it could set for other battles on housing, health and the support of Bus Éireann workers. Hence, the need to go after the people of Jobstown and criminalise them. This was done to ensure there is a bitter taste on the victory of the movement of people power. People power has humiliated the Government and forced it into abolishing water charges, at least for now. The Government desperately wants to leave the back door open. Let us be clear that the decision to meter new-build houses has nothing whatsoever to do with EU obligations. It does nothing to assist or advance compliance with the charges. Furthermore, the EU directives do not require domestic water charges, as has been suggested. If the Minister does not believe me - I do not care what Gavin Barrett says – I need only utter one word, namely, "Scotland". There are no domestic water charges there. There are no EU enforcement obligations or actions against the Scots. I am keen to ask the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, about his new-found concern for EU environment regulations. Does the Minister even know how many cases are currently being taken against Ireland on environmental matters? I am referring to cases in respect of which we will be fined because we are flagrantly in breach of EU environmental directives. We do not hear the Minister or Fianna Fáil talking about these. There are 15 such cases. Five are at the second stage of enforcement. Of itself, this is another revealing fact about the process that the Minister says will lead to certain penalties. These cases have been in train for years. Five of them are at the second enforcement stage but the Government is not saying anything about them, yet it is still flagrantly in breach of them. Interestingly, we still have not been fined. We do not believe for a minute that the doors the Government has left open have anything to do with compliance with EU directives. They have everything to do with giving the Government the opportunity to come back and restore water charges at some point in the future. That is what the Government is about. At least Fine Gael is more honest in stating it wants water charges. Those from Fianna Fáil simply say whatever suits them at whatever time. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will not get away with it. At every point in this journey the movement of people has trumped them and it will continue to do so. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil need not think they are going to fool the people because the people will be back on the streets if there is any attempt to restore these unjust regressive charges.
