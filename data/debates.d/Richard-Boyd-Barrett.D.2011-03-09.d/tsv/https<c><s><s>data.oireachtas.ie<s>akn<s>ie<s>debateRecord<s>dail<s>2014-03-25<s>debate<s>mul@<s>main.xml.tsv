RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is actually our turn.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his discussions on the economic situation in Europe at the European Council, did the Taoiseach raise the issue of the property sector, housing and homelessness? The reason I ask this is that if we were to sum up in a few words the cause of the European and global economic crisis, it could probably be summed up as "property speculation in the area of housing". In the Taoiseach's consideration or in that of his colleagues in Europe, is there any awareness of issues about which I have been trying to ring an alarm bell for a year and a half, that with real estate investment trusts, rising rents, growing homelessness and so on, we are starting to do it all again. We are starting to repeat the mistakes we made in the area of property and housing that led to the bubble and the crash that beggared the people of this country and brought the European economy close to the brink. I find it extraordinary that in the reports and discussions on the situation we talk about banking union, stress tests for the banks and the viability of the banking system etc. It is all about the banks. We all know the banks want property values to rise. It is in their interests that rents rise, because this increases the value of property and their balance sheets look good. The human consequence of inflating the property market again to benefit the banks is that people are being made homeless. This is not just an Irish problem, but the problem is particularly acute here because property was so central to what crashed our economy. This is happening in Greece, Spain and is starting to happen elsewhere. As cynical as I am about the neoliberal dogma that dominates European political and economic thought, even I cannot believe that only six or seven years after the crash caused by this issue, it is being stoked up again. I must point out that the Taoiseach's comments, while in New York, encouraging American investors in the idea of making a killing on the Dublin property market were alarming and dangerous, because he was talking yet again about a crisis -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----as an opportunity for investors to make money. However, this is a human crisis that lies at the heart of our economic problems. In his discussion with our European counterparts, is there any awareness on the Taoiseach's part that treating property as a matter for speculation, particularly the area of housing, is dangerous? Is he aware there are dangerous signs a property bubble could be beginning to emerge again in this State, fuelled by the policy of wanting to restore the banks' balance sheets and by the narrow concept of what banking is about? Even in America, the Federal Reserve Bank has a wider mandate than the ECB to ensure that areas such as employment and keeping a roof over people's heads are considerations for banking policy. US banking policy is not a model one would want to follow, but even the US has some awareness that there must be a wider mandate. On Ukraine, I agree the Russian invasion is unacceptable. The Russian empire has long been the prison house of small nations, particularly in the areas between Russia and Europe. I agree that carrying out referendums under the barrels of tanks and guns is not a legitimate manifestation of self-determination and should be condemned. However, I find it worrying in the extreme that the Taoiseach seems to be the most gung-ho on the European side in portraying this conflict as the bad guy Russians and the good guy Ukrainian Government with Europe backing it. The other of this equation is equally nasty. There is no doubt the former Ukrainian regime was rotten, corrupt, repressive, dictatorial and backed by a nasty regime in Russia under President Putin was pretty vicious to its population. However, we have also had sight of supporters of one of the elements of the Ukrainian Government as out and out fascists - attacking TV presenters in Ukraine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We seem to be lining up with dangerous people who have a history of corruption and dangerous far right wing political ideas and saying these are the good guys. We should not be doing this. We should be responsible and recognise this is a complex situation where big powers are manoeuvring for self interest and stirring up ethnic and national divisions which could be very dangerous and are reminiscent of what happened at the beginning of the 20th century leading to the First World War. I believe the Taoiseach is being irresponsible in presenting this as a simple black and white, good guy bad guy and is doing so in a way that could be quite dangerous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please do not equate marching with what those thugs were doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mentioned housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Taoiseach going to do about it? He should build some council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do you think tax breaks for speculators-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So I do not get the same-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will put in ten questions next time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach referred to the security of the State. I put it to him that what is at stake with the resignation of the Garda Commissioner is not the security of the State but democracy and the accountability of the State to its citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is unacceptable in the aftermath of the Commissioner's resignation and on foot of a litany of scandals-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that the Taoiseach excluded one third of the Opposition from the briefing and refused to facilitate the making of statements in the House. The statements that will be taken later this week pertain solely to the penalty points issue. We need a statement from the Taoiseach on the resignation of the Garda Commissioner-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and an end to discrimination against one third of the Opposition.
