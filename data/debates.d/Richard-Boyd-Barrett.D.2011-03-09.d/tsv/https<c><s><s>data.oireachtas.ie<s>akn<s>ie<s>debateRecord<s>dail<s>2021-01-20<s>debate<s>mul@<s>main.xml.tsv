RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Paul Murphy and Barry. Last week the victims of the mother and baby home scandal were insulted. The insult centred on the Government's refusal to value the direct testimony of those victims and instead to follow an official narrative from institutions. This week we have the same pattern of insulting the student nurses and midwives, refusing to listen to their direct testimony and instead listening to the official and, quite honestly, dishonest narrative that it is getting from the health authorities about what they do. Hundreds of student nurses had their testimonies read out and circulated all over social media.They attended meetings where they spelled out what was happening in detail. People Before Profit brought a motion last year calling for the payment of student nurses and midwives. The Minister for Health simply dismissed that testimony. The testimony continues to come in, however. It explains, sometimes in shocking and graphic detail, the work the student nurses and midwives do, the risks they take and the pivotal role they play and have always played - not just during the Covid-19 crisis - in making up for chronic staff shortages and working during their placements. Instead of acknowledging and respecting that testimony, the Government insults those student nurses and midwives by suggesting that it is protecting their education. To be honest, I nearly choked when I heard the Minister speaking again about protecting their education and referring to the "full student experience". How can the Minister trot out those phrases again? For student nurses and midwives, the "full student experience" is paying fees of €3,000, or €7,000 in some cases, for the privilege of working on the front line of our health services. That is even more the case in these dire conditions of the pandemic, when they are playing a critical role in helping us to combat the virus. The Minister, because he was forced, then offered them a miserable €2.50 an hour for the work they do, in the same week that he bumped up the salary of Secretary General of the Department of Health from €210,000 to €290,000. It is shameful and an insult on so many different levels. It is an insult to women. I do not believe it is a coincidence that this involves a mostly female profession. It is an insult to students to treat them in this way. It is also an insult to young people, as Deputy Cairns said, 70% of whom have said that they are seriously considering leaving the profession, and many will leave after their training because they are treated so badly. They are treated badly as students, and then they will also be treated badly when they come to work in the health service. Nurses are being made to work free hours in the form of the Croke Park hours, when they are fighting to protect all our lives on the front line. The Minister offers these student nurses and midwives an allowance that will not even pay their bus fares or parking costs, in most cases. It is an absolute insult. I disagree with Deputy Cullinane when he says that he does not want to fundamentally change the structure of nurse training. We need to do that to stop the drain of talented nurses and midwives out of this country that is happening now. In Britain, the Government was forced to acknowledge that it needed to pay student nurses £10,000 a year because of the drain of nurses out of the NHS and out of Britain. We should be doing that too. When the Minister says it is not possible to pay the student nurses and midwives and for them to have a degree, as I pointed out to him last week construction engineers get paid €12 an hour for doing their degrees. Student paramedics get paid, in some cases, €28,000 a year for doing their degrees. It can be done, therefore, and it should be done. Fees should also be abolished, not just for the student nurses and midwives, but for all students.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. For British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Tory right, Brexit was always about a reckless drive to accelerate the race to the bottom, undermine standards in worker rights or the environment, for example, and, no doubt, to further enhance the role of the City of London as a centre for financial speculation and emulate this country in trying to develop a tax haven model that would reduce corporate tax obligations on multinationals in order to encourage investment to the United Kingdom. It was about whipping up anti-immigration sentiment and tightening what are essentially racist immigration laws in the UK. In pursuit of that ultra-neoliberal and right-wing race to the bottom agenda, Boris Johnson was reckless and willing to run the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and the erection of a hard border, which would have been a disaster for this country. Europe was also very concerned about protecting the Single Market and insofar as the protocol or agreement guarantees no hard border, it is very much to be welcomed. I have no doubt many officials worked very hard on the details of this arrangement on many levels. Ultimately, the greatest credit must go to the majority of people, North and South, in this country who utterly reject the Johnson ultra-neoliberal, right-wing, reckless and, frankly, racist agenda and, equally, who have opposed any notion that there should be a border erected between North and South. That was pressure from ordinary people, with a majority in the North and South recognising that a border would be an absolute disaster. That pressure guaranteed that we got the protocol. That is very much to be welcomed and I go further in saying it opens the possibility we should pursue actively trying to get rid of the Border altogether. The logic both around Covid and the possible consequences of a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit opens the real possibility of ending the disaster of partition and we should actively pursue a border poll to bring about that end to partition. It should be one of the key lessons we take out of this. Having said all that, we should be absolutely clear that the Scottish Parliament voted against this deal. The Stormont Assembly voted against this deal. The left in Britain voted against the deal. Apart from the protocol and guaranteeing no hard border, it is a terrible deal. It is a terrible deal for fishing communities, for example. This is not just because of the recklessness of Mr. Johnson but the historic mistreatment of the fishing industry and communities in this country at the hands of the European Union. It is a terrible deal in that it looks to hold on to prohibitions on certain types of state aid. State aid in Europe and the UK seems to be fine for banks, for example. They can gamble and wreck the economy but we will have state aid for them. If we tried to have state aid for public enterprise, public infrastructure or services that ordinary people need, Europe would cry foul, as would the Johnsonites and ultra-neoliberals. What about the Mercosur deal? The EU opposes protection against a race to the bottom deal but it has signed up to a rotten Mercosur deal that will flood Europe with cheap beef, damage the interests of small farmers and do immense damage to the environment. It is good we will not have a hard border, and that has been achieved, but let us not paint this deal in overly rosy colours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As somebody who is a political activist, but also somebody who was adopted and born in a mother and baby home, I have very mixed feelings about this debate and report. I suspect that is true of many survivors and those who went through mother and baby homes. In my case, my outcome was relatively benign in that I was adopted by a wonderful family and I was lucky enough eventually to be reunited with my biological family. However, I am acutely aware that for many other people the outcome was not so benign. I am really upset that at a time when women and children who suffered at the hands of the church and State finally had their turn to have their voices heard, to reclaim their history and identity, to change the narrative and to put the people who lived that history back in their rightful place at the centre, that has not happened with this process.Survivors' fears that official and political Ireland would bring its influence to bear on the history, the story and the narrative, and put its interests first, have been realised. I refer to this report, and the commentary surrounding it. It is incredibly disappointing that this has happened after we had the debacle in respect of the legislation and the seal on records before Christmas. Surely, warnings were given to the Government and to the people putting the report together that this must not happen. Yet, that is exactly what has happened. Even before the debate last week during Leader's Questions, following the publication of the report my gut instinct led me to say that I thought the report I had read was "beginning to look like a sham, an insult and a whitewash". I wondered then whether I was being unfair. I realise now that my gut instincts were right and our fears have been realised. I say that based on how much more we have now read about what happened and how much more we have heard from survivors. We have heard much more about how the testimonies taken were not given weight, were not considered evidence and were not even transcribed accurately. We have heard survivor after survivor saying that this report is not what they expected, not what they wanted and not the vindication they expected. The point about this whole situation is that the official Ireland was never going to admit its crimes. The report relied on official records, when it was precisely official Ireland - church and State Ireland - which presided over the shadow State and the abuse and neglect. Everything was centred on the obscene concept of "legitimacy". What an offensive term that is. How could any report try to disperse that obscene concept onto people in general, and onto fathers and families, when it was on the Statute Book until 1987? It was written in as part of the registration of mothers and when babies were born in the homes. Some were characterised as "legitimate" and some as "illegitimate". If people were deemed illegitimate, of course, then it was permissible to treat them as less than human and to allow them to suffer malnutrition, sickness and burial in unmarked graves. The histories and narratives of those people could be stolen, distorted and twisted with a perverse ideology driven by the priorities of politicians and religious orders and institutions. That is the reality. This report whitewashes that reality and insults the survivors. I believe the Minister when he says he wants to put that right, but this process has failed so far. The Minister now needs to put the survivors, and the real voices and histories which have been denied, at the centre of the process of redress. He also needs to put them at the centre of efforts in respect of the archive and all the supports necessary to right the terrible wrongs which were done to the people in the mother and baby homes.
