RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some 366 people were on trolleys yesterday, with 34 in Galway, 38 in Drogheda, 31 in St. Vincent's, 27 in Beaumont and 24 in Mullingar.  Some 20 people were on trolleys in Wexford before they realised the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was coming down.  Additional staff were magicked into the hospital and another ward was opened to get people out of the Minister's way so that it looked nice when he got there.  In some ways, that demonstrates the real issue.  Behind all the talk of fair care and reconfiguration, reform and special delivery units, accident and emergency units throughout the country are in absolute chaos.  None of this spin and jargon can mask——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that they are in chaos and are not working?  The idea that we get more from less when it comes to accident and emergency units is nonsense.  We get less for less and we get more chaos.  The only beneficiary of this are the people I hear day in, day out on the radio, such as the Blackrock Clinic and the Beacon Clinic, advertising for people to come to their private accident and emergency units.  The policy of——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle did not interrupt anyone else like that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that money follows the patient in a situation where there is this level of chaos in accident and emergency units?  The patients will walk out of public accident and emergency units, which are being slashed by cuts, and they will be encouraged to walk into private hospitals and public money will follow them.  If the Minister wanted to do something about this and make some real savings——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——he would cut the €500 million or €750 million that is going in subsidies to private consultants——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a question.  Would it not be better — that is a question — if, instead of cutting staff and budgets in our public accident and emergency units, we cut the subsidies going to private consultants and other private health care providers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister says the closures can be justified on safety grounds.  On 19 April 2009, shortly after the accident and emergency department in Ennis was downgraded to providing an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. service, Mr. Dan McConnell, a 59 year old father of three, died just minutes away from Limerick hospital.  He had suffered a heart attack in Kilkee, 34 miles from Ennis——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  It was 34 miles from Ennis but 59 from Limerick.  In other words, he died because the hospital in Limerick was further away.  The closure of local accident and emergency departments in hospitals costs lives.  That is the health and safety issue.  What is the Minister's response?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, the response times mean nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I have been asking this question for six months, I still am no closer to getting an answer from the Government as to whether it plans to downgrade the accident and emergency service in Loughlinstown hospital.  The people of Loughlinstown and south County Wicklow seek an answer and a timeframe as to when the Minister will publish or announce his plans or recommendations.  I appeal to the Minister not to downgrade the accident and emergency unit at Loughlinstown hospital.  I note the Minister has stated this is all about safety.  A total of 21,000 people go through the accident and emergency unit at Loughlinstown hospital each year and were it to be downgraded to a minor injuries service operating from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and if, at a conservative estimate, half or even 10,000 of them were to be pushed down to St. Vincent's Hospital, this would mean the attendance of an additional 28 people per day at that hospital's accident and emergency unit.  As 31 people already were on trolleys in that hospital yesterday, this does not add up because as matters stand, St. Vincent's Hospital cannot cope.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one pushes thousands of accident and emergency cases on to St. Vincent's Hospital, which already is in chaos, there will be more chaos, suffering and lives lost.  I appeal to the Minister to do in his review what the people of south County Wicklow and Loughlinstown want, which is to retain the 24-hour accident and emergency service in Loughlinstown hospital and if safety issues exist there, to put the requisite resources into it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggested half of the 21,000 people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister still has not informed Members when they will get a chance to be consulted on this issue or when his recommendations for the so-called reconfiguration of services will be out in the public domain.  Moreover, the Minister is not answering the question about how St. Vincent's Hospital already is unable to cope on a daily basis.  He appears to suggest the downgrading of the accident and emergency service at Loughlinstown hospital, both what it does and the hours it will be open, will have no impact on St. Vincent's, which already is overrun.  This does not add up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does this mean the Minister has already decided without consultation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All those who can afford to will be running off to theBeacon Clinic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I tabled six questions and the Taoiseach did not really answer them.  He did not even refer to some of them in his reply.  The weekend prior to the European Council meeting, and directed towards it, in approximately 2,000 cities across the world people in their tens of thousands, and in their hundreds of thousands in some cases, took to the streets to protest against the policies of bailing out banks and bondholders and imposing austerity on ordinary people.  In Greece, as I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, there has been huge mobilisation of people power taking to the streets to oppose the policy of inflicting brutal austerity on the people, pensioners and workers in the country to pay off bondholders and bankers.  These protests took place here too.  The Taoiseach may have noticed at the weekend, reinforcing the message of these protests, opinion polls indicated a significant majority of people believe the austerity to pay off bondholders was unjustified and is not in line with public sentiment in this country.  The protests across Europe indicate——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the European Council meeting did the Taoiseach or any of the EU leaders take on board the message being put out by the people on the streets in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Wall Street that they believe it is wrong and unsustainable to continue a policy of bailing out bankers and bondholders at their expense?  Did the Taoiseach discuss those protests?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the EU leaders take seriously what looks like a majority sentiment across Europe, and increasingly across the world, about the incorrect priorities that Governments seem to pursue?  Did the Taoiseach specifically discuss jobs and what he was going to do for jobs?  This is all about bailouts and mechanisms.  What did the Taoiseach say should be done to create jobs in Europe?  What decisions were made and what actions will be taken by European Council leaders to create jobs in Europe?Did the Taoiseach discuss the fact that there is probably a consensus among economists and commentators that austerity is having a negative impact on growth, that it is crippling growth in the European economy and that policies are not working?  Did the Taoiseach discuss these issues?  Did he raise them or did European Union leaders raise them?On the question of a referendum in Greece does the Taoiseach agree with many people, who feel it is outrageous that European leaders, Merkel and Sarkozy and the so-called markets went crazy because the Greek Prime Minister had the audacity to suggest the Greek people might have some say on their social and economic future?  Does the Taoiseach agree it shows contempt for democracy that this was the response of the EU leaders and the markets in Europe to a desire by the Greek Prime Minister to have a referendum?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Martin has had his chance.  The Taoiseach did not answer one important part of the question.  Was there discussion at the Council meeting about the fact that growth is stalling and contracting in Europe as a result of austerity?  There is a widespread view among a wide spectrum of commentators, academics and economists, supported by recent figures, that growth is contracting and is being crippled in Europe as a result of the austerity policies resulting from the prioritisation of the bank bailout.  Was this discussed or was there acknowledgment that this is happening?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of the referendum, does the Taoiseach share the shock most people feel at the hostile response in Europe and among the markets, who seem to be dictating everything to us, at the simple fact that the Greek people might have a vote?  Does the Taoiseach think this is terrible?  Does the Taoiseach think this shows dysfunctionality at the heart of the European system that they were so appalled at the simple prospect of people having a vote on the austerity package?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach clarify his position on bringing forward legislation on ECB interest rates?  It is not clear.  Is he saying legislation will not be introduced unless the Financial Regulator tells the Government he wants legislation?  Will the Government not respond to the outrage over the failure to pass on the interest rate reduction and will it bring forward legislation to ensure it is passed on?Some time ago, I asked about the mental capacity Bill.  We have Victorian laws to deal with vulnerable children and other persons——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the mental capacity Bill be brought forward?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if he does not?
