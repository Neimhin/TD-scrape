RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we try seven minutes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To continue on the same lines, I find it pretty amazing and quite shocking that neither the Minister nor the European Commissioner with responsibility for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, Commissioner Hill, whom I met yesterday, will give any detail about the gap between the European Union and the Greek Government, when we talk about that gap potentially leading to Greece’s exit from the eurozone. Commissioner Hill says he does not know the details, we can get them in the media and the Minister is more or less telling us he does not know the details, yet we are talking about an existential crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I do not accept. We are not getting the details of the gap. We are not supposed to be talking about conflicting sides. In a negotiation between a nightwatchman and an employer, arguably they are conflicting sides. We are talking about people who are supposed to be partners. Greece is supposed to be a partner in the European Union. All sides are supposed to be working towards a resolution that is in the best interests of all, yet it is being framed, as the Minister has just framed it, as some sort of hostile negotiation that we cannot get the details of. I find that suspicious, to put it mildly. I believe the reason we cannot get details of the gap from the Minister or the Commissioner is that if we did get them we would discover the EU is being vindictive, that this is a question of trying to politically discipline the Greek Government and send a signal that we are not going to appear to give any ground to a government which has demanded an end to austerity.Is that not the reason? Even if it is not, how can the Minister, as the representative of the State, say that he does not know the detail?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister not think-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is what brings it back to the common ground between us and the Greeks. Greece has a primary surplus. It is not spending more than it is taking in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no significant gap between what the Greeks are taking in and what they are spending. The only issue at stake is the payment of the debt. Yet the one thing Europe is saying, even though Greece is more or less in balance and may still have a slight surplus, is that it must pay the debt, whatever it takes and no matter how much suffering it may inflict, and that Europe is willing to allow the possibility of a Greek exit from the eurozone over that. The Minister is telling me he does not even know the details.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I get one more question in? I take the Minister's point, but I disagree with it and it is very revealing. What the Minister is saying now, and he is giving us a little more information, is that there actually is a vindictive agenda. As if Greece has not taken enough punishment, when one looks at the humanitarian indexes of that country, we are not going to allow a situation where they have anything resembling a half-decent minimum wage or pensions that might be a little bit better, supposedly, than those elsewhere. We are going to hammer them down. There is no solidarity there. The attitude is that we are going to hammer them down because we consider them to have too much. How anybody could think that anybody in Greece, other than the very rich, has too much is beyond me. I have a final question-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister reply to the questions together?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is my very last question. In both our case and their case, this revolves around the debt. I will bring the discussion back to Ireland and the macro-financial review from the Central Bank today. The ECOFIN meeting is also discussing imbalances. They are commenting now that the major domestic threat facing the Irish economy is the issue of housing, property and so on, apart from the humanitarian-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the macro-financial review. They talk about external threats and then they talk about the disastrous rise in rents, property prices, and so on, and the threat it represents. The way to address that is through major capital investment in housing in order to provide a supply and bring down the costs, to make it affordable and to deal with what is now a major macro-economic threat, never mind a humanitarian crisis, in this country. Is it not the case that we cannot do that because next year we are paying €8 billion in debt interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my question. Is the debt not, therefore, the key issue for us, as it is with the Greeks? We are not able to address what is now a major social crisis and macro-economic threat because we are paying out €8 billion in interest next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did we sign up to the rules, then?
