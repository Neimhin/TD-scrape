RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 144 relates to an appeal by the holder of the relevant authorisation against a decision to impose a major sanction. That would be dealt with by the High Court. Will the Minister of State explain, if an entity is trying to defend a decision to impose a major sanction and the holder of the authorisation is saying that there should not be a sanction, whether people such as non-governmental organisations, the public or stakeholders would have a right to give evidence on their view about whether the sanction was justified? If the holder of the authorisation is saying that there is nothing to be seen, nothing has been done wrong and a sanction is not deserved, how would those proceedings operate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to fully understand this. We raised concerns yesterday about the potential difficulties in access to justice for NGOs, for example, the costs and so on that they might incur. In this particular instance, let us say that the reason that the MARA decided a sanction might be necessary is because it received reports from stakeholders, NGOs or members of the public that they felt the holder of the authorisation was breaking the rules of the authorisation and was not compliant in some way. If people asked the MARA to look into and investigate cases and it then decided that there was something to investigate and was of the view that sanction would be required, would those people have the right to give evidence to the High Court if they wished? Could they state why they brought the matter to the MARA's attention and outline their view that what the authorisation holder stated was not true?It is being able to supplement the case that sanctions should be brought. Does the Minister of State understand my point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that point. I am trying to thrash this around so that I am clear in my own head. If it was the case that a stakeholder, an NGO or, for that matter, a concerned member of the public had brought matters to the attention of MARA that prompted it to investigate and impose sanctions, certainly MARA would have to defend its position in the court against an appeal by the authorisation holder that this was an unfair sanction. However, it might well be the case - I could certainly imagine a case - where the stakeholder itself or the NGO would say that, as well as whatever MARA will say, it wants to give evidence in these proceedings as to the reason it thinks MARA's decision is entirely justifiable and to represent its own position as the group that potentially had prompted the entire investigation in the first place. That is what I am asking. One could imagine there could be quite controversial matters going on in a court between MARA and the authorisation holder where those stakeholders might state that they have a strong view on this and they want to give their evidence to the court as to why they think sanction is, indeed, justified and MARA has acted correctly in these circumstances.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point except to say - I will consider submitting an amendment on Report Stage - that it would not be unreasonable to consider at least some sort of provision where those who felt they had a stake in the outcome of those proceedings might be allowed to give evidence to the court as to why they think the decision to impose a sanction was a correct one. In other words, not only what MARA thought was relevant evidence but what that stakeholder or NGO felt was relevant to the considerations of the court.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I get a little clarification here on the protections that exist for those who have reported an alleged ground for sanction. That is what this section deals with. Could the Minister of State run through the protections? I note reference to communications that are deemed frivolous or vexatious. That is fair enough. They would not provide grounds for protection for persons reporting alleged relevant ground, but will nearly any other concern being expressed around the breaching of grounds give protection to those who want to make complaints or call for investigations to MARA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For clarity, the Minister of State said that under maritime area consents, nothing actually happens and licences or relatively minor activities are granted by MARA but any development is dealt with in this section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to things that might be considered to have an impact on the environment or the required screening and public consultation provisions. Those are all dealt with here. Is that correct? Does that include, for example, seismic surveys? Where are they dealt with?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the purposes of my simplistic understanding, would a seismic survey require a development consent or just a licence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand it depends on the type of survey. I asked specifically about a seismic survey.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They would.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to tease it out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The same here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the spirit of these amendments. The county development plan does not relate to anything beyond the high-water mark. The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council county development plan has objectives, priorities and so on for Dún Laoghaire Harbour. It could as easily be Bullock Harbour, Galway Harbour or Cork Harbour.How does all this impact on that? We fought quite hard to get Dún Laoghaire Harbour integrated into the local authority. It was previously managed separately by a harbour company. That caused significant problems due to divergent objectives. We now have, at least in theory, the possibility of having an integrated approach between the county and the harbour, which is a very important asset for us, as I am sure the harbours of towns and villages across the country are. How then do these two things relate to each other? Will the Minister of State explain that? I am not sure whether this is the section where I should raise this issue but the Minister of State referred to it there. I ask for the Chairman's direction on that. In this section we are dealing with, and I am pretty sure the Minister of State referred to it, permission may be granted where the national marine planning framework or maritime spatial plan is materially contravened. There are conditions where permission may be granted. I must express concern about that. It states the conditions under which this might happen are if: "the proposed development is of strategic, economic or social importance to the State" and where they may be conflicting objectives, essentially, that are "ambiguous" in the national marine planning framework or the maritime spatial plan. That just opens everything up. Anything goes then, potentially. We have all these safeguards, all these plans and we have this framework but then, actually, anything goes if it is considered to be "... of strategic, economic or social importance to the State". Alternatively, I can tell the Minister of State that from looking at the marine planning framework, it would not be difficult to construe multiple competing objectives in the same maritime space. Then we are into a situation where literally anything goes and it is about whoever happens to be making the decision at the time and whatever his or her particular prejudices might be. Will the Minister of State respond to those concerns? As a final point, I refer to the benefits and impacts for the local economy, communities and so on. That is absolutely imperative. There is nothing that frustrates people more. By the way, I do not think there is anything discriminatory in it. It would be discriminatory if we set religious or ethnic conditions or if we were saying there were particular natives or something. If we are talking about benefits to the local community and people who live in that area, as long as it is done on a non-discriminatory basis it is critically important there are benefits and employment benefits of developments which may be impacting on that area. It is an entirely laudable and legitimate aspiration. Maybe the Minister of State could set out what his thoughts are on how we are going to achieve that. Does he agree that is what we should be trying to achieve? If it is, what is he intending to do to try to achieve that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise. Will the Minister of State repeat that last comment? I am trying to keep track of several issues here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How is the board held accountable, just as a matter of interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let Deputy Ó Broin in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will start with the question on the harbour etc. In the current system, a county development plan, where it has certain strategic objectives or priorities for something like Dún Laoghaire harbour, does not actually carry any legal weight. Is that correct? That it is subject-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and now that is going to carry over.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, its jurisdiction does not extend into the foreshore-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----under the current system. It requires foreshore permission and that is going to be replaced by the DMAP. Okay.I want to express concern about the second point - the conditions under which you can breach the marine planning framework or the spatial plan, where it is deemed strategic. The SHD process has been very widely discredited to the point that the Government has agreed, notwithstanding a delay, to drop it and replace it with something else although it is not clear what that will be. The reference to "strategic, economic or social importance" worries me and I want to signal that. I think it worries people because it can become a blank cheque for doing things that people do not feel are beneficial if the Government decides at some point that they are strategically important or of benefit, even if it might be argued afterwards that they did the opposite or completely failed to achieve those strategic objectives. It leaves things quite open to subjective assessments of what is strategic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points have largely been made. This is about allowing for a period longer than 30 days for the public to inspect the EIA or the Natura impact statement. We all know that the public often feel these projects pass them by before they have a chance to know about, consider and inspect them. It is a reasonable provision to try to ensure that level of public participation in the process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know how many sets of numbers there were there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Subparagraph (4) states: "Subject to subparagraph (10), a rights commissioner shall not entertain a complaint under this paragraph if it is presented to him or her after the expiration of the period of 6 months beginning on the date of the contravention to which the complaint relates." What is the rationale behind limiting the right of somebody to make a complaint to six months and not allowing it afterwards?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not a brilliant explanation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would express concern about that. I can think of many circumstances where in the case of an employee, for example, there could be a delay of longer than six months in making complaints about things that contravened the conditions the holder of an authorisation should be meeting but maybe was not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will come back to the Deputies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to express concern about a few matters. First, I understand this allows for applications for development which, under paragraph 12, would include "the purpose of nuclear waste material storage". I would like an explanation of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excellent. We collectively deleted it. That is good.I also have concerns in respect of paragraph 15(b), relating to "a terminal, building or installation ancillary to a terminal that is used for the liquefaction of natural gas or the importation, offloading and re-gasification of liquefied natural gas", because some of us think that we do not need LNG infrastructure. If we are serious about our climate goals, we should not be envisaging further development of LNG infrastructure. I doubt the Government will agree with us on this, but it runs counter to the commitments we have to try to reduce CO2 emissions. As regards paragraphs 16 and 21, it may be that I need them to be clarified. If I understand this correctly, in the context of the installation of storage for certain developments, there is no requirement for full development consent if the development is less than 20 ha. All of this applies for developments of more than 20 ha. Developments of 19 ha, 10 ha or 5 ha are quite large. The installation of storage for natural gas capacity, combustible gases, oil or coal on an area of 15 ha, 10 ha or even 5 ha is a pretty big deal. Is the threshold adequate? What is the logic behind it? There is a similar point to be made with regard to paragraph 21, which relates to port installations and works relating to parking areas, unloading areas, ship repair areas, associated office facilities or areas for transport of goods in circumstances where the enclosed area is less than 20 ha, involves the reclamation of land that is less than 5 ha or involves the construction of a quay that is less than 100 m in length or the provision of facilities that would admit vessels that are less than 1,350 tonnes. Those would all be quite big developments to happen in a port. Why is an effort to put a rigorous regime in place for significant development proposals, if I understand this correctly, while proposals that are pretty significant but below that threshold will not be subject to the same sort of development consent process with all the associated consultation and compliance with directives and so on that, obviously, we have all said we are committed to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to be clear on this. First, on the LNG issue, the Minister of State said the Government decision in that regard is such that he does not envisage applications-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or developments of that sort. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case, should that not be deleted as well? Is it not logical to delete it in the same that reference to nuclear storage was deleted?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will reflect on the response of the Minister of State. On the last point, for clarification, he is saying that in the case of reclamation or the building of storage facilities under those thresholds, they will be dealt with by the local authority through the normal process of assessing planning applications, with all the public consultation provisions and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everything else will be dealt with through the normal planning process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State would not explain that again, would he?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy can say that again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Briefly, this is the last chance to mention something we have not mentioned before Report Stage. I believe these issues arose yesterday but I want to ensure they are on the record. They are the concerns we have about access to justice issues in terms of the various consents for which the Bill sets out the provisions. Without making statements on it, there are concerns about the consents, the standing of NGOs and so forth as well as costs issues regarding access to justice in respect of the various provisions of the Bill. I wish to signal that in case we may need to table amendments in that regard on Report Stage.
