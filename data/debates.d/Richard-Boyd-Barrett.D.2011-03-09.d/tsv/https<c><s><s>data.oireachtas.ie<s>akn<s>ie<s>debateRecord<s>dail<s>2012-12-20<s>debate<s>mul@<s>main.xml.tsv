RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish a happy Christmas to all of the Deputies in the House, all of those who work here and to the public outside. I wish to ask the T치naiste a "Christmasy" question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the aspects that I love about Christmas, and I suspect that many do, is the Christmas tree. Most families in this country will have a Christmas tree in their homes. It is like having a little piece of Ireland's woodlands in the sitting room over Christmas. When one is surrounded by family, friends and the community, it is a time around the Christmas tree when people consider those matters that are important. A matter that might be considered important at this time of year as one looks at one's Christmas tree is the woodlands. They are a part of our heritage and our culture and are a vital resource for the State. People might also wonder whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, believes the fairy tale that money grows on Christmas trees. Perhaps it is money that could pay for the property charges that will be imposed on families that will not be able to pay them next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Money does not grow on the trees that are in people's front rooms during Christmas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, does the T치naiste agree with me that money and jobs grow on those trees on Coillte lands and that, when our country is being crucified with unemployment, austerity and cuts, it is a crime against the nation that the Government is planning to sell our nation's trees to private interests when those trees could generate thousands of desperately needed jobs and revenue for the State?This week saw a further 1,000 acres sold. Private interests will make money from the sale of Christmas trees and logs, while industry and jobs that could have been created in the forestry sector will be lost. Will the T치naiste grant the nation a Christmas wish by undertaking not to give away our woodlands and forests to people who see them only as an opportunity for profit? Will he give a commitment that our forests and woodlands will be retained for the benefit of the citizens of this State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, does believe that money grows on trees. Otherwise, he would not expect people who are in mortgage distress, on social welfare or whose incomes have been slashed to pay property charges and endure other cuts to their income. My point is that while money does not grow on the Christmas trees that are in people's front rooms this Christmas, money does grow on the trees on Coillte lands and so do jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Leaving aside private interests, even Coillte itself, as it prepares for privatisation, does not actually generate jobs or revenue for the State. What it does is asset-strip our woodlands and sell them off for a song. One need only look to Switzerland, a country half the size of Ireland, to see what can be done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some 100,000 people are employed on its woodlands compared with 11,000 in Ireland. Those numbers will be further reduced when the Government sells off the trees to private interests which see them only as a cash crop that will make a quick buck. They have no interest in maintaining them as woodlands or developing the woodland industry to create jobs. That is the point I am making.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is interesting that one of the companies that is in the bidding to buy our forests is a Swiss bank, a subsidiary of which is headed up by Bertie Ahern.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That company understands the value of our forests because it knows how to manage them properly. Why does the Government not keep them in public ownership, to generate the jobs that could put our people back to work, instead of selling them off to asset strippers who want only to cash in and have no intention of creating jobs or revenue for the State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the same payment the T치naiste and his colleagues receive under the party allowance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is factually incorrect.
