RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Commissioner may have noticed that there is a very significant irony at play in this committee in that the political parties which were the most enthusiastic supporters of the European Union are most resistant to her findings in this matter and those of us who were most critical of the European Union are the most enthusiastic about her findings because some of us believe that there has been a facilitation of aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals operating in this jurisdiction. As there seems to be confusion about what the Commissioner has concluded on this matter, for the purposes of clarity I will suggest a summary of what I believe she is saying. I must say that I agree with her. The essence of her conclusion on this matter resolves around the fact that profits that were generated by Apple in Ireland were allocated to a subsidiary of Apple that had no real economic existence. Is that essentially the case? Is that the essence of it? It is impossible to allocate profits to an entity that has no employees, no offices and that can show no evidence whatsoever of any economic activity. Is that the essence of what the Commissioner is saying?If so, in Ms Vestager's questioning of Revenue did it explain how it had allowed the allocation of profits to such entities because I am confused as to how it could possibly have made that decision which Ms Vestager has questioned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But the profits in the branch were not taxed where there was a real company. By the way, I fully agree. To me, it is cut and dried. Frankly, I do not see how anybody could mount a defence on that front.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. I want the â‚¬13 billion for this country. I want to understand the nature of Ms Vestager's investigation. Did she question Revenue about its ruling or was it a paper investigation? Surely, as part of her investigation, she questioned Revenue in some shape or form about its ruling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not ascribing motives and not asking Ms Vestager to give an opinion on motives. I am merely asking her if she asked Revenue the reasons it allowed the allocation of profits to entities where there was no economic activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be quick because I am running out of time. Ms Vestager did not ask it why. Is it her understanding Apple asked for the particular ruling, that it proposed a particular ruling to the Irish Revenue authorities and that they said, "Yes, that is acceptable." Is that how it worked?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not my question. I was simply asking, from her investigation, if it was Ms Vestager's understanding Apple had asked for a particular ruling, to which Revenue agreed. I think she said that in circumstances where state aid might possibly have been given, governments or revenue authorities might ask the European Union whether a ruling had breached state aid rules.Did the Irish Government or the Revenue, at the time when they made these rulings, ask any opinion of the European Union as to whether these rulings could possibly breach state aid? Following her ruling, does the Commissioner know if the Irish Revenue Commissioners are still calculating and allowing the allocation of Apple taxes to entities which the Commission has concluded they should not? In other words, is the practice continuing or has it changed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Commissioner and commend her on her work.
