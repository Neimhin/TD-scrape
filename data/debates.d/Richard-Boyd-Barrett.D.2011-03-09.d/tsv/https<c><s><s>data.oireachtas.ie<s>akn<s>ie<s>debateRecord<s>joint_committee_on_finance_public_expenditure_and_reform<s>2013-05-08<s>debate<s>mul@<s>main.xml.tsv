RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Listening to the Minister's response, I get a sinking feeling of the sort one might have had if one had watched Nero fiddle while Rome burned. His assessment that we are making progress and the process is working, whether in this country or more generally in Europe, is not one that would be shared by the vast majority of people in this country, the rest of Europe and, increasingly, mainstream, middle of the road economists and analysts. The Bruegel Institute submitted a report either to the European Council or ECOFIN in which it stated current policy was not working. Moreover, the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, recently stated that austerity had reached its limits, while the European Commission downgraded its growth forecasts for Europe. A clear pattern has emerged in the downgrading of growth forecasts and upgrading of the projected increase in unemployment. It is that the austerity experiment, which was first tried here and subsequently extended to Greece and Spain with disastrous consequences for all three economies, is now being applied across Europe where it is having a similar effect. Evidence that these effects are beginning to impact on Ireland in a manner that was entirely predictable is provided by the most recent figures from the purchasing managers index, which show that manufacturing employment and output in Ireland have recorded their largest declines in four years. Is it not the case that this is a direct result of the European economy beginning to contract?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the European Commission recently indicated that unemployment will be higher than anticipated and the European economy is moving into a second quarter of recession?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am aware that growth in service exports has counterbalanced the decline in manufacturing exports but I put it to the Minister that when a country’s manufacturing begins to decline it is in serious trouble. In recent years, when we pointed to the weakness in the domestic economy the Minister repeatedly stated that, provided we remained competitive, our thriving exports, most of which go to Britain and the European Union, would be our way out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Now, precisely as we predicted, the austerity applied in Ireland and subsequently extended to the rest of Europe is causing the European market to contract and this contraction is hitting our manufacturing sector. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the contraction that is taking place in the rest of the European economy will not impact on Ireland or choke off exports, the sector the Government repeatedly states will save the economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So am I. I read Noel T. Palmer or whatever his name is. That is the only economics-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is not addressing the point I am making. The Minister is right. There is some growth in the American economy, in Asia and so on, although there are worrying signs of what could happen in Asia. The difference between the United States and Asia is that stimulus is taking place in the United States and investment is taking place in Asia. In contrast, in Europe the austerity policy is being applied. We are cutting back on investment and spending, the European market is contracting, unemployment is rising and Britain and Europe are our biggest trading partners. Looking at the macro situation, it is evident that the policy being pursued by European governments, including this Government, is failing Europe, driving it further into recession and guaranteeing at best that we do nothing to make a dent on the enormous unemployment crisis and at worst that we are making the unemployment crisis even deeper. Is not that what is happening in Europe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody else thinks it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Paul Krugman today or-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know what the Minister is going to say as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, Minister-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To expand on the medicinal analogy, the Minister sounds like a drug addict who is in denial, who has got to do something about the problem but continues to give himself lethal injections of the poison that is killing him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it that the Minister is so specific on debt and deficit targets? The Minister is so specific on the processes for achieving what he calls stability and utterly non-specific in terms of giving targets and timescales for addressing the unemployment crisis. How can he say the Government is taking growth and jobs seriously when he does not have anything like the projections for reducing unemployment that he has for reducing the deficit? We know exactly what his plan is to reduce the deficit and debt. He has forecasts extending three or four years, but the targets will drop by a certain amount and, of course, the targets are never met, but none the less he has very specific targets. Where are the specific targets for reducing unemployment either in this country or in Europe? Where are the specific targets for increasing growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the target and the timescale for reducing unemployment in this country to, say, 5%?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about targets for dealing with the unemployment crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on, Minister. That is just disingenuous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister got a target for reducing unemployment to 5%, for example? Does he have a timescale for that? Has he got a target for saying we are going to get from 430,000 unemployed to 100,000 unemployed over a specific number of years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his introduction, the Minister said the theme of the Irish Presidency was stability, jobs and growth. I am focusing on the two latter elements, jobs and growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Minister spoke about in his introduction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his introduction-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Vice Chairman would allow me to use up the time in the way I choose, I am asking why, if the theme of the Irish Presidency is jobs and growth, the Minister does not put it to European finance ministers that we need to be more specific on targets for generating growth and employment across Europe in the same way as they are specific about imposing targets for deficit and debt reduction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked if the Minister had targets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Targets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it. It is waffle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have lots of positive things to say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a question about the proposed banking resolution regime. I agree with Deputy Donnelly that it is a positive development to make a distinction between depositors and speculators or professional investors-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----if we want to be nicer about how we describe them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Minister's opinion is this shift largely to do with what happened in Cyprus and the intervention of the Cypriot people, where the original plan to deal with the bank financial crisis there was quite different, namely, to raid people's savings of under €100,000? However, as a result of a popular intervention, that policy was changed and bondholders, rightly, came into the firing line. That policy is now being applied generally as a result of events in Cyprus. If that is the case, is there not a case for us to say that if we have accepted that senior bondholders should take a hit and if that is to be the new resolution regime which will be applied across Europe, we have a case? People may take the view about the European Stability Mechanism, ESM. I am less interested in the ESM than us having a moral case on the back of what has happened in Cyprus and this new proposed regime to say that we want some write-down. Can we not ask for some write-down, given that senior bondholders did not take the hit in the Irish situation but Europe has now rectified that mistake?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that the new bank resolution regime has established that senior bondholders can take a hit and following events in Cyprus, have we not got a case for claiming some level of write-down given that we took the hit for bondholders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What concessions can we seek on foot of that admission?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister saying that he does not consider us to be in a position to seek further concessions on foot of what is a fundamental shift in policy on the part of the European Union?
