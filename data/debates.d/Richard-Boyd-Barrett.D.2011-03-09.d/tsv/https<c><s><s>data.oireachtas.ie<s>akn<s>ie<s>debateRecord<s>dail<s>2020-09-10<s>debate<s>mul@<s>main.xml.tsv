RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For more than 150 days now, more than 1,000 workers have waged a truly inspiring and heroic struggle for a just settlement following the ruthless and cynical behaviour of Debenhams, their employer, to execute a tactical liquidation in order to leave those workers, who had given decades of service, absolutely high and dry without a penny. Due to their struggle, they have forced the issue of the injustice done to them to the top of the political agenda and although we have had sympathy from the Government, it continues to hide behind various excuses and is doing absolutely nothing to resolve the dispute to ensure that those workers get justice. This morning, the Taoiseach said on the radio that we cannot invent a scheme in order to give justice to these workers. I strongly challenge that. First, the Debenhams’ workers are in the plight they are in because of the failure, specifically, of the Government that the Tánaiste led to address the issues that arose from Clerys and other types of tactical liquidations over many years. The Tánaiste, specifically, and his Department, have a moral responsibility to get a just settlement for these workers. The claim that this cannot be done is belied by the fact that although KPMG's offer of €1 million for 1,000 workers who had decades of service was absolutely insulting, that it could make any offer at all proves it can be done. If KPMG can offer €1 million, it can offer the €13 million that is needed to give the two plus two solution. It is unconscionable that Revenue, which is owed €20 million, would not waive its position as creditor when it has benefited from the taxes paid by those workers for 24 years. Those taxes would more than cover the cost of putting the Debenhams workers rather than Revenue at the top of the creditors list. The Government could then go after Debenhams, a company KPMG says has no assets but it turns out has €95 million in the bank, a €2.2 billion turnover and, in the past week or two, revealed that it had €50 million more than it thought it had. It was hiding behind subsidiary companies to load debt on Debenhams in order to avoid paying workers a just settlement. The Tánaiste's excuses will not fly. The workers in Cork ended their occupation this morning and have decided to put the focus now on the responsibility of the Government to give them the just settlement they deserve and which it is responsible for, given that it failed to legislate on the Duffy Cahill report during the Tánaiste's years in government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, the points I put to the Tánaiste were not points that I dreamed up. They came directly from the Debenhams workers I was talking to this morning. They are their arguments and their proposals, and I agree with them. I am glad the Tánaiste mentioned Clerys because what the Debenhams workers pointed out this morning is that precisely the same situation operated in Clerys. The Clerys owners tried to do the same trick that Debenhams is doing. There were two companies in Clerys. There was a trading company that had no assets - none - and then there was a property company that owned the building. The workers still got a deal. It was not a very good deal but it was better than the deal they would have got had they not fought. That is exactly what is going on here. The claim that Debenhams Ireland does not have assets is not true. There are assets worth millions in the stores. Moreover, artificial debt was loaded on the company and there is a retail business still operating, all run by a parent company that has massive assets. This is a manipulation of the situation and, therefore, it is right and correct, particularly because of the Government's failure over years to address the issues arising out of Clerys and other disputes, to say that they will secure the moneys necessary to pay the two plus two. I ask the Tánaiste not to forget the point I made about all the taxes the Debenhams workers paid to Revenue, which give them a moral claim on the Revenue's position on the creditors list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even before Covid-19, supports and services for people with disabilities and their carers were woefully inadequate. The equality that is demanded by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is not, and was not, a reality. For the past six months, the hardships that all of society has gone through have disproportionately fallen on those with disabilities and carers, with the closure of day care services, schools and so on. While it is welcome that day care services are now reopening, as they will not reopen at full capacity a hell of a lot more must be done. There needs to be serious acknowledgment of carers. Carers are paid €230 for doing a huge State service. That amount is derisory in the first place, but the double burden that carers have carried over the most recent period means that a bonus payment should be made to those carers to acknowledge the extra service they have given in recent times. I make that direct call to the Minister for State and the Government. We rightly praise our healthcare workers for what they have done but we often forget about carers and the heroic efforts they have made over the recent period. The Government has acknowledged that the pandemic unemployment payment, originally proposed to be €203 per week, was not enough for people and had to be raised to €350. That has implications for the disability allowance payment because if we rightly recognised that €203 was not enough for people who lost employment as a result of the pandemic, by the same token it is not enough for people with disabilities, particularly when they have significant additional costs such as paying taxi fares and all sorts of other things. We must look at increasing that disability payment for carers. I would also like to mention the campaign that Access for All Ireland has waged and pay tribute to Sean O'Kelly and Bernard Mulvany for highlighting the unacceptable failure to properly maintain lifts and ensure access to the public transport system. It was a victory for the campaign that a welcome additional €3.3 million was announced to fix 12 stations in Dublin. That is welcome but still leaves many DART stations with serious problems. That money will not be translated into changes until 2024. Six lifts were out of service on the DART line yesterday. The day before, five lifts were out of service. The day before that, six lifts were out of service. A similar pattern was repeated in the weeks before that. It is not enough that the work will be completed in 2024. We need all of those lifts to be properly maintained in order to ensure that we get real access, and equality of access, to public transport for wheelchair users, people with mobility problems and so on. I will speak briefly on the school transport issue. I have said the following to others in the past and I will say it to the Minister of State now. It would be a win-win situation if the Minister of State engaged with some taxi drivers whose employment opportunities have significantly diminished. A number of taxi drivers are already involved in school transport and many others are crying out for work. As we have said, there is a significant deficit in school transport, in particular serving children with disabilities and special needs where there may be concerns about Covid-19 and so on. I suggest that the Minister of State engages with the representative organisations of taxi drivers to discuss how they could assist to address the school transport issue, particularly for those with disabilities. It would also be beneficial for a cohort of workers who are in real trouble and need additional support. The Minister of State's remit is partly within the Department of Health but she also is covering a whole range of other issues. It seems to me that given our commitments under the UNCRPD, the issue of disability should be taken into the Department of the Taoiseach. That could allow a cross-departmental approach that is needed for the disability sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is happening at St. Mary's Centre Telford - the nursing home, the assisted living housing and the disability services - and indeed what has already happened with the Caritas Convalescence Centre, in terms of the attempted execution of a tactical liquidation and a manufactured insolvency at the expense of the workers who worked providing these services and the residents and service users in the centre and at the homes there, is an absolute scandal. The residents are watching this debate now because what has gone on there threatens perfectly good and viable services specifically and uniquely provided for people with blindness and visual impairment and disability. It is an institution that has been operating since 1860, funded by the public but run by the Sisters of Charity who have decided, essentially using Covid-19 as a cover, to execute a tactical liquidation. To give the Minister of State a sense of the feelings of the residents I will read out what some of those residents, who have been there, in some cases, 63 and 72 years, are saying:We want our home back as we knew it. It has been so frightening and threatening having these liquidators here. How would you like it if you had the enemy in your home, your sanctuary? Our home should feel safe and unthreatening. Now it is like a prison. We are afraid to move. I've been here 62 years and my friend has been here 72 years. We've stopped smiling. Instead we are nervous, cannot sleep and it is affecting our mental health so much.I do not have the time to read them all but the Minister of State will get the sense of fear and anxiety of these residents who are vulnerable, elderly women with visual impairment. They are facing their home and their community being broken up and all of the workers who provided those services being simply dumped.The Government needs to step in and do something about this. The social housing element was originally financed by Dublin City Council and the services were funded by the HSE but the Sisters of Charity-owned companies that run the centre have manufactured an insolvency and are looking for a liquidation that they should not get. This is because the insolvency is manufactured. The companies claim they have liabilities associated with refurbishing the place to bring it up to certain standards. They claimed that the HSE funding might not continue and that they could not afford the redundancies, but the redundancies are happening only because St. Mary’s triggered them - it did not have to – in a nursing home that was actually Covid-free, was run perfectly well and provides excellent services and a home to the residents. This is occurring when the company has €750,000 in the bank. If the redundancies go through, it will cost the taxpayer nearly €1 million. The request is for the Government and the HSE to step in and support the application made for an examiner to be brought in to save the jobs and services and prevent the trauma and anxiety that is now being inflicted on the vulnerable women. I ask the Government to step in. It has the power. It should get the HSE to do the right thing and stop this scurrilous behaviour by the companies owned by the Sisters of Charity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State but it is very disappointing that the senior Minister is not here to deal with this very serious matter. Engaging with liquidators and the INMO in terms of redundancies is just not good enough in this situation. Let me finish reading the comments of some of the residents:Let us have our lives back so we can laugh again. To break up our community and friendship would be akin to death. We have not committed any crime. What have we done to deserve this?What the residents want is to know that they can continue to live in their homes. That means retaining the assisted-living housing, the community, the disability services and the nursing home, which are perfectly good. All the HSE has to do is say it will support an examinership. It should not allow a liquidation to go through that is a tactical liquidation based on manufactured insolvency. This is an institution that was financially washing its own face. Its so-called insolvency was manufactured on the basis of notional redundancy liabilities that would not exist unless the workers were being let go. If the workers are not let go and the services are maintained, there is no liability. The HSE has made it clear that it was willing to provide funding to meet the necessary standards and, indeed, the companies had money in the bank in any event so there is no need for these services to close. There is utterly no need to move the elderly residents who have lived in the homes for decades and to cause stress and anxiety. We do not want words about engagement and all the rest of it; the Government must instruct the HSE to keep the services, homes and community in place. If it decided to do this, and if there were sufficient political will, the anxiety and fear of the residents could be prevented, vital services for the disabled and visually impaired could be maintained and the jobs of the workers, who have provided dedicated service for the service users for many years, could be saved. That is what the Minister of State needs to do and we need a commitment to that effect.
