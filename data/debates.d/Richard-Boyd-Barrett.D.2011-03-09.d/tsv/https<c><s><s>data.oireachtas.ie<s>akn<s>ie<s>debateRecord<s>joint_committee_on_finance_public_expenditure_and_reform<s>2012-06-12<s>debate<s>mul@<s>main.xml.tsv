RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for having to leave the meeting for a short period.  I got the thrust of what Mr. Furlong said on the second issue and, if I understand him correctly, I am in agreement with the point he made.  To clarify, is he saying there should be no immunity for whistleblowers where they are essentially engaged in an abuse of the protections provided to secure immunity for themselves in respect of certain criminal behaviour, malpractice or whatever?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree wholeheartedly with that.I have a difficulty with the first point Mr. Furlong made.  The thrust of the legislation surely must be to remove any disincentive or discouragement for people to blow the whistle on malpractice, negligence or criminal behaviour in a corporate or State body.  This is the problem that must be addressed.  The type of middle way Mr. Furlong seems to be proposing implies there is a real danger or threat of a significant number of vexatious or trivial reports and disclosures.  I disagree with that emphasis or starting point for examining this issue.  The root of the problem is that people have been afraid to make disclosures because of the consequences that might flow from that.  Our focus, therefore, must be to give confidence to people, in both the public and corporate sectors, that in reporting activity which they believe to be wrong, criminal or negligent, they will have the full protection of the law.The benchmark set out in the legislation that a potential whistleblower must believe a report of wrongdoing is substantially true if he or she proposes it to bring to the regulatory body is too onerous.  Far from diluting the incentive to report or encouraging people to approach their employers in the first instance, we should instead be encouraging anybody who has any concern, even if he or she is not certain that it is substantially true, to report that concern to the regulator.  Given that people are often very reluctant to approach their employers on such matters, there should be no discouragement in terms of bringing the matter to the regulatory body.  In the case of the banking sector in recent years, for instance, an employee might well have looked at what was going on in terms of lending policy to developers and suspected, without being certain, that there was a problem.  Such concerns might not have passed the "substantially true" test but would nevertheless have been reasonable and valid.  People should have the right, even where they are uncertain of the validity of a concern, to raise that concern with an external regulatory body, particularly where they are doubtful of receiving a reasonable or balanced hearing from their employers.  The requirement that one must believe one's suspicion to be substantially true before presenting it may function as a disincentive to such reporting.  Where one has significant concerns that unacceptable, problematic or criminal activity is taking place, should one not feel completely confident in one's right to raise it with an external regulatory body?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that we must be very careful in this regard, not just in terms of what Mr. Furlong has said but in terms of the Bill as a whole.  Anything that might act as a disincentive or discouragement for people to raise concerns, such as the requirement that they be confident their concern is substantially true, should be avoided.
