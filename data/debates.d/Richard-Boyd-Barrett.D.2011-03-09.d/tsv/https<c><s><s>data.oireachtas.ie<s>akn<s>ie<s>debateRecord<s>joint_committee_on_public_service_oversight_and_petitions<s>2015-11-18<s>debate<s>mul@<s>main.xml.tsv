RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot of the bases have been covered. If I understand correctly, it is up to the Government to make decisions on some of the more contentious issues such as the level of the direct provision payment and the right to work. I think I am right to say that Ms Harrington is not in a position to shed much more light on those matters. People who have been there for more than six months - many have been there for ten years - have been robbed of the right and opportunity to work. They should be compensated for that by being credited for those years when they were denied the opportunity to work. That is a policy decision. Did Ms Mooney say that once they start work, a three-year credit is given?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, except such people have been in a situation often for a lot longer or simply have not had that opportunity. However, it is obviously a decision for the Government as to whether it will grant such people credits based on how long they had been in direct provision and denied the right to work. Is it possible for the witnesses to provide members with the guidelines the Department gives to community welfare officers in respect of flexibility? I would be interested in seeing them because it seems to be a sort of moving goalpost or whatever is the expression as to how such flexibility is or is not granted. There also does not appear to be a great deal of consistency in the discretion that is given and it often appears to vary between individual community welfare officers. One community welfare officer may be much more flexible in applying the flexibility than others who might be highly inflexible and who will simply tell people that X is the rent allowance limit and they cannot breach it. If this is stated to people by a community welfare officer, I advise them to indicate that they wish to make a formal application in any event and to not accept a verbal refusal. I advise people to seek, in writing, the reason the community welfare officer is refusing them because the rents in question are what the rents are for any available properties in the area, of which there are very few. I suggest this in order that there will be a requirement on the community welfare officer to provide, in writing, the reason he or she refused somebody a breach on the allowance cap. If such a written reason is provided and people still cannot get accommodation, I advise them to submit a formal appeal. However, I wish to know what precisely is the instruction or memo that is passed on to community welfare officers in this area that leads to such a wide variety of responses from those officers in granting discretion in these cases. This is not just for asylum seekers but for anybody. Can the witnesses enlighten members?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If possible, I have a few more questions on this theme when we resume. Are members returning or not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to examine the issue of flexibility a little further. Before we suspended for the vote, it was said that the direction given to community welfare officers was to take rents in the area into consideration in terms of deciding what constituted a reasonable rent before breaching the rent allowance cap. Is it possible to see a copy of the memo? Could it be sent to the committee? I am interested in seeing it, not because I doubt Ms Harrington but because there is such a wide diversity in how the advice seems to be interpreted. It would be quite useful for members trying to represent people to have the wording of those guidelines so that we could, as it were, arm people who are going to community welfare officers with precisely what the instructions say in cases where there might be a dispute about the interpretation of discretion or flexibility. Is the instruction being given to community welfare officers on whether to accept an application dependent on where the person was previously located in an area, in this case where the direction provision centre was? This is a general issue but I seek clarification on it. What I have come across in general is people being told applications are not being accepted because they have no proven link to the area and they are somebody else’s problem. We have had to fight, sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully, to establish a person’s right to apply for rent assistance in a particular area. Given the chronic lack of affordable rental accommodation, that is a crazy situation. I would have thought it applied very much to people coming out of direct provision trying to find what is very difficult, namely, affordable rental accommodation that accepts rent allowance. It seems to me that we must have great flexibility at that level as well. In other words, regardless of where somebody has been in a direct provision centre, if he or she could find accommodation anywhere that would accept him or her, he or she should be able to go to the community welfare officer in the area and ask for rent allowance and for permission to breach the cap because the accommodation in question is all he or she can find. Could Ms Harrington comment on that point also?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Ms Harrington also send the memos?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one takes my area, and I am sure it is true also of other areas, it is virtually impossible for somebody who lives in Dún Laoghaire to find somewhere to rent that takes rent supplement. I accept that most people want to stay in the area in which they are living and where their children go to school. One might get one or two places available and several hundred people in a month chasing those one or two places. In an ideal world, they would find somewhere close by but often they have to go further, for example, to Little Bray or into Bray, which is administratively under the jurisdiction of Wicklow County Council. Boundary issues arise in terms of people being told they are not the problem of the local authority area in which they are seeking accommodation. That is crazy. People might be reluctant to go to Bray but if they can get somewhere and they are happy with that, then there should not be any issue about them being able to get rent allowance in whatever area they can find accommodation. Such flexibility should be available. If a person is willing to move to an area where he or she might have some prospect of getting somewhere close to the rent allowance limit and there is a slightly higher likelihood of rent allowance acceptance, for example, on the edge of the city such as Tallaght, it should be possible to do that. Understandably, many people do not want to go there but others might accept it and then boundary issues arise. Maximum flexibility should be provided given the mess in terms of trying to find rental accommodation that will accept rent allowance. Instructions should be given to community welfare officers to exercise the maximum flexibility and not to say "No" on the basis of administrative demarcation lines. I wonder what the situation is in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to people who are trying to get rent supplement elsewhere.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To simplify my question, what will happen, if let us say one is in a direct provision centre in Dún Laoghaire and then one tries to get rent allowance in Bray? Will one be told by the community welfare officer in Bray that because the person is not on the Wicklow list, he or she cannot get rent allowance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one is not on the list, one cannot get rent allowance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. I understand that, except that the condition under which one gets the rent allowance is that one is on the list in that administrative area. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an issue of joined-up thinking between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the local authorities and the Department of Social Protection. Going by my experience, which is not specifically with direct provision, I would anticipate that this could become an issue for people who have got their status and are trying to exit direct provision and find rental accommodation, which is very difficult to find. We should not let these demarcation lines be an obstacle. People have been told when they go to get rent allowance that the community welfare officer would like to give it to them but cannot unless they are on the list in that particular area, while the local authority is resistant. Sometimes we argue with them and can get there but sometimes we get resistance. Given the difficulty of the situation, we need joined-up thinking between the relevant Departments and flexibility across those administrative lines.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I have made the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In order to get the rent allowance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just so I am absolutely clear on this, there is no legal requirement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So as long as they are on a local authority list, they can apply.
