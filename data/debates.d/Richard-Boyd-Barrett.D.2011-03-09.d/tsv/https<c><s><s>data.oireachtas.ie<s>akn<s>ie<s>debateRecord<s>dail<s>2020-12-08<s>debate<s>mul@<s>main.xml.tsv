RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Garda Síochána is currently engaged in a joint EU-funded research programme called real time network, text and speaker analytics for combating organised crime, ROXANNE. The programme has been in place since September 2019 and runs to August 2022. Among the participants on this programme is the Israeli Ministry of Public Security, which oversees the Israeli prison service, police, border control and so on. It has been involved and implicated in repeated, terrible human rights abuses of Palestinians, including many children, administrative detention, detention of children without trial and many other human rights abuses that have recently been documented by, among others, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign in a report it produced in August. The latter has written to the Minister for Justice. I submitted a parliamentary question that was ruled out of order asking what on earth the Garda Síochána is doing. The Garda has, as part of its code of ethics, specific and clear commitments to human rights and yet is partnering with an Israeli body that is deeply implicated in human rights abuses. I put to the Taoiseach that we should have no hand or part in a project involving the Israeli Ministry of Public Security. Indeed, we should be suggesting that the EU, which is supposed to respect human rights, should have nothing whatsoever to do with such a project if the Israeli Ministry of Public Security is involved.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since the Government voted down the Solidarity-People Before Profit motion calling for the payment of student nurses and midwives, I and student nurses and midwives have listened with fury to the Taoiseach's lame, dishonest and unacceptable excuses in respect of the decision the Government made. There is an interesting all-Ireland dimension to the hypocrisy around treatment of our front-line workers, such as student nurses and midwives. The following is from an elected representative on this island:It’s only fair and right that our student nurses are properly recognised and recompensed for the service to our communities during this pandemic.  Right across the city we have Covid patients being tended to by NHS staff and their student nurse colleagues.  The Health Minister must recognise their efforts at the most challenging of times with fair and proper wages.That is a quote from a Green Party councillor, who would have voted in the election for the Greens to enter Government down here and in the party's leadership election. That is stunning hypocrisy. A party with which the Taoiseach is allied marched into the Dáil last week and voted against paying student nurses and midwives; the same party, in the North, is calling for their payment and saying it is due recognition for the work they have done on the Covid front line. What does the Taoiseach think about that? Even people who are aligned to the Government call for the payment of student nurses and midwives in the North. Yet the Taoiseach comes out with lame, dishonest and unacceptable excuses for doing the exact opposite down here and covering over the disgraceful decision not to pay student nurses and midwives. We will rebut these excuses one by one in the next question in this session.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not saying that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Start with the reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government could have amended the motion to pay them in a different way.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, the Solidarity-People Before Profit motion on student nurses was drawn up in direct consultation with hundreds of nurses at meetings we organised online . It was, therefore, their words, not ours. When the Taoiseach insults the motion they effectively wrote, he is insulting them. He is also insulting their intelligence when he plays politics because the following are his words to me on 20 October in terms of:... student nurses working on the wards in the current context. As they were earlier, they should be paid in accordance with the agreement arrived at earlier in the year. I will follow up on that. That was just six weeks ago. As for the nonsense that their education is being protected, Melissa said:Seeing as I am regularly moved away from my preceptor to another nurse in a different section of the ward because the second nurse in that section has called in sick, do you think my education is the priority in that decision? Do you think I am doing real work? That is directly to the Taoiseach. Róisín has worked four nights in a row on a ward so understaffed she had a patient load of seven and there was no shadowing or supervision. When one of the seven patients became aggressive towards her with their dinner knife, she was told it was "her responsibility to call security and the doctor as they were her patient". Will the Taoiseach admit that this is work and commit to paying her for this work? I could go on. He is invited to the next meeting with those student nurses if he wants to talk directly to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are all being put in that position.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the Taoiseach's words six weeks ago?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will send the Taoiseach an invitation to that meeting. He can meet a few student nurses. They are good people to talk to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a member of the budget scrutiny committee we were engaging with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council today and it pointed out that the significant expenditures related to Covid-19 and, previous to that, Brexit, that led the Minister to defer the plans to put €500 million into the rainy day fund were part of a trajectory of debt, even though it approves of the Minister's decision to make them available, as do we in the Opposition, for which we would have to pay the piper at some point in time. The way it put it was that hard choices were coming, not immediately but in the medium term. I think we all know what hard choices means. Hard choices means austerity or raising taxes. That means we have to really think about those consequences and decide which way we will address that problem. The choice the Minister has made for now is to borrow. As I said, we agree with the decision. In fact, in terms of the increases in capital and current expenditure, we would have gone further.We did not need Covid as an excuse to do some of the things that we have now had to do, particularly having to increase the capacity of our health service, invest more in housing and so on. Nonetheless, we agree with the countercyclical, emergency approach to dealing with this crisis. How do we finance it in the medium to long term? How do we make those hard choices? The approach that the Government has taken is borrowing. The alternative that we have argued for and that we have seen put into practice, with a tax that is almost a cut and paste from People Before Profit's pre-budget submissions for the last few years, has now being imposed in Argentina, and not by a radical left Government. A Covid solidarity wealth tax has been introduced, which is on wealth and assets in excess of £1.8 million sterling, which is quite a high threshold, on the richest 12,000 people in Argentina. They expect that it will raise 300 billion pesos. That money will be spent on health, relief for small and medium enterprises, social developments and so on. There will be slightly higher taxes for people who have wealth and assets kept outside the country. It is a fairly middle of the road regime adopting a policy that the Government regularly dismisses as being off-the-wall left-wing economics. That should give the Minister pause for thought. While the Fiscal Advisory Council does not pronounce on specific measures, when I asked it directly if we need to look at these options and if it is legitimate to look at wealth taxes as a choice to deal with the debt situation that is developing, it said that we need to start to look at these things. I will put it simply. If one borrows, one is borrowing from people who have much surplus money, with interest. If one introduces wealth taxes, one takes the surplus money off them. Which is better value for us, borrowing from very rich people with surplus wealth who make more money from having surplus wealth, or taking it from them with taxes to equalise the distribution of wealth and to fund needed social services, infrastructure and so on? I put it to the Minister that it is the latter and the decisions that he has had to make here are indicative of a fundamental change away from austerity economics and debt-financed spending towards redistributive wealth taxes.
