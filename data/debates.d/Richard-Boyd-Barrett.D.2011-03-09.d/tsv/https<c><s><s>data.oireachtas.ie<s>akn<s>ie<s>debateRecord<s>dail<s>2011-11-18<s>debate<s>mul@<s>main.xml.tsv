RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Catherine Murphy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have seen it all now when Fianna Fáil brings forward a proposal to get rid of corporate donations.  If there were an international award for brass neck, Fianna Fáil would get it for this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Fianna Fáil Members deserve Oscars.  They really should go into acting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The irony is beyond belief.  The party of Charlie Haughey, Bertie Ahern and the Galway tent suggesting it knows how to clean up politics just beggars belief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil's rotten relationship with big business, developers, bankers, and the super-wealthy has destroyed our economy.  It has plunged 500,000 people into unemployment with tens of thousands leaving the country.  Some of the most vulnerable sectors of our society are being punished in the most obscene way for the crimes Fianna Fáil committed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not have jobs now thanks to Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil Members should be holding their heads in shame for what they have done.  I could take this Bill seriously if those Members put their hands up to say they were guilty of wrecking our economy and imposing unbelievable suffering on working people, the vulnerable and the poor.Fianna Fáil Members, however, have not done so.  They have not acknowledged their role in doing untold damage to the economy.  We do not know if we will ever recover from what they have done.  The idea of Fianna Fáil Members standing up here to pretend they are the champions of cleaning up political corruption after their rotten relationship with big business is simply staggering.  Fianna Fáil is the A-Team of creating the conditions for political corruption which has devastated our economy and our society.  The new Government, and specifically Fine Gael, is the B-Team which is coming up fast behind Fianna Fáil.How can one take seriously the Government's commitments on dealing with political corruption and the rotten relationship between big business and politics when at the recent forum it held in Dublin Castle to discuss how we can get out of this crisis it had present Mr. Denis O'Brien, a man who we know from the debate here on the Moriarty tribunal has major questions to answer, to put it mildly, about the way he got the second mobile telephone licence and the involvement of a former Fine Gael Minister in taking money from Mr. O'Brien during the time that licence was up for grabs?  It beggars belief that the Government would invite this man who is a tax exile to discuss how we should get out of this crisis which was caused by corporate vultures and people who did not believe they should pay taxes or that taxes were only for the little people.  How can we take seriously the commitments of a Government which rightly condemned the Galway tent but is involved in organising golf classics where developers and wealthy individuals make significant contributions to the huge election campaign fund of Fine Gael in the last election, a fund that was clearly boosted in a very significant way by major corporate donations?  I find it very difficult to take any of the Members opposite seriously.  We will support this proposal but we need to go much further.One simple measure we could start with is to put severe limits on election spending.  We would be doing the ordinary members of the population who are inflicted with posters on every lamp post and inundated with leaflet after leaflet or wall to wall advertisements during elections——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am for limiting them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should limit the number of posters that parties——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should limit the number of leaflets candidates are allowed put through letter boxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should limit the number of advertisements and the expenditure generally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do it in student union elections and, therefore, there is a level playing field.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are not serious about doing anything about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should have a decontamination period for politicians and people in high public office——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——in terms of them being able to serve on the boards of corporations where there is a conflict of interest.  That is a practice that continues where people walk out of very senior jobs in Government and the public service and go straight on to the boards of big business, which often they have been dealing with directly in particular areas only weeks or months previously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We cannot deal with the issue of political corruption unless we deal with the gross inequalities in wealth.  As long as 5% of the population have 40% of the wealth they will always corrupt politics.  Anyone who is serious about dealing with the corruption in politics must deal with the gross inequalities in wealth, and that means imposing taxes on the super wealthy in our society whom both Government parties cosset consistently and refuse consistently to take some of their wealth off them to make a contribution to our society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will you tell the Fianna Fáil Members to be quiet?
