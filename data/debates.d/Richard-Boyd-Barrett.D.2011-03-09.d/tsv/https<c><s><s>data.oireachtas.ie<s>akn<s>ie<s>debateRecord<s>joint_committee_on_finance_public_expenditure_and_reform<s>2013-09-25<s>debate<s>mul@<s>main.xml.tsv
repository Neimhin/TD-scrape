RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Governor, Professor Honohan, for his attendance. I will summarise what the banks have said last week at the committee and what the Governor has said. The banks said, more or less: "We lent in good faith - maybe a bit recklessly. A big financial crash came along and people are in difficulty but we have the right to get our money back off mortgage holders. If they would only just engage with us, because we really want to engage with them, we will be fair and reasonable with them. The problem is that too many people are strategically defaulting or not engaging with us." Professor Honohan has given a slightly more critical narrative in that he probably says: "The banks are not doing as good a job as they could." Broadly speaking, however, he is going along with the idea that heading along the current trajectory will mean it will be all right on the night with the current framework. I put it to the Governor that the banks are telling us an absolute fairy tale, that the Governor is blindly optimistic about what is actually going on and that there is a financial bomb likely to explode on the balance sheets of the banks, with pretty devastating consequences for our economy and for the citizens of that economy. I want to illustrate that point with an example which, in my view, is typical. I will not mention names. A young couple from Dún Laoghaire, both working and with a low to middle income, take out a mortgage to buy a house in Wexford. They do not want to live in Wexford. Back in the day, the bank offers them money to buy a house in Dún Laoghaire. They decline because they believe they would never be able to afford it. They decide they want to get on the property ladder but they decide to be sensible and go to Wexford and hope eventually to work their way back to Dún Laoghaire. The crash comes. Their income has decreased by about 20%. The house they bought for €250,000 is now worth €80,000 to €90,000. Payments were at about €1,200 a month and they are now just about able to pay €700, and barely so. This is a less than interest-only arrangement, which means the debt is building up on them. The woman becomes pregnant and very soon will be unable to work so that their income will drop even more. For two years they write to the bank, begging for a permanent solution. All they get from the bank is moratoriums, temporary solutions and so on. Only when I raised the issue with the chief executive officer of that bank at a committee meeting when I said the bank was not engaging with the customers, does this couple finally get an appointment to meet the bank. At that meeting the bank representatives offer them another temporary arrangement whereby, because things may turn around and perhaps in a year or two, some sort of split mortgage can be considered. The couple, quite rightly, decline. They say they are sinking into a mire of debt and such an arrangement is no good to them. They point out that the bank recklessly lent to them and actually encouraged them to take out even bigger loans. They had hoped that the bank would be realistic, but after the meeting they conclude they have no choice but probably - although they have not fully decided yet - to hand back the keys. If this happens, the banks, which Professor Honohan says cannot afford to give a write-down, will be forced to take a write-down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a previous occasion when I asked Professor Honohan whether there could be a write-down to current market value for distressed mortgages, he asked who would pay for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The banks are going to take a bath.I put it to Professor Honohan that there is a high level of so-called non-engagement because huge numbers of people cannot afford to pay. Those to whom I refer have lost their jobs, their incomes have been reduced and they simply cannot afford their repayments. Sooner or later that is going to manifest itself and either a massive hole will be blown in the balance sheets of the banks or wholesale repossessions will occur. The latter will lead to the creation of such a massive hole in any event because the banks will take a bath in respect of the properties they repossess. Are we prepared for such an eventuality? Are the stress tests relating to the banks adequate to deal with an outcome such as that to which I refer? In light of the figures the banks supplied to the committee last week, all the evidence points towards the fact that people just do not have the money to pay, that the hope that everything will be all right on the night is just a fantasy and that this whole matter is just going to explode in our faces.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that ordinary people whose incomes have collapsed or who have lost their jobs are of the view that what the banks may consider to be sustainable is utterly unsustainable from their point of view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the cases to which I refer, the only sustainable solution would be to write off a significant portion of the debt but the banks are refusing to do that. Professor Honohan and the Government are stating that we cannot afford-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the figures and in an attempt to quantify what is involved, what proportion of the approximately 200,000 people who have entered restructuring arrangements, whose mortgages are in arrears, etc., will be able to repay what they owe without defaulting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the position been quantified? Is the figure 50%?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When Norway experienced a similar crisis-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we not inform our friends in the ECB that this is their problem too? Is it not the case that we should we impose a solution similar to the Norwegian model whereby we write down distressed mortgages to current market value plus 10%, whatever that value might be, and inform the ECB that this is also its problem? Should we not do this and face reality? At present, we are not facing reality and huge numbers of people, and the economy in general, are being crushed as a result. The ECB is certainly refusing to face reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In respect of cases where people are dealing with their banks now and where there is evidence that those banks engaged in really reckless lending in the past - individuals I have met are willing to testify that some institutions were literally throwing money at them, encouraging them to take out loans that they knew were crazy or providing bad advice - is the Central Bank position to intervene? Can evidence of reckless lending of the kind to which I refer be a factor in people's current negotiations with the banks? Can someone provide evidence to the Central Bank to the effect that a bank behaved in an utterly reckless fashion in the past? If that is possible, can the Central Bank intervene?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, there is evidence that there was reckless behaviour at a high level in the former Anglo Irish Bank and a lot of evidence can be provided by individual customers in respect of the reckless behaviour of various other lenders but there is nothing the Central Bank can do in either instance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is pretty weak, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two brief questions. I am aware it is not the Governor's job to pass judgment on Government economic policy.Given the serious mortgage distress people are in and the huge arrears crisis, is Professor Honohan worried that any measures that may be imposed in the coming budget that will cut people's incomes will deepen the mortgage crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Three billion euro next year. We would not need an adjustment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked whether Professor Honohan expected more people to go into arrears.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was the question.
