RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The entire strategy of the European Union, endorsed from what I can see by the Government, has been to recapitalise and repay banks, to make them more profitable, to focus on them all of the time and to pay for this by means of austerity, supposedly in the name of competitiveness and efficiency. Is there any recognition on the Government's part or that of European leaders that this is just not working? We are five years into this strategy and it is not working. As a result, the European Union is tipping further into recession. Does the Minister of State accept that all the hopes for significantly renewed growth, both in the economy and across Europe, are being dampened because the austerity strategy is not working? Is it not time that the Government raised its voice and, to paraphrase John F. Kennedy, asked not what the people can do for the banks but rather what the banks can do for the people? Is this not the time to begin to look at matters the other way round and prioritise jobs instead of protecting the banks? Is it not amazing that after each summit the Taoiseach comes before the House and talks up the situation in Ireland, yet the projections for job creation for next year are flat? There will be no increase in employment next year. That is the issue which matters to people. All the growth forecasts are being downgraded and we are faced with an unsustainable level of debt. Is the lesson to be learned from what occurred in recent days that the European Union was forced to provide for a debt write-down for Greece because it had become apparent that the latter simply could not repay its debt and that its people could not take anymore? Is it not time that Ireland sent the same message to the European Union? Will the Government inform European Union leaders that the 1.8 million people who are living in poverty here cannot take anymore? Will it inform them that austerity is not working, that the people cannot take this pain and that we cannot afford to make €9.1 billion - or 20% of our overall expenditure - in debt interest repayments next year? Why not send that message, particularly as we have obtained diddly squat - well, words but nothing substantial - in respect of the issue of interest repayments? My final point relates to the situation in Gaza. Do we not have a special responsibility to point to the appallingly cynical nature of the Israeli assault on Gaza which, for the fourth time in five years, has coincided with the holding of elections in Israel? Do we not have a responsibility to speak out about the fact that successive Israeli Governments think killing Palestinians is a way to attract votes? Should we not speak up loudly on the international stage about this matter? Should we ask Israel to stop behaving in this rogue fashion? As a former colony, Ireland has a responsibility to be much more blunt at European level in demanding an end to this type of cynical and murderous politics on the part of Israel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is hardly an even conflict.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My remarks will be in a similar vein to Deputy Pearse Doherty's. I acknowledge that we had a constructive engagement on Committee Stage with regard to the amendments that we tabled largely on behalf of the Irish League of Credit Unions. Generally speaking, the Minister indicated a willingness to deal with the concerns raised by the credit union movement and to bring forward his own amendments in the Seanad which would address those concerns. To a certain extent we are in a difficult position because we have a responsibility to do the best we can on behalf of the credit unions and their members. Report Stage is the last opportunity we will get to make any intervention on the Bill. We must take the Minister at his word but I believe he responded fairly honestly on Committee Stage and showed genuine concern and acknowledgement for the issues raised by the credit union movement. I was not entirely satisfied with some of the Minister's responses and I will refer to these during the course of the various amendments, but the Minister was honest enough. I am keen to hear from the Minister about what has happened since Committee Stage when it comes to dealing with these issues. Can the Minister tell us any more about how he intends to dealt with these concerns, starting with these amendments? Like Deputy Doherty, the submission of my amendments for this stage was rather rushed and they were provided at the last minute because we had little time between Committee Stage and the deadline for Report Stage. Anyway, the amendments are an attempt to raise the issues again and to get a response on how we are progressing to ensure that the credit unions are not caught up in the backlash against the banks, a backlash that resulted from the activities of the banks. As Deputy Broughan and all of us stated on Committee Stage - the Minister would probably agree - while the credit unions are not perfect and naturally require regulation, they are not the culprits of the dire situation we are now in; the culprits are the banks. It would be a deep irony if the credit union movement suffered as a result of the backlash against banks. It would be a supreme irony if this were the case when the banks are still being protected. I realise they are being regulated and we will see how effective the new regulation is, but from most people's point of view the banks are being cosseted and protected and it is all about ensuring the welfare of the banks. It would be most ironic and unjust if the credit unions, which are not perfect but do not bear responsibility for the deep mess we were in, were to suffer as a result of the need for greater regulation in the banking sector. This is the assurance which we and the credit unions seek. We have no wish for an onerous regulatory regime to be imposed on the credit unions such that their ability to function is effectively undermined or damaged in any way as a result of the implementation of regulation. I realise my amendments are imperfect in this regard. They are not as specific as those of Deputy Doherty. They simply suggest that only the regulation appropriate to credit unions in the legislation since 1942 should be applied to the credit unions. I understand that the amendments need to be more refined but we are keen to hear and, more important, the millions of credit union members are keen to hear that the amendments the Minister will bring forward with deal with this concern. We would all appreciate if the Minister could provide a progress report with regard to what these amendments will look like and an assurance that the credit unions will not be caught up in the backwash of the necessary regulation that must be imposed on the banking sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Likewise with amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, in my name.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We discussed this issue on Committee Stage and while I do not want to elongate the debate unnecessarily, I feel particularly strongly about this point because it relates to the bigger macroeconomic picture. We are in dire need of a stimulus and investment. The credit union movement wishes to ensure there is no impediment to its members investing money in a way that could be beneficial to the economy and society in terms of job creation and the development of socially useful projects. We should welcome this. The Minister suggested on Committee Stage that there was no impediment to such investment by credit unions which are putting their money in the bank but would rather put it somewhere else. The Minister also said he had to safeguard the deposits of the members of credit unions and was concerned about that aspect in the context of this proposal. However, as I understand it, the credit union movement is stating any scheme in which credit unions would invest would be State-guaranteed. The idea is that they would lend money to the State for a guaranteed, modest return, thus making money available for programmes to create jobs and benefit the economy, local communities and so forth. The State would guarantee the repayment of the money, at a modest rate of interest. That seems to be a no-brainer. It is a very positive suggestion, the acceptance of which would be good for the credit union movement and the economy as a whole. The credit union movement would like the Bill to state explicitly that there will be no impediment to member unions doing this. It is obvious that it would be better if credit unions put money into such projects rather than deposit it in banks. I, therefore, ask the Minister to outline how he proposes to deal with this issue in a way which will satisfy the credit union movement and benefit the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever we may think on this side of the House, the Government often pleads that it does not have the money it needs for the investment and stimulus programme we would like to see. With the credit union movement, we have an institution with money which wants to assist the State and its citizens in stimulating the economy by backing projects that would create jobs and pay social dividends. I understand the Minister of State's argument that the State has an obligation to ensure credit union members' funds are safe and sensibly invested but given that credit unions have to put their money in the banks, one might ask how safe are the banks. The credit unions are asking to be enabled to invest in State guaranteed schemes not just any old scheme. The credit unions are offering money the State says it needs at low interest rates, as long as they are guaranteed a return. I do not know exactly what the credit unions have in mind in terms of how this would work. However, having chatted with them, I understand one example of the sort of thing they might consider would be a social housing project. There is general agreement in this House that we spend too much in moneys to private landlords in rent allowance. If we built local authority houses, that rental revenue would return to the State and would, therefore, be guaranteed. There would also be guaranteed savings in terms of the money paid out in rent allowance. This could be quantified roughly. If the credit unions lent €1 billion, the State could build 10,000 council houses and then receive extra revenue of approximately €120 million per year. The State could guarantee the repayment of the loan and the interest on it and we would have the extra social housing we need. That is the sort of scheme the credit unions and their members would like to back. The State could confidently offer a guarantee because it knows the revenue would be secure. There would be definite savings and a definite revenue return. On the shared services, the Minister is saying that while not against the idea, the Government's concern is for the welfare of the credit unions and their funds and for whether they have the infrastructure to provide shared services without endangering the solvency and liquidity of individual credit unions. My understanding of what the ILCU suggests in this regard is that the Bill would state that they would be enabled to provide these services, but the Central Bank would put whatever conditions it wished in place to ensure the necessary infrastructure and safeguards were in place. Therefore, there would be conditions on the credit unions moving in this direction and these would be regulated and laid down by the Central Bank. What the credit unions want is the removal of any possible impediment to them moving in this direction. This is a laudable aspiration and is in the interest of credit union members and of offering choices to people in the financial services area. The Government should co-operate with the credit unions in facilitating this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have an amendment down as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a mover as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it only the mover of the first-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, when am I supposed to move my amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendments before the House, which are of the same nature, relate to what has been termed "shared banking". The Irish League of Credit Unions is well aware of the need to protect the funds of credit union members and to ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place to support any move towards the provision of shared services to members. Obviously, there is no question of running into this blindly without the necessary regulations, protections and infrastructure. In light of the need for that level of regulation and protection to be in place, it is equally valid to say nothing should impede credit unions that want to move in this direction. If we were to pass this Bill without using it to spell out the fact that credit unions which might wish to move in this direction will be facilitated when they are ready to do so, it would seem to be a huge missed opportunity.I believe the credit unions are being eminently reasonable in this. The obvious point to make is that, as the Minister of State has said, by and large - with a few exceptions - the credit union movement is not in trouble, has not acted in a reckless fashion and is very responsible in how it uses and protects the funds of its members. Its general orientation is such that it is far less likely to engage in a reckless manner, as we know the banks did with gusto. It is fair to accede to this request that the Bill should set out the right of credit unions to move in this direction, but with all the protections and caveats that would be necessary to ensure they are actually capable of doing that and protecting credit union members. It is quite possible for the Government to come up with a formulation that deals with those concerns, given the need to be cautious, while on the other hand facilitating the credit unions to move in this direction. It is something that will be of benefit to citizens in providing them with an alternative to the commercial, for-profit retail banking system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points have been made but I will put one other argument. The Minister of State could call me a conspiracy theorist.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is highly likely that the commercial retail banking system would not be enamoured by the idea that credit unions could offer a greater level of shared services for members. We are talking about front-office services not back-office services. I accept the Minister of State’s point that there is no obstacle to the latter currently. This is about credit unions, through sharing services, being able to offer a wider range of services to their members which they are somewhat limited in their ability to do at the moment. I suspect – one could call me a conspiracy theorist – that the for-profit banking sector would not be terribly pleased with that and could lobby intensively at some point in the future behind the scenes or in some way try to exercise influence to prevent credit unions moving in that direction. I do not suggest the Government would be in any way complicit with such efforts by the banking system but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a private banking system would use its influence to try to prevent credit unions offering an alternative to its network. From that point of view it would be useful and it would give the credit unions confidence if it were explicitly stated that the legislation allows for the future development of shared front-office services for members of credit unions with the necessary conditionality on the need for regulation, protection and infrastructural capacity. The Minister should examine the matter and consider how we could come up with a formulation that sets that out in the legislation while putting the necessary protections and safeguards in place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we move an amendment and then withdraw it? Is that how it works?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has amendment No. 8 been moved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that, but if an amendment is not moved does that mean we can discuss it at a later stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does one have to move an amendment to be able to withdraw it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Ceann Comhairle is not pulling a fast one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The exclusions and term limits provided for in the Bill have excited a considerable amount of concern among credit union members, particularly as they strike at the heart of the credit union movement.They are based on volunteerism and on a principle of democracy. While it is entirely reasonable that the Government and the regulatory authorities would want to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise - some of the inclusions are reasonable in this regard - but the inclusion of voluntary assistants, employees and those who might have fallen into arrears, are problematic and should be removed. I refer in particular to the voluntary assistant because such individuals are at the heart of the credit union movement. One might well argue it is precisely someone like a voluntary assistant who is willing to give his or her time to the credit union that would be wanted on the board of a credit union. It does not make sense to include that exclusion. On the matter of the term limits, the Minister's defence on Committee Stage for these limits was the need to uphold a principle of rotation, as he called it. The credit unions have indicated a willingness to look at something at local level in the credit unions that would try to vindicate that principle of renewing boards and officer positions. However, the idea of Big Brother imposing these term limits in a way that could adversely affect the functioning of the credit unions and the right of the members of credit unions to democratically decide who should be a board member or an officer of the union, strikes at the heart of the democratic basis of the credit unions. The opposition and concern expressed by the credit unions and their members on this issue is entirely understandable. I suggest the Government should consider acceding to these concerns.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody is sympathetic to the notion of renewal, bringing new people in and developing them to run credit unions.That is a laudable aspiration. However, there is a problem in artificially imposing limits which could actually have a detrimental effect without resolving the problem, particularly in small rural areas and towns where one might not have the base of people with the necessary skills and abilities. The Government will have to reconsider this. Initially, the Irish League of Credit Unions was agreeable to the term limits. However, when it went back to the local credit union branches and members, people were up in arms about it, expressing strong opposition and reservations about the limits. The Government should take this on board. The grassroots of the credit union movement are deeply concerned about this issue, seeing it as a threat to their ability to function and an erosion of the democratic right of credit union members to decide who they want on their boards. It is a powerful argument when it is pointed out that no such limits apply in the banking sector or, indeed, in politics where one could argue they are more required. That is not to say that one does not get cliques or stagnant leadership in a credit union and some form of dealing with these is required. However, the credit unions' proposal that there should be protocols at local level to ensure there is rotation and renewal of board members is a reasonable compromise. This will bring together the Minister's reasonable concerns with those of the members about their right to make decisions about who they want serving on boards and as officers. The Minister should consider the concerns of the grassroots of the credit union movement and bring forward a formula that allays them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 32:In page 35, line 10, after “committee” to insert the following:“as expressed through a written statement issued to the director in question”.We discussed this on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated sympathy with the purpose of the amendment. Perhaps it was a mistake in my office or in the Bills Office, I am unsure, but the line number is incorrect. The original amendment referred to line 16 on page 35 rather than line 10. I wish to clarify that although I am unsure where the error was made. The amendment relates to section 23 which states "the board oversight committee of a credit union considers that a member of the board of directors has taken any action or decision which, in the opinion of the committee, is not in accordance with the requirements of this Part...". This relates to where there is a suspension or where disciplinary action is taken against a member of the board. This was requested of me by someone who was previously on a board and who had certain issues with how this disciplinary procedure operated. The amendment calls for any opinion, in cases where the oversight committee believes that disciplinary action is required or where someone has not acted in accordance with this part of the Bill, to be a written opinion in order that there is a clear record and transparency, accountability and recourse for the person in question. It seems a small but important and perfectly reasonable amendment and the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he believed it had merit. I hope the Minister still believes this and that he intends to bring forward his own amendment which will take this concern on board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My anger at the failure of this State to vindicate the rights of women over a period of 20 years or more has really risen in recent days. That failure has emboldened so-called pro-life advocates to once again argue about the lives, rights and bodies of women. This is the spectacle we have witnessed in recent days. They are arguing as to whether suicidal feelings represent a real threat to a woman's life, about when the threat to a woman's health becomes a threat to her life and what are the best interests of a woman who has been raped, is the victim of incest or has become pregnant with a child with genetic abnormalities. Those discussions are both obnoxious and medieval in nature. Some Deputies on the opposite side of the House have stated that we must discuss the intricacies of these matters. We do not need to do so because it is not possible to make definitive adjudications on psychological matters, on when a threat to a woman's health becomes a threat to her life, on whether suicidal feelings may lead someone to commit suicide or on when the continuation of a pregnancy represents a real and substantial threat to the life of a woman. The fact that any of these things might come to pass should be sufficient to ensure that the women involved would have the right to terminate their pregnancies. The only way to proceed is to allow women to decide. Savita Halappanavar should have been allowed to have an abortion because she asked to have one. That is the right we need to uphold and vindicate. In fairness to the Minister, he accepted this and indicated that the current legal and constitutional framework means that even if we legislate for women who are pregnant with children with genetic abnormalities, who are the victims of rape or who find themselves in the other circumstances to which I refer, their rights would not be vindicated. That is medieval. If those in government are serious about this matter and if they really mean what they say when they make statements such as that, then they should indicate that they are going to bring forward legislation to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution. They should also clearly state that a referendum will be held in order to remove these medieval restrictions on women. I saw a post on Facebook yesterday in which someone said they had discovered the meaning of the word feminism, namely, that women are human beings. We need to establish women's rights in this regard. The Government - if it means what it says - can commit to holding the referendum to which I refer. In the interim, however, emergency legislation is needed in order to cater for the judgment handed down in the X case. The argument that the Bill before the House is not perfect is not an adequate reason to vote it down. Neither is the argument that we have not had adequate time to consider it and the matters relating to it. If the Government really believes the latter, then it should offer to make time available for us to continue the debate on the Bill next week. If the Government indicates that we can use its time to engage in a non-guillotined debate on the Bill - this would give those opposite and everyone else in the House an opportunity to frame the amendments necessary to refine it - then we will not push the matter to a vote. The Bill was put forward in the aftermath of a terrible tragedy which we never want to see repeated and in order to expedite matters in respect of this issue. Doctors should never again be expected to operate in a position of legal uncertainty with regard to when they can act in the interest of saving a woman's life. I wish to put an offer to the Government, namely, that it should extend the debate on the Bill into next week, at which point it can put forward its own amendments. If it does not do this, then it appears that the Government is not serious about this matter and is again guilty of facilitating the type of delays that have marked the past 20 years.
