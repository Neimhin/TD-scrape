RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have never subscribed to the two-state solution when it comes to Palestine because it codifies and institutionalises the ethnic and religious partition of people, specifically Jewish people and Palestinian people, in a way that I do not think we would accept anywhere else, not least on this island. I do not accept it. Setting aside that debate, and the fact the two-state solution is falling apart anyway because of Israel's complete flouting of every elementary aspect of international law on human rights with regard to the Palestinians, what does the Taoiseach say in seeking nomination for Ireland to the UN Security Council about UN Resolution 194, which deals with the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to the homes from which they were expelled and to recover the property lost when they were expelled, whether in 1948 or 1967? In answering this question, the Taoiseach should consider the appalling conditions of refugees in camps in Beirut. I was there in July and it was absolutely shocking and worse than what we would see in the West Bank, Jordan or Syria. As the Taoiseach seeks to get Ireland onto the UN Security Council, do these refugees have a right, as those on the Great March of Return demanded, to have that UN resolution vindicated and be returned to their homes in what is now called Israel? If the Taoiseach does not believe this, his aspiration to be on the UN Security Council is meaningless because it is completely selective in its implementation of its own resolutions when it comes to the Palestinians. Will the Taoiseach look at UN Resolutions 55 and 56, which deal with the Kimberley process and conflict diamonds? This is a process which the EU will chair and there will be a meeting from 12 to 16 November where reforms of the Kimberley process will be discussed. There is a big demand in this regard by those who support the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian people themselves, because of Israel's flouting of international law, its suppression of Palestinian rights, its continuous use of violence, which we saw most recently against the Great March of Return and the killing of approximately 170 people, its use of administrative detention and the shocking national law passed by Netanyahu recently that states Israeli Palestinians no longer have the right to self-determination - another tenet of international law - in Israeli territory. Will the Taoiseach champion this demand, that Israel is suspended from the Kimberley process and that its diamonds, in which there is a massive trade that finances the Israeli military, are suspended from the Kimberley process and labelled conflict diamonds as they absolutely are?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation which reveals itself in the case of Sophia is shameful. I met her father a couple of weeks ago in DÃºn Laoghaire and he told me of her case. He has since told me that, in 2015, he wrote to then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, who told him that no child would be waiting for scoliosis surgery for longer than 15 months. At that time, Sophia had to wait 16 months following her initial diagnosis in 2013. More recently, the Minister for Health said no child will wait longer than four months for surgery. Sophia was placed on the urgent list in April 2017 and, without having had her surgery, she was removed from it in August 2018, which is 17 months later. The Government, at the highest level, through the Taoiseach and Minister for Health, has let this young girl down. Sophia suffers from scoliosis. Her condition is deteriorating and she could face the possibility of emergency surgery because the screws in the rod in her spine, which goes into her hip, are loose. Her internal organs are being affected and the curvature of her spine is worsening. This deterioration may impact on her ability to undergo surgery. It is not fair to put a child, and her parents, through that suffering and pain. As stated by Deputy O'Reilly, this is linked to the wider issue of 52 people having been removed from the surgery list, giving the impression that the list has reduced when in fact these people have only been moved to what is known as a "suspended list" and still need surgery. Many of them have complex needs and the State is letting them down. This is not acceptable and I want to know what the Government intends to do about it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is disappointing that the Minister is not present. It is even more disappointing for Sophia's father that despite repeated requests the Minister will not meet him. Consequently, we get answers which do not respond to the questions asked. Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach when the backlog of urgent and complex will cases be addressed. The Government needs to stop trying to manipulate the figures by moving people to a suspended list. As stated by Deputy O'Reilly, only one person has had scoliosis surgery in the UK under the treatment abroad scheme, despite many people being in pain and suffering. Why has the scheme not been approved for people on the list who are urgent, complex cases? If the Minister or the Government does not fully understand what is going on, they should meet Sophia's father who will explain the problem and discuss what solutions can be found to end Sophia's suffering and the suffering of other urgent and complex cases.
