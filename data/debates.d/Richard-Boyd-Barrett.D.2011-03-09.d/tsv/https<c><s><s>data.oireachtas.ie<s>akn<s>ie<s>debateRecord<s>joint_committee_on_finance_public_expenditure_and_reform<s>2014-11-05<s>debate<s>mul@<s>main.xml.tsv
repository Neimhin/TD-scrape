RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many questions I have about the banking sector are directed more to the Government than to individual banks.  However, I have a few questions for Mr. Boucher.  Does he accept the proposition that his bank, along with others but his would be at the top of the league table, is profiteering in terms of the interest rates it is charging on loans compared to its European counterparts?  This was raised earlier but I was not present, and I apologise for that.  The evidence from the briefing we were given is that the bank is engaged in serious profiteering in respect of the interest rates being charged, compared to what banks in the rest of Europe are doing.  How would Mr. Boucher respond to that?  How does he consider it morally justifiable, given that the bank would not exist today without the bailout it was given by ordinary citizens of this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the briefing document we have been given it is suggested the average rate for mortgage business in Ireland is 4.5% compared with 2.64% in the eurozone.  Is Mr. Boucher disputing this figure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise, but I was not here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am running out of time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It probably comes back to what I said earlier - my beef with how banking works here has more to do with the Government and its policies.  Mr. Boucher made an interesting comparison between the Europe-Irish and Europe models.  It bears more discussion, but, unfortunately, we do not have the time to do so.  I wish to ask about two related matters.  First, there is the matter of repossessions, voluntary surrenders, not just of principal private dwellings but also of buy-to-lets and so on, and the fact that a lot of people have been forced to give up their homes or are being put out of them by receivers.  Why do banks require tenants who are paying rent to be put out?  I have not read all of Mr. Boucher's document, but he has said Bank of Ireland is now one of the biggest or possibly the biggest lender to the construction and property and corporate sectors.  He has trumpeted the fact that it is engaged in a lot of lending in these areas.  I put two and two together and it seems all of this property has been made vacant as receivers move in and that commercial property is being bought up by others who are presumably financed by banks like Mr. Boucher's.  Banks get control of this property and in the meantime tenants are put out.  Rents are then jacked up, which is great for the people to whom he lends and the bank, but the consequence is a housing crisis and another property bubble.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Boucher accept that his bank is contributing to the problem?  Does he agree with me that this is happening and that banks are profiteering from it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not familiar with that component of the Nyberg report and how it was derived.  It is most important that it be decided by income and that banks not be glorified pawnbrokers.  Ultimately, it is a judgment call on the capacity of the customer in terms of income.  The security is used to repay the bank in a case of default.  It is the cashflow of the customer that is judged, whether it be a business, corporate, construction company or a consumer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think I am only going to have one minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My questions are about lending in the property, housing and construction sector.  I want to get my head around what is happening in that sector at the moment.  Will Mr. Boucher explain how he is making decisions about lending to property developers at the moment, what proportion is given to them of the finance they need to carry out a construction development and what criteria are being used?  My concern is that we would repeat all the mistakes of the past.  How is that working?  Is the bank lending to people to buy up property that was left over from the collapse?  How is that working?   In the document, there is reference to working in terms of public private partnerships.  Will Mr. Boucher say something about the types of public private partnerships in which the bank is collaborating and how that works?  What is the balance between its involvement and that of the State sector?  Could he give some examples?
