RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 3 October the National Homeless and Housing Coalition, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, housing non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as the Peter McVerry Trust, Simon Communities and Focus Ireland and housing activist groups such as Take Back the City and many others are calling for a major national demonstration at Leinster House to demand emergency measures to deal with the spiralling housing crisis. The protests follow the magnificent protests of mostly young people in the Take Back the City movement who have occupied scandalously empty residential properties that could be used for housing to highlight the obscenity of people suffering from homelessness. Let us be clear: they are not protests for the sake of protesting, rather they are driven by intense frustration at the Government's continued policy of relying on speculators, vulture funds and corporate landlords to resolve a housing crisis that the very same people created in the first place, a failed policy that continues with the Land Development Agency initiative, the continued sale by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, of public land, including the former Player Wills factory site, and scandalously section 110 tax reliefs whereby billions of euro are going into the pockets of vulture funds, the local infrastructure housing action fund, LIHAF, and Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, whereby we are financing private developers to build, in some cases, on public land, run away with the profits and charge astronomical rents and property prices, while all the while obscene profits are being made as the housing crisis gets steadily worse and the human misery it causes continues. The protestors are demanding a change in policy. They are saying: stop selling public land to vulture funds and speculators, start an emergency programme to build public and affordable housing on public land, introduce rent controls, adopt robust and aggressive measures to go after empty residential properties where there is no justification for a property lying empty when it could be used to house those who need housing, stop evictions into homelessness - nobody should be evicted into homeless - and establish a constitutional right to secure affordable housing. Does the Taoiseach think that rather than seeing paramilitary policing methods, with men in balaclavas, used against peaceful housing protesters - young protesters, in the main - some of whom were hospitalised such was the aggression used against them during the protests, and recognising that his policies have failed to address the deepening housing crisis, he might listen to the demands of the protesters? While he is at it, will he repudiate the unbelievable suggestion made by the Minister for Justice and Equality that gardaí should no longer be recorded in the conduct of their duties when it would amount to censorship of the press and the public in the context of their right to oversight of the heavy-handed policing tactics we saw used on North Frederick Street?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I condemn, unreservedly, any threat or use of violence against anybody by anybody, be it against gardaí or against protesters. Will the Taoiseach condemn the use of actual violence - not threatened violence - against wholly peaceful protesters? Some of the protesters were hospitalised with concussion, cuts and bruises or had to get stitches as a result of the violence of hooded gardaí and the private security people who used excessive violence against peaceful protesters. Yes, the Government should build public housing, as the Taoiseach has said, but last night I looked at his Departments' figures to refresh myself. They show that between 2011 and 2018 the Taoiseach's governments built 2,827 council houses while in the same period the housing list has gone from 96,000 families to 136,000 families when one includes transfer lists-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----of HAP and RAS, which, I put to the Minister, is massaging the figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The number of people in emergency accommodation has quadrupled. We have the shocking obscenity of children and families in growing numbers in emergency accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That policy has failed, and unless the Taoiseach addresses it and stops with policies that continue to hand over billions of euro in tax breaks to private speculators and landlords for land, property and cash, as the Government is proposing to do again with the Land Development Agency-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----it will never solve this crisis and it will continue to get worse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will share time with Deputy Coppinger and we will each have five minutes. Solidarity-People Before Profit will be supporting this legislation and the plan to remove references to blasphemy from the Constitution.It should be obvious why we must do it. It is a relic of an old Ireland that we need to leave behind because the special relationship - to use a phrase the Taoiseach used recently - between the Constitution, the political institutions of the State and a particular morality, that of the Catholic Church, has left a bitter legacy for huge numbers of people. For the sake of writers such as James Joyce whose literature was banned in the newly founded State because of this morality and these notions of blasphemy and, more seriously, the Magdalene women, those who suffered in mother and baby homes, the Tuam babies, children who were separated from their mothers, those who were the victims of forced adoptions, LGBT people generally who were persecuted by the State for so many years, single mothers who were stigmatised and vilified because they did not fit in with the morality of the church, for all of the victims of that draconian and supposed morality that was inflicted on so many and which caused so much suffering, it is critical that we leave all of that behind and take the morality of a particular religious view out of the Constitution and our laws and remove any special position it might have in the State and the political system in our society generally. It is long overdue that we would do this and we will support it wholeheartedly, but we must go further. Reference was made to seven reports and the recommendations that we not only remove references to utterances of blasphemy but also to seditious or indecent matter. Perhaps the Minister might explain why the Government ignored these recommendations. One person's blasphemy is another's robust criticism of a viewpoint with which he or she does not agree. That is also true of sedition. One person's sedition is another's completely legitimate criticism of the institutions of the State, society or particular laws. With regard to indecent matter, the work of many of the best writers of this country was considered to be "indecent". Ulysses was considered to be indecent and something that could not be read by certain people. Dr. Noel Browne's mother and child scheme was considered to be indecent, subversive and seditious according to the prevailing morality of the State. I do not know why this constitutional amendment does not also remove those references. More broadly, I believe that simply changing words in the Constitution, while not giving real and tangible effect to the need to separate church and State more generally, potentially leaves us open to legitimate criticism of tokenism. Why does the Catholic Church continue to control schools and hospitals, to refuse to pay its debts under redress schemes, to have an influence over the curriculum taught in schools and to have influence over procedures carried out in hospitals? All of that is unacceptable. While this measure is to be supported, it is tokenism, unless we move to give full effect to the complete separation of church and State, particularly in the education and health sectors.
