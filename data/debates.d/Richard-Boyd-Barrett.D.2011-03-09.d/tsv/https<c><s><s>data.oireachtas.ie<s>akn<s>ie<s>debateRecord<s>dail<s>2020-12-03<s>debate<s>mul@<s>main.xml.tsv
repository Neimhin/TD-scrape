RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the programme for Government, the Government committed to returning the support of healthcare workers for their willingness to protect us all. Last night, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party betrayed their promise to healthcare workers, in particular student nurses and midwives, by voting to delete the People Before Profit-Solidarity motion calling for those workers to be paid. For that betrayal, shame on Fine Gael, shame on Fianna Fáil and shame on the Green Party. I have been inundated since last night by the student nurses and midwives who worked with us on putting the motion together. They are not giving up the fight. They are now talking about the action and campaign that they will escalate-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to make the Government hold to its promise in the programme for Government to reward our front-line healthcare workers, including student nurses and midwives, for their work in protecting us all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government took the money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendments are in my name but I am hoping to hear from the Minister before I get a chance to respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a cruel irony in the exclusion of certain groups of people, whose incomes and employment have been hardest hit by the pandemic, from a scheme which is called the Covid restrictions support scheme. The threshold for this support is turnover being down by 25% to cover the ongoing costs which businesses have. I refer to insurance, fuel, maintenance and repayment costs. Since March, I have been highlighting two cohorts who have been the most impacted. Musicians have not seen their incomes impacted by 25%, or 30% or 40%, but by 80%, 90% or even 100%. If they do not have a premises, however, musicians are excluded from the CRSS. How are they supposed to pay insurance? How are they supposed to make repayments? How are they supposed to survive? I refer to the anger expressed by musicians yesterday, 87% of whom were excluded from the award scheme provided by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. That gives us an indication of the cruel injustice of this situation.Most musicians do not get the music industry stimulus package, MISP, award. Most musicians do not get the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Yet they are the people who are among the hardest, if not the hardest, hit along with the crews - the sound engineers and the light engineers - who stand behind them. It is not fair. I appeal to the Minister to make this scheme available to them. I will talk about the taxi drivers in my final contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was hoping the Minister would respond to the direct point I am making about that group before I make my final contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. The same argument that I made for the musicians and the crews, who I want to emphasise are behind the musicians, applies to the taxi drivers. The taxi drivers' income is either non-existent because is not worth going out on the road or, for those who go out on the road, is down approximately 70%. They have repayments on their cars. How are they supposed to make them? A taxi driver has to put fuel in his or her car to drive around the city looking for non-existent fares. How are they supposed to pay for that? How are they supposed to pay their insurance? The Minister has got to give them an answer. The pandemic unemployment payment, which I acknowledge the Government made changes to, is not enough to cover their ongoing costs. The reason CRSS was brought in, and is being given to businesses, is that the Government knows the huge numbers of businesses it is giving money to cannot meet their bills for maintenance, rent, insurance and repayments. The Government acknowledged that point but for some inexplicable reason, it denies it to a group such as the taxi drivers who carry those same costs, the only difference being that a taxi driver's premises is his or her taxi. It is a moving premises, but it is the taxi driver's place of work. The taxi is what the taxi driver has invested in in order to have his or her small business as a sole trader. I do not see how it is difficult to tweak the scheme to allow their inclusion and allow them to sustain themselves until things get back to where they were. I have made the argument. I would like to hear the Minister justify it. It would not cost much to do this but, God Almighty, it would remove much stress, pressure and hardship from 23,000 taxi drivers and their families, and the same goes for the musicians and the crew.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is being pressed. On a point of order, can I ask what happens if we call a vote now because there are seven committees meeting in Leinster House and Deputies, certainly, in the case of our group, are attending them? There is no way many of those Deputies would be able to make it over for a vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am merely pointing out that many Deputies would be disenfranchised if we called a vote. I am minded to call a vote but it is a little unfair on all the Deputies attending committees in Leinster House. Maybe we had not envisaged it. We are in a difficult position. It is a bit of a problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the interest of fairness to others who have amendments and to the Deputies who would not be able to make it, I have no choice. Maybe it is a matter for the Business Committee to consider, that is, that the possibility of votes clashing with committees meeting in Leinster House is a real problem.However, I have to be reasonable and, therefore, I will only press the amendment to a voice vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Ceann Comhairle knows.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 60:In page 29, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:"12. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on a levy on large profitable companies to meet the costs of the Covid Restriction Support Scheme and other supports to business.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 68:In page 45, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:“22. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the extent to which producer companies in receipt of section 481 tax relief are complying with requirements to provide quality employment and training, with employment legislation, taking direct responsibility for their employees and trainees and acknowledging the service of employees who have worked for them over many years and in productions similarly financed through section 481 relief.”.This amendment is on an issue we have debated on a number of occasions. I have to acknowledge, as I have many times, that the Minister has genuinely engaged, been helpful and brought in significant reforms around tax relief given to the Irish film industry through section 481. Despite-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we stop the clock?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment concerns the approximately €80 million in tax relief that is given to film producers every year under section 481. It is a considerable relief to support the development of the film industry. However, as the Minister knows, the specific condition attaching to this relief is that, in order to access the relief, the film producers must provide quality employment and training and must comply with all relevant legislation on workers' rights. They must also take responsibility for their employees and trainees. My amendment is asking for the Government to investigate with a review, to be done in a very short time, as to whether that is happening. I have also added a particular reference to the question of acknowledgement of service of employees who have worked for those same film producers over many years.That acknowledgement is required under fixed-term workers contract law. Despite the Minister's efforts and mine, and despite the declaration forms that film production companies are supposed to fill in and in which they must solemnly commit to give quality employment, take responsibility for employees and comply with all employment law, they are brazenly flouting that law, refusing to acknowledge the legal rights of their employees and blacklisting out of the industry those who attempt to assert their rights. They have already blacklisted a significant cohort of people. They are signing the declaration, which is the condition for getting the relief, and committing to the requirements, but they then walk into the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to state publicly that they are doing none of that. All the Minister has to do to establish that the relief is being abused, the law is being broken and rights are being denied is cross-check the declarations given by these producer companies with the statements they are making in the Labour Court and the WRC when the workers engaging in their film productions, which are supported by public money, attempt to assert their rights. Workers recently attempted to assert their rights around the issue of collective agreements made with film producer companies. I will provide evidence to back up what I am saying. A letter went to the Minister this morning from representatives of the workers. Its two pages briefly summarise the situation and I appeal to the Minister to read it carefully. I will cite a submission to the Labour Court, dated 19 September, from a film producer company that has got a great deal of money for many years. Workers engaged in the company's productions took a case over a breach of a collective agreement. According to the producer, which signed the Minister's declaration, the claims were raised on behalf of a number of individuals who were previously engaged on productions associated with the respondent, that being, the producer. The producer stated that neither this nor any of the other complainants were its employees. It accepted that they were associated with and employed on productions funded with section 481 reliefs, but in an Orwellian twist, it claimed they were not its employees. It went on to say that workers such as the complainant were engaged by designated activity companies, DACs, which were set up specifically for each production if and when commissioned, that there were no employment contracts with the respondent and that any employment relationship existed between the employee and the specific DAC. It claimed that, as such, each DAC was the employer and there was no continuity of service where an individual was employed by different DACs. The worker in this case had worked for that film producer, who gets money from the State on the basis of complying with the fixed-term workers Act, for ten years. This is a flagrant breach of the declaration. On 6 October, the CEO of Screen Producers Ireland gave evidence in the Labour Court in a case involving another producer. She stated that she would give evidence before the court that there was no possible basis, having regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment could be said to have existed between the parties, those being the employees who worked on the film production and the film producer, which got the section 481 relief on the specific requirement that it be the employer and acknowledge all the rights of the employees. This could not be more blatant. The Minister has published a declaration that commendably requires producers to give commitments. They sign the declaration, take the money from him and then publicly go to a State body and say none of these legislative measures apply to them because they do not provide employment to anyone and they do not have employees at all. The next day, they return to the Minister and tell him to give them some money because they will provide employment. The Minister cannot let this stand. Will he investigate these cases seriously and withdraw section 481 relief from companies that are abusing him and the taxpayer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's engagement and the commitments he just made. I have given him some new information, which I hope he will follow up. The letter, which he would have got today, elaborates on that. There is Orwellian, Janus-faced double-speak coming from the producers that are getting the relief. In order to get the money, they are telling the Minister that they will do certain things. They are not just quietly not doing them and breaking their commitments, though. Rather, they are breaking them publicly. Their representative from Screen Producers Ireland has given witness evidence in court against workers to the effect that the recipients of section 481 relief could never be anyone's employer. This is a serious abuse. The same producer companies are getting the relief year after year. The consequences for the workers are serious. If the continuity of service provided by someone whom the respondent agreed had been working on productions associated with it for ten years did not make the producer the employer, it means the employee's pension rights are messed up.The Unfair Dismissals Act does not apply to them. Rights they have by law simply disappear because a producer who gets the relief sets up a designated activity company, DAC, then says he or she has nothing to do with any of these things or the employees in the DAC. It is shocking. The consequence is not just for those workers, but for delivering on the creation of an industry with a permanent, developing and trained pool of workers - the crew one needs to make films and, indeed, attract investment to film.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, I genuinely thank the Minister for those commitments and his engagement and interest on the issue. I will make one or two other brief supplementary points for his consideration. There has been much talk about the possibility of a collective agreement as a way of resolving this. I will point out that the producers to whom I refer, and the people who support no change in the situation and who were defending the status quo in terms of denying responsibility for employment, essentially refused to go to the forum for stakeholders that was agreed by the Oireachtas joint committee. They refused and, effectively, vetoed that forum. One way to resolve it is for the Minister to have the forum, to have everybody in and to hear the case in front of independent people, like the Minister, who can hear the points and then adjudicate independently on it. There is intense lobbying coming from a certain sector that does not want the change. If it has nothing to hide, or if anybody else has nothing to hide, bring them all in and let us hear from them. Let us hear the different cases and make a fair and independent adjudication. In terms of a collective agreement, no collective agreement is legally possible if we are not talking about the employer and employee. When there is reference to the Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, employment agreement or a collective agreement, SPI is a representative body and is not an employer. In fact, it is saying publicly that its members are not employers. Its members or it, as a body, cannot legally establish a collective agreement because it is saying it is not the employer. Only employers and employees can have a collective agreement. By the way, the Labour Court found in a recent hearing that these same producers were in breach of a collective agreement they had previously undertaken.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the basis the Minister has said genuinely that he will look into it, I will not press the amendment. I thank the Minister for his engagement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 69:In page 45, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following: “22. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the effective rate of corporation tax being paid across the country and the effect of the closing of tax loopholes would have on revenue.”. I was hoping Deputy Barry would take up the mantle because I have to go shortly. I will make a brief point. This amendment is about loopholes and establishing a minimum effective corporate tax rate. We have rehearsed the argument at length. I believe, however, the argument the Minister makes is that if we did this, we would somehow endanger foreign multinational investment in this country. I do not believe that is true because they are paying such a low level of tax. As I pointed out to the Minister the other day, even on the day Mr. Joe Biden was elected, Mr. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat congressman, was asked on national radio whether these multinational companies would leave if a little bit more tax was requested or levied on them. He said he did not believe so because they make so much profit here and Ireland is such an ideal location, particularly because of our trained and skilled workforce, our access to European markets and the fact we are English speaking. Why would we not consider having a minimum effective corporate tax rate to address the clear and fairly brazen exploitation of loopholes, particularly in the areas of intangible assets and intra-group transactions. By the way, during the Committee Stage debate I was wrong to say that had changed in the layout of the revenue reliefs. It a bit hard to find online but just so we know, there was €16 billion in intra-group transactions relief. That is one loophole totalling €16 billion. That is the movement of profits to subsidiaries where they become costs for those companies, and through that mechanism they write down their tax bill, their taxable profits, to negligible levels. I believe the Minister knows the argument. He knows our view of it but, surely, one way to make things a bit fairer, to get a significant additional tax contribution and to close off what is clearly an abuse, to some degree at least, would be to enforce a minimum effective corporate tax rate.
