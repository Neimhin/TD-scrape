RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach was very pleased following the comments by Angela Merkel at the weekend that we were special.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach expected and expects the people of this country to feel pleased at these comments but, apart from the warm fuzzy feeling that we might be expected to feel after Angela Merkel's kind words, can he tell the teachers who are marching to the Dáil today, particularly the young, newly qualified teachers, what their new special status will mean? So far, their experience of being special is that if they start working as teachers this year, they are so special they will be earning 25% less than people they are working beside for doing precisely the same job, and they are so special they will earn €250,000 less over their working life, which is, by the way, the price of a house-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----because of their special treatment at the hands of the Taoiseach and the troika.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The young people of this country are so special they have had their class sizes increased, their SNAs cut, their language support and resource teachers cut, their capitation grants cut and registration fees increased for third level students. Can the Taoiseach tell the teachers on the streets, the young people of this country and their parents that our new special status means there will be no further cuts to education at primary, secondary or third level and that he will reverse this unfair discrimination against young, newly qualified teachers, who are special?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a former teacher himself, does the Taoiseach think it is fair that young teachers coming into the profession this year should be working alongside people doing exactly the same job but be earning 25% less? Is that not straightforward wage apartheid? Is it not discrimination and ageism? Is it not completely unfair? Is not utterly unfair that the difference in earnings over the lifetime of those new, young teachers will be the price of a house? That is the difference. Are they to blame for the financial crash that has hit this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should they pick up the tab? Is it fair that our young people, students with special needs and those entering third level education should pay the bill for the gambling of speculators, financiers and bondholders that the Taoiseach and Angela Merkel are insisting they pay? I ask the Taoiseach to tell those teachers, so they do not have to come out in protest and can concentrate on what they want to do, that he will reverse this unfairness and that the Minister sitting beside him, Deputy Quinn, will give a commitment there will be no further education cuts hitting primary, secondary or third level in the forthcoming budget. Can he give that commitment to us and to those who will be on the streets today?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is just a loan shark operation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 10,000 extra pupils a year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Through the Chair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As others have said, I do not know what happened in the Taoiseach's conversation with Angela Merkel and I certainly do not know exactly what "special" means. Special could mean better treatment or it could mean basket-case, as is the case with Greece and the impact of troika policies on that country. It would be helpful if the Taoiseach could tell us what he thinks "special" means in terms of treatment and what he is asking for. What, precisely, are we asking for? If we are not asking for debt write down, then it is difficult to see how any special treatment is going to alleviate the burden on ordinary people or do anything other than produce long-term stagnation, if not depression. We do not know what Angela Merkel means by "special" so I ask the Taoiseach to tell us what he means by that term. If we cannot get clarity on whether we are going to get debt relief, I ask the Taoiseach to consider an alternative strategy. As of September 2013, we will have a primary budget surplus. As of that point next year, the deficit will be entirely composed of interest on debt. That gives us leverage because at that point we can be self-sustaining. Let us tell Angela Merkel that if she does not give us a deal by the middle of next year that makes our debt sustainable, we will not pay back the money because the debt interest will cripple us. We will be in a position to do that because at that point we will not be spending more than we are taking in in tax revenue and we will be able to manage. Let us use that leverage and tell Angela Merkel that she has a deadline, after which we cannot be nice anymore because it is killing us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very good analogy.
