RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ordinary workers do not have that right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an example of there being one law for the rich - in this case, big business - and another for ordinary workers. An ordinary person cannot claim that because he or she had large debts in one year that cost him or her a fortune, the amount of tax paid the following year should be reduced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly the point I am making. It is not acceptable that there is one law for workers and another for business. It is even less acceptable that it applies to bailed out banks, for policies over which we do not exercise any control. The Minister might have an argument if he exercised some control over their lending and investment policies and their treatment of distressed mortgage holders. With members of the public, we have pleaded with him to do this in recent years, given that we bailed out and nationalised the banks. It is an utter scandal that, having bailed them out and nursed them back to profitability, at the very moment they are starting to make money, we give them back to the private sector which benefits from carried forward losses and will have virtually no or, in any case, a greatly reduced tax liability.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made the main point but I add to it the wider question of the various deductions and allowances that a bank or any other corporate entity is allowed to avail of to write down its taxable income. It is a scandal that is waiting to be uncovered when we dig into the detail. We need a forensic analysis of every single one of these headings under which a bank or any other corporate entity is able to write down its tax liability. Looking at the figures before me for 2011, I see there was €39 billion in deductions and allowances under various headings that year. The figure is pretty consistent - in fact, it is rising. I do not know the more recent figures. Every single one of the headings needs to be forensically investigated so that we can see whether we are being robbed. We have a good bit of evidence and we know that these corporate entities employ the best tax lawyers and the big accountancy firms to find ways to reduce their tax liabilities under various headings. Trying to keep up with them is a very difficult job. We will discuss a number of the means later - the section 110s, the means by which Apple managed to avoid taxes and so on. These losses carried forward constitute one of those very significant headings. It is an absolute scandal. Any forensic analysis of these headings under which taxable profits are written down would reveal that the Exchequer and the public are losing out a hell of a lot. The very least the Minister could do is carry out a review of this, consider it closely and let us all see what is happening under this heading, how much potential revenue is being lost and what the case for and against it is. These headings constitute one of the primary mechanisms through which the people of this country are being ripped off enormous amounts of tax revenue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are doing it under section 110.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 70:In page 23, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:"14. The Minister for Finance is to order a study to be carried out on the operation of Relevant Contracts Tax, particularly in relation to rise in self-employment in the construction industry, and is to report to the Dáil within six months of the enactment of this Bill on the findings of the study.".This relates to the concern about bogus self-employment, particularly in the construction sector, and the need to take action to curtail what construction workers and I believe to be wholesale abuse of the category of self-employment in the sector by big building contractors. We have raised this issue with the Minister a number of times and I have correspondence from the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners stating that they are doing their best, the criteria are good, they are trying to enforce them and so forth. However, I do not accept that we are serious about dealing with abuses taking place in this sector. I note that in the controversial and prominent case of J.J. Rhatigan & Co., the contractor who was building a school in Kishoge in Clondalkin, there was a long dispute in which building workers claimed that they were victims of this abuse of the category of self-employment. They were vindicated when they took a case in that regard, even though at the time of the dispute there were denials that there was a problem. There has also been an interesting variation in the figures given by the Department in response to questions as to how many people are categorised as self-employed in the construction area. At one point I received a reply stating that there were approximately 30,000 and then we were told it was over 60,000. In fact, there is also a figure that puts it as high as 70,000. To have that level of self-employment among the 130,000 people working in construction immediately tells one that it is being abused. I do not believe for a minute that more than half of all those working in construction are self-employed entrepreneurs. It makes no sense in terms of how construction operates. Signs of it are seen in cases such as the Kishoge dispute. The workers at the centre of it believed themselves to be employed by the main contractor. Then they were not paid for weeks, after which one of them was paid and was told that he was a sub-contractor and the boss of all the rest. They were unaware of this. This is what is happening, and it is on a widespread basis. Frankly, everybody knows this is happening, but there is no serious effort to deal with it. Many of the people who are categorised as self-employed simply do not fit any of the criteria that should apply to the self-employed, such as having offices and the like. They do not have any of this stuff. Clearly, they are people who have been taken on by the contractor but he does not wish to pay the various contributions, sick pay and so forth which he would have to pay if the person was categorised as directly employed on PAYE. As a result, there is evidence to suggest that the taxpayer is losing a huge amount of tax revenue due to people being wrongly categorised. Unfortunately, I do not have the figures with me now but I have quoted them to the Minister in the past. There have been parliamentary questions on this issue and the replies show a minus figure in some years under the RCT tax heading. In some years the State pays out more in refunds under this heading than it receives, in a situation where 60,000 people are categorised as self-employed. The State ends up with a minus figure. Even when the figure is a plus, it is a very small amount of money compared to the number of people employed. If those 60,000 people, or even half of them, were categorised correctly as PAYE workers there would be tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of euro in additional tax revenue for the State. There is wholesale abuse. There is a further piece of evidence of how this is continuing. The latest Purchasing Managers' Index shows that jobs growth in the construction sector is now at its weakest in 18 months, but we know that construction is growing at present. The index points out that it is because outsourcing is accelerating, so there is job displacement. As the construction sector begins to take off again our old friends, the developers, are up to the same old tricks again. They are displacing properly paid jobs with these outsourced jobs to supposedly self-employed people who are not, in fact, self-employed people. They are bricklayers, labourers and so forth who are being falsely categorised as self-employed. This is Italian mafia style stuff taking place in the construction sector and there must be a serious move to deal with it. It is very unfair to the workers, obviously, and it is also costing a huge amount of money for the taxpayer. The Minister for Finance should be far more concerned about the urgent need to deal with this. We are asking that a serious study be carried out in this area to get to the bottom of what is, regardless of how one looks at it, a very controversial and disputed matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A what industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I am glad to hear the Minister acknowledge that there is some problem. By the way, I have raised specifics. I cannot spend my days and weeks wandering around building sites conducting spot checks, so I am dependent on calls from construction workers. I have raised specific cases in the Dáil when I have been tipped off by construction workers about particular sites. For example, I raised a case in the Dáil eight or nine months ago and there was a raid three or four weeks ago. That was the delay between my naming a specific firm and site and a raid on that site. From the report that I received from construction workers, Revenue found that a large number of people had been mis-categorised when it finally bothered to raid the site. That was just one raid, and the problem is that there are not enough raids to identify a problem that is rampant. Anyone working in construction will say so. It is a cliché to say that the dogs on the street know, but there is wholesale abuse of the category of self-employment. It is being dictated by contractors because they have the whip hand. People approach contractors looking for jobs and believe that they have got them, only to discover that they are instead being categorised in this way and that, if they kick up a fuss, they will be out the door. This is how it works. Everyone knows it. Consider the number of people who are supposedly self-employed. It goes without saying that general labourers - bricklayers or particular trades people, for example - will comprise a larger portion of the workforce than managers or bosses, be the latter main contractors or subcontractors. One would expect that the portion of people who are self-employed would comprise approximately one quarter of the construction workforce. It is not a quarter, though. Rather, it is approximately a half. This suggests that major abuse is happening. Any reasonable person looking at the situation would agree that that is what is happening. A serious investigation is required. I am not the only one raising this problem, as the Minister well knows. ICTU has carried out reports on it and trade unions with significant numbers of members working in construction agree that it is happening. I will go slightly off point, but the Minister has raised another matter. It is true that there is a great deal of Lego-type construction. It is not doing much for the quality of construction in Dublin, aesthetic or otherwise. It is the cheapest way to bang stuff together and is too widespread. Some of that is precisely because developers do not want to have to deal with troublesome workers like bricklayers, carpenters, stonemasons or so on, who do quality work and build quality buildings, because they demand things like the right to pay tax. They cannot have that, so get rid of them and have as much of the Lego-type stuff that they can bang together as quickly as possible. Its quality is poor.This is something we have already learned to our cost with some of the construction practices in recent times. More to the point, it is something people who have to live in certain places have learned to their cost. I suspect we will find much more of it in the future. Apart from anything else, skilled tradespeople and experienced construction workers are also the best police for the purposes of quality control, which has been significantly hit over recent years. It is patently obvious that there is enough evidence in the form of allegations, and from groups kicking up about it and saying there is a problem, to justify a serious investigation. I can commit to bring to the attention of the Minister, Revenue and the public any tip-offs I get, as I and others have done in the past. If a serious allegation of widespread abuse of the tax system or of employment rights is made, however, it is up to the State to look into it and to find out if there is a systemic problem, which I absolutely believe to be the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made most of my points. There is enough opinion even in this committee, never mind the various people who have raised it beyond this committee such as ICTU, unions and construction workers, to merit the review we are asking for, regardless of people's opinions. The Minister said that construction is reporting growth in all areas and has grown consistently for the past three years. However, as I pointed out to him, job growth is stagnating. The PMI report I mentioned previously states that while the rate at which companies outsource work to subcontractors grew the fastest in three months, they are displacing direct employment. As construction picks up again, the move back towards subcontracting that was a major feature of the last construction boom is returning and with it, almost inevitably, an increase in bogus self-employment - replacing directly employed people with stuff that is outsourced, which opens up to all of the bogus self-employment. It is in that outsourcing that we see all the bogus self-employment. I accept that there are legitimately self-employed people in construction. I know that is the case but when the proportion of people who are categorised as self-employed is as high as it is and is increasing significantly while job growth is stagnating, that suggests that the abuse of the category of self-employment is increasing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will consider what the Minister has said and reserve the right to bring the amendment back on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We oppose several sections of this Bill that amount to incentives for landlords. We are not happy with the thrust of the Government's policy on increasing the availability of affordable rental property under whatever guise, publicly or privately provided. Tax incentives for landlords and developers are not the right approach. It has not succeeded, and rather than continue to forgo taxes in this area, we should be using available funds for direct provision. It is one or the other. If the Minister gives tax breaks or subsidies to private landlords, there is less money available to the State to provide the affordable housing we need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know the Minister thinks it is not true but I think it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is possible but the problem is we are not growing the economy. We have leprechaun growth. There is a student in Trinity College Dublin who is researching a PhD on corporate tax. He gave a presentation at the weekend which was quite stunning even for someone who has been as critical of the corporate tax regime as I have. I was pretty amazed. He showed a graph that stripped out growth based on intellectual property assets. There was no growth in the Irish economy. It was barely above zero.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will see. Much as the Minister can get the laughter and he is a very witty character, there is no doubt about it. The problem is that Ireland is the laughing stock of the international scene because we record growth rates which bear absolutely no relation to the real economy or the lived reality of human beings in Ireland. I would not say they would be sharing the joke. In fact they are not sharing it. It is certainly not delivering in the area of affordable rental accommodation and there is nothing to laugh at there. If the Minister is suggesting that it is, that is laughable. That is the thrust of our opposition to several sections, we think this is a misguided use of available revenues to continue to give them to developers and landlords rather than put what resources we have into the direct construction and provision of local authority housing and affordable schemes of various kinds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sympathetic to the issues Deputy Donnelly has raised, but in trying to develop something that would assist people in these circumstances, it must be tightly managed so that it is not subject to abuse or exploitation or become another loophole through which people can profit.If it were not done properly or set up with that danger in mind, it could be open to abuse. That said, I am sympathetic. With regard to the section we are dealing with, in so far as it covers interest deductibility, these are the only people who should get assistance. That is dealing with the wider section.
