RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A number of weeks ago Social Justice Ireland revealed that one in ten children goes to school without proper clothing or breakfast. The CSO revealed recently that 10% of the population is living in food poverty. Today we read, in a report from Trinity College and the ESRI, that two thirds of families of thousands of teenagers surveyed for the Growing Up In Ireland study are experiencing significant hardship and that the number of families in that situation has doubled in four years. Another survey reveals that nine out of ten people believe that after the forthcoming budget they will have less money to pay for basic food items.It is incredible that poverty and hunger are stalking the land in the 21st century. Against this background the Government plans to impose a tax of between €400 and €500 per year on the homes of already struggling families. Is there any red line the Labour Party will not cross? Is it willing to drive hundreds of thousands of families into poverty and hunger? Can the Tánaiste give us an assurance that those who are already struggling to put food on the table, clothe their children and pay their bills will be given protection and perhaps even relief in the forthcoming budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take that as a "No". The Tánaiste cannot give an assurance to hundreds of thousands of families who are living in poverty. Approximately 700,000 children live in poverty and hundreds of thousands more are hovering just above the poverty line. He cannot assure them they will be protected or get relief from the dire circumstances they face. The Tánaiste says there is no alternative because we must restore the public finances. A couple of weeks ago I asked a question on corporation tax which revealed that corporations that made profits in this State of €61 billion last year only paid an effective tax rate of 6.5%. If the Government brought the rate up to 12.5% it would raise between €3 billion and €4 billion and do away with the need for property taxes or further cuts in health services and education. Will the Government make corporations with multi-billion euro profits take the hit rather than families who are struggling with poverty and, in some cases, hunger?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Increase the effective corporation tax rate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These companies paid €4 billion in tax out of profits of €61 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I simply want them to pay tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are discussing the notorious blanket guarantee that Fianna Fáil gave to the banks, the major corporate donors, the bondholders and the speculators who helped to cause the crash in our economy and the wider European economy.Fianna Fáil initiated it and Fine Gael at the time also backed this guarantee. Whatever qualifications they may have put on it, when it came to it, just like the European political establishment, they prioritised the interests of the very institutions, speculators and financiers who had caused the crisis. They rushed in to provide an emergency guarantee to these gangsters, frankly, who had caused the crisis. The Government is claiming success in that we are moving towards the winding down of this guarantee. It claims this is being enabled because the banks are now able to access money on the international markets. Whatever small bit of stability might be returning to the famous markets, the Government should not count its chickens on that stability being retained over the medium to long term, particularly considering the net effect of the policy of bailing out the banks and paying for it with an austerity that is crippling economic growth across Europe. At some point the markets will recognise the significant contradiction. I would confidently, but regretfully, predict that the panic will return at some point when the extremely damaging downward spiral caused as a result of the austerity measures imposed on the European economy, begins to kick in and to make its way into the core of the European economy. This is beginning to happen. Even in so far as the Government is claiming success in its efforts to move towards the winding down of this guarantee, we should remember that this so-called success has only been made possible because these banks have been stuffed with the cash of ordinary people. The previous Government and this Government, under the diktat of the ECB, said that they would do whatever is necessary to protect the banks; it is their top priority. Everything will revolve around restoring the banks to so-called normality, bringing them back to profitability, bringing them back to where they were before the crisis began. I find this to be a bizarre aspiration, that we are going to nurse them back to the situation they were in before all this mess started and that we think that is the recipe for sustainable economic and financial development over the long term. This shows a complete failure to understand what caused the crisis in the first place. It is not just a case of studying past history because we will be counting the cost when the crisis hits again, as it surely will. The cost being paid by Irish citizens for returning the banks to so-called normality is the €64 billion we have had to borrow - for which we will be paying interest for many years to come - in order to stuff these banks with cash and restore the confidence of the all powerful markets. The cost is an unsustainable debt burden taken off the backs of the private banks, the for-profit banks, and unloaded onto the backs of the Irish people. If people are made suffer to the extent that we are making them suffer, the banks will be nursed back to health but at what cost for ordinary people? It is a cost we will be counting for decades, possibly. We are counting this cost now because of an unsustainable debt burden. The cost next year will be €9.1 billion in debt interest. The spectre of the deficit is constantly raised by the Government. We are warned that the deficit is €15 billion which we must cover. We are told that anyone who criticises the Government's policies is living in Cloud Cuckoo land. I ask the Government please to state the qualification that €9 billion of that deficit is in debt interest-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. We should not pay their debts and cripple our economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a terrible price which is even more galling when one considers that these banks which we have nursed back to health refuse to give relief to distressed mortgage-holders. They refuse to lend to small and medium enterprises and they refuse to put the mountains of cash we have given them back into the economy to create jobs. I draw the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to the sharp contrast between the behaviour of the banks we bailed out to this extent and the offer of the credit unions to use their assets to finance job creation programmes, social schemes and so on. They are pleading with the Government to use their assets to help the economy but the banks, which have been stuffed with our cash and which we own, refuse to do so. That is the contrast between the two. We will not support the extension of this guarantee. Over the next three or so years, we will be paying off the bondholders at a rate of €17.4 billion in 2013, €6 billion in 2014 and €11 billion in 2015. If we were to assert control over these banks, which we own, and if we were to default on these bondholders, that money could be used for the stimulus programme needed to create jobs, economic growth, the protection of the vulnerable and the development of the economic and industrial infrastructure of the country. Why not do this instead of continuing with this insane protection of the financiers and banking system that caused the crisis? The Government is allowing them to walk off into the sunset after we have bailed them out and paid this terrible price. They will walk off into the sunset, be again privatised and return to making profits, while we are left holding the can.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say anything.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not specific to this drilling exercise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the fishermen and the seismic survey?
