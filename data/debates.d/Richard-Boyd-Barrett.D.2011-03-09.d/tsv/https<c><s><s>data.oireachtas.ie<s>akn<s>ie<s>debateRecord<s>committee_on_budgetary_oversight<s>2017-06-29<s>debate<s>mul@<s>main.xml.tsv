RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did and I apologise for coming in and out. It is useful to have a chance to ask Mr. McDowell questions because I do not fully know about the workings of the bank. I understand the broad principles, but it is very helpful to get a clearer and more detailed picture. The EIB lends directly to a state for its own projects which are on balance sheet. It also does public private partnership lending and lending to semi-state bodies. Does it also lend to small and medium businesses or any element of the private sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What sort of conditionality does the EIB put on the loans? Is it primarily about the strategic nature of the investment or the ability of the particular project to be self-financing and therefore able to pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise. There was nothing I could do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is repetition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies. Genuinely, there was nothing I could do. I had to be at the management committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I was trying to get at.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. McDowell. Given that the level of capital investment has fallen way down since the crash and all that, a big debate we are having here - and I apologise if this has already been raised - is about the constraints of the fiscal rules as applied to capital investment. We are trying to make a case for capital investment to be treated differently from current spending. Has the EIB any view on this or any influence on the EU in this debate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Mr. McDowell say that again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a matter of interest, if something is co-financed by the EIB, if it thinks it is a good thing and our State, for example, thinks so too, would that be on balance sheet at the moment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. McDowell said the EIB does equity investment as well. Would it do joint projects with states?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the EIB do a joint venture with a state that would not be on balance sheet?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say the EIB had 51% and the State had 49% in some project to build social housing here, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the housing front, I am very worried about the PPPs. Mr. McDowell sounds quite enthusiastic about them.Can Mr. McDowell elaborate on the nature of the PPPs? Apart from anything else, they seem to be opaque and because they involve the private sector, we get all this stuff about commercial secrecy. We never quite know the details of a PPP. There are a variety of PPPs but my concern is that they are a vehicle for the privatisation of public land. Previously social housing developments on public land would have been 100% provided by the State with the State owning the asset at the end and generating all the revenue. Under these PPPs, my fear is that the private sector will end up with significant portions of the developments and deriving much of the benefit from them with the State not having an asset at the end of the process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I press Mr. McDowell on housing? I take the point that PPPs are diverse and so on. Setting aside other types of housing, which we can debate another day, I do not see the case from the State's point of view for using PPPs for social housing because under the old-fashioned model, it was a win-win for the State. While there was upfront capital investment, there was a constant revenue stream coming back. Any alternative requires that much of the revenue does not come back to the State and, in some cases, the State will continue for a long time to spend in the private sector as part of the deal. If we do it ourselves, we can reduce current spending because if the State does not provide council housing, for example, money is given to private landlords to provide social housing and, therefore, it becomes an ongoing current expenditure, the cost of which goes up and up as rents increase and as the private sector charges the State more to provide this housing. With the traditional 100% funded public model, it is a win-win on every front for the State and the people who need social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the State set up a semi-State body to construct social housing, the EIB could potentially lend to it. Would that be off-balance sheet?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the semi-State body had an affordable housing element as well as a social housing element, there would be nothing to stop the State getting money from the EIB and doing it off-balance sheet.
