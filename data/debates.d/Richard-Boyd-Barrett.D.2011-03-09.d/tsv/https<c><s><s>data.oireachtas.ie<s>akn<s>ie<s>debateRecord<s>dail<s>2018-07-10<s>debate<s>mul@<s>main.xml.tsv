RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government indicates that this Government should be judged on the basis of how it addresses the housing crisis. I wonder how accountability for that commitment is being pursued, given the ever-worsening housing and homelessness crisis and record numbers who are homeless. There has been a pretty pathetic output of public housing. I ask particularly about two of the big ideas from the Government in dealing with housing: Housing Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, and the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF. We were told when LIHAF was introduced that 40% of any development with such funding would deliver affordable housing. That was then dropped with no explanation. Now, essentially no percentage is guaranteed for money that was supposed to deliver affordable housing. It is a similar problem with HBFI, which is a major fund for lending to private developers but absolutely no commitment, guarantee or obligation on the part of those who get those funds to deliver housing that is affordable. What is the point in these initiatives if they deliver large sums to private developers but with no guarantee whatsoever that they will deliver housing that will help address the housing crisis and meet the Government's commitment to address that crisis?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we proposed it, when the Labour Party was in government for five years, it did not bring forward a minimum effective corporation tax rate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It did not bring forward a minimum effective corporation tax rate. That is a fact. There is no history to read. We asked the Labour Party to do so time and again. I am glad that it is now in favour of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is amazing. It is strange that Tim Cook's name cannot be mentioned. It is a little odd. Perhaps it is symptomatic, or just an office thing, but there is a fear of and deference shown to Tim Cook, Apple and similar corporations which I find extraordinary, with the access they enjoy. The Taoiseach and I disagree on Ireland's role in tax avoidance by Apple, but one thing is beyond dispute or doubt - Apple is an aggressive tax avoider which uses, exploits and abuses loopholes, whether it be in the Isle of Man, on the Cayman Island or here to evade tax. I find it odd that we do not challenge it about it, or, specifically, that the Taoiseach does not do so. Instead, we roll out the red carpet; it is given extraordinary access and there is no statement from the Taoiseach to say we think Apple should pay its taxes and that it is unconscionable one of the richest corporations in the world pays less than 2% in tax. How can that be anything other than obscene? When the Taoiseach met Mr. Cook, did he mention the extraordinary housing crisis in this country and the massive deficit in investment in water infrastructure, two issues which should be of importance to him, as well as the €110 million deficit in the public health service? In that context, did he perhaps reconsider, with Mr. Cook, whether it was a good idea to engage in a legal action to try to prevent the €13 billion from being paid into the Exchequer in taxes the European Union believed Apple owed to this country? Do the huge deficits in housing and infrastructure provision not give the Taoiseach and Mr. Cook cause for thought?
