RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Eleanor is 70 years old, is blind and lives in St. Mary's Centre - Telford - Merrion Road houses and apartments. It is the same site she lived in as a child in the St. Mary's asylum for blind girls and women, an institution named in the Ryan report and in the Residential Institutions Redress Act. As a result of a tactical liquidation by the Sisters of Charity, the institution to which we plan to turn over the national maternity hospital, she is being evicted from the housing, which was essentially leased and funded by Dublin City Council. A blind, disabled woman is being evicted by the Sisters of Charity. She does not want to leave but is under major pressure and is a vulnerable woman. This follows the loss of 200 jobs at the Caritas disability centre on the same site, where the workers only got statutory redundancy at short notice. The Sisters of Charity have sought to rezone the land and will make â‚¬50 million profit out of it. Could we have an intervention to protect Eleanor?
