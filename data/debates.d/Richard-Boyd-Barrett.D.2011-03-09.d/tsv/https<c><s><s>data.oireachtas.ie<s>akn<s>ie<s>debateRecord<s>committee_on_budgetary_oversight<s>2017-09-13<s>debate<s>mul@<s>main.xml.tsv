RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Coffey accept, as I think everybody does, that we have an enormous housing crisis? Apart from the social impact, it is now a macroeconomic problem and threat. If one does not have affordable accommodation, it becomes a problem for economic growth. It is now a serious disincentive for those who have left this country, including graduates, to come back and it may be a reason for starting to see a significant outflow of school and college leavers who simply cannot afford to live here. Does Mr. Coffey acknowledge it is a macroeconomic problem that must be addressed as a matter of urgency? Added to that, we have a major infrastructure deficit in other areas, including broadband, public transport, education and so on. Is it his job to comment on that and does he acknowledge those facts and the need to address them urgently? If so, is the fiscal space we are talking about sufficient to begin to address those problems in a serious way? Certainly, I do not think that €500 million can even touch the infrastructure deficit and housing problem before us. If he accepts those propositions, does Mr. Coffey have thoughts about what we should do given that he seems to think we should not borrow in a pro-cyclical way, which may be unsustainable, to increase expenditure to deal with those issues? It only leaves one option if the first two propositions are accepted, which is that we must raise additional revenue to expand the fiscal space. In other words, more tax must come in. That is the only sustainable way to do it within the fiscal constraints. I ask him to comment on all that. If it is true, must we not look forensically at where we can get extra revenue? That brings me to Mr. Coffey's report on corporate tax, which I accept is not a report of the fiscal council. While I do not agree with all of the recommendations, which fail to go far enough, page 120 is very revealing and could help to answer some of the questions I have just posed and which are posed to the economy. I am surprised that the following has not been stated and someone should comment on it. I would like Mr. Coffey to do so. Corporate profits have increased by 100% in the last six years; that is, from €70 billion to €144 billion in gross trading profits. Does Mr. Coffey agree that by any definition, it is a spectacular increase in profits at a time when we are arguing with a miserable little bit of fiscal space, which is not enough to address our infrastructure needs? Do we not need to look at that? Why is Mr. Coffey not commenting on it? Even DKM came here yesterday and said there was €23 billion in tax expenditures, mostly in the form of allowances and breaks for the corporates, which we need to look at. Is it sensible that we are giving out what DKM estimates is €23 billion when Mr. Coffey shows, for example, there was €66 billion in 2015 in allowances for the corporate sector? They are making €149 billion in gross profits and another €12 billion in other income, a lot of which is probably rental income for vulture funds. Do we not need to look at this?Would Mr. Coffey accept that the effective corporate tax rate, however one defines it, is falling? When one looks at the figures over the last number of years, we are not even close to the 12.5%. Whatever way one defines it, it is reducing. We need to look at that and seriously tighten up on it. That is a black hole in the public finances which, if we plugged it, could give us the revenues we need for the housing investment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that. Is it fair to say that the proportionate increase in corporate tax revenue is not as great as the proportionate increase in gross profits?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have Mr. Coffey's report helpfully out here in front of me, and it shows the increase is not as great.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only if one accepts that the enormous allowances, which Mr. Coffey's paper gives the figures for, are all legitimate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Their extent is pretty staggering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It happens to us all the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not spend much time on Brexit. Would Dr. McQuinn agree that many of the things that could be issues for us as a result of Brexit are really difficult to pin down at this point? We had the fluctuations, but on a range of other things we just do know what could be the potential impacts. There could be upsides and downsides. While I agree with Dr. McQuinn's point about encouraging greater diversification in export markets, do we not just need greater diversification in the economy beyond that? It is not just in the export area and there may be a necessity to develop other sectors of the economy that are not quite as vulnerable to fluctuations in the international markets.I will say no more about that because much of it is intangible. I welcome strongly the ESRI's comments on housing and pensions. It is absolutely right. Perhaps the witnesses can elaborate a little albeit they must obviously be slightly cautious about being too prescriptive. The ESRI seems to be saying in a fairly forthright manner that there are big questions about tax expenditures benefitting private developers as a mechanism to deal with the housing crisis. It is very strong on saying we must increase significantly the output of public and affordable housing. The ESRI notes that we are still well below the expenditure levels in those areas that obtained even back in 2011, which is a very important point. By the way, the level in 2011 was not enough either as we had a housing crisis then too. Perhaps the witnesses would like to elaborate on that. I agree with them strongly, if that is what they are hinting at. It emerged today that developers are saying they cannot build anything for less than €320,000, which is partly linked to what the banks are demanding. All that points to the folly of reliance on private developers to get us out of this mess. It would be cheaper to borrow the money and use public land to build directly. At every level, it makes more sense to ramp up direct expenditure on public and affordable housing rather than to rely on the market and tax incentives to encourage developers. Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that. I agree on the site levy but one must think about the extent to which it would actually force these guys to do anything. Do the witnesses have any comment on things like section 110 as a big area? Is it a problem, as I certainly believe it to be, that the Government cannot even tell us in response to parliamentary questions how much tax revenue has been forgone, or is likely to be, as a result of the section 110 break on rental income for vulture funds as well as on capital gains? That is shocking when we are looking for extra fiscal space. We have put down parliamentary questions, but the Government cannot tell us notwithstanding the fact that this is clearly a massive expenditure. There is no doubt that these people who have bought up all this stuff are going to make massive capital gains. They are clearly making big rental income profits currently but we do not know how much tax is being forgone in the area and cannot get an answer from the Department. I do not know what the ESRI thinks, but I find it shocking. I agree that the public pensions system seems much more efficient and safe. Do we need to look at tax expenditures on private pension tax breaks where they are benefitting high income earners with what one might call "gold-plated pensions", in particular, and start to reduce those tax expenditures and redirect the money to a better public pensions system with higher pensions for pensioners?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Dr. McQuinn not want to comment on the section 110 issue?
