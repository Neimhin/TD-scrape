RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In many ways, this Bill is an admission of defeat and fear on the part of the Government and a tribute to the unprecedented popular rebellion and mobilisation that has taken place against water charges over the past year. We have come a long way from when the water charges were first mooted to be introduced by this Government, when there were many threats and much bullying talk, which was summed up when the former Minister, Commissioner Hogan, threatened to reduce water to a trickle for anybody who could not or would not pay the water charges. The Government's strident and confident approach to trying to introduce these regressive and unfair charges has disappeared in the face of a mass popular movement that has brought unprecedented numbers of people out on the streets and forced the Government into a series of humiliating U-turns on charges. The threat to turn off people's water or reduce it to a trickle was disgraceful for anybody to even consider when we are talking about a basic human right and something that people need to exist. That threat was taken off the table and the amount of the charge was reduced, with a cap introduced for the charges in order to essentially appease the popular rebellion taking place on the streets as the Government backtracked. This Bill, along with the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 that we dealt with a week ago - in essence, a new Bill shoehorned into an older Bill at the last minute - are a further admission that this Government is just terrified of the massive movement against water charges. It is so terrified that it has had to hide anything to do with those water charges inside an apparently innocuous Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014. It meant that Bill, along with the legislation now being discussed, could be put into the last couple of weeks of the Dáil term so as to avoid creating any focus for the anti-water charges movement to mobilise on yet again. I am absolutely sure the Government was aware that there was a plan to have demonstrations when this legislation appeared and it did its best to try to minimise the time we would have to mobilise significant numbers. Hence, the effort to smuggle some matters to do with water charges into the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 at the last minute and ram this Bill through in the last couple of weeks.The public needs to recognise its own power and the fact that the Government is quaking in its boots in the face of the sort of mobilisations we have seen over the last year or so. The fact that Irish Water will not give out the figures on how many people have paid or not paid speaks for itself. It indicates that there is an unprecedented mass action of peaceful civil disobedience going on across the country. Regardless of the attempts by this Government to manipulate the Dáil timetable, to play fast and loose with the whole legislative process, and to spin and propagandise about the power it has or intends to give itself to deal with that boycott, the reality is that, just as the people of Greece had the courage to say "No" when faced with the bullying and threats of the troika and Angela Merkel, hundreds of thousands have the courage to say "No" to this Government's attempt to impose a totally regressive and unfair austerity tax, and they are clearly doing so in droves by refusing to pay these water bills. Against that background, what we have in this legislation is an attempt to make people think the Government has powers that it does not have to undermine that boycott. That is what this legislation is all about. Again, it is smuggled in in an apparently progressive move. One aspect of this is progressive, namely, the removal of the threat of imprisonment for people who are unable to pay small debts. That is a progressive measure, although the add-on of attachment orders, under which employers would be asked to make deductions from people's earnings, is an absolute disgrace. Employers would effectively be given a political profile of their employees. If they are, as hundreds of thousands are, engaged in an act of political protest by refusing to pay water charges, their employers will be given that information by the courts, with all the potential ramifications that could have for individuals. It also applies in the case of bills that people might simply have been unable to pay because they are poor, because they are low-paid, because they are on zero-hour or low-hour contracts, or for whatever reason. The Government is proposing to give people's employers the information that they have been unable to pay debts and have had court orders made against them to the effect that their employers are to deduct those unpaid debts. That is a pretty disgraceful move. This is another in a very long litany of utterly treacherous things for the Labour Party to do. For the Labour Party to give an employer that kind of information, detail and power over an employee is nauseating. However, we should not be surprised by a further betrayal by the Labour Party, which has given up even any slight pretence of being a progressive, left-wing party with the things it has done and the betrayals it has perpetrated over the last few years. That is a disgraceful element of this legislation, but the key characteristic of the legislation is that the Government is trying to kick the whole thing down the road. It is trying to shoehorn this Bill into a short period of time, misrepresent what is actually in it, and then kick the substantial issue of how to deal with a mass boycott down the line until after a general election. This is an act of political cowardice of the highest order. What I want to say to the many people who are opposed to water charges and who have been on the protests is that it proves how powerful this movement is. People need to understand that this sort of power, which can make the Government run, hide, kick cans down the road, manipulate, spin and mess around with the legislative process, shows that people are winning and that if they maintain the boycott and the massive mobilisations on the streets over the coming months, these water charges can be defeated and the Government that introduced them can be swept out of office.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Mulherin is absolutely right when she says NAMA has failed spectacularly to deal with the enormous housing crisis we now face. While she does not say so explicitly, it is an implicit and severe indictment of the Government because it has allowed NAMA to behave in the way it has. Many of us on this side of the House have been saying since we arrived here and the Government took office that NAMA should have been transferring much more land and property directly to local authorities to provide social housing. The Government simply did not listen. We have got a derisory social dividend from NAMA and that failure is one of the major contributory factors to the catastrophic social housing crisis we face. The problem is that the horse has, to a very large extent, bolted and a levy does not really deal with it. What should happen is a simple change of NAMA's entire mandate or to have all available housing and land that could be used for social housing immediately transferred to local authorities. Any cash that NAMA generates should provide the capital for a major social housing construction programme instead of being used to pay off bonds. While a lot of the money has been used to redeem its bonds, at one stage when NAMA appeared before a committee, it had €4 billion in cash reserves. That money could have financed a serious social housing programme. Recently, its cash reserves have been reduced considerably because NAMA has used the money to redeem bonds. We could have put billions of euro into a social housing programme but did not. I do not know the latest position but maybe the Minister of State can enlighten the House. Do we have an estimate of how much more cash NAMA will generate from the off-loading of land and properties before it is due to dissolve itself? What are we doing with that money? Why do we not say now that the money will be used as the capital for a serious emergency programme of direct social housing provision? A levy will just not cut it at this stage. It will not make any difference. The big question is the mandate the Government gives NAMA. That mandate should change so that NAMA is not there simply to unload big lots of land or property to whoever it can sell to just for money. The whole mandate should be geared around the provision of social housing and resolving the housing crisis. If its mandate is not changed in those terms, NAMA should be dissolved and everything it has simply given to local authorities. As we will discuss in more detail later, even if we did that, the Government would still have to provide the money for a serious social housing programme. Despite all of the spin and propaganda of the Government about the billions of euro to be applied before 2017 and 2020, one finds when one looks at the detail of the Government's social housing strategy 2020 that there will be no big social housing building programme. Approximately 85% to 90% of what the Government is doing is outsourcing to the private sector. Given the scale of the crisis, that means the stealth privatisation of social housing will be the long-term effect of the Government's policy, including in the legislation before the House. It is to Deputy Mulherin's credit that she points to the issue of NAMA and what it has not been doing and should be doing, but this particular amendment will simply not deal with the problem. The problem is one of Government policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fundamental problem with NAMA is its mandate. Everything else flows from that. It is important, in demanding the necessary independent investigation of the sale of its assets, to note that there are a hell of a lot of questions to be answered about the large portfolios which have been sold off at a fraction of their par value and whether the public interest was protected. All of this can only happen because of the flawed mandate of NAMA, which the Government should have changed. Some of us on this side of the House called for it to be changed from the minute we entered here, saying it needed a much stronger social mandate. The social dividend aspect of NAMA was tacked on, as we all know, to assuage public concern about these matters. However, NAMA was told to get the money in as fast as it possibly could and that the Government did not care how it got it; hence, assets were flogged to vulture funds. That inevitably opens the door to possible corruption and dodgy dealing. This is not about ideology. Wherever there is a sale of State assets or the handing out of State contracts to private interests, corruption exists. It happened in Italy with the Mafia and in Russia with the oligarchs. Corruption is an inevitable by-product of the process. I will give the Minister of State a more detailed answer on what I would do if I was Minister when we deal with the next amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have thought about this since Committee Stage, and when the Bill is added together with the social housing strategy it would be fair to say it is something of a pincer movement to force the further privatisation of social housing. If local authorities are levied for a failure to develop lands in their ownership, and if they do not have the money to build social housing because the central government does not give it to them, they will either sell the land or be forced into arrangements which effectively privatise the land through public-private partnerships. They will have to do this to avoid the levies and get capital from the private sector. That is the plan. This dovetails with all of the other measures in the social housing strategy. If announcements about housing solved the housing crisis we would have solved it in the past year, but when we look at the detail of the social housing strategy and start to parse through the numbers we see the pressure on the local authorities, to which this measure will add, to privatise land. When we look at the detail behind the targets for social housing 2020 strategy, we really begin to see that the strategy is the wholesale privatisation of social housing. Taking the social housing strategy for 2015 as a sample of what is coming between now and 2020, the response to one of our councillors who wrote to the Minister trying to get a breakdown was very illuminating. According to the reply, the Minister expects that 7,400 new social housing units will be provided in 2015, broken down as follows: 1,400 units will be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies; 3,000 will be under the social housing leasing initiative; 1,000 will be vacant local authority units which will be returned to use; and 2,000 will be new rental allowance scheme units. This amounts to 7,400 units. In addition, there will be 8,400 new housing assistance payments. Out of a total of approximately 15,000, 2,000 plus 3,000 plus 8,400 will be from the private sector. The vast majority will be money going out to developers and landlords in the private sector. A tiny fraction of the big headline social housing commitment being made by the Government will be through the direct provision of local authority housing. The rest of it will be under various rental and leasing arrangements with private landlords and private developers, the very people to whom we have just sold all of these massive portfolios for a song. These vulture funds or speculators have benefited from the misery inflicted on the rest of us in terms of austerity, the cost of the crash and the cost of the bailout. These guys come in, buy the stuff for a song and will rent it back to the local authorities, sucking huge amounts of money on an annual basis out of the public coffers and into their swelling bank accounts. This, of course, also has the advantage of driving up rents and property prices because, if it were possible, it is an even smaller cartel than the previous cartel of developers and land bankers. We will have an even smaller golden circle of people controlling the vast majority of rental and commercial land and profit in the State.This includes private rental and commercial property etc. It is an absolute pincer movement, a scam of unbelievable proportions, with which we will at an even more intense level do again what caused the last crash. The last lot in power made an absolute bags of it and reduced social housing provision to a trickle but this Government is, more or less, closing it down. That was the announced policy in July 2011, when it was publicly indicated that direct social housing provision would be stopped. Even with the slight reversal of that at the rhetorical level, in reality the Government is continuing along that line.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am reading the figures from the Minister. How can they be explained? From a total of 15,000 housing units next year, only 1,400 will be new council houses. That means 10% of the social housing that the Government has indicated it will deliver next year will be council housing, with slightly over 80%, taking into account the returned units, being sourced from the private sector. This, in conjunction with the housing assistance payment, HAP, is a wholesale move into the privatisation of social housing. The voluntary housing bodies, generally speaking, are decent organisations with decent people in the social housing area for the right reasons. Still and all, many people would prefer to be in council houses than in housing provided by the approved housing bodies. I bet that most of the 1,400 houses is not council housing but rather stock from approved bodies. In England, as the voluntary housing sector expanded at the expense of direct provision of social housing, it became big business as well. For-profit operators began to move to the voluntary housing sector and I can guarantee that will happen here too. The Minister of State has challenged us on making these criticisms by asking us what we would do. I, along with most of the people making these contributions today, have been saying since the week we came in here what we would do. We have been saying it almost on a weekly basis for approximately four years. It is disingenuous to say we have not put our views forward but, for the record, I will do so again. The total cost of projects like the rental accommodation scheme or RAS, HAP and the various ways in which we subsidise private landlords and developers in the social housing sector is approximately €1 billion per year. That includes RAS, social leasing and rent allowance, and it is money going out and down the flipping drain. If we take 15 years, for example, to solve the problem, we could spend €15 billion on a serious emergency social housing programme that would build 20,000 or 30,000 social houses per year for the next five years. It would cost much money up-front but that would be recouped within ten or 15 years because every single council house built is money saved in the long term. That would equate to money not going out of the State coffers into the pockets of private landlords. It would be a sure-fire, guaranteed winner for State if we built directly provided council housing. We would own the asset and it would be much more secure accommodation for the tenants and so on. It would also generate money for the State through rental revenue. Another big effect would be regulation of the housing market in general by keeping down property prices. If a tiny oligarchy of developers and vulture funds controls all the property, we are guaranteed bubbles and busts because we have no control over what they do. This can be counteracted with a big bank of social housing, which would act as a sort of deadening weight on property bubbles occurring in the first place. That would keep down the general level of property and rental costs. In the 1940s and 1950s, when the State had far less money than it does now, at least we understood that logic. When Ireland was virtually a Third World country, we built thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of council houses per year. How did people manage that? They knew it was a good investment. As the proportion of housing provided in any given year has become less public and more private, we have ended up where we now are, complete with bubbles and crashes. This idea would be an investment against future crises, not to mention saving the State money and, most importantly, dealing with the catastrophic housing crisis we now face. The Minister of State might argue that we could not achieve that in a year or two. If the Government had listened when we argued for this in 2011, we would not be in the current mess. If the Government admitted that the housing list is a disaster and it messed it up but it would rectify it, even if people were not housed in a year, they could be housed in the next two to three years. That would at least give people hope. This does not even consider the construction work that would be generated, taking people off the live register and giving employment at a local level. All of this would provide hope and enthusiasm to people, who could believe that we are seriously dealing with the problem. There would of course have to be temporary measures in the mean time and there is no good solution in this regard. That is the cumulative cost we are paying for the failure to get this right over the past 20 years. We should start now and recognise what we did in essentially abandoning the provision of council housing over the past 20 years. The process has worsened under this Government but it was a disaster under the last Government as well, when resources were reduced to a trickle. This was a major contributor to the property madness, as housing came to be seen as just a commodity on which to speculate rather than an essential element of society. Even the economy will now pay a price. Government Deputies often see us as the bleeding heart liberals who want to do everything for everybody but who do not know how to pay for it. Those Deputies see themselves as the hard-headed pragmatists who really understand the economics of the issue. If we do not deal with the cost of accommodation, property and rental prices and the lack of affordable accommodation, there will be a serious problem even for the Government's beloved foreign direct investment. Even the multinationals know that people need affordable places in which to live, although they do not want to pay any higher taxes to provide them. Jesus Christ, I would not want to say that Guinness had particularly enlightened capitalists but even that company built social housing and understood that its workers, from whom they wished to profit, had to have somewhere to live, or else those people could not go to work the following day. The capitalists from the 19th century were more progressive than the gang of multinational vultures that we now have. They will not do it unless the Government indicates that housing must be provided for all sorts of reasons, including macroeconomic and humanitarian reasons. There is a basic right to housing and a decent, dignified existence for human beings, whether one argues from the bleeding heart liberal perspective or the hard-headed macroeconomic side.Instead, with this Bill and the other measures it is taking, the Government is pretty much outsourcing the lot. That is going to be an absolute disaster. That was a slight digression from the amendment, but the point about the amendment is that imposing this levy on local authorities will be a pressure for them to privatise, either directly by selling the land or indirectly by engaging in public private partnerships, which will effectively privatise it.
