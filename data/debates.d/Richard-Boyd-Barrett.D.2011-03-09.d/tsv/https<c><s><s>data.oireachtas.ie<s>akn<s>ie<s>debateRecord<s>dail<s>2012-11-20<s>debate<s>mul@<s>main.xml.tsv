RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I concur on the point about all the questions being grouped together. It is reasonable enough to group questions on EU summits although they may have different aspects, but this group contains quite distinct issues and it does not make much sense to group them. Given that the discussion has focused on the victims of conflict and violence, the point about truth and reconciliation and giving all victims on all sides the opportunity to speak out and get justice is right. This is what we should do. It is important for politicians of all varieties, and not only those who are directly involved in the conflict, to recognise that war and conflict break out when politics and the political authorities fail. We all bear a responsibility when this happens. The Taoiseach recounted genuinely moving meetings and the terrible trauma that families and victims have suffered. In this context I ask genuinely in the spirit of trying to work together out of concern about such terrible things happening that the Taoiseach show urgent concern about the same appalling things happening to young children, women and families in Gaza at present and raise it with the political authorities in Britain-----

Whatever different perspectives we take on this history our country has a particular responsibility to speak up, speak out and intervene to ensure these horrors do not continue as they are continuing day in day out. The photograph of the al-Dalou family with four young children laid out dead-----

I do not know whether the Taoiseach has seen it. We need to do something about this. I received a letter today from the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will finish on this point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I would like him-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to raise this with him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle gave quite a lot of leeway to the other speakers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two more sentences.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----for human feelings and victims. To make a point there is some connection between this and what is going on in Gaza is reasonable.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very unfair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With them, but not with me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I am glad the Taoiseach has agreed to the debate on Gaza and the escalating crisis there. Hopefully, it can be held as soon as possible, because it is important that this Parliament be seen to speak out on the issue. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle can tell me what is the procedure regarding the request by the speaker of the Gaza legislative council that he might be invited to this Parliament. What is the protocol?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I simply ask what is the protocol regarding that request from the Gaza legislative council that its members might visit this Parliament to meet the Taoiseach, the Ceann Comhairle and representatives of the political parties?
