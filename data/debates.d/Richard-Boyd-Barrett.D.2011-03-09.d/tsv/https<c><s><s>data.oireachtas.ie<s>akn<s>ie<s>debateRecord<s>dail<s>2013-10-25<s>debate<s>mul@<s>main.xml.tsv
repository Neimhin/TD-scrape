RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are wishing for the Minister to reverse the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are already a disaster.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Am I not next?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One part of the Government strategy to deal with unemployment is to drive all of the young people out of the country. From this section, I wonder whether the other part of the strategy is to stop women having children. That is what it looks like and that is what the effect will be. In a disgraceful way, the Government is disincentivising women from having children. It is appalling that the Labour Party would be complicit with this sort of attack on expectant mothers, mothers who have just had children and families that are adopting. As the first year or so is critical, this is not just an attack on mothers, but on children when they are most vulnerable and most need support and nurturing. It does not get much lower than - we have been trying to total up the numbers - taking €936 from mothers who have just had or are expecting kids. This is a large chunk of money. On top of the child benefit cuts imposed last year and the taxing of maternity benefit, many will not be able to have children. As with all of these cuts, the least well-off will be hit hardest. Having children will become an option for the rich, but not a viable option for the less well-off. Shame on the Minister. She should withdraw this section. It is a disgrace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We cannot hear Deputy O'Dea.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have to put up with that frequently.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is my microphone switched on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will wait for the Minister to switch off her mobile telephone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not mine either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not my telephone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Labour Party once stood for anything, it was the welfare state and the idea of cradle-to-grave protection and welfare. However, in this budget the Minister literally is providing cradle-to-grave austerity and to hit people at the saddest times in their lives really is obnoxious. No other word describes it and as other Deputies have noted, this will hit at the least well-off. Death is a terrible time for people, as well as being extremely stressful, and it is simply appalling to add to that stress by imposing a further financial burden on less well-off families while they are trying to bury their loved ones. As it stood, the bereavement grant of €800 would not even pay a fraction of the cost of a funeral these days. Even in death, the inequality in society manifests itself, as those who are less well off are under pressure, are stressed and are pinned to their collars to bury their loved ones. This small support that was available to them now is being pulled away from them by a Labour Party Minister. She should be ashamed of herself about this measure. She should withdraw it, like so many of these other nasty, ruthless and cruel cuts she is imposing in this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would take six months to process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, we were told earlier that the order in which speakers were called was according to the list. The Ceann Comhairle told us that, as did Deputy Olivia Mitchell.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect, we were told the exact opposite of that just before the last vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were told that by the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Olivia Mitchell.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did the Ceann Comhairle tell us the opposite earlier?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle told us it was going according to the list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle was calling them according to the list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am entitled to be called as I have tabled an amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle is making the rules up as he goes along.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to ask the Ceann Comhairle a brief question. I am trying to understand what is happening here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to fight with the Ceann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do want to speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Ceann Comhairle calling Members in the order in which they submitted amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to know if everyone who has submitted an amendment will have an opportunity to speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We move on through the depressing list of targets set in this really ruthless Bill. We have already dealt with women who are having children, people who are burying their dead and those who are injured or become sick at work. Now we are moving on to young people. The Minister laughably tries to justify this measure with references to labour activation. I am sure she is aware that the real activation for young people is to leave the country. The fact that they are leaving certainly shows they are not sitting at home in front of plasma-screen TVs, lazing about the place waiting for someone to offer them employment, or living in luxury - as the Minister might see it - on social welfare payments. These individuals are leaving because they are energetic, educated and dynamic and there is nothing here for them. How much more dynamic and energetic does the Minister want them to be? They want jobs, but what she is doing is attacking their incomes and providing them with lots of fake jobs. It is important to place on record the fact that officials from the Department of Finance came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and highlighted an anomaly in the Government's figures. This anomaly relates to an apparent drop in unemployment and a slight rise in employment in circumstances in which no corresponding economic growth had occurred. The officials could not explain the reason for this, but there is an explanation, namely, that everybody is leaving the country and that the so-called jobs that are being created are not real jobs. People are paid virtually nothing when they take up these jobs but they are still classed as no longer being unemployed. The officials stated that the surveys carried out by the CSO ask people whether they are employed or unemployed. If someone is on a Tús, JobBridge or JobsPlus scheme or if he or she is involved with the Government's new brainchild, the Gateway project - which is a disgrace - under which people on social welfare payments will be given an additional €20 per week to do council workers' jobs, thereby essentially doing away with real jobs, he or she will be classed as being employed but there will be no corresponding growth in GDP because the person is not actually contributing to the economy but is in a fake job. Such jobs do not give rise to growth.This explains the anomaly pointed out by the Department of Finance. We need real jobs. They can happen only with investment, not by taking money from people, which is an attack on them and on their spending power and in turn damages the economy. We need real investment to create jobs. That could be done by taxing wealth instead of attacking young people, as many on this side of the House have said time and again. It is a disgrace that the Minister is making this attack on young people. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The cut to mortgage interest supplement means hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs as a result of crisis caused by others will have the misery of losing their jobs compounded by the great likelihood of losing their homes. This is a case of making a bad situation worse and of rubbing salt into the wound. It is appalling. There is an implicit acknowledgement in this measure that the Government does not believe any of its own talk about economic recovery and improvement in the employment situation here. If it believed there was any serious prospect of economic and employment recovery it would not feel the need to introduce this cut. It would see it as a stopgap for people who lose their jobs but have a realistic prospect of getting another one sometime soon. Obviously, Government does not believe that. It does not believe for one minute that its policies are capable of providing employment for those who have lost their jobs and who now face the prospect of losing their homes. The Government is implementing this cut because it does not believe its own propaganda and because it sees mortgage interest supplement as a potential drain on the public finances.  A better and fairer way of resolving this situation would have been to force the banks to write down unsustainable debt, which the Government has refused to do. Yet again the banks are protected and ordinary people suffer the loss of their jobs and, now, the likelihood of losing their homes. This cut, like so many of the other cuts proposed in the Bill, is shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To try to answer the question Deputy Shortall has raised, there is, among the Fine Gael Party and a certain element of society, a certain contempt directed towards people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a belief among people who are generally better off and have never found it necessary to depend on the social welfare system that those who depend on that system are somehow being dishonest and lazy and leeching off the system. In their minds, what we need to do is toughen up such people by giving them a hard time and they will then return to work. While this view is not stated explicitly, I believe it is held by certain members of the Fine Gael Party. However, a cursory examination of the past 25 years will show that it is utter nonsense. In the 1980s, the head of the Central Bank made a disgraceful statement about spongers on the dole. I recall that his remarks caused outrage and led to protests and so forth. At that time, he could try to make that argument because, as Deputies will recall, the 1980s were characterised by mass, long-term unemployment. This lie should have been completely nailed, however, when the economy took off and employment became available because people took jobs and unemployment declined to negligible levels. There is always some unemployment as people need to move between jobs and graduates emerge from college seeking employment. There is also a tiny number of people, usually consisting of families with deep problems who have been damaged by one or other circumstance, who may be long-term dependants on the social welfare system. The idea that a majority of people would want to live on the miserable amount of money paid under the social welfare system, with the lack of dignity and so on that this entails, is nonsense. Nevertheless, a significant section of the Fine Gael Party believes this nonsense. They should ask why, if that is the case, everybody took jobs when they were available.  A friend of mine, a skilled tradesman who lost his business in the recession, has been applying for five or six jobs virtually every week. He informed me that when we went for a job in a warehouse in Sandyford recently, he found that 2,500 others had also applied for it. It is not the case that people are not seeking work. The Government is failing to provide employment and is punishing people for losing their jobs and being unable to find another one.  Having picked on everyone else, why should the Government not pick on 65 year olds? It attacked the transition pension and will no doubt tell us the purpose of the measure is to rectify an anomaly. It is notable, however, that all such rectification involves measures with downward rather than upward realignment.
