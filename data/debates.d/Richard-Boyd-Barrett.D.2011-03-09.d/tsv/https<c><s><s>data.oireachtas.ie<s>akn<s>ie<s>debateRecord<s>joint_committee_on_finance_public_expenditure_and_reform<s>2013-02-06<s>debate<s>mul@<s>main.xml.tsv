RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank everyone for attending. The witnesses are the experts here so I want to learn from them. I agree there should not be any fees or restrictions on access to information and no disincentives. We must open up the State to full scrutiny by journalists and others. The disadvantages faced by freelance and regional journalists were outlined. I am not defending the fees, which I think should be abolished completely, but the other side of the coin is that if the State is opened up to full and free access to all information, there will be a significant increase in the number of freedom of information requests, which will then place an administrative burden on the State. Is that the case? We will need more people to work on this. Perhaps the other side of the coin of asking for full and free access is an acceptance or an acknowledgment by the media that are critical of the size of the public service and want it to be culled that if they want this information, more employees are needed to provide it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will our guests comment on the particular areas where journalists have been prevented from obtaining information and in the context of which it is important to obtain such information in the public interest? I am particularly concerned with regard to commercial sensitivity being used as a catchall mechanism to prevent all sorts of information which I would have thought to be in the public interest - particularly that relating to public private partnerships, semi-State bodies and matters involving the State's finances and the use of public money - from being released. Will our guests provide some examples in respect of this matter and comment in greater detail on it? I did not catch the reference to environmental matters at the very beginning of the presentation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are our guests in a position to provide examples of where commercial sensitivity is used to prevent the disclosure of information, particularly in the context of semi-State bodies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point on fees and I completely agree that we should get rid of them. However, I am referring to exemptions and how they are used. I would like our guests to provide some examples. Ms O'Kelly has already provided one such example which is shocking. Will our guests elaborate on how exemptions are used?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Anti-Deportation Ireland. I thank the committee for agreeing to see the witnesses and I thank them for making the request to come here. I know their concerns are much broader than the issue of freedom of information. Hopefully, one thing that will come out of this first engagement with the Oireachtas is that they might go on and try to be heard by other committees dealing with some of the other aspects of the situation they are in. Our particular job is to identify how we can mend the draft legislation in such a way as to assist and shine a light on the refugee and asylum process, which the witnesses have described as a process that really needs to be looked at and be much more transparent. However, what we need to know is what we have to do to this legislation to achieve that end for them. It is absolutely clear to me - and, I suspect to most of the committee members - that this needs to be done. My view is that there is a total veil of secrecy over this process because it essentially keeps those concerned away from the rest of the community and facilitates deportations in the dead of night. I believe, although I could be wrong, that it is a systematic policy and that is why it is difficult to get the information. I suspect that is what the witnesses know to be the case. What we need is the information and to get the truth - the objective facts - out there about the processes so that society as a whole, the Oireachtas and everybody else can see it. What the Chairman was trying to get at and what we need to get at are what specific provisions or amendments we need to put into this Bill in order to ensure those concerned, the media and anybody who wants it can get free access to information about this.  Is it the case that the witnesses believe there needs to be a specific statement in the Bill to clarify the full application of freedom of information to all of these processes? Do they believe it is not stated clearly enough and that because it is not clearly stated or because there are exemptions or limitations on the information currently, it is allowing this veil of secrecy to continue? Listening to what was said, what seems to be necessary is a clear statement at the outset of the Bill or somewhere else explicitly setting out that full information on all the processes relating to these particular agencies must be fully subject to freedom of information provisions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Information was refused on the grounds it was sensitive to security or was exempted from the normal application of freedom of information in some way. Does Anti-Deportation Ireland want information to be fully available on the way in which contracts are given out to direct provision centres, and the rules for running them? That information is currently not available to the organisation but would be important to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Similarly, the criteria surrounding the judging of refugee applications and appeals, and the manner in which people are selected to adjudicate on appeals, is not being made available and Anti-Deportation Ireland is being blocked from getting information on that process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Also, information on deportations and the rules and regulations surrounding them, and complaints that might be made by deportees about the process, is not being made available.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Bukha has made a very clear point on the deaths of refugees and that there is no comprehensive catalogue of the circumstances of their death. Is it Mr. Bukha's belief that if there was full transparency surrounding the circumstances of the people who died, and the number who have died in the centres, it would reveal a high level of suicide or premature deaths?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Mr. Bukha elaborate on the point he made about the way the Geneva Convention is invoked and whether people are stopped as they try to enter this country? What is the exact point he wants clarified?
