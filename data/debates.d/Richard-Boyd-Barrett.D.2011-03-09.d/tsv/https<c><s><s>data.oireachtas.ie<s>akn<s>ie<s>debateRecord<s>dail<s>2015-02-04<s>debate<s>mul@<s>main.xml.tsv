RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Welcome to the bizarre, surreal and labyrinthine world of financial capitalism in the early 21st century. That is about all I can say when I consider this Bill and what it is trying to deal with. It is difficult to know where to start. Of course, this is part of the problem faced by ordinary human beings trying to do simple things like put a roof over their heads. How simple these things were once upon a time. Now when a person tries to put a roof over his head, he is faced with problems that are summed up with the following statement from one of the helpful guides on Bills given to Deputies by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service - I love this stuff:In short, the institutions that typically purchase loan books in order to service them are structured in such a way that the legal entity which employs people to service said loan books is a separate entity than the one that owns the loan book. This means that the owner of the loan book would be regulated but the entity that interacts with the customer would not be.It is like something from a science fiction novel. In fact, it would not be a bad first paragraph in a science fiction novel, because we are not dealing with human beings, the bank manager down the road or any substantial being. We are dealing with an entity that is also a special purpose vehicle. I am unsure whether the Minister has ever read Iain Banks. He is a fantastic Scottish science fiction novelist who used science fiction and space opera to create analogies for the madness of modern capitalism. The big spaceships that dominate the universe in his books are also called SPVs. This is exactly where we are at. SPVs are floating around the global financial markets looking for opportunities to make money. No one knows who is driving these vehicles: they are simply entities. These entities are swooping down on the mortgage books of the poor unsuspecting human being who lives in an estate somewhere in Dublin or Cork and who is simply trying to put a roof over his head with considerable difficulty. He has been battered by the consequences of the financial madness and corporate gambling of the past ten or 20 years. Then, down from outer space comes the SPV, driven by the entity, which is not regulated by anything and which no one knows about or understands but which will soon have control of the person's mortgage. It is totally bizarre. We may ask how we got to here, whether we have learned any lessons about the mess that we are in, the causes of that mess or how we got to this pass. However, we only have to read some of the reportage to know that we have learned absolutely nothing whatsoever and we are about to do it again. The Irish Times from 19 January has a headline: "Record year for investment in Irish commercial property". The article begins:Investment in Irish commercial property reached a record high in 2014, with some €4.5 billion invested. This represents a 25 per cent increase on the previous peak of €3.6 billion reached in 2006.My God, we are now surpassing the level of gambling in the property market in Ireland in 2006, two years before an absolutely catastrophic crash that beggared the nation and for which our children and grandchildren will be paying the cost. It produced unsustainable debt that has been loaded onto their backs as well as the crushing austerity, injustice, unfairness and inequality that goes with it. It could almost be funny if we looked at it as science fiction, but when we get down to the human reality underneath it is not funny at all; it is tragic and terrible. It produces anxiety, worry, terror, uncertainty, homelessness, the loss of homes and evictions.That is how it translates at the level of human reality. The Government will state the Bill attempts to extend a little regulation to the entity and the SPV floating somewhere in the financial markets, the spaceship that is hoovering up mortgage books and loans, and that at least it is trying to extend some regulation to this madness. The problem is that we allowed this to happen in the first place after what happened in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Minister and the Government have facilitated the hand-over of loan books and the mortgages of real human beings to these entities. They have allowed it to happen. Then, after the fact, they say, "Oh my God, we had better do something to regulate it because the Central Bank regulations do not cover it." They are trying to extend the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to these entities and SPVs, or their "credit servicing firms". I am sorry, but I forgot about those because the matter is even more complicated than I explained. The irony is that we cannot regulate the SPVs because they are not banks; therefore, we have to regulate the service companies they employ to manage and administer mortgages. It becomes even more labyrinthine as we go along. We do not know with whom we are dealing. We are not dealing with the SPV or the entity driving it; rather, we are dealing with a shuttle that has been sent from the main spaceship to planet Earth to pick up the mortgages and loans. It is totally bizarre and mad. The Government has facilitated this by allowing the sale of loan books when, of course, many of the mortgage holders asked whether they could buy back their own mortgages. No, we could not have that. We could not have something simple such as people being able to buy their own mortgages in order that there would be some relationship with real human beings and the things they need, namely, a secure roof over their heads and some knowledge of who owned the loan, but no, that would be far too simple. Instead, we must sell to the subcontractor of the entity in the spaceship. Why? There is logic behind it from the Government's point of view, namely, selling off all of these things as quick as it can to get some cash back in order that it will be able to say it has recovered some of the cost of the shocking, outrageous and unfair bailout of the banks and other financial institutions and in order that it can put out a statement, like many it has put out before, stating, "We have covered the cost of the bank bailout. NAMA is going to pay for itself. It is all fine - really. We have done a wonderful job". The truth is, however, that the country is being sold from under our feet. The mortgage books and property assets are being sold to the spaceships, the SPVs, the vulture funds, to the alien entities that do not give a damn about human beings here, the economy or whether people have a roof over their heads and who are just in it for money. It is amazing. As a socialist, I am actually becoming nostalgic for the old-fashioned bank because we now have these entities that are not even the old-fashioned banks to which one could go. I have been banking with Ulster Bank for years. I am a socialist and want to nationalise all of the banks, but now I have real nostalgia for the old days when one could go to the Ulster Bank brank in Blackrock and actually talk to a human being and there was some accountability, which we do not now have. We are going to talk to the subcontractor of the vulture fund in the special purpose vehicle. One will call the bank in Blackrock and get through to a call centre in Scotland which will reroute it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Scotland. It will then be rerouted back to Blackrock which will send a text message.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is beyond belief. This Bill is going to make no difference; it is absolute decoration. As an aside, according to the schedule, I was due to speak at 3.30 p.m. on the personal insolvency legislation, but Government speakers did not turn up. It comes back at a micro level to what is happening in Greece. The debate about Syriza and the Government is about why these big financial entities - the bondholders, the SPVs, their subcontractors or whatever one wants to call them, or the creditors - will call the shots on people's personal indebtedness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what our office told us. I have a schedule which I can show the Acting Chairman and which indicates that I was down to speak at 3.30 p.m. About six or seven speakers did not turn up. I was told that they were on the Government side, which was very unfortunate since we were dealing with the very important issue of personal insolvency. On this issue the same central points can be made. The Government has continued in the same way in terms of personal indebtedness, how the banks operate and now in the case of these entities, how, in the last analysis, these guys will call the shots. They will decide whether they are going to turf someone out. That is the bottom line and the Government has allowed this to happen and believes it is just inevitable. When is it going to get what is starting to happen in the rest of Europe? The pendulum is swinging against this approach to the problem. It is not because of a charismatic individual by the name of Alex Tsipras in Greece; rather, it is because the people of Greece have had enough. There were 26 general strikes and eventually, after everybody else had let them down, they found an organisation that stated it would stick with them on the madness being inflicted on them. Now it is spreading to Spain and there are even echoes of it in this country in the water movement, which is not just a campaign about water, as the Taoiseach rightly spotted, but about everything. It is about the housing crisis, being battered, having no money, the threat of eviction from one's home, the diktat of the bondholders, the SPVs and the entities in the financial markets. It is a case of saying, "Sorry, could you remember the human beings? Could you remember us and the simple things we need - a secure roof over our heads, a decent wage packet at the end of the week so that we are not the working poor and that, when we go to the hospital, we will not be on a trolley for a week, or on a waiting list for an operation for two years?"
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would not have to worry about such things as the sale of people's mortgages and other loans to entities and special purpose vehicles, otherwise known as vulture funds, if we were not flogging the family silver and, literally, selling off the city. We are flogging the country. Billions of euro worth of loans and property is being flogged to the very same people who helped to pump up the property market in the first place. It is beyond belief. The levels of gambling have now surpassed those in 2006. At what point will we say we have to stop the madness?It must stop because all over Europe, including in this country, people are demanding that we stop it. This is another accident waiting to happen. In terms of the Bill, the effects of all of this are felt by the poor unfortunate individuals who do not know who owns the loan on their mortgage or who they are dealing with. In any event, current borrowers are the beneficiaries of a code of conduct on mortgage arrears that does not make a blind bit of difference to those to whom it applies because the creditors have a veto. They will ultimately decide whether to do a deal with the borrower. If it does not suit them or they cannot make money out of a deal, it will be tough luck for the borrower who will be evicted. Who picks up the bill in such circumstances? The answer can be found in the spiralling numbers of people on the waiting lists for social housing. Flogging off loan books and assets held by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is a false economy. It may allow the Minister to announce that NAMA will make a profit or that the banks have repaid the moneys provided by the State. However, the number of families on the social housing list has increased by 10,000 and many of them are threatened with homelessness. The price will have to be paid through the rent allowance system or the new leasing arrangement known as the housing assistance payment. Who will get the €750 million that taxpayers will be required to fork out in housing assistance payments? It will be paid to special purpose vehicles, which is beyond madness as I believe the Minister, in his heart of hearts, knows. Europe is waking up as the winds of change sweep across the Continent. What was the famous line from the Bob Dylan song?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a line from the song "The Times They Are a Changin'" to the effect that those on the old road should get off the new one if they cannot lend a hand. People have to change because the current approach has not worked. This legislation is not even a sticking plaster. It is purely decorative and meaningless and covers up the continuing insane gambling in the financial markets. The property market has been cut loose from reality and any type of consideration for the human beings who are affected by movements of money and financial and profit considerations. In addition to Iain Banks, it is worth reading the third voyage of Gulliver in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels as it describes a similar phenomenon. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are entities floating above the country which are controlled by crazy people who are making decisions that affect the human beings down below.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surprise, surprise - he is nodding at his colleague.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish Government is the scab of Europe right now. The people of Greece have risen up, finally, and said they have had enough of the madness; that they cannot take any more; that they will not allow suicide rates to go through the roof or child poverty to reach obscene proportions; that they will not allow their public services and State assets to be butchered to pieces or allow prostitution to get out of control; and that they will not allow people to starve because of the insistence of European bankers and financial institutions and their political lackeys that the interests of Europe's financial elite be protected. While I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for tabling this motion the people to whom we owe real gratitude are the Greek people, the Spanish people who will rise up after the upcoming elections there and the people of this country who have risen up in the past couple of months against not only water charges but about the failed and bankrupt policy of austerity. The people have had it with austerity. During the press conference on this issue yesterday, Brian Lucey, not a man associated with the radical left, reminded us of a point the Government should consider. He said we need to remember that we are talking about a political economy and not economics as if it is some dry science in respect of which there is a right and wrong answer. One does not even have to quote Marx on this. Adam Smith and David Ricardo understood that economics was about political choices and not only about obeying the rules set down by the troika or the financial elites. The following is an interesting quote from the The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith:People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.I refer Deputies to The Bankers and The Rise of the European Corporate Elite. We have been told there was no choice. This Government has recycled the nonsense for the past seven years that there was no choice when in fact there was a choice. There was a choice between the millionaires and the millions who have suffered as a result of the choice of this Government to protect the millionaires, the bond holders and the bankers. Finally, people in Europe are rising up. They are sweeping aside a rotten political establishment that has stood by and facilitated this looting of the European economy and the savage injustice that has been inflicted on ordinary people. The Irish Government treacherously scabs on this movement. It stabs in the back not only the citizens of Greece but the citizens of Spain, of this country and all people across Europe. Deprivation is widespread across Europe. The level of deprivation now stands at 16%.  One of the Labour Deputies referred earlier to there being soup kitchens in Greece and said that Ireland is totally different from Greece. There are two soup kitchens in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many soup kitchens all over this country, yet we are trying to pretend we are different. On what planet is this Government living? It is time to stand in solidarity with the people of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Britain, where child poverty is going through the roof, and with German workers. This is not about us versus Germany. This is about us against the financial elites and their political lackeys like Angela Merkel. Frankly, this Government has been part of the axis that has stood with the millionaires against the millions. It is about time it listened to the voice of the millions and put their concerns and needs first instead of the people who bankrupted Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is all talk to us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
