RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As ever, when we discuss the banks at this committee and learn more about their activities, we become more shocked by their behaviour. My first question is for Mr. Sheridan. We seem to be hearing that the wider economy, particularly SMEs and ordinary citizens, is being screwed yet again by the same banks that screwed the public finances because of their requirement for a bailout. They are screwing mortgage holders with threats of repossession and are refusing to give them write-downs on unsustainable loans. They are screwing the SME sector by not lending to it and are also screwing that sector and citizens by imposing more charges, essentially to recover their losses. Mr. Sheridan seems to be saying there is nothing the Central Bank can do about it because the banks pretty much have a free hand to do what they are doing because of legislation passed in 1996. Is it the case that there is nothing the Central Bank can do to prevent the banks from increasing charges significantly up to the allowed ceilings in a range of areas because of what was done in 1996?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Mr. Fielding respond to that point? The testimony we have heard from Mr. Fielding is that this is not a small matter or a matter that is being exaggerated. There have been increases of between 29% and 250% in foreign exchange charges. Nobody could describe that as small. There has been an increase of 23% in electronic funds transfer charges. It was suggested that transaction charges are going up from 6.5% to 8%. At a time when particularly small and medium enterprises and ordinary citizens can least afford to absorb increases, we are looking at what are pretty dramatic increases by any standards. Mr. Sheridan is effectively telling us that his hands are effectively tied because of legislation introduced in 1996. Does he not consider that a very serious matter for the economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We know from various studies that 1.6 million people have less than €50-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not coming through on mine. In a situation where 1.6 million people have less than €50 left per month after they have paid for essentials, €100 or €200 per year or an increase of around that level of charges is very significant. It is the difference between people being able to manage and not being able to do so. We are not exaggerating in expressing concern about it. This is the time when people can least afford it. The same is true when small and medium enterprises are literally hanging on for dear life in many cases. Deputy Spring referred to the anomaly whereby transaction charges via ATM, which one would expect to be considerably lower than over-the-counter charges, are not lower because, yet again, the banks are profiteering. They are not passing on the reduction in costs from which they gain an advantage by cutting staff numbers and closing branches, thereby reducing the quality of service to customers. They are not passing that advantage on in terms of lower charges for the use of ATMs. Does Mr. Sheridan agree that this seems to be the obvious explanation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Mr. Fielding respond on that point? There seems to be a suggestion that we are possibly exaggerating the potential impact of this on small and medium enterprises. How serious a problem is increased bank charges for small and medium enterprises among the many problems they face, be they lack of lending from banks, contracted demand and all the other things impacting on this sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was a time when, as Deputy Stanley mentioned, employees were paid in cash. There was quite a bit of discontent when many employers, particularly the State, moved to paying people through their banks precisely because people guessed that the banks would take advantage of that and use it as an opportunity to gouge people with charges. Does Mr. Fielding think paying people in cash or at least giving them that option rather than having to go through the banks might be something to consider?
