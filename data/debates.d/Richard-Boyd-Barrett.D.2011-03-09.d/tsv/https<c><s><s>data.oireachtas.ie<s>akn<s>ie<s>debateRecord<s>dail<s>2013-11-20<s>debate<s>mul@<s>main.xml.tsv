RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has been celebrating his plan to exit the troika programme. Some of us believe this is a complete mirage, particularly in the light of the various budgetary surveillance and monitoring and post-programme monitoring rules that will be applied by the European Union and the troika. Furthermore, we will also be obliged to meet requirements to reduce our deficit and pay down huge debts that are not ours. We must do this over a specified period and in line with the fiscal treaty, for which the Government encouraged the people to vote. Will the Minister spell out what precisely our obligations will be under the EU rules for reducing both our debt and the deficit, particularly in the context of the fiscal treaty? Will he also indicate what the position will be on the issue of budgetary surveillance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The sheer length of the Minister's reply and the level of detail provided tell a story. On leaving the programme, Ireland will be subject to just as rigorous a regime of budgetary surveillance, monitoring and debt and deficit reduction as it endured under the programme. Behind all the jargon, technocratic language and interesting names for the various programmes lies the fact that we will have to pay off €100 billion of debt at a rate of 5% per annum after we exit the programme. The Minister should spell that out in clear language. He indicated there will be a lead-in time of three years. However, during that lead-in period, we must move towards a position of paying off one twentieth of €100 billion or €5 billion per annum. The growth the Minister had hoped would rescue us from this scenario has not materialised as all the Department's forecasts have been wrong. Does this not mean that we are faced with a decade of further austerity, even after our so-called exit from the programme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that the information is not new but the issue is not being clarified for citizens. As the Minister correctly stated, if growth does not materialise, Ireland will be in deep trouble because, unlike every other country in Europe, we have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120% and a debt-to-GNP ratio of 150%. The requirement to pay down €200 billion in debt that is not ours will be a noose around our necks. If the growth projections do not materialise - and there is little sign of them materialising - we are banjaxed. The reality of this needs to be spelled out to people and radical measures taken to address the failure of Government policies to generate economic growth because austerity is killing growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's officials pointed to this anomaly at a pre-budget briefing. We do not have growth, but the Minister is claiming an improved position in employment and unemployment. The ABC of economics says if we have more people working, it is contributing to GDP. How can the Minister claim there is an improvement in the employment position when we do not have the growth to match it? The explanation is not what the Minister has just told us about pharmaceuticals; it has more to do with the fact that many of the jobs it is claimed are being created are not real jobs. People are being counted as employed if they are not on the live register but on schemes and through the various ways the Minister has created to massage the employment figures. They are not real jobs; they are not properly paid and contribute nothing to GDP. That explains the anomaly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, can we put down amendments to this motion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is quite extraordinary. We got this motion yesterday at 4.50 p.m. and amendments were to be in by 9.30 a.m. this morning. That was before we got to hear what the Minister had to say about the bailout exit. How are we supposed to make an informed response to this motion without actually hearing what the Minister has to say? That is ridiculous. This is a bogus debate. It is an utter charade, a political trick played by a Government that specialises in pulling the wool over the eyes of the people. We are faced with a false choice which I, and others on this side of the House, reject utterly. We are being asked to make the choice of whether to stay in the frying pan of the troika’s austerity programme or jump into the fire of the international markets to become prey to the vultures, speculators and the bondholders who caused this mess in the first place. To suggest these options are valid and that opting for the latter is a victory for the country is wrong. To put it in simpler terms, the choice is either to borrow tens of billions of euro from the troika to pay off odious debts that belong to the banks but which the Minister will inflict on the backs of our citizens or to borrow tens of billions of euro to pay off odious debts from the very same bankers and bondholders whose debts they are. What a choice. The issue is why we are paying off debts that are not ours. Why is it that next year we will pay €9 billion, the equivalent of the education budget, on interest on debts that are not ours? No matter which choice we make, we will be dictated to by the lenders. It is only because the Minister has agreed to take on these debts that these guys control us. They can dictate to us through the blackmail and bullying of the international markets which we have been subject to either in or out of the programme. If we choose not to go down that route, we will be subject to the surveillance, monitoring and diktat of the ECB, the IMF and troika which, in any event, dances to the tune of the international markets. This is a complete joke. Meanwhile, our country is being beggared. This is the real meaning of the motion as the Minister well knows.The real purpose of this motion is to try to deflect attention away from the vicious, cruel, heartless cuts that are being imposed on some of the most vulnerable people in our society, such as taking medical cards from people who are sick or old and taking social welfare payments from young people who are unemployed through no fault of their own. It is all very amusing in the cynical world that is Dáil Éireann, where everything is a game and a charade, played out for the cameras and the soundbites, presumably to give the Minister some satisfaction and a few laughs as he puts Fianna Fáil into a difficult position because of that party's view on precautionary credit lines, which is an equally opportunistic position and utterly bogus. They talk about it as though there were only two options: either to have conditions rammed down our throat or to become subject to the international markets. The Minister is trying to lure the public and the media into an utterly false debate, played out purely for the cameras. We reject that utterly. When is the Government going to stand up to these vultures, whether they are the troika representatives of the financial markets or the financial markets themselves, and tell them that our society cannot take this any more and that we cannot afford to pay them €9.1 billion next year? Now that we are close to reaching a primary budget balance, we have the leverage to tell them that. The Minister no longer has the excuse that we have a massive deficit and that we are spending more than we are taking in. We can tell them to get lost, that we are not paying that money back, and see what they have to say to that. Instead, we are just getting down on our knees to be screwed one way or the other.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Children should not have to go through that when they are sick.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should not have to ask.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had a sick man from Castlebar talking to me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is still going on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What has that got to do with disadvantaged areas?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should come off it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is reading from the wrong script.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, at 4.59 p.m., we received notification of the Government's motion on exiting the EU bailout programme, on which the House will vote later today. No mention was made of a deadline for amendments either when we received the motion or subsequently. When I asked this morning whether we could table an amendment to the Government's motion, I was told the deadline had passed. How can one amend a motion when one is not given a deadline by which to submit amendments? It is preposterous also that we be given a deadline for a motion before we have a chance to hear what the Government has to say on it. We should, at a minimum, be told of any deadline to submit amendments. I request, therefore, that we be given the option to submit amendments to the Government's motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are the requirements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes and I was told the deadline had passed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was buried at a committee meeting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, this is a serious issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I inquired this morning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, unfortunately; I do other things and cannot continually check my e-mail. The Taoiseach is engaging in further political games.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on, a Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, a Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government often does precisely that during Private Members' business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Dáil will vote on the motion today and we were not informed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to amend it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was no deadline.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excuse me, a Cheann Comhairle, there was no deadline. Will you tell me what the deadline was?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the deadline?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want an answer to my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle cannot tell me when the deadline was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whom is it up to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want an answer to the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. I want it now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a serious abuse of the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to know when the deadline was. This is a vote on an important issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will somebody answer my question? Can I have an answer to the question from someone? When was the deadline?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is that written down?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it in the Standing Orders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it in the Standing Orders? Would the Ceann Comhairle tell me where in Standing Orders it is?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the Government playing more tricks and abusing the democratic process yet again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, the motion that was submitted by the Government was a motion tabled at short notice. The Standing Order dealing with motions requires that they be submitted four days before they are taken in this House. The Government's motion was tabled three minutes before 5 p.m. yesterday. Discretion was allowed to the Government to include the short-notice motion but discretion has not been given to the Opposition to amend it. I tabled an amendment to the Government's motion at 2.15 p.m. today but it has been rejected. Therefore, we cannot vote on it and we are being forced into either endorsing the Government's policy or opposing an exit from the programme. We reject that choice. Some of us will have to abstain from what is a charade.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No explanation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The story of young people in this country and their abuse by this Government, and the last one for that matter, is the flip side of the coin of the mirage the Government has tried to conjure up about the so-called exit from the so-called bailout. We are not exiting anything and we were never bailed out in the first place. The human reality of that is vicious, vindictive attacks on the least well off in our society, the old, the sick and, of course, the young, as this motion highlights. It is sickening that this Government compounds the insult to young people. It is unable to provide meaningful, well-paid employment for energetic, educated young people who desperately want to work and contribute to our society. All this Government can do is kick them when they are down by cutting their social welfare in order to try to dragoon them into scam jobs in which they can be exploited by unscrupulous employers - or, with the Government's new Gateway project, by local authorities. The aim is to create a pool of cheap labour that can be exploited. Thus, the people who are the victims of this crisis become double victims, denied meaningful employment and then brutally exploited because of the conditions that the Government, the financial elites, the bankers and bondholders have created for them. What puts the lie to the Government's claim that these measures are to activate young people, who apparently have no desire, according to the Government, to find meaningful work, is the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people are streaming out of the country. If they need to be activated, how come they are showing the energy to leave the country? Is it because they want to laze about and do nothing?No, it is because they want work elsewhere that the Government is unable to provide for them here. It sees young people as another group on which to unload the cost of the recession and it is using the atmosphere of recession to exploit young workers and to ratchet down pay and conditions for them. It is an absolute disgrace and I hope that simmering agitation among young people through the We're Not Leaving campaign and the youth assembly will make the Government rue the day it picked on Ireland's young people.
