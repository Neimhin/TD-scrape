RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to add my voice of support for Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment on the issue of vacant tax. The urgency of a vacant unit or vacant home tax simply cannot be overstated. Let me put a human face on this matter because often, when we debate financial matters, one only hears dry figures, statistics and so on. I have a long litany of cases that people in dire circumstances bring to my office every single week. This week, a young woman in her early 20s came to my office. She has been homeless with her young child for two and half years. Her child is now five and half years old. They have been housed in eight different emergency accommodations, including the Clondalkin Sonas homeless accommodation where there was a fire. As the Minister will know, one mother and three babies were killed due to the fire. The young woman who came to my office had been in that hostel and she was very close friends with the woman who died. She is completely traumatised, as is her son. She is still in emergency accommodation. Her son is now in his third school in two and half years. They are utterly traumatised and they have no idea when they will be housed. The signs are, given the state of the list operated by the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, that it could be years. The woman broke down several times in my office. She is completely unable to cope. She blames herself, she thinks she is a terrible mother for putting her child in this situation and pleaded for a secure roof over their heads.  Side by side with that, close to the emergency accommodation that she is in now, and I highlighted this case before but I suspect that it is the tip of the iceberg, I highlighted recently a block of apartments in Sandyford. I refer to the Robin Hill apartments in Balally. The apartments have been owned by NAMA since it was set up. NAMA has sat on between 15 to 20 empty units since it took them over the loan of the developer. Recently, NAMA sold the properties to a vulture fund that tried to evict the rest of the tenants. All the while, between 15 and 20 apartments have been left empty while people like the young woman and her child I referred to and so many others go through a housing trauma. Could there be anything more urgent than putting human beings, like that young mother and her child, into those empty apartments? For ordinary people, it is as simple as that. It is obscene that NAMA sat on those empty apartments. It is worth saying that the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approached NAMA and asked for the apartments but NAMA said no. The apartments are still empty while there are people like the young woman I mentioned going through hell. It seems to me that we should set aside the very interesting debates on whether there are 180,000 empty units, as the CSO suggests, or a percentage of that figure. I do not know whether the percentage is 10%, 20% or 30%. We have to find out the correct figure, as a matter of urgency. There are no debates about probate or anything like that but there may be a debate about what conditionality should have been put on the off-loading of NAMA assets or whether NAMA assets should ever have been off-loaded in the teeth of a housing crisis like this one. Either way it is simply unconscionable that there are perfectly habitable empty units that people like the young woman and her child that I mentioned could live in. Instead, she is breaking down as a human being. The damage that has been done to her child is impossible to fathom or calculate. Deputy Pearse Doherty has tried to inject urgency into this question, which I echo. I wish to add that it is just not good enough if the Government does not move, as a matter of absolute urgency, to ensure that not a single unit that could be inhabited by people who are at the sharp end of this appalling housing emergency has an obstacle to its usage. I urge that any obstacles to getting people housed in these empty units are removed, as a matter of urgency. Whatever measures that have to be taken and whatever taxes or penalties that have to be imposed in order to get those properties for the people who need them must be taken, and they must be taken now, because we have talked about this matter for years. The amendment is a very modest effort. It must operate within the constraints of the Finance Bill and what we are allowed to propose. We cannot propose things that result in a charge on the Exchequer. The amendment seeks to compel the Government to do something about the obscenity of empty units sitting side by side with human misery and human tragedy. I appeal to the Minister to take the amendment on board and do something about this matter. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I think they are the subject of a Residential Tenancies Board dispute, which is the last thing I heard about them, because the vulture fund tried to evict the rest of the tenants. That suggests the fund probably has not rented out the apartments that were vacant for the last period.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were between 15 to 20 units over the three or four years, according to the residents in the Robin Hill apartments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I add my support to this amendment. The Minister said in his initial contribution that the judgment on the help-to-buy scheme would be the extent to which it did or did not contribute to a rise in house prices. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, brought out a report today which stated house prices have gone up by 12.8% in the past year. In Dublin, in the past three months, the average house price has gone up by €17,000. Clearly, any value that the Minister might even ascribe to this measure from the point of view of the home buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular rises in house prices. The only beneficiaries of this scheme are developers and builders. In the early phases of the debate about the housing crisis, the cry of developers as to why they could not deliver the supply everybody said we needed was because it was not profitable for them. There was no doubt they wanted a dramatic rise in house prices and the Government obliged. The Government is contributing enormous sums of money through this scheme as well as through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to subsidise those who are hoarding land, manipulating prices and lobbying the Government to boost their bottom line and ensure they can make a lot of money out of the housing crisis. The Government is being dragged by the nose by these people. There is an opportunity cost to this. Every cent the Government gives to them is money that does not go into building public housing. It is not just a debate about whether it is effective, although clearly in its own terms it is contributing to or failing to stop the spectacular rise in house prices. The other side of the coin is it is money that could be going into public housing. However, the Government continues, or in the case of HBFI and LIHAF, expands corporate welfare to the very people, the builders and developers, who landed us in this mess in the first place and who, even in the teeth of this extraordinary crisis, are still manipulating it to their own advantage. It is extraordinary. I heard an interesting contribution at the Right2Change conference last weekend from the head of the plasterers' union about the cost of housing. Much of what we hear about the cost of building housing is actually the propaganda coming from the builders and developers. He helpfully pointed out that when one breaks down the cost of building a house, it is between soft costs and hard costs. The hard cost of building a house comes in under €200,000. To physically build a house one needs bricklayers, labourers, electricians, carpenters and the other associated trades. The other costs are the profit-taking of the developers, the estate agents, the architects, the surveyors and so on. As he simply pointed out, those costs would not exist if the local authorities were building houses because they already employ all of these people. Half of the cost of building a house goes to people in the private sector, whereas if they were built by local authorities we would only have the hard costs with most of the soft costs covered by existing local authority architects, surveyors and so forth. Accordingly, much of the profit-taking would not be necessary at all. That is the opportunity cost of the Government's approach and its ideologically dogmatic approach of believing the market will solve it when clearly the market is the problem. Worse, the market is manipulating the situation, and yet the Government continues to feed the monster. It is inexplicable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Setting aside any questioning of the Minister's motives or agendas around builders, and I do not believe that he is in any way acting as a representative of those sectors, the measure is not working on its own terms. That is the point. Alternatively, the money could be put where it could contribute to resolving a disastrous situation. This is the essence. Any benefit to the buyer is being wiped out by the spectacular growth in property prices. The beneficiary of those increases in prices are builders and developers. There is absolutely no question that they are the beneficiaries and are making money out of this. As prices go up, arguably an incentive such as this or assistance for the home buyer is also encouraging them to get into an unsustainable market. Let us remember what happened the last time. People are being encouraged to buy houses at unsustainable prices where mortgages are gargantuan and the burden they will carry will be disastrous if further done the line we have another crash. From any point of view, it seems that this is not working. Contrast this with where the funding could be diverted. This situation is not just about this particular incentive. The package of this scheme, involving the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, home building finance Ireland, HBFI, leasing, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, are all reliant on the private sector and the market to deliver. I have just done a quick tot and of the €1.83 billion in the budget, about €1 billion is going to the market in various ways to try to get the market to solve the problem. This is a disastrous strategy. The Minister said that in putting an alternative, our proposal is that only the State should build public housing. Deputy Burton implied that some of us are arguing for that, but that is not what we are arguing. We do, however, argue that there needs to be seismic shift back in that direction. The story of the past 25 or 30 years was that the proportion of housing built by the State has dropped to negligible levels. If, as Deputy Burton has rightly said, some 30% of people cannot purchase housing at market prices through their own resources, what does this mean? It means the State should provide 30% of the housing. There is no plan for that in what the Minister is doing but it is what we should be aiming at. This is what the State used to do back in the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s. The State built that proportion of the housing stock. The vast majority of the moneys being allocated by the Minister to resolve the problem in one scheme or another are going to the market to try to encourage and incentivise it. I accept that the Government in Rebuilding Ireland has somewhat and in a small way shifted, although mostly at the level of rhetoric, to saying that Ireland needs public housing. Rebuilding Ireland is still relying overwhelmingly on the market and I do not believe it can deliver. In so far as it may increase supply, it is going to do so at unaffordable prices. We need a dramatic shift in where the State puts its resources. Let the market look after the market. People who want to purchase their own homes, and I accept that it is the majority, are not able to purchase now because the prices in the market have gone out of control. They would also benefit. I underline this point, particularly given the offensive rhetoric from the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar - not from the Minister for Finance in fairness - about "free housing". The implication was that social housing is free. Social housing is not free. People pay rent according to their income. The point is that a person can get a house and pay according to his or her ability. The Taoiseach's comments about "free housing" suggest that those people who want council housing or who advocate for social housing are advocating free housing, as against people who pay for their housing. That is absolutely offensive. It indicates a certain mindset, which needs to shift. I do not believe that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe shares that mindset, but I believe that he shares the ideological blinkers that have been put on governments because of the shift towards neoliberal thinking that has dominated for the past 25 to 30 years. I urge the Minister for Finance to take off those blinkers and recognise that the only way Ireland can provide affordable housing is to get back up to 30% of housing being built directly by the State. This would also stabilise, or bring down, house prices in the private market. If the Government wants to bring prices down for the ordinary home buyer, it should build more council houses. That is how it could stabilise the market. When we give more and more incentives to developers to solve the problem, they will just use them, manipulate them and profiteer from them. They will land hoard and release supply only when it suits them and they can make money. They will stop the supply when they think it does not suit and when they cannot make enough money. This is our point. The signs are on it when we consider the experience of the past ten years, or even what has happened in the past year or two. This is what is happening. The Minister should consider taking on board the points we are making.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to add my voice of opposition to what the Government is doing. The Minister of State has rightly taken us back to when the market was bottomed out in 2013. However, the strategy that the Government adopted at that point has turned out to be a disastrous folly. The theory was that by giving vast tax breaks to these investors, we would do something positive for the market. What we actually did was hand over vast wealth to these vulture funds. It was obviously a concerted strategy. In fact, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was straight-up about it. We now know he was busy meeting representatives from all these funds and actively encouraging them to come in. No doubt, he was telling them they would get favourable tax treatment and that they would walk away paying no tax on the capital gains, which, we now know, are absolutely astronomical. Even then, it would not have taken a rocket scientist to know that when the market was bottomed out these people were going to gain in a major way. There was only one way the market was going to go at that stage, namely, up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The market had collapsed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The market had collapsed. Some of us at the time were saying that NAMA should have behaved differently. This might indeed explain the mystery of a case I brought up with the Minister for Finance earlier. It related to apartments in Sandyford. In that case, NAMA was sitting on empty properties and then sold them to a vulture fund. The vulture fund then sat on the empty properties while there were homeless people all around. It is a mystery. Why was this happening? Perhaps it was for precisely this reason: the decision was to simply sit on the property and let the value go up. Then, the owners would walk away with a vast capital gain and pay no tax on it. The Government is not moving immediately to close that down and is allowing it to play out. I suspect that is because the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, said it was guaranteed and that the Government would not do anything. It is a little like what I suspect also happened with Apple – we will move on to that discussion later. In those critical years of 2013 and 2014, a great deal of running around was done by the then Minister. He was talking to big corporations and property investors and telling them that the Government would look after them on the tax front. These funds moved in and the consequences have been disastrous. The Government has somewhat belatedly acknowledged this by making some moves to close down the loophole. However, it seems to be extending it for one year because of some sort of principle of honour or because we have to honour the deal with these vulture funds. The Government should forget it. We should close it down now, recognise that we made a big mistake and recover whatever ground and revenues we can. We should close down the incentive for these people to continue immorally and obscenely hoarding land and property when thousands of our citizens need places to live.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And the quantum of assets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An additional €3 billion to €4 billion in assets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some members said very clearly at the time it was a mistake for NAMA to unload all these property assets and that it should instead have given them to local authorities. It was likely that vulture funds would buy at bargain basement prices. There was considerable debate about whether NAMA was engaged in a fire sale. It is not true to say this was not the subject of hotly-disputed debate at the time. Those who opposed the strategy the Government followed in respect of NAMA have been vindicated by what has happened.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were not taking a risk when they were being told they would not pay any tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should get the maximum allowed amount of information, as the Chairman has indicated. The Minister of State has mentioned he thinks four or five funds will benefit from the CGT exemption. We should get as accurate information as possible on how many of those entities will benefit from the extension and factual detail on the quantum of assets in question, which the Minister of State has estimated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to add a further point to those that have already been made. The current approach offers an incentive to evict people. These capital gains tax breaks incentivise funds to evict people and they are acting on those incentives. When they evict people, the value of the property increases. This is what the funds are doing. I am dealing with a property in my area that has been bought by one of these funds - I am not sure of the exact year, but I am almost certain it would have been in the period in question - which is evicting people in order to drive up the value of the property. To my mind, that is another outrageous consequence of these tax breaks. We are incentivising these funds to increase their capital gains before walking away tax-free. I have another question that I would like the Minister of State to answer, although I suspect that he cannot or will not do so. Do we have figures for the tax that would be gained or forgone, depending on whether we extend this relief? I see somebody shaking their head, so I suspect the answer is "No", which is fairly shocking in and of itself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the various allowances, credits, exemptions and reliefs that we will be discussing later. We have figures for them, so we know what are the tax expenditures. We know how much tax is forgone in those categories. As far as I know, although I would be happy to be enlightened, we do not know how much tax is going to be forgone as a result of this extension. Do we have estimates? We have just estimated how many firms or funds will benefit from it and what the quantum of assets will be. Do we have estimates for how much tax will be forgone if we extend this or if we do not do so? Do we have figures not just for the beneficiaries of this capital gains tax extension but also for the overall amount of tax forgone as a result of the extension?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are there any estimates?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An estimate would be better than nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we are trying to get to the truth of these tax breaks which are given to corporations or property interests, it is always revealing to look at how they are touted by the consultancy and accountancy firms which do the work of getting these people in.Their comments are very revealing. Our friends in PwC, in their document Irish Real Estate Investment Structures, say:[There has been a] remarkable resurgence of interest in ... Irish real estate ... spearheaded by overseas investors [not little Irish pensioners trying to save up for their pension pots] and in particular by the hedge funds and private equity groups. Such investors are using the array of available ... structures ranging from QIAIFs to REITs to SPVs to mitigate or eliminate taxes that would otherwise arise on their real estate investments.They go on to refer to REITs: "[N]on-resident investors are not liable to CGT [this is them touting these things again] on the disposal of REIT shares." The document states REITs are "not chargeable to tax in respect of ... property rental business or chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of assets". Regarding section 110 companies, it states, "While such entities are taxable at a rate of 25%, the taxable profits tend to be modest because of the use of tax efficient profit ... mechanisms such as interest ... on profit participating loans." It goes on and on. What PwC is touting is the fact that this is an array of structures which allows the mitigation or complete elimination of the profits extracted from the Irish property sector, much of them courtesy of NAMA, which flogged this property - our property - to these buyers in order for them to extract profit and pay no tax. This is the greatest scandal this State has seen in recent times. As if everything that happened in 2007 and 2008 and the cost that people paid were not bad enough, that then became the prelude to the vast unloading of property assets to foreign investors, hedge funds and so on, which then extract an absolutely enormous profit from this and pay no tax. Now-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	PwC's document is wrong. Is it giving bad advice to the hedge funds?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State can go to PwC's website now. He can get on his phone and look at what PwC is saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to PwC. Of course, the other interesting-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know, and PwC says it can be reduced through various mechanisms. I take its word for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like I said, tell it to PwC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the point about the disposal of REIT shares true, that CGT is not chargeable on the disposal of REIT shares?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If a person invests in REIT shares, the value of the property goes up and the value of the investment, the share in the REIT, goes up, is it the case that if that person then flogs the shares, he or she does not pay any capital gains on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is even better. We should look at that too. It is shocking, when one considers what is happening in the property market and the enormous appreciation of the value of these properties, that such buyers are walking away and paying no tax. The other side of the coin is that I then have to traipse into PwC on behalf of residents or tenants in properties managed by PwC on behalf of these funds and plead with PwC not to evict them. I had to do that a while ago. These stony-faced men in PwC are looking for, in one case, 90% rent increases on an apartment block in Dún Laoghaire - the whole block. They wanted to kick the residents out on behalf of these lovely people. We have this array of tax structures to minimise or mitigate their tax liability and they try to evict people. I am glad to say that because the people resisted, PwC has been forced back so far. There have been two separate attempts by PwC to evict the whole block on behalf of, in this particular case, Apollo Global Management, which presumably benefits from this array of tax structures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just citing an instance-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that I happen to know of. This is the on-the-ground reality of the matter. I am telling the Minister of State what PwC is touting the array of structures to mitigate or eliminate tax on property investment. He can tell PwC to update its website if he likes, but I suspect PwC knows what it is talking about. This is what one gets when one googles "real estate investment trusts". PwC is the very first result, and it is all about mitigating or eliminating tax liabilities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly hope so. It might make it think twice about evicting the people in St. Helen's Court.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So long as it is not Jersey or the Isle of Man.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Deputy can speak to the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are other amendments, which we will deal with shortly, to which the issue is relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everything about the Apple situation, including the changes made in the budget by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in 2014, stinks to high heaven. Frankly, it stretches credibility that this happened at a time when new political forces had come into this Dáil. In 2012 and 2013, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I raised at the then Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform the massive loopholes we could see in the corporate tax regime. We suggested that the effective rate being paid by big corporations like Apple was a tiny fraction of 12.5%. The double Irish arrangement was at the centre of that. There are plenty of other examples of loopholes. We will talk about some of them in a moment. When the spotlight began to come on, the reaction of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and Fianna Fáil was to close ranks immediately in order to protect Apple. In July 2013, when this stuff was starting to be debated, Deputy Pearse Doherty and I proposed that representatives of Apple, Google and Facebook should be brought before the finance committee to face questions about the tax affairs of those companies. The cameras were literally shut off as a result of a manoeuvre from the Chairman of the committee. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, along with Deputy Donnelly and a couple of others, voted to switch off the cameras while we debated whether Apple and the other companies might be brought in. Not only did they not want those companies to come in, they did not even want anyone to know we were discussing whether they should come in. In 2013, the Government closed ranks to protect Apple and ensure it was not questioned about what it was up to. At this time, international and domestic pressure was building with regard to the double Irish arrangement. Right up to the last moment, the Government denied that this country was playing any role in that arrangement. It was finally forced to announce that it would be closed, although it is worth noting that it is still not closed. It is still operable up to 2020 for companies that have benefited from it. Apple, and probably others, had to try to find a new way of evading tax. In January 2014, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, met the CEO of Apple. I would love to know what happened at that meeting. I do not know what happened. The closeness of this Government's relationship with Apple is remarkable. We know from the Paradise Papers, or, as I like to call them, the parasite papers, that in March 2014, lawyers acting on behalf of Apple began to search for new ways to avoid paying tax. According to one of the leaks, Baker McKenzie, which was acting on behalf of Apple, contacted Appleby about its various tax haven locations and asked it to "confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction". That is what Apple wanted to do. It wanted to avoid paying any tax at all and, as we have now discovered, that is what it did. Shortly afterwards, the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, decided to change the allowances regime for intangible assets, such as Apple's intellectual property assets from which it derives its profits and around which much of its tax evasion activity centres. I refer to the manner in which it sells ideas or intellectual property assets from one arm of the company to another, thereby turning profits into costs and consequently writing down its tax liabilities. Oddly and strangely, we made this change at this time. It is quite extraordinary. Frankly, I do not even understand why it should get an 80% allowance, never mind a 100% allowance. Why should it get an 80% allowance on these intangible assets? I would like somebody to explain that to me. When one arm of a company supposedly sells something to another arm of the company, which is a joke in and of itself, the company in question is allowed to claim massive allowances and gain enormous tax benefits that are worth hundreds of millions of euro to the company. We used to give this company an 80% tax break, but in the year in question, that was increased to 100%. Why did that happen? Is it a coincidence that it happened in the same year that Apple had to start thinking about restructuring its tax avoidance strategies? It moved one of its subsidiaries, which was previously based here, to the Channel Islands. I presume that company now sells the asset to the Irish-registered company without having to pay any tax on the profit it gets. It has discovered via Appleby that it pays no tax whatsoever there. The 100% allowance that the Irish subsidiary gets allows it to write down all of its profits which derive from that intellectual property for the next decade or so. It is quite extraordinary. Can the Minister explain how it happened? Why was that decision made in 2014?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not look like that. This is why the EU is very suspicious, yet again. We have already been told we should have collected €13 billion of tax that we did not collect. The Government has still not taken that money and the interest off Apple and put it in an escrow account. As soon as there was movement on that particular tax avoidance strategy, lo and behold, we made changes which ensure Apple does not pay a single cent more than it was paying previously.Not a single cent. it is perfect restructuring, almost to the euro. It involves the Channel Islands and the changes in the intangible asset allowance. It works out so perfectly that companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax. Their spin is that they did not pay any less tax - brilliant. They did not, however, pay any more tax; they paid exactly the same amount of tax. With regard to their tax liability, the net effect of closing down the double Irish is zero as they do not pay any more tax. This company is nakedly avoiding tax. Was the Minister aware of this and will he acknowledge that this is what these companies were and are doing? We might quibble about what the Minister did or did not do, but the reason there had to be movement against the double Irish is that these companies were just nakedly and rampantly seeking to avoid paying tax. What they are doing is immoral; companies are looking around for tax jurisdictions and loopholes in our tax code so they pay no tax. We say it is nothing to do with us, it is inconsistencies between tax codes and there is nothing we can do about it. Yet, Ireland seems to facilitate these companies. First it was with the double Irish and when a light is shone on the double Irish we then, coincidentally, facilitate them in a new way. We may have done it inadvertently. Is that the explanation? Inadvertently, the change that was made in 2014 perfectly succeeds in doing exactly what Apple would want to do, given that there was a problem developing with the double Irish tax avoidance strategy. This is too much of a coincidence. Does the Minister believe that anybody who looks at this would not say it is too much of a coincidence? The net result is that these companies do not pay a single extra cent in tax. How convenient. Does the Minister not believe that the European Union and Commissioner Vestager have some justification for being suspicious of this and that anybody looking on would say "Jesus, that stinks"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Minister says that Ireland's corporate tax revenue has increased he forgets to mention the extraordinary rise in profits during that period. The percentage increase in profits far outstrips any proportionate increase in tax revenue. For example, 2012 pre-tax trading profits were €76 billion. By 2015 these had gone up to €149 billion. As we know, and we can surmise, a vast amount of that is attributable to these companies' enormous and spectacular increase in profits that are beyond belief. A doubling of aggregate corporate tax profits is overwhelmingly attributable to a small number of companies.Just as those profits go through the roof we give them extra tax allowances to ensure that there is not a commensurate increase in the proportion of tax that we will get from them. I accept that there is some increase - how could there not be - when profits increase to that extent. Proportionately, however, the effective rate is going down not up. It is actually going down and it is already pitifully low. In addition, the effective rate as against the total profits is actually falling for these companies because of measures that we are taking or our failures to close down these loopholes. In doing that they are robbing this country of tax revenues that we should be getting. They are also robbing people all around the world. All of the tax and global justice groups say this kind of behaviour that Apple, Facebook and Google are engaging in is the major contributory factor to growing global inequality, poverty and deprivation. These people are robbing us blind in a deliberate, naked and explicit drive to ensure that they pay no taxes whatsoever.  The Minister has not really answered the question as to whether he finds that morally repugnant. Is the Government bothered by that? The signs are, given the behaviour of the Government, that it does not find it repugnant but in fact at best turns a blind eye to it and at worst is actively colluding with it. Deputy Doherty and I have both set out the chain of events where very serious questions are now also being asked by the European Union about what happened and why it happened. We also need to know about the lobbying and the interactions that this Government had with Apple and with any of these other companies. The one aspect on which I will agree with the Minister is that this is not about one company, although there is definitely one favoured company that is leading the charge. It concerns a few companies, a very small number. It is maybe five to ten companies who accrue these massive tax benefits because of the regime that we have and the changes that we made in terms of the window we created for them between 2014 and now. The move to reintroduce the 80% rate is closing the door after the horse has bolted and followed the massive onshoring of these assets. That allows those companies to pay no tax for a decade ahead against these enormous profits. It looks like collusion. Their behaviour is certainly immoral. Does the Minister agree that it is immoral?  If the Minister does agree that it is immoral, why do we not capture the additional tax benefit that these companies have accrued as a result of the change from the 100% to the 80% going back to when that change was made? Why do we not do that if we think it is wrong? I do not see how anybody could say what they are doing is not wrong. Why do we not do it? Is it because we made an agreement with them? Is it that we gave assurances to Apple and a few others at the time that we are going to allow them to do that? Otherwise, I do not see why we would not do it. Many people, and not just the left and Sinn Féin, are saying that the window they were given should be closed and we should recover that 20% difference which resulted from the changes in 2014 and, in the process, get the €800 million or so that would accrue if we did that.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 41:In page 39, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“22. The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the amount of tax revenue foregone as a result of the changes to capital allowances relating to intangible assets made in Budget 2014 and the re-introduction of the 80 per cent cap in such allowances in Budget 2018, the reasons for the Budget 2014 changes and the additional revenue that would be generated by applying the 80 per cent cap for the time prior to 11 October 2017 where the allowance was 100 per cent.”. This amendment deals with a topic that we have already discussed at some length about the changes made to the capital allowances allowed on intangible assets in 2014 and the enormous tax benefits they conferred on a small number of companies, notably Apple among others. We have made the point. To paraphrase the Minister, he said the Government does not gear its tax policy around any particular company. That is probably true because I think it was more around a group of companies. The Minister did refer to sectors of industry. I think it was a group of companies that benefitted from this. We are all familiar with names such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and a few others. I believe that whether it was through direct lobbying or just the servile attitude that successive Governments, not just that of which Deputy Donohoe is a part, but previous Fianna Fáil Governments, have shown towards those companies, they just want to do anything they can to please them and that means tailoring the tax code to suit their purposes. We have had the discussion so there is no point in labouring it. We clearly disagree on this issue. However, I take issue with the argument the Minister made about what would happen were we to go back and close the window that was opened for them in 2014, which the Minister is only closing now after all the intangible assets have been onshored and where they will derive the tax benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years.I take issue with the argument the Minister makes that, were we to go back and close the window that was opened for these companies in 2014, and which he is only closing now after all these intangible assets have already been onshored, and where they will derive the enormous benefit of paying no tax on the income from those assets for up to 15 years, many other people might be affected where there might be a legitimate basis for their expectation to benefit from that change. I do not know how the Minister does not draw a distinction between a company that might actually purchase an intellectual property asset, where it is a genuine cost on the company, and a company that is clearly doing this as an accountancy exercise, where it is not a cost on the company because it is buying the asset from itself and has set up a network of companies purely for the purposes of minimising its tax liability and benefiting from these kinds of allowances. I just do not see how the Minister does not draw the distinction and why the tax code cannot so do. Of course, if there are legitimate costs for a business, it is reasonable that it should get an allowance on those costs against its trading profits to reduce its tax liability. However, this is a case of Apple, Google or Facebook moving around assets between its own subsidiaries in order to manipulate the tax code and reduce its tax liability. Everyone knows that, the Minister knows it, and we have known it since long before 2014 and the onshoring of these assets. All of the tax avoidance that has been engaged in by these companies centred on similar types of manoeuvres around intellectual property and payments of one subsidiary to another, whether from stateless subsidiaries that were incorporated here but not tax-liable here or subsidiaries that are no longer stateless but are located in Jersey, where they do not have to pay tax anyway, so it is the same difference. It is the same type of tax avoidance strategy and it is one company doing it. Therefore, I do not see how they can in any sense be deemed legitimate costs. It is just a way for such companies to reduce their tax liabilities on their absolutely staggering profits, and they are literally writing their own tax bills. They are deciding how much tax they will pay, not the Government, the tax code or the nominal tax rate. None of that actually determines how much tax they pay; they decide how much tax they pay through a manipulative accountancy exercise. I do not see how the Minister deems that to be legitimate and, as I said, why he cannot draw a distinction between companies that clearly are engaged in tax avoidance and companies that might actually have a legitimate claim on an allowance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not very credible because the parent company is deciding how much one subsidiary will charge the other for the use of the intellectual property. It may be the case that the profits then derive, as the Minister says, from that piece of intellectual property, but the parent company is deciding how much one charges the other and is setting the cost at precisely the level that is necessary to ensure that it pays no tax. That is what these companies are doing, and we all know it, so it is a tax avoidance strategy. As the Minister said, our tax code - I cannot remember the exact section - actually refers to not allowing, or prohibiting, things that are very obviously tax avoidance tactics. This, to my mind, is very obviously just that, and everyone knows it is, but we allow it. I do not see how the Minister can stand over it, frankly, but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will bring it back on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 39, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“22. (1) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the potential to raise additional corporation tax revenue by closing down tax loopholes, examining the extended legitimacy and abuse of all corporate tax expenditures, exemptions, allowances and deductions, such as losses forward, R&D tax credits, the Knowledge Development Box, intra-group transactions, allowances on intangible assets and establishing a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5 per cent on gross trading profits and incomes.(2) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a specific report and comparative study on the relative social and economic benefit of research and development tax credit expenditures, benefitting private corporations as against the investment of the equivalent funds into research and development in public universities.”.We dealt with a specific allowance and a particular set of circumstances around the changes made in 2014, but this amendment relates more to the bigger picture of the whole array of allowances, deductions and reliefs available to corporations. It is worth saying the same groups we have just talked about are the major beneficiaries of this: the Apples, Googles and Facebooks and probably the pharmaceutical companies and so on. A relatively small number of companies benefit from this vast array of allowances, deductions and reliefs. What we seek in moving this amendment is a really detailed look at these, with a view to trying to close down all these loopholes that are being exploited to reduce the effective rate being paid by a small number of corporations. I think the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country do pay in or around the 12.5% because they cannot for the most part utilise many of these reliefs. It is the big players, the favoured, pampered few of these extraordinarily profitable corporations, that are the big beneficiaries and have the accountants, the consultants and the lawyers and so on to maximise the benefit they derive from all these reliefs. The scale of the tax benefits they derive is quite extraordinary. We have talked about the intangible assets. Another one I came across looking at Revenue's list of these reliefs and allowances is the one entitled intra-group transactions. I would not mind hearing a little more about this one, which was a relief that cost the Exchequer €2.9 billion in 2015 and €9 billion in 2016. Again, it is one of these reliefs where we see a staggering increase over one year. If the officials want the document to which I have referred it is the second page of a Revenue document titled Cost of Tax Allowances, Credits, Exemptions and Reliefs. It details the various reliefs. Losses, including capital allowances brought forward from earlier years, were mentioned earlier, and account for €2.7 billion; group relief costs, €254 million; research and development tax credit, €700 million; and capital allowances totalling €6 billion. The total of these, when we add them all up and set them against profits, is extraordinary. Mr. Seamus Coffey remarks on this in what is a very good paper. As I have said before, I do not agree with his ultimate conclusions, as I do not think they are radical enough. However, he comments on the enormous increase in these deductions and allowances. He writes that they have increased from €18.9 billion in 2003 to €97 billion in 2015. Those are all tax loopholes that a small number of corporations benefit from. I repeat, the increase is from €18.9 billion to €97 billion, an extraordinary jump by any standards. If the small and medium enterprises are for the most part actually paying the 12.5% rate, this explains how a small number of corporations benefiting from these reliefs have actual effective tax rates of 1%, 2%, or in some cases less than 1%. At the same time, their total aggregate profits, as I mentioned earlier, have gone from €76 billion in 2012 to €149 billion, more than doubling. There is no doubt that this doubling of profits is attributable to the same small group of companies. Yet the tax that we get from it does not double. If gross trading profits double over that period, then one would think our tax revenue would double. Yet that is not the case. The increase is from about €4 billion to about €6 billion. That is a 50% increase in corporate tax revenue, roughly speaking, but there has been more than a 100% increase in profits in that period. How does one explain that? It is explained by the fact that we have had this dramatic increase in allowances, reliefs and deductions.  Do the members not think we should do something about that, and move towards some sort of minimum effective rate so that these players would be forced to pay a fair contribution in tax, rather than doing what we are doing at the moment? If I give the best interpretation of what the Government is doing, it is chasing them around, trying to catch up with them as their lawyers and accountants engineer ever more imaginative and innovative ways to get around and exploit the tax code, to open up loopholes and so on. That is the most benign explanation of what is happening. However, I believe it is worse than that. I think there is collusion. Even if I am wrong, surely the way to deal with it, to stop this behaviour, to stop this exploitation of loopholes and to make these people pay a fair proportion of their enormous profits in tax, is to introduce some sort of minimum effective rate. I would go further. I would do that and raise the nominal rate. I know that would be unthinkable for the Minister but could we not at least introduce a minimum effective rate, so that they actually pay the 12.5%?  These companies would still be making staggering levels of profit. I do not believe they would leave the country if we did that, because even if they actually pay the 12.5% they would still be paying significantly less here than they are in most jurisdictions in Europe, at least in western Europe, which is where they want to be. I am sure they want to be in English-speaking western Europe, so our real competition for a lot of this investment is probably only Britain and Scotland. Would that not be a fair and reasonable thing to do? Would it not be fair and reasonable, as this amendment suggests, to at least look at all of these allowances and deductions, examine how they are being exploited by these corporations, and look at ways of trying to increase the tax take from them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not speak to the second part of my amendment and I want to say one brief word to put it all together before the Minister comes back in. This is specifically on the research and development tax credit. I am asking the Minister to consider whether the amount of money which has been given in a tax allowance for research and development to a very small number of corporations, as has already been said, would be better spent on public universities. The debate is often framed as follows. If one is against research and development credits, one is claimed to be against innovation and research and development. I am very much in favour of research and development but there is an opportunity cost in giving the funding to private companies through tax expenditures because that money is not going to public universities. There would be a lot more benefit and advantage for the domestic economy if that happened. I refer to the real Irish economy as against the economy that exists around a tiny number of multinational corporations, which could be gone at any point and that get far more from us than we get from them. We should look at which approach would provide a greater benefit to the Irish economy and society as a whole. Is it to continue with this very large tax expenditure which benefits private corporations or is it to provide that money for research and development in our public universities? I ask the Minister to address that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not revert to the issue of research in universities and the bang for the buck that we derive from encouraging research and development through these allowances for private companies and, as has been said, the small number of big corporations that benefit from it. It seems to amount to the privatisation of research and development. The funding of our universities was hammered during the period of austerity. They lost approximately 30% of their funding. Would it not be better, rather than have this huge tax expenditure on research and development tax credits, to put more money back into our universities? Should we not at least examine which would be more beneficial to our economy and our society and examine whether this is good tax expenditure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that if I press the amendment and not call for a vote, I can re-enter the amendment on Report Stage.
