RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(3) Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the benefit of abolishing the universal social charge on all income below €90,000 and replacing it with 4 new income tax bands for income earned between, €100,000 and €140,000; €140,000 and €180,000; €180,000 and €250,000; and over €250,000.”.The Comptroller and Auditor General recently produced a report which confirmed something that some of us have been saying for a long time, namely, that the richest people in Ireland do not pay their fair share of taxes. He revealed the quite astonishing fact that 90 high-net worth individuals, defined as people whose average income is in excess of €50 million a year - a tidy sum for those who earn that money - paid less tax than the average worker. He cited loopholes, tax allowances and so on as the mechanisms by means of which some of the richest people pay less tax than the average worker. One can imagine how that would stick in the craw of the average worker. Coming from a source like the Comptroller and Auditor General is a serious fact that is difficult to dispute. It comes on top of the fact that Ireland's income distribution is one of the most unequal in the western world. It changes after social transfers but in the basic distribution of income there is a shocking level of inequality in the distribution of income. We must begin to discuss, therefore, making the very wealthy in our society pay their fair share of tax. In our alternative budget submission we have a whole range of measures in different areas, but this one relates to income tax. The USC has been a punitive austerity tax for low and middle income workers and it cannot continue to be justified. If what we see as punitive taxes on workers are to be removed, which would be justified, the money needs to be found elsewhere. We emphasise that we believe in balanced budgets and one of the measures we propose to provide a balance is to have a whole series of new bands of taxation for people on the highest earnings in excess of €100,000. Our specific proposal is that people who earn between €100,000 and €140,000 would pay a rate of 50%, those who earn between €140,000 and €180,000 would pay a rate of 55%, those who earn between €180,000 and €250,000 would pay 60%, while those who earn in excess of €250,000 would pay 65%, on the earnings over those amounts. I should add that those people would benefit from our proposals to abolish the USC for earnings less than that as well as the abolition of property tax, for example. On the earnings that are in excess of the figures I mentioned, however, they would pay much higher rates of tax. While they might seem radical to the Minister and many in the Dáil, it is worth saying that those levels of taxation on high income were not unusual for much of the post-war period. The most successful period of expansion of western capitalism, for want of a better word, was probably in the post-war period when there were taxes of that sort on wealth. The corollary of having those higher taxes on wealth was the provision of a welfare state. Expansions in public housing, improvements in access to education and the provision of the health service and so on in much of the western world were based on the wealthy paying higher taxes. More money was available for universal access to third-level education, more public transport, more public housing and national health services. We are an outlier in European terms in the way we tax wealth and income. It is not surprising in that context that we have the sort of crises we face in the very areas where a fair tax system would provide the revenue, namely, health, housing, education, infrastructure and so on. All of these things are creaking at the seams, crumbling or in severe crises because, in essence, the rich do not pay their taxes. This amendment seeks to require us at least to have a serious debate about these issues and about what the potential impact would be of moving in this direction. The Minister will say the rich will scream and run out of the country and the economy will go down the tubes if we dare to ask them to pay a little extra tax, but I do not buy that for one minute. We costed this proposal with the Department and, according to the Minister's response to a parliamentary question, these measures would raise €2 billion, which is a tidy sum, to help shift the unequal distribution of wealth in Irish society, which is a fair and reasonable thing to do. It would not impoverish the people who would have to pay these taxes and they would still be well off but it would begin to challenge the significant inequalities in wealth that exist in our society. On that basis, it is a fair and reasonable measure to consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These debates reveal the fairly fundamental differences between the Minister's perspective and the perspective of those of us on the left. As a result, I will not labour the point too much. I do not buy the complexity argument one bit. One could not get anything more complex than some of the stuff that is in this Finance Bill. When one looks at some of the reliefs, formulas and equations that we have for various aspects of our tax code it seems we have a very competent Revenue Commissioners and Department of Finance that can do this. I am absolutely amazed every year just looking at the work that goes into it and the complexity of it and the difficulty of getting one's head around it but it all works as it is supposed to most of the time. Things get tweaked and tightened up and that is part of what we do but the idea that it is just too complicated to tax the wealthy is ridiculous. I do not buy that for one second. The Minister stated that there may be behavioural consequences for people on these very high earnings if one was to levy these kinds of tax rates on them. That is possible, although when one looks at the behaviour of many of these high-net-worth individuals even as it stands, one sees that their loyalty to the country is minimal. In many cases, they are tax refugees based elsewhere. They do not want to pay tax and do not believe in paying tax. I do not think we should pander to these kind of people who have absolutely no care at all about the consequences for Irish society of people as wealthy as them not paying tax. I do not really buy that. It is essentially saying the rich have us over a barrel. If we dare to touch their wealth, they will sabotage the economy. I do not think we should accept that approach. There would be positive behavioural consequences as a result of our proposals were they to be implemented, which is that ordinary working people who tend not to be tax refugees because they live and work here and spend their money here and will not move whatever is done to them, actually contribute. The more income they have, the more it contributes to the domestic economy and the high street in their localities. There might be some behavioural changes on one end of the spectrum but they would be easily outweighed by the positive impact of people having more money in their pockets and actually contributing to the real economy here. I also think it would deal with a lot of the concerns the Minister might have about tax bases and so on because the more ordinary workers have income, the more it generally feeds into the cycle of money going into the economy. It results in more economic activity and that generates revenue at a range of levels for the Exchequer. I do not really accept the Minister's argument but I know he is not likely to be swayed by my opinion on this. Nonetheless, I think it is important to have these debates. One of the unfortunate features of the past 25 or 30 years and what I see as the neoliberal revolution is that certain political and economic debates which used to be had stopped being had. It was assumed that neoliberalism and that particular approach to organising an economy was the only game in town. I remember debating with Senator McDowell's brother, the economist. I forget his first name.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Moore McDowell. He pointed out that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, they stopped doing comparative economics. We do not debate alternatives any more. I think that is wrong. When one looks at the state of the global economy generally and the crises we have had recently, the idea we do not discuss alternatives is wrong and will lead us into trouble. It has led us into trouble. We need to debate these alternatives and that is why I put the amendment forward but I do not expect I will get the support of the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise because I must go. I will be back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a very modest measure. As discussed earlier, we would go a hell of a lot further in trying to use the tax system to generate more equality in the distribution of income in Irish society. The Minister has concerns about this particular amendment and the production of a report. His earlier responses were thoughtful in that he offered to listen to ideas and to provide information to people who are developing alternative policies. He speaks about progressivity and worries about the effective rate going higher, but he has not really acknowledged the point that emerged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggesting that those general statements are not accurate. What the Comptroller and Auditor General has said is deeply troubling. It angers me, and I suspect a number of workers out there, that we actually have a very substantial cohort of very rich people who are not paying high effective income tax rates because of loopholes, allowances, credits, deductions, etc. that they are able to avail of. This measure is only a small measure in that regard, but at least it is moving in the right direction. Does the Minister acknowledge that there is an issue? Was he alarmed by what the Comptroller and Auditor General found? Does he think it behoves the Government to look at it as a matter of urgency to ensure that we do not have a situation where very wealthy people are paying very low levels of tax because they are able to find means through the tax code to substantially reduce the amount of tax they pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we breaking at 1 p.m?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised the point on budget day about this being an incentive to evict people. There is no doubt in my mind that is what it is. I know of several examples in my area where it is being done or has been attempted. Most notable is one example I have raised on a number of occasions in the Dáil which is a property owned by Apollo Global Management, an enormous asset management company that bought an apartment block from NAMA in central Dún Laoghaire for a song. First, it attempted to increase rents by 70%. It sent people the notification that it would increase the rents the day before the 4% rent cap came in and the residents resisted and kicked up a stink. I kicked up a stink in the Dáil and it backed off on that but then it came back saying, it would carry out substantial refurbishments and everybody had to leave because it was doing substantial refurbishment to the apartment block. It was pretty strange because a small number of people in that multi-unit complex had purchased and were not tenants and they had heard nothing about substantial refurbishments. Substantial refurbishments of the sort this company was talking about would have required the entire place to be done but those apartment owners had heard nothing so it was a ruse to get the tenants out in order that the company could jack up the rent because it had been unable to get the rent increased by 60% or 70%. I am glad in that case, because we publicised it in the national media and because the residents fought back, Apollo Global Management backed off, although the insecurity it created for many tenants in the block led some to just give up and get out. It is just one example but people need to know what this stuff means in reality. Approximately ten of the units in that block, which are perfectly good units, are sitting empty because Apollo Global Management wants to see the value of the property clock up, detenant the place, make life difficult for the other tenants until they all leave and at some point flip the property. This is where we are at and where our policy of courting - not just incentivising - these people into the property sector supposedly as a means to professionalise the rental sector has been a total disaster. It has been the biggest mistake ever. Instead of the Government recognising it has been a disaster and that we need a radical shift in policy away from courting, incentivising and pandering to these people to using public moneys to invest directly in providing affordable housing, we continue to do this kind of thing. It is madness. I could not be more strongly opposed to what the Minister is doing here. What is the point? I suppose the Minister will argue we need people to provide rental accommodation. What is the point in rental accommodation that is unaffordable for the majority of people? I refer to what I-RES REIT tried to do close to my area in Sandyford recently. We forced it to back off because we kicked up about it in here and the residents protested and so on when it tried to increase the rent by 30% using another loophole. When I met the residents, the existing rent was €2,200 and the trust wanted to increase it to €2,800. Who can afford that? What is the point in supply at that rent? There is none except to make profit for these guys and to extort people. Ultimately, it is an accident waiting to happen because, at a certain point, even these guys will realise there is no point in them supplying at that cost because nobody will be able to buy or rent it.Why would the Minister incentivise these people in that way? It beggars belief when public money could, and should, be put into directly providing accommodation that is affordable and is not based on profit margins but on making accommodation available that is affordable to people who need it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister has said, we have debated this at length. Sadly, we are going to continue to have to debate it. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government acknowledged recently that the housing crisis has not peaked. While this is a very grim prospect, all of us in here know it is true and everybody else fears it is true. It is difficult to imagine a situation that is worse than the one we have now. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has admitted frankly that the housing crisis is going to get worse. That is a pretty hopeless space for us to be in. It is a national shame that the people at the acute end of this crisis are in homeless accommodation. Children who are being brought up in these circumstances go to school without knowing whether they can face the humiliation of telling their classmates they live in homeless accommodation. They are unable to bring their friends home to play or for sleepovers. Every one of us is dealing with families in these circumstances. I am sure the Minister is dealing with these families as well. It is shameful. It pushes us towards despair when we are in our clinics. Floods of people who are facing these desperate circumstances keep coming to see us in the hope that we can offer them some hope. However, the situation is continuing to get worse. The private rented sector is the issue in almost every case. That is where these people come from. They have found themselves homeless because of the private rented sector. When people who are in this dire situation go to the council, in some cases after two years or more in emergency accommodation, they are told to find a HAP tenancy in the private rented sector. Such tenancies might well exist in places throughout the county where the crisis is not as acute, rents are lower and HAP limits mean something, but in those areas where the crisis is most acute and rent levels are way in excess of the HAP limits, we might as well tell people to go to Mars as tell them to find HAP tenancies. All we can do in such areas is beg the council to increase the HAP limits to a more appropriate level. While we have no choice other than to pursue such an approach in the immediate sense, it is a disaster in the macro sense. This point applies to the Minister's entire housing plan. Approximately 80% of that plan depends on the private rented sector. It is not a solution. The Minister has said that the direct provision of council housing is going to ramp up. Given that we are starting from a base of almost nothing, of course the percentage will look impressive if the figure increases to 4,000. Having been at a point where very few council houses were being built, we are now hoping to get up to levels which will not come anywhere close to matching the scale of the crisis. The vast majority of the solution being offered by the Minister involves the private rented sector. If it succeeds, the public finances will be looted on a massive scale. I asked him about this the other day. Has he calculated what will happen if Rebuilding Ireland works and he gets the 100,000 social tenancies he is hoping to get from the HAP, RAS and leasing schemes? How much will that cost the State over a period of 20 or 30 years? The amount of money it will cost is terrifying. Between €30 billion and €40 billion will be going out over that period of time. That money could and should be used to invest in the construction of public housing on a massive scale. Of course the upfront capital investment would be significant, but it would save the State money in the end while providing a much more secure and genuinely affordable form of public housing at the same time. People living in such houses, unlike every single HAP tenant, would not have to run the risk of the landlord pulling out of the HAP tenancy whenever it suits him or her. Even if it works, 80% of the Government plan will depend on a precarious form of social housing which will continue to produce a stream of people going into emergency accommodation. In addition, it will cost the State a fortune. In fact, it will blow a massive hole in the public finances over the long term. The Minister, having to failed to acknowledge that this is madness from any point of view, is now going a step further by giving a further tax incentive to these people, which signals that he believes they can help us to solve the housing problem even though that is absolutely not the case. There is not even a link with affordability. I would like the Minister to answer a question I asked earlier. Does he recognise that rents are out of control? What is the purpose in this case of incentivising a supply of rental property which is unaffordable? I repeat that I would like to know what the point of that is. Does the Minister think rents will decrease because of it? If he does, he is living in cloud cuckoo land. It is not going to happen. These guys are pushing for rent increases all the time. The Minister intends to incentivise them to move into this market. The only reason they will do so is that they can command these massively high rents, which are useless to anybody. In the case of the HAP scheme, the State is not even willing to pay these rents. If such rents are paid, they will blow a black hole in the public finances. They are completely unaffordable for the vast majority of people looking for rental property. I will repeat the question I asked earlier. Who can afford a monthly rent of €2,200? One would want to be very rich to afford it. Such rents are being sought in vast swathes of Dublin, where the crisis is most acute. What is the point of this approach? The Minister has said he fears that some of these people might pull out of the rental market. Deputy Paul Murphy provided an answer to that when the said that the houses will remain. These people cannot take them away. They cannot put the houses in a suitcase and get on a plane with them. If it is the case that these people might leave houses sitting empty, as many of them are doing because they do not want the hassle of tenants and prefer to make easy money, we need to put in place severe laws that make it illegal for people to sit on empty properties that could be used for residential purposes, or impose punitive taxes for so doing. That is how we should deal with the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make a brief comment as we have had this discussion. Unfortunately, the discussion has had to move on to the streets because I do not believe the Government really gets it. The anniversary of Jonathan Corrie's death will be on 1 December. The National Homeless and Housing Coalition, which was set up in response to his death and held a vigil outside the Dail two years ago, has called for another national demonstration for 1 December, following the 3 October Raise the Roof protest. People protested on 3 October in the hope that in this budget the Government would change tack, and that it would encompass a radical move to address a crisis that the Minister with responsibility for this area has acknowledged has not peaked. This may be one of the few opportunities in the debate on this Bill that we get to discuss what could have been included in the budget to provide for housing. This amendment sticks in the craw because even though it is a relatively small one, it is part of an approach the Government seems to be taking underpinned by a belief that the private rented sector will substantially help us to solve the problem when in fact it is the dysfunctionality of the private rented sector and of the private market generally which has helped generate some of the worse aspects of the crisis. We accept, for the time being at least, that there will be private landlords and some of them will provide accommodation that will assist in addressing the situation but the problem is that it is not a secure sustainable basis to solve the crisis. The bulk of the Government's housing plan, Rebuilding Ireland, depends on this sector and the bulk of the Government's policies seem to be focused on supporting, incentivising and pandering to people who see the provision of accommodation as a means to make money. It is that commodification of housing that has reached very extreme proportions in Ireland that is at the base of the current crisis. That is the frustration. There is nothing in what the Minister said that gives me much hope that the Government will change tack.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the amendment concern the film industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just made it back in time. Will the Chairman to clarify the position on the amendment I submitted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I queried this ruling with the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I did not blame the Chairman. When I queried the ruling, I was told that the amendment had been ruled out of order on the basis that it might impose a charge on the Exchequer in so far as it might reduce access to the relief. I said to those responsible in the Bills Office that under no circumstances would it do so, nor was it intended to do so. I pointed out that it would be a clarification of a condition already attached to section 481 tax relief, which requires that the relief produce quality employment. Essentially, my amendment sought to define and clarify the meaning of "quality employment". I do not understand how the ruling could have been made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay; that is fine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, but I missed the earlier discussion because I was in the Dáil Chamber.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a number of comments to make on the section, but, to be honest, I do not know where to begin. If anything, we need to increase investment in film industry and the arts generally. The film industry has enormous potential. We have a massive pool of creative talent, with a fantastic tradition in acting, film making and writing, as well as excellence on the technical and construction side of film making. These talented people have produced an amazing legacy of film production in Ireland.We could do a hell of a lot more. We are underperforming compared with where we could be. In the same way as Ireland has a literary tradition that internationally punches way above its weight for a small country like ours, we could do exactly the same with film. I favour dramatically increasing the amount of public investment in film production. However, I have a big problem with the manner in which it is being done. Much of that problem relates to section 481 tax relief. The current tax relief has a condition that film in order to qualify for section 481 tax relief should "act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through, among other things, the provision of quality employment and training opportunities". When representatives of the Irish Film Board and Screen Producers Ireland appeared before the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht essentially to make the case for the continuation of section 481 relief - there has been a pretty sustained media campaign by certain people in the film industry to try to ensure the continuation of section 481 - they claimed the industry sustained 17,000 jobs, which is a lot of jobs. This relief is worth €70 million to €80 million a year, added to which is €10 million to €15 million in Irish Film Board grants: we are talking about a lot of public money. As I said I do not begrudge that: in fact I would like to double it. However, it is supposed to be conditional on "the provision of quality employment and training opportunities". If it were true that there were 17,000 quality jobs with training opportunities, one would say it is money well spent, but the problem is that just is not true. The Minister has a responsibility to look at that very closely. Generally as he knows, all these tax reliefs which are worth billions of euro every year need to be examined very thoroughly to ensure they are achieving the objectives they are supposed to achieve. In the case of this one, it simply is not true that there are 17,000 jobs in the industry. Today if one looked one would probably find a few hundred people are working in the film industry in Ireland - not a few thousand and definitely not 17,000. If one looked a bit further one would find a tiny minority of them, if any, are working in what might be described as quality employment. Hence the amendment I tabled. I ask the Minister directly to define what is quality employment. Employment in the film industry is absolutely precarious because people who work in that industry are effectively a "hire 'em and fire 'em" workforce employed on an if-and-when basis from production to production by special purpose vehicles which are established for making a particular film and then disappear when that film is complete even though standing behind those special purpose vehicles are other companies that have a permanent existence. I do not know how familiar the Minister is with this. For each film production a new special purpose vehicle, SPV, is set up. The company standing behind it gets the money but the SPV employs the workers and then disappears. It appears like a mushroom and then disappears in a puff of smoke leaving the workers with absolutely no rights and entitlements. Only about eight to 12 companies get the bulk of section 481 tax relief. The workers, who never get formal employment by the parent company but are working for the same people again and again, are not treated as employees, or if they are treated as employees they are only treated as employees for the duration of that production. They have no guarantee when the next production comes along that the company will take them back if the company decides it does not want to take them back. It is totally precarious. Thursday's "Prime Time" programme did a veritable hatchet job on workers who were protesting about precarious employment in the industry. In that programme a contractor in the industry said that when he entered the film industry he did not expect any security of employment, permanent employment or continuity of employment. If a contractor wants to have a totally precarious existence because that is their business, that is up to them. I do not understand why anybody would want that, but it is up to them. However, it is total precariousness that every worker in the industry should have to expect that and put up with it. I think he actually used the phrase, "You're only as good as your last job", and that is defined by the production company that gets the section 481 relief and has no obligations to employees it may have employed on and off for 15 or 20 years. Those workers were then vilified by RTÉ in a shameful "Prime Time" programme. I have great time for RTÉ and public service broadcasting. However, what it did on Thursday bordered on being unethical in its treatment of workers who are protesting about the total precariousness of their employment conditions. Some workers may have worked for the same parent company again and again. However, if they ask for their rights and say they did not want to work hours in excess of the working time directive, the company may refuse to take them back. If they are transport workers and it is unsafe to work excessive hours when driving to transport equipment but they dare to say anything about that, they will be considered troublesome and the contractor who employs the transport workers for the SPV, which in turn is really working for the parent company that gets the relief, may refuse to take them back because they are insisting on working what are legally safe hours. It is totally unacceptable. I should add that none of these people has pension entitlements. I met people on sets who had been working for 20 years with no pension entitlements at all. The representatives of Screen Producers Ireland have agreed that they need to do something about training. However, nothing has actually been done about training. There is no training pathway that stipulates that after a particular amount of hours working on film productions a trainee then becomes qualified and is entitled to certain entitlements as a qualified person in that particular grade of film production.That does not exist. Someone can be a trainee for years and never be deemed to be actually qualified because it suits the film production companies and they get people cheaper or whatever the case may be. This is not acceptable and it does not fit any definition, unless the Minister can tell me how these working conditions for people who, I repeat, in many if not most cases have worked for the people who are getting all this relief and who have a permanent existence with their companies but those companies state they have no obligations to these workers even though they have worked for them many times, can be defined as quality of employment and training opportunities. To back up my argument, much of the defence of the status quo by the film producers and film board in this regard is based on stating that film is different, that people do not understand how it is different and that is just the way it is in film. Recently, I met somebody who works in animation and animation does not work like that. Animation is about making animated films, and I presume just like with normal films there is a certain precariousness in terms of when people will get a project, yet animation companies manage to employ people on a permanent basis with pension entitlements and rights as employees. They seem to have got it right. In fact, the Irish animation industry, based on what I would call more proper quality conditions of employment and training, is a world beater. The Irish animation industry is a big hitter on the international stage. The idea we must accept total precariousness in film production is disproven by what is happening in animation. There is no justification for the continued precariousness that those who are the recipients of section 481 seem to insist has to exist in the industry. I believe the "Prime Time" programme was directly related to this debate and the fact this section of the Bill deals with the renewal of section 481 relief. It was part of the very sustained campaign to retain this relief. It is very disappointing that "Prime Time" waded in in the way it did in a very biased manner on one side of the debate and essentially tried to smear those who have a different view on how the film industry should be organised. I was interviewed for the piece. The journalist involved put on camera contractors who defended the precarious situation and who stated groups such as the Irish Film Workers Association that are demanding security of employment are just trying to control the industry, just want a closed shop and all this other stuff that was thrown at them. The journalist stated he had offered film workers the opportunity to come on camera to talk about the allegations they are making about blacklisting of union activists or people demanding their rights but that he could not find anybody to go on camera. The public was completely misled on this and I will cite the evidence because it is important in terms of the Minister's consideration of this issue and the section generally, and my proposed amendment that was ruled out of order. In one of these committee rooms, at the first hearing of the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Equity representative from SIPTU, not the Irish Film Workers Association that was maligned very badly in "Prime Time", was asked by me whether there is blacklisting in the industry. I sent the journalist the transcript of that meeting before "Prime Time" aired and stated if he was telling me he could not find evidence of people in the industry saying there is blacklisting that he look at the arts committee hearing where the SIPTU Equity representative stated there was widespread blacklisting. The Equity representative went further at that meeting and stated Equity had done a survey that, if I remember correctly, indicated approximately 70% of people surveyed were in fear of blacklisting and not being re-employed in the industry if they rocked the boat. Furthermore, dozens of members of the GMB union, not mentioned largely in "Prime Time" and, again, not the Irish Film Workers Association, attempted to phone the journalist to state they would speak to him on camera about blacklisting in the industry. That was not acknowledged on "Prime Time". The journalist did not talk to them and refused to take their calls but then stated he could not find anybody to speak about these things. Furthermore, on a protest outside Ardmore Studios the journalist did interviews on camera with people who said they had been blacklisted but he did not present those recordings as part of the documentary. He completely misled the public as to the other side of the debate. There is a sustained campaign to deny the fact there is a serious precariousness problem in the industry. I want to say to all of those involved, including the Minister and the film producers, this is not good for the Irish film industry. The retention of this relief should be absolutely conditional on a clearly defined definition of quality of employment, which would involve some level of security and continuity for employees. I want to stress those employees recognise the work is project to project. In decent parts of construction, not where there are bogus self-employment issues but where it is done properly, people are employed directly for a job by a particular construction firm. That project may end but unless the person has done something absolutely appalling the firm will take the person back on for the next project. People build up pension entitlements and rights as an employee which accumulate. This is not the situation in the film industry. I put it to the Minister this has to be the definition of quality employment and giving out this very generous tax relief must be conditional on it. I want it noted in this regard that an all-party Oireachtas committee, at which all parties here were present, made a recommendation that we need to look at the question of continuity of employment, quality of employment and a proper structure in terms of training and career progression. It also made a recommendation that there should be a stakeholders' forum for the film industry for the various grades, including contractors, producers, politicians for that matter and anyone with a genuine stake in it. It should include all grades of workers and no organisation should be excluded from it. The campaign of recent weeks has been to try to exclude specific groups on the basis of hearsay-type allegations. I have no doubt, by the way, this has got very bitter on both sides but there should be a will on the part of everyone to get over the bitterness. The only way this can be done is if all sides state they are willing to sit together in a room to try to work this out to the benefit of everybody. The Minister needs to set down a marker that giving this relief will be contingent on convening that forum recommended by the all-party committee.He should set down a marker that this stuff cannot go on in terms of precarity of employment and that having a genuine stakeholder consultative body where issues and problems can be ironed out in a fair and reasonable way should be the condition of getting this film relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to come back in if I can.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the Minister has listened and is looking at this. I welcome the news about the screen education and training forum. On that point, there have been commitments and promises about having a proper structure for training for quite a long time. There has been report after report that this would be done but nothing was done. To give the Minister some sense of what is at stake, one of the people I met on a recent protest at Ardmore Studios. The protest in question involved workers who believe they are being blackballed out of the industry because they have, essentially, asserted their rights. Many of them are involved with the Irish Film Workers Association and the GMB. The young man in question rang me the following day. I had never met him before. Perhaps he did not want to bring it up because he was embarrassed. He is an apprentice painter trying to make his way in the film industry. During our phone conversation, he revealed that he had done his entire apprenticeship trying to make his way in the film industry while living in emergency accommodation. In fact, he went from one form of homeless accommodation to another. He has children who he could not see because he does not have a stable place to live.I spent last week interacting with Mr. Brendan Kenny in the housing department of Dublin City Council. In fairness, we came to an agreement that would sort things out for this young man who for four years has been living in emergency accommodation while trying to pursue his painting apprenticeship working in the very precarious environment that is the film industry. It is just not on. The Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, is in my area. It is a fantastic institution, with wonderful people and equipment put in in recent years. It also has great training courses, but is this level of precarity the future for those who graduate? People will not know where they stand from film production to film production. I refer to those who have the power to make decisions and whether people are liked. There are many allegations and a level of bitterness on all sides of the dispute ongoing in the film industry which is both unfortunate and depressing. It is such a pity that that is the case when we have this fantastic potential about which we have spoken. The issue could be resolved if we made the public moneys going into the industry conditional on providing some level of security, for continuity of employment, entitlements and rights in order that there would be an actual career path. How is it supposed to be possible for people to take out a mortgage, pay rent or even find a landlord if there is no security of employment for them next month or in six months' time because of the nature of the business? If the industry was not so heavily publicly subsidised, we could say it was just the private market. However, a lot of State money is going into the industry. Surely the provision of State money should be conditional on something much better. I refer to trainees or, in this case, apprentices not living in homeless accommodation or people not being able to take out a mortgage from a bank because their employment status is completely precarious and dependent on them "not rocking the boat". I use the words of the Equity spokesperson.  I take the Minister's point which is why I have mentioned this issue. I am glad that he acknowledged the point about the animation sector. It proves that it does not have to be like this. How can the animation sector maintain continuous, decent and secure employment for its employees and at the same do a fantastic job such that it will be a player on the international scene? It is able to compete with the absolute best and sought after. As it can offer proper conditions of employment and standing companies, I am happy to give it backing, all of the backing we can possibly give it. It is quality employment. It is something into which people might go and see career progression, but that is not what is going on in the rest of the film industry and that issue has to be addressed. We cannot just have promises that we will look at training and all other issues as we have had in the past. We need the Government to state the issues in the film industry will be addressed now. There are peculiarities to the film industry, but there are ways to deal with them. The animation industry shows that it can be done, even with those peculiarities. Screen training is a good start, but the forum that was promised needs to happen. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, need to state nobody is being excluded from it. If we start to operate on the basis that groups will malign each other and with mud being slung all over the place, there will not be a forum or we will not have one that will mean anything because half of the people affected by its decisions will have been left outside the door. That is not going to work. Everybody has to be involved. As the Minister rightly said - it is fantastic that he has said it - the number involved in the industry have turned out to be a fraction of what was stated to the committee by the Irish Film Board. It came here and stated it was 17,000, but the Minister is saying it is 2,800. There should be questions about that. How could it have come here and stated the number was 17,000 full-time equivalents when it has turnsed out there are only 2,800? I do not know what the breakdown as between PAYE workers and contractors, etc. and would be glad if there was extra scrutiny. I would like to think, however, that the Minister would give some assurance that the forum for stakeholders would happen, there was to be a timeline for it and everybody would be included. It should also be ensured quality employment and training opportunities would be policed and that receipt of the relief would be strictly conditional on people adhering to that requirement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one more question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be quick.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not worry; we will fly through the remaining sections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has said some of the issues I am raising are outside the remit of the Bill or his Department. Even the legislation, as it stands, includes a specific reference that I have mentioned to the Minister. The measure is already conditional on the provision of quality employment and training opportunities. That is something that falls within the remit of the Minister. I did not write the legislation and did not propose the amendment. As that is what is included in the legislation, these are issues that are directly relevant to the Minister, this section and amendments to it.  I asked the Minster one question which he did not answer. I do not think he is avoiding it as we are having an expansive discussion. Given that it is included in the legislation, will he define for me and, more importantly, the people who benefit from the relief what is meant by "quality employment and training opportunities"? I ask because it is a condition of availing of the relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is. It is about the relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I indicated I wished to speak before we went into private session.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mechanism thorough which the big multinationals are avoiding tax in large amounts is through these inter-group transactions. Will the Minister tell us, if he has the figures, about the latest available figures on inter-group transactions, reliefs and credits? I have before me a list produced by Revenue with data for up to 2016. It is the Revenue list of tax allowances, credits, exemptions and reliefs. Does the Minister have the latest available figures? The transactions come under a particular heading, which is the largest heading of all the reliefs that are available. In 2016, a total of €9 billion in intra-group transactions was recorded. Companies are able to deduct these transactions from taxable income. Initially, they would be part of the gross trading profits. Then, their taxable income is dramatically reduced through mechanisms such as intra-group transactions. The focus of the directive is precisely to get at that. We all know that is where the devil is in this whole question. It is through the intra-group transactions, royalty payments, licence payments and whatever name they use. A company pays off a subsidiary in a low-tax or no-tax jurisdiction and consequently does not pay tax on what are in actuality profits. They are not really costs and should not be allowed to the degree that they are allowed. I am keen to know the latest available figure. Do we have projected figures for what we are likely to get next year or the year after on these intra-group transactions and allowances? I find it astonishing that, according to the Minister's explanation, a measure that is supposed to address this issue will produce zero. He explained that is because we do not know what the figures might be from year to year. Does he believe this measure will curb and address such conduct? If not, I do not see the point of it. It does not seem that the option chosen by the Minister will curb this kind of tax avoidance activity by multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When one looks at the jump which took place across 2014 to 2015 and 2016, it was huge. Normal repatriation of profits to parent companies might see incremental or even substantial increases but not the level of jump we saw between 2015 and 2016. That is why I am curious about the 2017 figure. The figure for intragroup transaction allowances, or "loopholes" to the layperson, which is to say tax-deductible allowances, goes from €2.9 billion in 2015 to €9.1 billion in 2016. I do not know what it is in 2017, but it is a dramatic increase in the claim being made by multinationals for a relief on their taxable profits. To me, that suggests something untoward.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand what we are doing here. What I do know, however, is that the way in which the Minister is dealing with this cap is contrary to what was recommended by Mr. Seamus Coffey when he produced his report. He argued, if I remember correctly, that the move back to 80% from 100% should capture income from before it was reduced, not just going forward. By doing that, one would capture the onshoring of assets which took place after the double Irish was closed down. That was the previous mechanism through which aggressive tax avoidance was pursued by Apple and others and which has done significant and, frankly, justified damage to Ireland's international reputation and copperfastened our reputation as a corporate tax haven. Mr. Coffey would not describe himself as a radical lefty or someone who wants to threaten the welfare of the Irish economy and is probably, in fact, a defender of existing corporate tax arrangements. However, even he said we should have applied the 80% rather than the 100% relief the Government allowed for that window period during which the massive onshoring of intangible assets took place. That would have raised approximately €700 million more but the Minister chose not to do it. Perhaps, the Minister might explain if the clarification relates to that decision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, if he had done what was recommended, might have damaged our reputation with people who are engaged in aggressive tax avoidance but he would have enhanced our reputation with what I suspect is a very significant majority in the world who feel we have developed a reputation for being a tax haven and facilitating tax avoidance. I would have thought it is more important to improve our reputation with those who are legitimately and correctly, in my opinion, expressing concern about how Ireland has been used by these corporations to avoid very large amounts of tax, first, through the double Irish and, subsequently, through the window that was created by the 100% relief on intangible assets. In regard to our previous discussions, it may be the case that when the Minister tries to ascertain why the figure for inter-group transactions jumped from 2015 to 2016, they will be accounted for by the reliefs being claimed, such as the 100% relief available in that period for the massive onshoring of intangible assets that took place in the window that was created for those years. In fact, I am certain that it is what he will find. We created the window that they jumped through and we gave them relief which allowed them to avoid billions in tax. That is reprehensible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept what the Minister has just said. He probably did make the decision based on his belief that it would essentially scare the horses if the assets that were onshore during that period were captured by reducing the cap to 80% and that companies such as Apple would be very upset by that which might have implications for investment decisions they make here. I would say that is the reason the Minister did this. It is not good or acceptable logic because it is the logic of those companies having their guns to our head to prevent us from doing what is right in terms of fair taxation and tax justice because the original window that was opened in 2014 - which I consider to have been a little deal because the coincidence is remarkable that the double Irish was closed down - that had big implications for those companies and lo and behold a new window opened up which allowed them to onshore all these assets. It beggars belief that there was not a nod and a wink arrangement in that case. It is too convenient and the benefit of that window being reopened for the companies was very significant. The Minister closed it down but he is allowing that stroke to stand. It was a stroke because hundreds of billions of euros worth of assets were onshored and a tax relief of 100% was given. Those assets will continue to benefit from that 100% tax relief based on what was a stroke and the Minister should not have done that, it is wrong. The Minister did it for what we would have considered to be pragmatic reasons such as the security of the economy but let us be clear about what that means. It means that we let bygones be bygones on the basis of a stroke. It was a stroke and that must be said publicly. The double Irish was a stroke and that had to be closed down due to pressure but lo and behold a new window was opened. To my mind that is wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 131:In page 108, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:
"Report on corporate tax rate
27. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on establishing a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent.".This amendment is on the effective corporate tax rate. I will not delay proceedings much longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not at all; it has been a long day. This is an issue that I and others have raised consistently in the past few years so I will not go over the ground too much except to say what I believe to be fairly obvious, which is that a corporate tax rate of 12.5% is by any standards a very low tax rate. It is one of the lowest headline corporate tax rates in the western world. It is lower than havens of capitalism like the United States, Britain and so on. It is a very generous rate of tax on profits already and, as we all know, the actuality is that after reliefs, deductions and allowances, the corporations do not pay that very low level of corporate tax; they pay much less. If we calculate the effective rate based on the proportion of tax actually paid by corporations as against the gross trading profits of those corporations, before all the reliefs, deductions and allowances kick in, the real rate of corporate tax in Ireland has actually reduced in recent years. If it is calculated in that way, in terms of the amount of tax they paid versus the gross trading profits, the effective rate was 5.8% in 2012, 5% in 2013, 5.1% in 2014, 4.3% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016. The effective rate of tax paid by corporations in this country has gone down 1.3% since 2012. That happens through the myriad of tax loopholes that are detailed on this very interesting document the Revenue produces under headings such as inter-group transactions, losses brought forward, research and development tax credit and others. It is important to emphasise that that is how they get their taxable income down from what are astonishingly high figures. While the effective rate on those gross trading profits has dropped since the Minister's party came into government, the gross trading profits themselves have doubled. In 2012, gross trading profits were €74 billion. In 2016, and these are the latest figures available to me, they were €158 billion. All I can say is "wow". That is a story people do not know. The aggregate profits of corporations in this country have more than doubled in the past five years. When we talk about economic recovery, that is a recovery, but have the incomes of people doubled? Is the quality of life and the quality of services twice as good as they were in 2012? As we know, they most certainly are not. We have creaking public services and housing, health service and infrastructure crises. In terms of people's income, public sector workers are still earning less than they were earning before all the austerity cuts came in. Even now, so many years into the recovery, people are earning less than they were earning in 2008, but the profits of corporations have more than doubled and the effective rate they pay has actually reduced. Again, all I can say is "wow". Against that background, does the Minister not think it would be reasonable to make them pay the 12.5%, as a minimum? That would be very reasonable and it would produce approximately €8 billion in additional revenue for the State, and they would still be paying a lower rate of tax. I know the Minister's comeback will be to say there are all sorts of reliefs and that the nominal headline rates in other countries are not the real rates either. All of that is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope he will say "wow" in terms of the profits. I do not dispute that the narrative coming from some of the critics of the Irish system is self-interested, that they have all their loopholes and so on, that they are annoyed that we have even more loopholes and that we are better tax pirates than they are in the game of tax piracy.Even if we did make them pay the 12.5%, we would still have, to use the Minister's term, an extremely competitive corporate tax rate. The latter is not a term I particularly like. I do not think there would be a mass exodus of corporations on foot of having to pay 12.5% on astonishing profits, because they would still be making significant profits. It is a very reasonable demand. We could go into some of the individual loopholes but I will do not do that because it is getting late. All I will say is that there are myriad such loopholes. I do not see how the Minister can justify many of them. I will just pick one. The second of my amendments that was ruled out of order focused on one of these loopholes, namely, the research and development tax credit. I would very much like to make this point because it is becoming increasingly important after the Irish Universities Association pleaded with the Minister about the need for increased investment in universities given what it sees as the significant declining proportion of investment per student and the need to dramatically increase investment. In that context, the €700 million we give out in tax reliefs, which mostly benefit the same gang, namely, Apple, Facebook and others. These companies are the main beneficiaries of the research and development tax credit. Instead of giving them €700 million in the form of such tax relief, imagine what would happen if we gave the same amount to the universities. Would that not make a difference to the universities that are tumbling down the international rankings? If one carried out a cost-benefit analysis in respect of giving €700 million to most of the multinationals or to the university sector, I wonder which would have a more positive long-term significant impact on the economy, its sustainability and viability. To me, it is a no-brainer that we should give the €700 million to the universities. The money would be far better spent on the universities than giving it in research and development tax relief to a load of multinational corporations. That is the sort of thing that a minimum effective rate would allow us to do. It would close down some of what is going on and claw back some of the money which we could then put into universities, infrastructure and key areas where we are chronically deficient in the levels of investment that we need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would call for them to be nationalised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, we would do it before the jobs go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The same.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have gone on longer than intended. We were trying to be brief. It is an important discussion because of the consequences of how we deal with that. The Minister is correct to say that the Trumps and Theresa Mays of this world, among others, are further accelerating the race to the bottom for corporation taxes. The Minister is saying that is the way corporation taxes are going and that we have to accept that is the way it is going without doing anything that would endanger our position. It is worth saying that possibly even Trump himself has indicated at times that his tax policy was a reaction to what places like Ireland had done. We helped to spearhead it. There has been much commentary on it internationally. It is not that we cannot do anything now because of what they might do. What they are doing is, to a significant extent, a reaction to what we did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what is being said internationally and I think it is true. I know the Minister does not like to admit it because it would be a big admission. That is what is being said, including in the Financial Times. It is not just being said by Trump, although he has referred to the Irish tax rate and Irish tax piracy, although I do not know if he used that exact phrase. I am not saying it for rhetorical or hyperbolic reasons. I think we have been spearheading an international race to the bottom on corporate tax. Nobody could dispute with a straight face that the biggest corporations in the world are aggressive tax avoiders which have gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying tax on staggering amounts of profits. That is beyond dispute. Is it a coincidence that they are all located here and that the whole world is saying that Ireland is a tax haven?Even Trump, as obnoxious as he is, is sort of saying he must reduce corporate taxes in the United States. He wanted to do that anyway - do not get me wrong. He would find any excuse but the fact that he has cited Ireland must tell us something. Insofar as Ireland has influenced the global race to the bottom in the wrong direction, we propose that Ireland start to influence global corporate tax policy in the right direction - in a good direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pressing it. That is what we are proposing. As a final point, the Minister is not acknowledging that there is a cost to all this that is not only about a kind of ideological choice, that where we would like to go might end in nationalisation and that is what we really want whereas where the Minister wants to go is somewhere slightly different.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot different, I accept, but that is not what it is about at all. I would rather not be in politics. I would rather get on with something other than politics but the reason I am involved in politics is a real concern about problems that we simply cannot ignore and that are getting worse, such as the environment. The world is proving incapable of dealing with the environment because the politicians will not take on these corporations. That is what is happening. Why is there an infrastructural crisis in the western world? It is not only in Ireland. We are one of the worst but there is a housing crisis all across Europe. There is a housing crisis in the United States. A housing crisis that did not exist 20 years ago exists now all across the western world. Why is there a crisis in health services all across the western world? Why is it we could do better 20 years ago, in health, in housing, in education and in infrastructure, than we are able to do now when we are richer than we were then? Is that not a conundrum? We are worse in all the key areas of infrastructure than we were 20 years ago but we are richer today than we were then. That is a contradiction. The Minister's perspective is not acknowledging that is a problem and that we somehow need to move in a different direction to address it otherwise we will be in big trouble. I will finish on this. I cited the example of the universities versus the research and development. The Minister did not respond directly on it. He can make all the cases he likes for Apple and the level of investment but I beg him not to try to convince me that it is better to give €700 million to Apple, Google and Facebook than to Irish universities because I do not buy that. From an economic point of view, from a social point of view, from a sustainability point of view and from the point of view of moving in one direction rather than another, it is self-evidently the case it would be better to give it to our universities than to give it to Google and Facebook.
