RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the issue of Brexit, the Border, the backstop and all that, last week I asked President Juncker whether we could trust him and the European Union on this issue. He looked slightly annoyed but shouted "yes", that we could trust them, across the Chamber. Is the Taoiseach fully confident that the European Union, if negotiations fail and there is no agreement with the UK, is not going to protect the Single Market and insist that some sort of Border is put in place? I ask that because while I do not trust Mrs. Theresa May one inch and I find her Little Englander, xenophobic nationalism obnoxious in the extreme, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act that passed today in the Houses of Parliament, and this has not been mentioned in any media discourse, actually has legal provisions saying that there will be no Border. Section 17 of the Act says that after negotiations, regardless of the outcome of those negotiations, there will be no customs posts, no Border checks, no random stopping of cars or vehicles etc. There will be no Border. It is absolutely spelt out in the EU (Withdrawal) Act and that is law now in Britain. They can of course change the law and I do not trust them but at least it is in the law and it has been passed by the British Houses of Parliament. Where is the guarantee from the European Union?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At least it is legal. It now has legal force. The law will have to be changed to impose a Border. That is obviously because of the pressure from this country, within Britain and from all sorts of forces but it is now translated into law. That is binding on the British Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the binding obligation on the European Union to hold the line on the assurances that it has given that there will not be a Border? In the Taoiseach's discussions with the Spanish Prime Minister, did he discuss the issue of Palestine and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza which takes on more importance now that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, is saying that it does not have money to sustain its aid and education programmes in Gaza and the West Bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to talk about Venezuela.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Words such as "biodiversity" confuse people because they are technical. We are talking about the birds, bees, trees and fish that sustain the ecosystem on which we depend for our survival. That ecosystem is under threat. It is an economic threat in the sense that the depletion of biodiversity means that, among other things, we potentially face huge fines. A diverse environment acts as a carbon sink. Monoculture forestry, for example, is not a good carbon sink compared to forestry made up of native broadleaf species. Deforestation has been a feature of reports over the past five or six years. Despite targets to increase afforestation, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, there is significant evidence of deforestation. Kelp is an example of where a commitment to biodiversity is not matched by action. BioAtlantis will start cutting down 1,900 hectares of trees of the sea in Bantry Bay, which will destroy biodiversity there. Another example is the fact that the Heritage Bill will extend the cutting season so that hedgerows can be cut down, which will deplete biodiversity as well. The Government is allowing that to happen. All the commitments to deal with climate change are not followed through. In reality, the Government is implementing measures which significantly degrade biodiversity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I am happy with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also thank Deputy Micheál Martin. The people in west Cork will say very differently, in that the boxes were ticked but it was not a real consultation as very few people actually knew what was happening and what was proposed. We do not know what the impact of the cutting down of kelp may be, but it is certainly a spawning ground for many marine species and we do not know what the damage could be to those fish that spawn in those kelp fields. This is why people are very opposed to the harvesting commencing, particularly in advance of the judicial review. The Taoiseach did not respond on the Heritage Bill 2016, which runs completely against our commitment to maintaining biodiversity. It allows the cutting down of hedgerows, which are critical for sustaining biodiversity. Scrub, hedgerows and wild growth are absolutely critical from a climate change point of view and a biodiversity point of view. The Heritage Bill cuts very much against it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was no answer on the Heritage Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is keen to slag off the agenda of the left. I have a big problem with boosting military expenditure at the behest of the European Union to bolster the military-industrial complex and arms manufacturers in Europe. I would be quite happy, however, to see money spent on soldiers and their families to give them a decent wage and livelihood in order that they do not have to depend on family income supplement. Up to 25% of the Defence Forces have to take up family income supplement, forcing their families to go out protesting. That is at the root of the significant recruitment and retention difficulties, resulting in the Defence Forces being way below strength. Health and safety has been compromised because of the exodus of experienced personnel from the Air Corps, the Army and the Naval Service. It all comes down to low levels of pay, as well as poor conditions of accommodation, food and other factors which are a result of the Government not putting investment into the soldiers. Will the Minister of State give us the figures for the last recruitment drive? How many people were actually recruited? I know 3,000 expressed an interest, 381 went as far as being processed and only 180 were called. How many people were actually recruited?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the soldiers said to us when they were outside protesting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does the Minister of State explain the following comment from one member of the Defence Forces?:We're only a priority for the State when the State wants to highlight it themselves worldwide. We are far from a priority when it comes to the welfare of our troops, their wages, their conditions, their health.Another member talks about the fact that he earned approximately €150 per week more between 2005 and 2007, when he was able to get a mortgage, than he earns today. This is the reality, and this is why the Department is unable to recruit and retain people and they are flooding out of the Defence Forces. The Department buys new naval vessels but does not have the personnel to put on them, so the vessels go out to sea but I hear reports that they then cannot do the fisheries patrols because they do not have enough personnel to board ships. The Department is buying new CASA airplanes, but I understand there are only three CASA pilots, some of whom may even leave, yet it takes years to train these pilots. Where will we get the pilots to fly the planes? It is interesting the Minister of State does not have the figures for the result of the recruitment drive. There are all these expressions of interest, but then they decrease to a tiny number because the applicants discover what the pay and conditions are and will not touch the positions with a bargepole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must have people to sail the ships.
