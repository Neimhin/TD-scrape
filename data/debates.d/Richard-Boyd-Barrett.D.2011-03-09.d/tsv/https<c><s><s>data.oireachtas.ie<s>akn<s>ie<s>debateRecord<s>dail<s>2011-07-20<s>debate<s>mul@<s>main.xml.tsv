RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will be two taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have asked this question about six times.  When will the House have an opportunity to discuss the McCarthy report on the sale of State assets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Legislation will be brought forward to secure the sale of those State assets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have done so several times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have experienced exactly the same frustration as has been expressed by others——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——because they all get transferred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put in about six or seven questions last week.  The majority of my questions are being transferred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give the Taoiseach a few examples.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  Why, for example, when I asked a question as to whether the Taoiseach had met personally with the EU-IMF delegation during their visit, was that transferred?  When I asked a question about the Taoiseach's role in the Economic Management Council, that question was ruled as being subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  In addition, a document that we got as new Deputies referred to the fact that the Taoiseach was supposed to answer questions on economic and social affairs.  However, time and time again, when I table questions on economic affairs, which is the area of most public concern, they are all transferred or disallowed.  It is unacceptable for the Taoiseach to say that a question should go to the Minister for Finance, particularly in the current economic climate.  The Minister for Finance is up for questioning every four weeks approximately.  Given the scale, depth and severity of the economic crisis we are facing, which is a fluid situation that is moving on a daily basis, as public representatives we must have an opportunity to ask the Taoiseach about those developments in our country's economic situation.While it is absolutely justified and legitimate for the Taoiseach to bat off detailed questions about economics or the country's finances to the relevant Minister, if we are asking questions about how to deal with the broad strategic orientation of our economic and financial policies in relation to the current economic crisis, the Taoiseach should answer those questions instead of batting them off, transferring them or telling us that they are subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  Given all the right talk about a new type of Government and politics, transparency and open government, it is not acceptable to have questions on these key issues batted off to some Minister or disallowed on some spurious basis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not meaningless at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked if the Taoiseach met them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So the Taoiseach did not meet them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had a question about the Economic Management Council refused on the basis of Cabinet confidentiality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I then asked what areas were subject to Cabinet confidentiality and I was told that was subject to Cabinet confidentiality.  This is just bizarre.Can I specifically ask, in the area——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  I have made my point, but the Taoiseach did not answer the other question I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am getting nowhere on that.  A document given to us stated the Taoiseach would answer questions on economic and social affairs.  Given the severity of the economic crisis and the concern we all have with economic and social affairs, it is not good enough to have questions in these areas batted off to Ministers who can only be questioned once every four weeks and only then by a kind of lottery.  Will the Taoiseach be a bit more generous in answering questions on economic and social affairs as they are so important?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach heads off to this meeting, has it dawned on him even a little that the EU, IMF and ECB simply do not have a clue what they are doing, and that the policy of bailing out the bankers and the bondholders and imposing brutal austerity on ordinary people is not only unjust but is making the crisis worse and is spreading the contagion?  Has it occurred to him — flashed on his radar screen at all — that the EU-IMF medicine is a poison that, rather than curing, threatens to kill the patient?  Has it crossed his mind that the EU, IMF and ECB do not care what happens to ordinary citizens here, working people and those with special needs, but are simply acting as the agents of the financial markets and big corporate interests which want to asset strip this country, Greece and Portugal just as they have done elsewhere?Does the Taoiseach know, for example, anything at all about the history of the IMF and the trail of destruction, poverty and war that it has left in its wake as it has gone in to assist countries?  Does he know, for example, that two champions of IMF austerity and privatisation programmes are General Pinochet in Chile and the not lamented former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and that the IMF policies they imposed on their countries in so-called structural adjustment devastated those countries and their people?  Does the Taoiseach want to go down in history in the company of tyrants such as Pinochet and Mubarak who imposed such brutal policies on the people of their countries?  Does it jar with the Taoiseach that as he and others in this House, and the bankers, developers and politicians who helped create and preside over this crisis, head off on their holidays, hundreds of thousands of working people here will not have any holidays and will not even know whether they can meet the bills over the summer months?  Is it not time to say the bankers and financiers who caused the crisis should pay for it and that our natural resources and the wealth in our society should be used to create jobs and protect public services and the vulnerable in our society instead of bailing out the insatiable monster that has wrecked the European economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If necessary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Policies, policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The pain and suffering of people who have been victims of abuse by church institutions is just too horrific to describe.  In that context the catalogue of abuse, and cover-up by the church authorities of it, and failure to act is an absolute outrage.  While this motion constitutes a good start in being so critical of the church authorities, Members must go considerably further.  First, as Deputy Halligan stated, the papal nuncio undoubtedly should be expelled until the church issues a clear and unequivocal statement that it will give precedence to civil law, that is, the law of the State, on these matters over canon law or its own concerns to defend its reputation or any other self-interest it may have.  In addition, the church and the State should be forced into some form of truth and reconciliation forum in which the victims of abuse by the church and other institutions within the State should be given the opportunity to confront the authorities of the institutions that abused them, to have their own voices heard and to articulate their demands on what they need in respect of redress.While the church authorities have, rightly, been criticised, the Minister also must consider the issue of the failure of the Garda to report complaints of abuse to the health boards, as well as the fact that in some cases, gardaí were assessing whether priests about whom complaints had been made were an ongoing risk to children.  The Garda has no qualification to assess whether alleged abusers are an ongoing risk to children as that is a matter for the health authorities.  The role of the Garda is to use different criteria to assess whether legal prosecutions can be taken.  In other words, when one talks of mandatory reporting, the key question is to what authority is one reporting and for what purpose.  Reporting should not be to the Garda alone, as I heard the Minister mention on radio today, although it certainly should be reported to.  Reporting also must be to the health authorities, which must consider the interests of the child.  Consideration must be given to whether a legal prosecution can be taken and to the best interests of the child, as well as to what measures must be put in place to secure those best interests.As has been agreed and as the wording of the motion suggests, many of these problems would not have occurred had the Children First guidelines been in place, had they been implemented fully by all agencies and bodies and had they been respected by church institutions and everyone else.  Therefore, I greatly welcome the Government's commitment to put in place and give legislative force to the Children First guidelines.  However, it is clear these guidelines cannot be implemented fully and properly unless the resources are provided to so do.  This goes far beyond the commitment to an additional 250 social workers, as many other types of supports, resources and staffing issues also must be addressed.  This comes at a time at which the public sector recruitment embargo is slaughtering staff numbers in many of the areas which it would be necessary to resource fully and this point must be considered.  If children are to come first, the resources must be put in place to ensure they do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could create a few internships monitoring the website.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When talking about the liberalism of the means test for the carer's allowance, is it not the case that the real story is that carers save the State an estimated €2.5 billion euro per year, according to the Carers Association?  The cost to the State would be massively higher if those being cared for had to be looked after fully by the State.  Is it not also the case that what the Minister calls the generosity of the scheme results from the fact that carers have extra financial burdens, such as increased electricity costs, extra washing and lighting costs, extra heating costs and extra medical bills, along with many other extra burdens that other people do not have to face?  That is why we need a carer's allowance.  Carers are already shocked that the Minister has cut the home benefits package.  All they want is an assurance that given the contribution they make to the State and the welfare of sick and vulnerable people, the Minister will not cut their allowances further.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is alarming that the Minister cannot confirm there will not be cuts in this area in the budget.  The EU-IMF-ECB troika requires that there be "reforms" — as they are euphemistically called — in the social welfare system.  Has the troika commented or made any specific demands concerning carer's allowance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot of politics is being played with this issue.  The Government has of course questioned Fianna Fáil's credentials, and rightly so given that the latter reduced the minimum wage and signed up to the IMF-EU deal which demanded this so-called labour market restructuring.  The Government also has described this Bill as being inadequate, which it is, but that is all politics.  The Government has chosen not to oppose this Bill because it, and its Labour Party component in particular, is on a hook over this issue.  This is because the base of the Labour Party's support in the trade union movement would explode with anger were it to oversee the dismantling or weakening of the JLCs.  Were the Labour Party Members serious when stating they do not intend to oppose this Bill, they would be screaming from the rooftops both to see this Bill proceed beyond Second Stage and to demand the reconvening of the Dáil next week to push through this legislation, imperfect as it is, as a stopgap to protect the workers covered by the JLCs and REAs.  Of course, none of them intend to do this because it is all about simply pushing the issue down the road before the real decisions are made in the autumn.I believe I speak on behalf of low-paid workers who are affected by the JLCs and REAs and who are deeply fearful because their already miserable pay and conditions are under attack when I tell the Government that if it is serious about caring for such workers, it should give Members absolutely cast iron assurances that as a result of the review it is bringing forward, not a single cent will be lost from the incomes of low-paid workers.  Moreover, it should provide assurances that none of the protections enjoyed by low-paid workers now covered by the JLCs or REAs will be taken away from them.  This is the assurance they seek and I note the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has not given to them.  This gives me reason to believe, as both Fine Gael and Labour Party Members are aware, that under the diktats of the EU-IMF, the Government intends to attack these low-paid workers, that is, those who already are the working poor.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Government is not so minded, it should give this assurance now and should do something before the summer to ensure these protections remain in place while all its members go on holidays.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not an expert on fishing by any means.  However, I know the fishing industry is facing a massive crisis and it has been brought to my attention whenever I go to the west and by those fishermen in Dún Laoghaire who are left.  It is a coastal town which used to have a thriving fishing industry.  All the fishermen say that EU fisheries policies have been a disaster for Ireland and this is visibly apparent.  The crisis seems to be intensifying very significantly over recent years, with more people being driven out of fishing while others are struggling to make a living in the industry.I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides in this matter.  There seems to be general agreement on the seriousness and tragedy of this situation.  It is a crime for an island country such as ours that the fishing industry is teetering on the brink of extinction.  It is even more of a crime that this is the case when so many people are unemployed and there is an accelerating depopulation of rural Ireland.  Jobs must be created and, as Deputy Ferris said, the sea is probably our greatest resource.  The sea defines us.  If this country does not have a fishing industry, we will have lost something of what we are as a people.  We are perilously close to losing what defines us.  The fishing industry has provided jobs in the past and could provide many more.As much as I have criticised the Government in other arenas, I commend the jobs initiative on its focus on tourism.  Our attractiveness as a tourism destination would be damaged if fishing, which is one of the things which defines us, were made extinct as a result of the policies of the European Union.  It is obvious that this plan to privatise quotas can only benefit the big fishing interests, the big European states and the multinational companies.  They are responsible for the parlous state of the fish stocks.  It is really a case of the big fish eating the little fish in every sense and this policy will further accelerate that situation and sound the death knell for Irish fishing and the small-time fisherman.  The issue of discards is an obscenity by which perfectly good fish are thrown away.  Something needs to be done about this policy.If the figures given by the Minister are correct, that we only receive 15% of the fish from our own waters, we must say to the EU that this is unacceptable and that we will not put up with it.  What benefit is there in being part of a European Union that is plundering our resources in this way and which has brought us to this state?  This echoes the current economic crisis.  Our so-called partners are supposedly helping us but in fact they are burying us in the interests of big financial and corporate interests in Europe.  We must stand up to these people and we have to defend our fishing industry and small fishermen.  We should oppose this privatisation of fish quotas.  We must work together on an all-party basis to decide how to stand up to these big European interests who just regard our seas as something to be plundered at our expense.
