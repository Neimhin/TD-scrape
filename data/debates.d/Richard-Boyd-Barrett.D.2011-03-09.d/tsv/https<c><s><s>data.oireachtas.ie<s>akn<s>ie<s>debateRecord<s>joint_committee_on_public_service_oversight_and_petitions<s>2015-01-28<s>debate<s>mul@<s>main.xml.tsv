RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will tell the witnesses honestly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that for the entire co-operative?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is 15 chapters done by 15 different groups.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, the witnesses convinced me of their case even before they came in. I am curious about the rationale behind this because it is just bizarre, absurd and shocking as far as I can see. It is bad enough wanting to privatise water and housing let alone privatise community and voluntary services that provide services to approximately 2 million people a year, according to one of the reports. Community and voluntary groups that get a pittance provide services to 2 million of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the country and now they want to privatise it. That is just beyond any sort of belief. I am trying to get my head around it because I am not easily shocked about the privatisation agenda but I was pretty shocked when I heard that.My reaction was to ask how they were planning to make money out of it. I can see how they might try to make money out of it and whatever else they want to sell off and privatise, but who is going to benefit?  I agree with the argument that communities and services will suffer. The entire idea of community and voluntary work will suffer, if it is not eliminated completely. I still do not fully understand the agenda behind it. On the face of it, it strikes me as privatisation and neoliberalism gone completely bonkers. The only commercial interests that I can think of that will benefit are private companies linked with an agenda of dragooning people into labour activation schemes. The mindset is that all of these schemes are a waste of time and run by hippy left-wingers who should be replaced by people who can get tough with disadvantaged communities by dragging them into labour activation schemes. There is no understanding that the schemes support people with serious problems who need the support of caring human beings. Do the delegates think there is a deeper logic to these proposals? Perhaps they might speak about the experience in the United Kingdom where this has already happened to some extent. If I fully understand what they said, we are even more gung-ho in this bizarre neoliberal privatisation experiment than the European Union. Normally the Union pushes us in that direction, but in this case it is pulling back from privatising these services, whereas the Government is pushing forward. Is that the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the delegates speak about the experience in England where problems have emerged with this approach?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The 15 organisations represented by the co-operative receive â‚¬1.3 million between them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the delegates to elaborate on what the organisations do. It is a tiny amount of money when divided between 15 organisations which probably act as the glue holding together some of the most disadvantaged communities in this city by providing an opportunity for people to re-engage with society. They appear to offer incredibly good value for money, but I imagine they are massively under resourced. Perhaps it might be useful to hear about the services they provide in oder that we understand what is at stake.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With how many people do they deal on an annual basis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the organisations were established by people who had a particular concern for these communities and issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They may now be taken over by commercial interests with absolutely no connection with the people or their community.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The official response from the Government is that this is a legal matter related to EU directives, but the delegates have presented evidence supporting their claim that such is not the case. At no point has anybody in the Government come forward to say there is a political rationale behind the proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our job is to smoke out the contradiction.
