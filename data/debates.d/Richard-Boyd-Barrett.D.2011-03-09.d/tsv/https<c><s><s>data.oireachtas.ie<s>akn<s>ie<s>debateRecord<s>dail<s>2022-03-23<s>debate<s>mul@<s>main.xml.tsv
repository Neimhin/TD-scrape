The latest bad news in that regard is the ESRI report that the rate of inflation will hit 8.7% this summer. People's incomes and savings and their ability to pay their bills are being wiped out. In the face of this, the Government and, I stress, other European governments and the American Government, all of which will be meeting in Europe this week, are saying that they are more or less powerless and that there is nothing they can do, even more so now because of the Ukraine war. Is the Minister familiar with the concept of war profiteering? I suggest he, the Government and the EU leaders make themselves familiar with this concept. War profiteering is a disgusting practice whereby ordinary people are asked to endure incredible hardship, financial and otherwise, as a result of war but where private companies and businesses make superprofits at the expense of everybody else's misery, exploiting the crisis and the war. I suggest to the Minister that this is what we are seeing across the world. We are seeing war profiteering on an industrial scale by the producers of fuel and energy and the suppliers of fuel and energy, globally, in Europe and in this country and the bill for that is being picked up in terms of the extreme hardship, energy poverty and so on that people are suffering.  I will give some facts in regard to the profits of these companies. The profits of the French company, TotalEnergies, are up 300% to €16.1 billion; BP's profits have increased to €13 billion, its highest profits in eight years; Shell's profits are up to €19 billion, again the highest in eight years; Chevron Corporation's profits are up to €15 billion; ExxonMobil's profits are up to €23 billion and the profits of Aramco, the Saudi company, are up 124% to €110 billion. This is mirrored in this country with the ESB's profits up 10% to €679 million and Energia's profits up 46% to €35 million. What is the Government going to do about that? While everybody else is being told to suffer, to endure hardship, these energy companies and petrol companies are making a fortune. If the European leaders who are meeting this week in Europe can take unprecedented action to impose sanctions on Putin's bloody regime, could they not take unprecedented action to stop the war profiteering that we are seeing from energy and electricity companies and the producers of petrol and gas across Europe to control the prices such that ordinary people are suffering?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point I am making is that collectively, the Irish Government and the European and American governments do have the power. It is a power that was used during the Second World War, whereby profiteering was stopped and the State took control of energy and other vital supplies in order to control prices. Under the current regime, even if we do develop more renewable energy it will not reduce the prices. I will set out some facts. Europe now produces most of its electricity from renewable resources in Europe and most of our gas comes from Corrib in Ireland. Most of our electricity - over 50% - is produced here but because we have given it over to the control of private companies, they charge what they like. They are profiteering and governments in this country and in Europe choose to do nothing about that. They can impose sanctions but, apparently, they cannot control the profiteering of energy companies in this country and in Europe. I suggest they can but they refuse to do so because, it seems, for this Government and for the governments of Europe, profits come before people.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say we are self-sufficient. I said that the Government has the power to intervene.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We believe the time is right and appropriate to have a referendum to let the people of this country make a decision, which is what this Bill is doing. We want to put our traditional military neutrality, which this and successive Governments have tried to undermine, into the Constitution so it is absolutely guaranteed and secured, and to stop the very concerted push by successive Governments to align us with the NATO military alliance dominated by major imperial powers, namely, the United States, the UK, France, Germany and so on. They are powers that have led barbaric conflicts, most obviously in Iraq in 2003, which claimed the lives of 1 million people. In Afghanistan, tens of thousands of people were killed. The leading powers of NATO continue to arm Saudi Arabia in an EU-UK supported war in Yemen that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation. These powers dominate NATO and we should have absolutely nothing to do with them, especially in the face of Putin's brutal imperialistic war. If we are rightly horrified by an imperialist war being waged by Putin, with devastating consequences for the people of Europe and Ukraine, then, surely, we must take a lesson from that.We have to stand against all warmongering, all imperialism and all military alliances that are about controlling other people’s lands and resources, shoring up spheres of influence and spending billions on weapons to kill people. Surely this is the most important time to reassert our neutrality. That does not mean being indifferent. It means remembering where James Connolly and the people who helped found this State stood when they fought to establish this State against the brutality of the British Empire and the brutality of the First World War. We should uphold that tradition. This Bill seeks to ensure that we do that by inserting it into the Constitution.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this group of amendments. I am not on that committee so I was not part of that discussion, but fair points have been made. It really is quite extraordinary that the CIF would be the body to house the register of building providers. This is an attempt or effort at regulation of an industry that has failed so badly in many respects, including the health and safety of workers, bogus self-employment, desperate defects such as fire safety, mica, pyrite and you name it, all of which has cost the State an absolute fortune. It has cost the lives of building workers, it has caused misery for homeowners and it has resulted in buildings that are fire hazards for those who live in them. One could just go through the list. It is extraordinary that the body in control of that industry, that allowed this sort of stuff to happen, and that represents builders and developers, is going to house the register. It seems to me absolutely amazing that they would have the right to appoint five members to the board. I take the Minister of State's point that consideration is being given to amending this when the Bill is before the Seanad to give greater representation to others, but I am not sure why this cannot be done here in response to the amendments that have been tabled by Deputies Ó Broin, Nash, and O'Callaghan. It is completely unacceptable but it also appears to run afoul of another provision of the Bill that states the body chosen by the Minister to house the register - or whatever phrase is used in the Bill - cannot be "a body that promotes a political cause". The CIF promotes political causes. It is constantly promoting political causes. It is lobbying for the industry all of the time. It lobbied against Covid restrictions, for example, at particular points in time. It is constantly lobbying in the interests of its members in what is self-evidently a political form of lobbying. Deputy Barry quips behind me that it is the "industrial wing of Fianna Fáil". Whether that is true or not, it is certainly a credible point. In all seriousness, if we are to exclude bodies that campaign for political causes then that would exclude the Construction Industry Federation, to my mind. It absolutely excludes them. There is a contradiction in the legislation from that point of view. Any serious definition of bodies that promote particular political causes would absolutely include the CIF, which is one of the most active bodies in campaigning and lobbying for its particular members to affect politics and affect public policy. I just wanted to add this point, if had not already been made. The Government must seriously rethink this. Those who control the industry should not be the ones charged with regulating it.
