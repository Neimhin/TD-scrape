RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are still not getting clarification from the Minister, even though others and I have been asking for a long time about the fate of accident and emergency services in places such as Loughlinstown, Bantry, Mallow, Navan, Dundalk, Ennis, Portlaoise and Nenagh and whether they will be downgraded, as mooted,  a move I would consider to be utterly unacceptable.  Can we have clarity as to when these decisions will be made and we will be informed?The Minister spoke about the reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys and the new target that they would only be waiting six hours either to be admitted or discharged.  Are these claims of success belied by the fact that in the first four months of the year 26,000 patients had to wait on trolleys?  The reason there has been a reduction in the number is that the Minister is packing trolleys and beds into wards and essentially causing overcapacity.  The real problem is that he is refusing to reopen the 2,000 beds which have been closed in the system and provide the necessary staff.  He seems to be considering closing accident and emergency services in smaller hospitals.  However, this does not add up.  He cannot seriously suggest he is going to improve the position when the bottom line is that 2,000 beds have been closed, there are not enough staff and he is planning to close or downgrade accident and emergency services in a number of hospitals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is what has disempowered the front line not the fact that it has been massacred in terms of numbers?  Some 5,000 nurses and midwives have been lost from the system.  Some 2,000 have been lost in the past year and, as I said, 2,400 beds have been closed.  The front-line workers and the INMO and other organisations are saying that is the problem the Minister needs to address.The target of six hours from registration to either discharge or admission seems utterly fantastic given the backdrop of cuts being imposed on staff and beds and the fact not even the nine hour target has been met.  The HSE performance report shows not a single hospital in the health service has met the nine hour target, never mind the six hour target.  Is it all a question of bandying figures, indicating targets that are unrealistic and massaging the trolley figures by simply packing too many trolleys and beds into wards that do not have sufficient capacity or staff?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not untrue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Taoiseach was not suggesting applicants for domiciliary care allowance were making fraudulent claims.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be an outrageous thing to suggest.Since the Government introduced the hated and unjust household charge, there has been an unprecedented campaign of mass boycott and resistance to this attempt to impose further unjust austerity on ordinary people.  Last week even the IMF had to acknowledge the scale of the popular campaign of opposition to the hated household charge and suggest the Government address issues of fairness in its policies.  At the weekend even Labour Party backbenchers started to get the jitters when they heard the outrageous suggestion the Government was thinking of circumventing the boycott campaign by taking the successor property tax directly from people's pay packets through the PAYE system.  This suggestion blows apart the Government claim that the planned property charge has anything to do with equity or fairness.  It is just another tax on workers.Why does the Taoiseach not admit that the Government's efforts to impose household charges and property taxes on ordinary working people are a shambles?  They are not wanted by the people, are unjust and should be completely abandoned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 18 July, the last sitting day of the Dáil before the summer recess, a national demonstration called for by the campaign against household and water charges will take place at Leinster House.  Why does the Taoiseach not save thousands of ordinary people the trouble of buying bus and train tickets to Dublin on that date by telling them he is abandoning the household charge or any property charge aimed at low and middle income families?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When laws are unjust, as people such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King understood very well-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----it is justified and legitimate to resist such unjust laws.  Hundreds of thousands of ordinary working people and families in this country have been unable or unwilling to pay the household charge because they are crippled by austerity and understand the injustice of such a charge when multimillionaires are asked-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to pay only the same amount as people who are on social welfare or on low and middle incomes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Taoiseach not address the substantial issue raised by the huge popular boycott of the household charge?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is now acknowledged by the IMF that ordinary people cannot and should not have to take any more pain of this unjust kind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Taoiseach not accept that the household charge was wrong and that property charges that are levied on ordinary working people are unfair?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Instead, such taxes should be levied on high income earners-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----those earning more than €100,000 or on multimillionaires, not on working people who are already crucified with the austerity the Government and the previous Government have imposed on them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even it understood that it was unfair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about all the interest on the debt?
