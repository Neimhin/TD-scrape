RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The context for this hearing is the sense of outrage people who have been hit with property taxes and are soon to be hit with water charges feel when they hear money they would expect to go to fix leaking water pipes, provide reservoirs and improve water quality, may be going to line the pockets of highly-paid consultants and executives in Irish Water.  Furthermore, our Government was trying to cover up that fact over the last year.  Having listened to the Irish Water representatives, my fears are not allayed on any of those questions.  Who knew what, when and where?  Did Mr. Tierney know parliamentary questions had been asked when they were asked, along the lines of what has been asked today and on which we finally got answers today?  Is he surprised that last week, Government representatives, including the line Minister, Deputy O'Dowd, and the Tánaiste, expressed surprise about the amount that was spent on consultants, while he is telling us they knew?  Ordinary members of the public, and I as a public representative, are confused at how Mr. Tierney can tell us they knew while last week they said they were surprised.  We need clarity.  Mr. Tierney has given us the answer, that they knew but were not telling us.  Therefore, their expressions of surprise last week were fake.  They were fooling the public last week when they said they were surprised.  They were not surprised because they knew.  That appears to be what Mr. Tierney is telling us.  Is all the money that is being pumped into Irish Water in the form of home taxes, and soon to be water charges, going to line the pockets of consultants and highly-paid executives?  The figures are extraordinary: €44 million to IBM.  The Irish Water representatives have tried today to convince us that this is money well spent.  They would want to do something special to justify €44 million to IBM or €17 million to KPMG.  How many pipes were fixed for this money?  What is the percentage improvement in the amount of water leaking out of the system for the money that was given to IBM, Accenture, KPMG and Ernst and Young?  Not one iota of water has been saved as a result of that expenditure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the question.  How much water has been conserved as a result of that expenditure?  It all relates to billing and charges.  If we did not have water charges, and consequently did not have the requirement to install meters to monitor how much water people are using, how much of this expenditure would have been necessary?  Is the vast majority of this expenditure about billing and charging rather than about building reservoirs, fixing water pipes, ensuring water quality, and the issues people are concerned about?  Can the Irish Water representatives convince us that there will be real, meaningful savings?  Mr. Tierney has told us he gets €200,000 per year.  In the semi-State sector there is a pay cap.  He was paid less when he was city manager for Dublin City Council.  His pay has gone up.  How many extra executives who are not subject to the normal public sector pay caps have been employed as a result of the establishment of Irish Water?  If those executive positions on salaries higher than if they were working on local authorities is indicative of so-called savings, it does not add up.  We are paying more to do things previously done by local authorities.  I do not mean to personalise it, but that is what ordinary people are thinking.  They are going to pay charges and the guy at the head of the company who will impose those charges on them is getting paid more than when he was in the local authorities.  That is how ordinary people feel.  They do not understand how Mr. Tierney is being paid more while they are being charged and ordinary workers in the public sector have had their wages slashed.  Are we creating and paying for a big, expensive bureaucracy to charge people which is doing nothing for the water infrastructure of this country?  If I understand Mr. Tierney, last year Irish Water spent €50 million on consultants from a total spend of €100 million.  By the end of the programme it will be €180 million and €80 million on consultants.  More will be spent on consultants and set-up charges, and that does not even include the metering.  This is all about office systems, IT software, billing, charging and bureaucracy.  What the hell are these people doing for us?  The issue is the taking over of €11 billion worth of assets that were not functioning well.  It does not seem to me that establishing offices and software systems, and all the rest on which Irish Water has spent enormous amounts of money, addresses any of the key issues that face that water infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not quite what I asked.  I shall repeat my first question.  Was Uisce Éireann aware that parliamentary questions had been asked?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	None of the €100 million referred to went towards fixing the infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are none the wiser about whether we got value for money.  Let me give one example of the large figure of €44 million that was paid to IBM.  That figure left me scratching my head and wondering how many people got a big whack of money in their pocket and what did we get.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must take Mr. Tierney's word that it is money well spent.  Can Mr. Tierney understand why people are not terribly trusting when it comes to matters like this one?  Let me refer to the article published by The Irish Times but I shall not go into the company's role in the matter.  I understand that a lot of what happened with RPS predated the company's involvement in the Poolbeg project.  It is more alarming that RPS was contracted for €8 million but the project cost €32 million and we will probably not have an incinerator.  While I am glad that we do not have an incinerator I am left with the following question.  Where did all of the money go?  It went into the pockets of the RPS guys, its consultants, spin doctors and management people.  No matter what they did one is left with a few questions.  Where did all of the money go?  How did costs overrun by so much? Can people be trusted to manage projects and deal with the enormously valuable asset that is water?  Is there any reason Uisce Éireann appointed two former senior RPS executives to the board of Irish Water given the poor role that it played in the Poolbeg project?   
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one last question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Other Members have done so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure they were for good reason.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many new staff will be employed in Irish Water as against people on secondment?
