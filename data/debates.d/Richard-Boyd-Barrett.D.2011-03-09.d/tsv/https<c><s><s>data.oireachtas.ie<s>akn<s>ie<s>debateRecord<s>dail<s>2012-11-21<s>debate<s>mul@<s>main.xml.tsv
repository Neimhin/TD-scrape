RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, there was great fanfare about the appointment of Ireland to the United Nations Human Rights Council. It is ironic that this country should be appointed as an international guardian of human rights when in the week since that appointment the Government has failed so utterly to uphold the rights of vulnerable citizens and their families, both in this country and abroad. The Government has failed in its duty to uphold the rights of a young pregnant woman, the late Ms Halappanavar, to choose an abortion when she begged for one with tragic consequences. The Government has failed to provide the independent public inquiry for which her family has asked repeatedly to investigate her death. The Government has failed to speak out about the rights of young children and their families who are being massacred by Israeli missiles and artillery fire in Gaza as we speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has failed to vindicate the rights of children with special needs and families affected by disability who are marching on the Dáil today. It has failed to protect the rights of the elderly-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----whose representatives delivered a petition here yesterday begging for an end to the cuts being imposed on the vulnerable and elderly citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach do the job that he was appointed to do in the United Nations and vindicate the rights of women to choose their own fate? Will he vindicate the rights of children in Gaza not to be massacred by Israeli weapons? Will he vindicate the rights of the disabled, those with special needs and the elderly in our society so that we can truly deserve this appointment as a guardian of international human rights?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about human rights, very simple.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I only stated facts. There may be grey areas, including who's, why's and wherefores, concerning the death of Savita Halappanavar, but Praveen Halappanavar's word about one fact is good enough for me. For three days, Savita Halappanavar asked for an abortion and she was denied her right to that abortion. The word of families who are on the streets today with children with special needs or affected by disability is good enough for me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is something wrong if their rights are not being vindicated. In addition, children have been massacred in Gaza, like the al-Dallu family whose four young children were killed during the week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Taoiseach going to do to vindicate those rights? They are the rights of women, like Savita Halappanavar, to choose their own fate when they are pregnant, the rights of young children in Gaza not to be massacred by Israeli weapons, the rights of the elderly, the disabled and those with special needs to live a dignified existence and not have their lives degraded by brutal and unjust austerity cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question was about human rights.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The human rights of women and children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to raise two points, both of which require the Government to develop spine and backbone to speak up for the citizens of the country and citizens elsewhere who are suffering because of the failed policies of the European Union and the failed policies of the major Western powers. The Tánaiste has done everything to demonstrate to Europe that we are the best boys, that we will obey diktats and inflict the most cruel and unjust austerity our citizens.In return for doing that the Government has got nothing from them. They must be laughing up their sleeves at us. The more we submit to their diktats and accept this cruelly unjust policy of loading the debts of bankers and speculators onto the backs of working people and the vulnerable sectors of our society, the more they keep ramming this injustice and austerity down our throats. The people cannot take any more.  People are demonstrating on the streets today about disability and special needs services. People were on the streets yesterday demonstrating about cuts to services to the elderly. Tens of thousands of people will be on the streets on Saturday next to protest against all the cuts that are being imposed on working people, the unemployed and the vulnerable. Austerity is not working. The pain is too great. We need to show a bit of backbone. We need to say we are not paying their debts any longer and that we are not paying €9 billion in interest on debts next year. If we did that we would not have a deficit of €15 billion. We would have a deficit of €6 billion and we could fix that by taxing wealth, the corporations and the elites, and get our economy back on track. That is what I suggest we say to them. What is happening in Gaza? It is depressing in the extreme to hear the Tánaiste recycle the lies of the Israeli Government in explaining how this conflict took off. The Tánaiste referred to the latest round of violence which, he said, was triggered by sustained rocket attacks on towns in Israel. It was not triggered by sustained rocket attacks on Israel. It was triggered on 8 November when a 13 year old Palestinian boy, Ahmad Abu Daqqa was playing football in the fields of Gaza and was killed by the Israelis. That triggered a response. Even after this a truce was agreed by Hamas on 12 November. That truce was broken when Israel launched an attack on 14 November. This is a cynical move by the Israeli Government to get votes in the forthcoming election by killing Palestinians. That is not acceptable.  When are we going to speak up against the rogue state that is Israel and which is crushing the Palestinian people with a siege and with constant military incursions, persecution and oppression?  While the Tánaiste may not accept my view on this I have a letter from the deputy speaker of the Gaza Legislative Council, Dr. Ahmad Bahar. He is asking that a delegation from the Gaza Legislative Council would come to this Parliament between 20 and 24 January next. Would the Government agree to allow a delegation come here so that we can hear the other side of the story, which the world is not hearing, from the elected representatives of the people of Gaza?
