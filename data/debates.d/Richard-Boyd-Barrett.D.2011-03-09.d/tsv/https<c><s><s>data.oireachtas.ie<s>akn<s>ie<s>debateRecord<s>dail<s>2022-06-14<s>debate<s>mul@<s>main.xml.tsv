RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the schedule, there is a proposal to approve Ireland's further participation in the PESCO military project without debate. Some of us believe that PESCO is putting in place the basis for a European army and that the Government is waging a very sustained attack on our neutrality, most recently expressed by the Taoiseach claiming we do not need a referendum to join NATO. There is, of course, a very sustained call from NATO to increase military expenditure across the EU. Now we have a proposal to move from Ireland's current involvement in one PESCO project to an additional four PESCO projects, further involving Ireland in arrangements with the European militarisation project and with NATO, with non-EU forces and their military projects, as one of the projects suggests. At the very minimum, this should be debated in the Dáil because some of us are going to fight to the death to prevent the Government from destroying Ireland's neutrality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We welcome the Taoiseach's welcome for our welcome.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not doing a very good job.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find it interesting that the Taoiseach met with the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine as she was on the way to the International Monetary Fund, IMF. People Before Profit-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I referred to the IMF, which the Taoiseach might possibly have heard of.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry. My apologies. Prime Minister Shmyhal was going to the IMF to seek financial assistance. Since the beginning of this, People Before Profit has been saying that we should support the calls for a unilateral cancellation of Ukrainian debt. It would make a significant difference to the ability of Ukrainians to restore and rebuild their country, which has been shattered by Putin's bloody war. Yet the Taoiseach and all the major powers that claim they are such great supporters of the Ukrainian people have resisted the call for cancellation of Ukrainian debt, just like the IMF has previously resisted the cancellation of the debts of many impoverished and war-devastated countries in Africa, the Middle East and so on. It seems that support for the international financial system is more important to the Taoiseach's Government and other western governments than actually assisting the Ukrainian people in their hour of need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Within days of Putin's bloody and inexcusable invasion of Ukraine, the Taoiseach, along with other European leaders, demanded that Putin and his regime become outcasts in the international community and have argued for boycott, sanctions and divestment of Putin's regime for his horrible crimes. Yet the Taoiseach has reported that he met the Israeli President and continues with normal economic, political and diplomatic relations with the state of Israel, which refused a European parliamentary delegation entry to Palestinian territory. The UN special rapporteur for the Middle East, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and B'Tselem all recently condemned the state of Israel for ongoing systematic crimes against humanity. A siege against Gaza has gone on for a decade and has brought the entirety of Gaza into "a permanent humanitarian crisis". Yet, there is no call for sanctions, a boycott or divestment but just business as usual with the state of Israel. Could the Taoiseach please explain these extraordinary double standards? There has been no sanction at all against Israel, and even when the most respected international human rights organisations in the world are saying there should be targeted sanctions, he resists. I ask the Taoiseach please to explain it, because the double standards are shocking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a double standard. The Taoiseach would not meet Putin but he meets the Israelis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The suffering of Palestinians is less important.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a moral equivalence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Israelis have done that to Gaza as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No sanctions - ever.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So have the Israelis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the Taoiseach think the siege of Gaza is except a weaponisation of food?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No sanctions - never.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just against all brutality; I am not selective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is selective in his condemnation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Saudi regime. The Government supports it all right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two years ago, the National Economic and Social Council produced a report in which it described Ireland’s housing sector as completely dysfunctional. It stated that this could be addressed by policy intervention by the Government and by structuring permanent affordability into the housing sector. Since then, the situation has got worse, not better. By the way, our housing costs are so far ahead of those of the rest of Europe, on average, that for the Taoiseach to suggest that this has to do with the Ukrainian war, or anything like it, is just ridiculous. It is part of the cost-of-living crisis, one of the biggest parts of it, and that is down to the Government’s policy failure, identified as recently as two years ago by the National Economic and Social Council. One aspect of this is that because the Government refused to raise the income thresholds on eligibility for social housing and social housing support in those two years, thousands of people have lost their entitlement to social housing and social housing support and some of them are homeless. When will the Government raise those income threshold limits and restore the time that has been lost to the people on the housing list?
