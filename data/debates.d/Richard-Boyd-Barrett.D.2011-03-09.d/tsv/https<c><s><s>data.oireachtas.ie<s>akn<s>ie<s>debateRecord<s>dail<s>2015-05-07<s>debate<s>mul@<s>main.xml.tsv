RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is doing its level best to trumpet and spin a supposed give-back to workers in the coming budget. My question seeks to put any so-called give-back in the context of how much workers and ordinary citizens have actually lost since 2008 on the various austerity taxes and charges, be it the local property tax, LPT, the universal social charge, USC, the pension levy or the household tax. What are the annual and total figures for all of these austerity charges and taxes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since 2011, up to €13 billion has been raised through the USC, €2 billion through the pension levy and close to €1 billion through the property tax. This has been an enormous gouging of moneys from the pockets of workers over recent years. We were told the property tax would improve local services. The USC was to be a social charge, while we discovered that the pension levy was not a pension levy at all. Essentially, for all that was gouged out of people’s pockets, we got fewer services as well as cuts to remaining ones. What will the Minister do to make up for this fantastic gouging from the pockets of ordinary people over recent years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is right that I and others have been raising these issues for the past several years. It is useful, however, to see what the totals are and how much has been taken from the pockets of people who had no responsibility for the economic crisis. What have they got back for it? Nothing. That puts into context what the Minister claims he will give back to them. Another point I repeatedly make to the Minister, but one to which he never responds, is this. How is it that workers have lost €14 billion as a result of the austerity charges and taxes while, coincidentally, the super-rich in society have gained about the same amount of money? This is according to The Sunday Times rich list, as well as the wealth distribution figures produced by TASC, Credit Suisse and Social Justice Ireland. How is it that what has been taken from the pockets of the working people has managed to end up in the pockets of the super-rich?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give us a break. Are those who speculate on the Stock Exchange workers too? I do not think so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. The super-rich did not. Denis O’Brien did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the millionaires?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish he would answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is The Sunday Times rich list a load of nonsense? Does Denis O’Brien not have all that money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If Europe is supposed to mean anything, it should be about international solidarity among the peoples of Europe and creating a beacon of progress and an agency of peace in the world. However, that is not what the EU looks like today. We have war in Ukraine, in which Europe has a hand, hundreds of people desperately trying to get into Europe to escape terrible situations in the developing world and losing their lives in the Mediterranean, and cruel austerity inflicted for the past seven years at the behest of the people who seem to really run Europe - the bankers, bondholders and money men. They are inflicting really vicious austerity on the ordinary citizens of Europe, to the point at which the EU is threatened with a break-up. This is what we are looking at with the possibility that the general election in the UK could lead to the possible exit of that country from the EU. There is also the very precarious situation in Greece, which could be forced out of the EU because of the really bloody-minded and vindictive attitude of the European authorities, and, behind them, the ECB and the financial markets in Europe, which find it acceptable to sacrifice the livelihoods, services, dignity and rights of the people of Greece on the altar of profit and maintaining the international financial system of speculation, banking and so on. Europe is in a very precarious situation, and one can add to that the very alarming rise of neo-fascist organisations in Germany, Greece and France and the rise of the far right in the UK. These are very worrying signs. One can add to that the shameful collaboration of the EU with Israel, which has been given favoured trading status. While Israel crushes the Palestinian people in a most obscene and brutal way, Europe does nothing about it but continues to do business with it. If we want to save the European project, we must remember that human beings come first. Europe must not be a place of money men, bankers, bondholders and people who only see the bottom line. It must be a place that puts the rights and dignity of human beings front and centre, regardless of whether they are human beings trying to enter Europe or ordinary working people across the Europe. If we fail to do that, the EU is riding towards a crisis and a break-up, and the darker possibility of a return to the sort of crises we saw in the 1930s, with all the horrendous consequences that followed from that.We are at a critical crossroads. Is it Europe for people or Europe for profit? Currently, it is Europe for profit and that is a Europe that will not last the distance.
