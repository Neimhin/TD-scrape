RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Professor is saying it is much worse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. I do not always agree with their recommendations but I appreciate the work they do in these engagements. The witnesses identify two key vulnerabilities for us, one external and one domestic. My question is about the external one first. This is the one that is often mentioned but is not thought about much beyond that, namely, the possibility of a significant global downturn or external shock because of what is happening in the global economy. Is it fair to say that the Government is not factoring this into its projections for steady growth over the next period and its generally upbeat story about what is happening in the Irish economy and that it is extreme folly for the Government not to factor in what I consider to be the growing likelihood - the witnesses can say if they agree on this - of a significant external shock? I wish to hear what the witnesses have to say on that but I will outline why I view it as a growing likelihood. First, mainstream people are saying it. My young nephew who is in my Dáil office did some research for me today and he picked out some examples of this. Willem Buiter of Citigroup, a New York based bank, is warning that it is very likely that China is facing a hard cyclical downturn and that this will have a very significant impact on the rest of the global economy due to falling demand and so forth. Similarly, the IMF has warned of a strong likelihood of a new global recession. Its head has said that the scenario the IMF is depicting does not rely on extreme assumptions at all. In other words, it is saying it is very likely. Frankly, when one looks at what is happening in China, it appears to be almost inevitable that this will happen. All of the money that exited from the banks in Europe and the western economies after 2008, which we bailed out, ran to China. It over-heated the Chinese economy and now China will face a downturn. Is this not almost a racing certainty? In addition, there is a simple historical fact. The recession happened in 2007 and it is now 2015. Can we think of a period in recent history when there has not been a recession at least every eight to ten years? Is it not almost a racing certainty that there will be a shock of some type? We do not know the exact depth of it but it is not factored into the Government's projections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to interrupt but my time is short. I appreciate Mr. Barnes's response, which confirms what my fears are. He clearly echoes those. I note two things in passing. It is not Mr. Barnes's responsibility but we should all learn the folly of bailing out the banks, not just for us but internationally. We gave the moneys back to the banks to go off and speculate somewhere else and it is going to blow back on us. That is a bigger international issue. On the projection side, it is fair to say the downside risk is always mentioned as a "by the way" to cover ourselves, but it is not taken seriously. It is mentioned as a matter of course that there is upward, downward and central, but that picture is changing. The likelihood of the downside risk materialising is now significantly greater than it was when it was mentioned in a perfunctory way three or four years ago. On the domestic side, I find myself again in total agreement with the witnesses. We have been saying for some time that over-reliance on the multinational sector is dangerous. I would be interested to hear from the witnesses what we should do about it. What is the council's role in advising on this? Our view is that we should get as much out of these multinationals as possible now while we can and apply it to the development of our domestic economy. We should invest it in infrastructure that provides a basis and some protection on a medium to long-term basis against the fluctuations, volatility and uncertainties of the global economy, in particular for an open economy like ours. Is that not what we need to start saying? Do we not need to say that we are too reliant on multinationals? My theory for the boost in corporate tax revenues is as follows, and I do not know if the witnesses agree. Microsoft was recently reported to have bought a huge amount of intellectual property from itself in the game of one subsidiary moving rights and patents from another to avoid tax. I understand that it bought an incredible €1.5 billion worth of intellectual property from itself which means the charging being done previously to subsidiaries in tax havens is now being done here. Some of the profits will be allocated here that were previously allocated elsewhere and that relates to the closing off of the double Irish and the opening up of the knowledge box. It is done precisely in order to benefit in the longer term from the knowledge box and to keep down the tax liability. That is my theory. What must we do and what should we be saying about insulating ourselves from the vulnerability that arises from an over-reliance on the multinational sector? Is it not about investing in our own domestic industrial and infrastructural capacity and so on? My last question flows from the above. An area of this which is macro in scale as well as a very immediate social problem is the housing market, about which I have spoken to the council on a number of occasions. This is now a big problem. Some of us have been warning about it for a couple of years. I read a very interesting article in The Irish Times today which acknowledges that the hope that the private sector would deliver the housing we need is not materialising. In fact, the article explains quite well why that is not the case. I will quote it briefly:A difficult dynamic of recent years is that very little land in Ireland is owned by developers, instead it’s owned by international funds, receivers, and private equity. Most of the multi-unit planning permissions of recent times have been run through by receivers and banks simply trying to add value to assets they already held, with no intention of ever building houses. Project Clear and Nama among others have been a big driver of planning permission applications and renewals and this is now moving towards a natural end.Ultimately, the article continues, this land has to get into the hands of capitalised builders or, I might add, the State before houses will be built. The people who bought up all the land and assets have no intention of building. They are just inflating the value of their assets. The private sector does not have the capacity or the will to do it and we have a major problem as a result, including a major social crisis. It will also be a macro-economic problem. If people do not have anywhere to live, it will put upward pressures on pay demands and choke off investment. Who wants to come to a place nobody can afford to live in? This is a developing global problem. I would be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say about it. The answer is for the State to marshal more resources to itself. It must increase taxes on capital and on those who hold all that wealth and those assets to invest them in key strategic areas of the economy. If we do not do that, we will be riding for a big crash.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I cut across Dr. Conefrey? The cautious approach partly concerns identifying the revenue sources. However, is it not also a question of determining what the money should be spent on, considering the view that we need to increase capital investment in infrastructure and domestic industrial and enterprise capacity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is true here also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we come back in again? Is the Chair trying to get rid of us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the public might be mixed on that one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The delegates seem to be saying it was what the Government was doing until it went on a splurge with the extra €2 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our resentment in our initial engagements towards the IFAC was that the demand for balancing the books came against a background where they had become unbalanced by the activities of others in circumstances where the can in respect of getting revenue and expenditure back to balance was being carried by those who, by and large, had not put them out of balance or who had not made the decisions. However, anybody who is sane should subscribe to the principle that one should spend what one can raise. Indeed, it raises the question, is there any such thing as good borrowing. Who was it who said, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions. The IFAC has said that it is imprudent to spend money the origins of which are uncertain. There is this unexplained jump in corporate tax revenue which was not in the initial budget projections and it would be unwise to merely go on a splurge and spend it. The IFAC has said that the Government is imprudent in this regard. Would it be less imprudent to spend it if one knew that the expenditure was guaranteed to give one back revenue and the spending, if you like, would wash its own face in the medium to long term so that there is not a risk associated with the expenditure? The reason I ask relates to my second question in respect of housing and the financing of housing, which I have already touched on but the importance of which I cannot overemphasise. It is often said - but we do not think through the implications - that the question of housing and the financing of housing is at the centre of the economic crisis, domestically and internationally. Buying a house is the biggest expenditure that anybody ever has in his or her life. On an ongoing basis, it is the biggest investment. It is central. It links to so many different matters. Is it a serious risk if the State is vulnerable to the volatility of the financing of an essential sector? I highlight for the IFAC this danger of which it should be aware. The vast majority of the Government's housing strategy, even in its social housing provision, is dependent on outsourcing to the private sector. The State will have to pay for that. It is money out - in the form of leasing arrangements, rent allowances, etc. - that will not come back in. The cost is running at approximately €1 billion per year. If property prices and rents continue to rise, the State could be in a really serious position. Is it not, to use the IFAC's word, "prudent" to reduce our risk in that regard? The way in which we would do that is to have a bigger stock of State housing which generates revenue. That would not be money out, it would be investment which guarantees money coming back in. There would be less current expenditure than there is at present. Through upfront capital investment for which we could use this €2 billion we would reduce the current expenditure going out on the private sector that is just money literally going out the door. Would that be prudent because there is no risk associated with it? The rents will come back, if the State builds this housing. I say that because one of the features of a more stable period of the world economy was in the post-war era when there was a much bigger stock of state housing across the western world. At certain times in Ireland, 40% to 50% of all housing would have been provide by the State and that created stability at the centre of the economy. Now the State provides less than 5% and its stock of housing is much reduced compared to what it was at that period of much greater stability. Is this something that we need to consider and that must be a much bigger feature of the IFAC's analysis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That increases borrowing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is still spending money one does not have, if Mr. Tutty does not mind me saying so.
