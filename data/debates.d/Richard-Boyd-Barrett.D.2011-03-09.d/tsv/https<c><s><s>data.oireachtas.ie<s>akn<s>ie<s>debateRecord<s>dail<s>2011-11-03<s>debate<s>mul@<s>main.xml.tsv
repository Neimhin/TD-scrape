RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Large numbers of people were badly affected by the flooding that occurred on Monday, 24 October.  Many of these individuals are repeat victims of flooding.  In Blackrock, which is in the constituency the TÃ¡naiste and I represent, I met people whose houses have been flooded and badly damaged for the umpteenth time as a result of the Maretimo Stream overflowing.  Is legislation being brought forward in respect of compensation for flood victims, particularly those who cannot take out insurance as a result of the fact that their properties were flooded on previous occasions?  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, has indicated that the Government is giving consideration to providing assistance to families who have been affected by flooding.  Will the Government be bringing forward legislation or proposals in respect of providing assistance, compensation and support to the many families that have been affected by flooding?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a timeline in respect of this matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Children First guidelines were first published in 1999, 12 years ago, yet they are still not on a statutory footing.  That understandably leads people to be anxious about the commitment of the Government to put them on a statutory footing.  Notwithstanding the commitments the Minister is making about them being effectively implemented in many areas, the whole point of putting them on a statutory footing is that the State and its agencies are held legally accountable for ensuring that children are put first.  In that context, the delay is worrying.The State has failed abused children.  We have a very high level of child poverty, as recent figures have indicated.  Faced with an austerity budget in December which may impact on precisely the resources and supports that exist for children, is the delay in introducing the Children First guidelines after the budget due to the Government's intention to make cuts which will impact on our ability to put children first?  Is the Minister going to be child proofing the budget?  Will this be part of the budgetary process?  The implementation of the Children First guidelines will be a key criterion and parameter over which the Government's budgetary constraints and need for austerity will not be allowed to pass.  Will this be a red line?  Will any cuts that impact negatively on children be offside?
