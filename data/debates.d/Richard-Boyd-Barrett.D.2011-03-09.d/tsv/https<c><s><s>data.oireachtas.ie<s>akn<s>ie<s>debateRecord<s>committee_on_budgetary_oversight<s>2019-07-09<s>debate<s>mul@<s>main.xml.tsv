RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from the previous set of questions, the key issue is that the extra money required for the national children's hospital has, if I understand Mr. Desmond correctly, delayed the publication of the capital plan. Presumably, that is because it impacts on other parts of that plan and the Department is trying to figure out how much extra money it will get from the Government and then cover the shortfall. Consequently, the Department is trying to figure out how it will impact on other capital projects. Am I right? If it will have such an impact, will Mr. Desmond indicate what projects will be affected?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that. Will the extra money required for the children's hospital impact on the timeline of other capital projects? Will it delay them? For example, Deputy Br√≠d Smith asked me about the Drimnagh primary care centre which has been due since June 2009. People in Drimnagh are wondering what the position is with it. Will the overspend on the national children's hospital impact on that and the timeline for the delivery of other such capital projects?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If Mr. Desmond does not mind me saying, that is a politician's answer. His unwillingness to answer the question seems to give away that the children's hospital overrun will impact on the timeline for the delivery of other capital projects.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I gave an example. The Drimnagh primary care centre is a capital project.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not cover the whole shortfall and, therefore, the timelines for other capital projects had to be changed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point. I read from what has Mr. Mulvany said that the reason for the delays has been the need to change the timelines for the delivery of other projects because of the children's hospital. I will ask one specific question about the children's hospital. Who made the decision that there should be a private section to the national children's hospital? Given the Government commitment to universality and removing private practice from public hospitals, who made that decision? Will Mr. Desmond tell us about the economics of it? How much did it cost to put in a private section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extraordinary that a state-of-the-art hospital which is pointing towards the future of healthcare in this country will have a private section when there is a Government commitment to have universality and eliminate the two-tier system. A brand-new hospital will have two tiers for ever and a day. I do not accept the contract argument. Will Mr. Mulvany clarify whether that means the HSE had no role whatever in a decision about whether there should be a private part to the national children's hospital? Could the HSE not have simply told paediatricians who wanted to work in that hospital that the only jobs available in it are public-only contracts?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are new contracts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked how much it will cost. We need to know how much public money it is costing to have a two-tier system. It has budgetary implications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The contracts of the consultants also have budgetary implications. In the existing hospitals where there are existing contracts, one can make that argument but I do not see how one can make that argument about new contracts. Surely there will be new contracts for the consultants in the national children's hospital.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one more question. I would like to know if there will be new contracts.If there are to be new contracts, we would have the power to stipulate public-only contracts. We would not have to have it in a two-tier form. I would appreciate if Mr. Mulvany could get back to us on that.  The HSE does not want to call them cutbacks because of the impact of the deficit. When talking about the savings that may be necessary, they are referred to as "interventions". That is a nice euphemism for cuts. The interventions to deal with the deficit of staffing and savings will be in the areas where most of the overruns occur, which are listed as disability services, acute hospitals, the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and overseas treatments. Is that correct? Are those the areas in which the interventions, which the HSE does not want to call cuts, will take place in order to meet the deficit? Will that not inevitably worsen the situation for patients in those areas?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If somebody is entitled to something and they are given it but they are not given it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On reflection, I would like Mr. Mulvany to clarify one point in regard to the private part of the children's hospital. The HSE provides the money for the national children's hospital. Is Mr. Mulvany saying that although the HSE provides the money, it has no idea what is going into the hospital?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not say this is what we want. I am trying to get my head around the fact that if the HSE provides the money, surely it says what sort of hospital it wants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that context, did it say it wanted a public and private part, or did the people it gave the money to make that decision?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just trying to understand the connections between the funding and what that funding delivers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see how it is outside the area to ask what is the connection between the funding and the thing that it funds.Is that not a reasonable question about funding?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have asked the question. Hopefully, the witnesses will revert with the answer. For the record, I was informed after stepping out following our earlier discussion that consultants could change from one contract to another. It is difficult to understand why we would not have discussed with those consultants the fact that we do not want a two-tier system in the national children's hospital.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have to employ them in the hospital if they do not want to play ball. In the case of home care, which was mentioned, is it fair to say that, because of the need in the Government's view to live even more stringently within the budget - more will be done to live within the budget this year than last year - people who need and have been approved for home care packages will not get them? Is that not the truth of it? The allocation of home care packages will not be driven by medical need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will refine my question. When the Department gives the HSE its allocation for 2020 or any year, surely the latter knows that its allocation will not be sufficient to provide a home care package to everyone who is approved. Does it not tell the Department this and that, if the Department wants everyone who needs a package to get one, it will have to allocate more?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Based on estimates of demographic changes, demand, maintaining services and so on, does the HSE not know at the beginning of the year that there will be a deficit at the end of the year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The HSE actually does spend more. That is the deficit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies, but I have to fly. Is that okay?
