RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For some weeks the Government has been promising the famous July stimulus, the details of which we will get soon, with legislation presumably to be discussed next week. Is it not the case that the term "stimulus" is completely a misnomer when what was leaked today and was in the air for the last number of days is that there will not be a stimulus for some of the people on the lowest incomes and some of the people who have been hardest hit by loss of income and unemployment, caused not by any fault of their own but because of the impact of Covid? The plan now is not to stimulate but to slash the payments of people who have lost their jobs and whose incomes have been reduced and to cut progressively the pandemic unemployment payment over the coming months. How is cutting the incomes of people who have lost jobs and incomes a stimulus?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How is that fair to people who have already suffered hardship as a result of the pandemic?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is really not good enough. I will tell the Minister of State who deserves pay rises for their level of responsibility. It is the nurses and the health workers who fought on the front line to protect our health, and the many workers in retail and other essential front-line services, often very low-paid workers, who worked throughout the pandemic. They deserve an increase. The people who do not deserve pay increases are politicians and Ministers. It is shocking and disgusting that Ministers of State on €124,000, about three times the average industrial wage, and about three times what the average nurse would get, are now to get an additional €16,000: Jack Chambers, Hildegarde Naughton and Pippa Hackett. It is extraordinary. Is €124,000 not enough for these people that they have to get an additional €16,000 and this is to be done at the very same time that the Government is planning to cut the pandemic unemployment payment from €350 to €300, and for others down to €250 or €200. Workers who have lost their jobs and incomes through no fault of their own as a result of a pandemic and Government-imposed necessary public health guidelines are to see their incomes slashed where it may be very difficult or impossible for them to return to work, but Ministers of State on €120,000 will receive an additional €16,000. Seriously, it is shocking. Does the Minister of State really think that is the right signal to send out? Does he really think that is just in the current climate when hundreds of thousands of workers in this country face serious hardship and uncertainty or are simply unable to go back to work because of the situation we are in? Will the Minister of State give us a better explanation or justification for that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will support the Minister of State if he gives our nurses and front-line healthcare workers the pay rise they deserve and gets rid of the absolutely shameful pay inequalities suffered by public servants at every level in the public service, where new entrants have to suffer the indignity of working on lower pay than people doing exactly the same job, just because they came in after a certain arbitrary date when austerity was imposed on them. Whatever way the Minister of State cuts it, in the current climate where the Government is talking about cutting the pandemic payments for people who have lost jobs and income as a result of a public health crisis over which they have no control, and then to give junior Ministers a €16,000 increase is, to put it mildly, sending the wrong signals. To put it not so mildly, it is absolutely disgraceful. If the Minister of State wants equality at the Cabinet table perhaps the senior Cabinet Ministers might cut their pay a little to show leadership for people who are suffering out there and are on fractions of the salaries and wages they are on.
