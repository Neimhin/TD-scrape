RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask once again for the Government to allow time for a debate on the disastrous situation and war in Yemen. The Government rightly has moved heaven and earth to debate and set out a response to the disastrous situation in Ukraine but it is stubbornly resistant to discussing the war in Yemen that has claimed more than 300,000 lives and brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation. Does the Government not want this debate because it has trade relations with Saudi Arabia and because the US and the UK are arming the Saudi regime? Is that why it does not want the debate? If that is not the case, will it please allow for a debate on this crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have Private Members' time every six months.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You do not care about the people in Yemen. The Government does not want to embarrass the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I expect sanctions to be imposed on Saudi Arabia and the apartheid State of Israel promptly following that announcement. I will not hold my breath on that, obviously. I again ask about the €1,000 that was promised to healthcare workers. The applause given to those healthcare workers for the work they did during the Covid pandemic - and are still doing - rings hollow now when the Government still has not paid these healthcare workers the €1,000 promised. Community swabbers have contacted us and I asked questions about that. It seems that community swabbers may not be getting this payment. There have been suggestions that phlebotomy nurses will probably not get the €1,000. The Government seems to be penny-pinching and that is why these negotiations are dragging on. The Government is looking for reasons to exclude healthcare workers, every one of whom deserves as an absolute minimum the €1,000 payment that was promised. Why has the Government not paid it and why is it trying to exclude healthcare workers from benefiting from this payment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No answer, in other words.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned Housing for All. Does he not have to accept now that it is failing disastrously? From my clinic, I can tell him about the number of people and families coming in, most of whom are working and who are facing eviction or who are already homeless. They have no prospect of finding rented accommodation under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme or social housing. The numbers are going through the roof. I will give one example. A man, his ill wife and their family of five are facing eviction on 2 April. He is working in one of our Dublin hospitals. I have another young man who works for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and he is living in his car. Another woman, who was previously homeless and is now in a homeless HAP tenancy, is being evicted. The Dublin place finder service cannot find her a place. She will not go to a hostel, so she is going to end up sleeping in her car. Another mother, with two kids, is on the housing list. She works part time and is in receipt of the working family payment. She has been told that she is over the limit for social housing. The list goes on. What does the Taoiseach intend to do for these people who are working but for whom the Government's housing policies have totally failed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is getting worse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach knows, one of the biggest issues in areas of significant deprivation is the impact of drug addiction on individuals, families and communities. I have often heard Government spokespeople pay lip service to the idea that we need to move away from the criminal approach to dealing with this problem and take a health-related approach but, in fact, we have not done that at all. I wonder when we are going to realise that the so-called war on drugs is a disastrous failure and that we need to start to deal with this as a health issue. We cannot bemoan criminal activity if simultaneously the State effectively criminalises huge cohorts of our young population. That is what we are doing and the consequences are a total failure that particularly impacts on the most disadvantaged areas. When are we going to get serious policy change in that area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach think, as I do, that it is time the State issues an apology to all those who are homeless in this country and for whom the State has failed in its duty and obligation to provide the most basic thing, which is affordable, secure housing? The homeless figures are accelerating disastrously once again. Despite all the talk about Housing for All and all the policy measures the Government claims it is taking, the number of people going into homelessness is increasing. There now are more than 2,500 children who are homeless. Are they not owed an apology? They will be marked for life by being in homeless accommodation. Will there be an apology for working people, as I mentioned earlier, who are working in our hospitals, local authorities and in Tusla? I have cited cases in this regard today and on other days. These people cannot, on their earnings, afford the rents that are out there and, in many cases, they are denied social housing support and are in emergency accommodation. I met a council worker last week who is sleeping in his car. He is working for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and is sleeping in his car. This is a disastrous failure by the State to meet its most basic obligations. Does the Taoiseach seriously not think these people deserve an apology from the State for its failure to vindicate their right to secure, affordable housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is failing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nonsense. Many planning permissions are granted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Zero council houses were built last year in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is getting worse again.
