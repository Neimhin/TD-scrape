RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did. As I said yesterday, notwithstanding the Minister's replies the decision to invite these vulture funds, investment vehicles and property speculators into this country, supposedly to assist the housing sector, will, when the history books are written, turn out to be the most disastrous decision ever taken. Frankly, it is the biggest heist on the Irish people and has contributed to one of the worst housing crises we have ever faced. The Minister maintains they are necessary because the State cannot do it all. That was essentially the tenor of his response. He contends that if we do not have them, we will not have the capital. I still completely fail to see what benefit they have added. We are talking about the big investment firms, wealth asset management companies or whatever they like to call themselves. What they deliver is mostly apartments nobody can afford. These are developments where the rents or prices are absolutely astronomical and completely beyond the reach of the vast majority of people. Take Cherrywood for example. I think €15 million from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, went into putting in the infrastructure there. It is one of the biggest residential developments in the State, if not the biggest. Years on from that we still do not know what affordable housing we are going to get back in Cherrywood. We are getting nothing from these people. What we do get, we get at a vast cost, far in excess of anything we would have paid if we had provided this directly on lands, taking Cherrywood as an example, which we actually had in our possession. These were NAMA lands. We gave them to the funds. They built completely overpriced stuff. They lease a little bit back to us at astronomical cost. We still do not know how much affordable housing we are going to get and the stuff they are selling or renting on the open market will be completely beyond affordable for the vast majority of people. Where is the benefit from this? There is none. They control the market and charge astronomical rents. I will give another example. It is one I have been banging on about for four years. It is a multi-unit complex across the road from me. It was originally bought out by Apollo Global Management, a wealth asset management company based in the US. Its first move was to try to increase the rent by 60%. Its next move was to try to mass-evict everybody in the place when it could not get away with that. Then it flipped the complex to another vulture fund, a domestic one, which has now succeeded in mass-evicting the tenants. That fund has left quite a lot of the property empty because it has slowly and through attrition driven out the tenants. It has sat on those empty properties, of which there are now 13, for more than two years. Other tenants, all of whom paid their rent and who have lived there for years are all being driven out, facing homelessness and so on. What is the fund doing? It is driving up the value of the asset. Then when it shifts the asset without the tenants - the only way it could finally shift the tenants and mass-evict them was by saying it was on grounds of sale - the value of that complex will have increased. The new owner will now be able to charge rents far in excess of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, increases. There will be no tax paid on the capital gain made on that flipping of a property and tax paid on the rental revenue derived from the fund being able to charge absolutely extortionate rent which has, by the way, resulted in people knocking on the door of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and saying they are homeless. These are good, decent, ordinary working people. That is what this is facilitating. The Minister said there is no alternative to that. I can think of one example. The credit unions have been screaming at the Government for the last six or seven years saying they have €5 billion they would like to use to assist the State in delivering social and affordable housing. Credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions, beloved of the people, which are not about making money but have instead social objectives. They are saying they would like to assist the State in the delivery of social and affordable housing. They are being completely frustrated in their efforts to do that. The Government would rather team up with vulture funds because apparently we need them. I have one last point. I asked the Minister about it yesterday. We do not even know how much tax is being forgone. The Minister said they pay this much tax. That is a meaningless figure to trot out if we do not know how much tax is forgone. How much money would they have paid in tax if they were subject to CGT and tax on their rental roll? Until we know the answer to that, we cannot in any way assess the supposed benefit the Minister is imputing to these funds. He will not convince me under any circumstances but at the very least, surely the finance and budget scrutiny committees of these Houses are entitled to know. We do this with other tax expenditures. Certainly this is something the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, has been pursuing very vigorously.We believe a light needs to be shone on tax expenditures. They need to be discussed. This is a real cost to the Exchequer in the same way as direct public expenditure is a cost, and yet we do not know how much money is being lost from the extension of these tax breaks to these ruthless profit-hungry vulture funds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 51:In page 77, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:32. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the functioning of section 481 relief for investment in films, particularly in relation to the degree to which it is meeting the requirement to meet “quality employment and training” and to examine whether film producer companies in receipt of the relief are hiding behind short lived designated activity companies (DAC) to avoid taking responsibility for workers employed on film productions supported by the relief.”.This is an issue we discuss pretty much every year at the Finance Bill. It relates to section 481 tax relief for investment in films and the question of whether the condition of quality employment and training, which is a condition of the granting of this relief to film producer companies, is actually being met. The Minister has been helpful in responding to our concerns on this issue over the last number of years.He has attempted to tighten the conditionality regarding the quality employment and training provisions of the relief, most notably requiring an undertaking in respect of quality employment for the recipients of the relief, on foot of the concerns raised by film workers and by me and others over the years. However, the problem is that there is very good reason to believe that this has not been enough to deal with the practice of getting around the requirements for quality employment and training by recipients of the section 481 relief. The Minister will be aware that when this question is raised, whether it is in this committee, in arts committees, in debates in the Dáil or between the different players in the debate about the section 481 relief, the film producers who are the recipients and their representatives in Screen Producers Ireland, in particular, will say that it is a project-to-project thing so one cannot really expect security of employment and income because that is just the nature of the industry. They say they will do their best to comply with the law and so forth, but that one cannot expect security of employment. I do not accept the case that just because something is project-to-project, the workers who work in an industry for decades are basically, due to the way the industry works, only as good as not even their last job but only as good as the producer deems them to be at the moment in which they apply for their next job, even though they may have worked in the industry for decades. That is not fair. I do not believe it is in line with the working time directive and I certainly do not believe it is in line with the requirement under section 481 to have quality employment and training. It is not quality employment and training. A person can be a painter, stage crew or somebody who is below the line, as they are sometimes referred to patronisingly by some elements in the film industry. The "below the line" workforce is the terribly insulting term that is often trotted out in these discussions. There are the above-the-line people, the flashy people perhaps, and there are the below-the-line people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I stand with the workers, whether they are deemed to be above or below the line. The Minister understands my point. It is an insulting notion because they are all equally important in the production of a film - everybody from the painter, costume designer, stagehand and transport drivers to the actors, directors and so forth. It is the case that if one is a painter who paints the stages, a very specialised thing, or somebody who works in props, again a very specialised thing, one might have worked in the industry for up to four decades and for the same group of producers. It is a group, and I have spoken to the Minister's officials about this. It is not necessarily the same producer every time, but in Ireland there is a relatively small group of producer companies. They are the overwhelming beneficiaries of section 481, and everybody knows who they are. There are smaller producer companies that may be set up on a much smaller scale, but everybody knows the big producer companies and everybody knows they are the largest recipients, year in and year out. They also have representatives and friends on Screen Ireland, which is the official State body and which is, in my opinion, just looking after their interests. I believe there is a conflict of interest in many cases in the way in which Screen Ireland, which is also dishing out grants, has such a close relationship to one particular group in the film industry, the film producers. That is an issue that must be addressed. It is not particularly in the Minister's remit, but part of the problem here is that there are a number of different Departments dealing with this, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My point is that somebody can have worked for three or four decades for the same group of producers, but when a film is being done by a producer the person has worked with previously and when the person asks to work on it the producer can just say: "No, we do not like you. You spoke up about conditions on the job and you spoke publicly in a way that was critical of us, so you are not getting a job here". There is nothing in the law to prevent that from happening. They seem to be able to get away with it. I am somewhat nonplussed as to how they are doing this, given that the Minister has made genuine efforts and I acknowledge them. When the worker who is a victim of that goes to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Court, a representative of the film producer is standing across from him or her. The worker has worked with that film producer on a section 481 production. The film producer knows it, the worker knows it and they have often done it time and again, yet the film producer can say that the worker was never his or her employee. Often the producer will send a representative to say it because he or she does not even turn up. Recently at one of these hearings the producer sent in somebody from IBEC, which is quite extraordinary. I do not understand how IBEC is able to represent somebody in such a situation. That is what is happening. Why is that? It is because the worker is an employee of the designated activity company, DAC. The film producer company gets section 481. The film producer sets up the DAC for the specific film project, but when the worker asserts his or her rights and says those rights are being breached in terms of a collective agreement - the WRC found in favour of the workers recently for breach of a collective agreement - or in terms of unfair dismissal because the worker had previously worked for the film producer and the worker is dismissed, the film producer who is getting the relief, and I remind the Minister that it is conditional on quality employment and training, says he is not the employer, even though he self-evidently is the employer because the DAC he set up is the employer. The DAC no longer exists and, therefore, the producer has no responsibility to the worker. That is fundamentally wrong. I also believe that if the EU Commission, and it is getting to that level, was aware that the scale of the relief that is being distributed through section 481 was being abused in this way, it would ask serious questions about state aid. Do not get me wrong, the State's aid to the arts is absolutely necessary and justified. I always have to reiterate that I want more money to go into film, arts, culture and so forth, and I have actively campaigned for that, but I want it to be conditional on decent employment conditions for the people who work in the sector. The specific state aid that is allowed in the area of arts, culture and film requires an effort to build up companies of scale and a permanent pool of skills. As I discussed with one of the Minister's officials yesterday, it cannot be the case, and nobody is asking for it, that a particular film producer company employs the workers for 52 weeks of the year on a permanent basis. Let us dispense with that red herring in case it is thrown out. Nobody is asking for that.Everybody knows that is not possible. Personally, I think it is possible at some point in the future but I will leave that for another day. There used to be film studios that did that kind of thing and, arguably, film was better then, but I will leave that aside. Even without that argument, that production can be a bit more episodic does not absolve the film producer companies that get this money again and again, particularly at the moment when there is a lot of film production happening and there is no real shortage of work. The film producer can say they work in a precarious industry, from film to film, and claim that, therefore, they have no obligation to the worker. They can say that if the worker ever tries to assert any obligations on the producer's part to the worker, they will simply deny they have any employment relationship with him or her. That is still not being addressed and it means people are wide open to and have been victims of straight-up blacklisting. If they rock the boat, they can become victims of blacklisting. People from the acting fraternity have even appeared before Oireachtas committees and said they are afraid. Let us think about Harvey Weinstein and all that stuff. He was doing this for years. If you did not do what he wanted you to do, sometimes awful things, he had the power to put you out of the industry and say you will never work again. That can happen above the line - it does happen there - and it can also happen to the below-the-line people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I have acknowledged previously, the Minister, more than any other Minister - there are a few Ministers who potentially should have been involved in this - and his officials have responded and there have been changes and improvements. The awful irony in all of this is that the people who brought the issue to the attention of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2018 and gave evidence to the committee have not worked in the industry again. They are people who had worked in the industry for decades. There is no doubt that they have been blacklisted out of the industry and subjected to horrendous vilification. I am sure the people who vilified them will say they are awful people but normally when someone is vilified in an employment relationship, there is a process in place. If an employer has a problem with an employee, or vice versa, there is a process involving disciplinary action, cautions, hearings and so on. The problem is that these workers have never had the opportunity to have their case heard in a fair way because there is nothing currently to prevent a film producer from simply telling a worker they are not being employed again because they do not like that worker, what he or she said or the criticism he or she made. The reason there is nothing to stop that is because of the acceptance of this narrative of employees working project to project and the relationship of the DAC to the producer company. I am nonplussed, as I said. I know the Minister stated the requirement for equality, employment and training applies to both the DAC and the producer company. The problem is the relationship between the producer company, which is the recipient, and the DAC, because the DAC is short-lived. For example, if an employee works for the DAC, while that DAC is in existence, it is required to comply. However, if it does not comply and the employee later takes a case, the producer company, the only entity that still exists - it is above the project to project work and is the continuous factor in all of this - will argue that the DAC is gone. The producer company will assert that it does not have an obligation and cannot be held responsible because the DAC, which had an obligation, no longer exists. However, the person who set up the DAC still exists and that person is the producer company, which is in receipt of the relief. The Minister has stated that it is up to the WRC to give a direction on this matter, but I do not think that is the case. I am asking the Minister and his officials to look at the detail. An instruction should come from the Government, clearly stating that where a film producer tells a worker that they do not have an employment relationship with that worker because the DAC had the relationship with the worker, it is not an acceptable case to make and film producers should not be allowed to make such a case because, in fact, the DAC and film producer are one and the same. If that instruction went to the WRC or the legislation was tweaked as required to say that that is not an acceptable position to adopt or case to make when employees worked on productions funded under section 481 or, for that matter, by Screen Ireland, it would make a big difference. It would clarify the position. Such a direction should apply to the pool of people who have worked in the industry for the past ten years, 15 years or 20 years. I know of a man, who had worked on the first season of "Vikings" and stood outside Ardmore Studios or Ashford Studios - I am not sure which - a few weeks ago. He has since died. He fully expected to work on the next season of the show but he was considered to be associated with the wrong people, was not re-employed and he is now longer alive. Shortly before he ended his life, he stood outside a place where he had worked for years, wondering why he was not taken back in. It is brutal stuff, and there is nothing to stop it happening. For many of the people involved, it is far too late by the time they get through the WRC process, the Labour Court and all the rest of it. The Minister knows what a rigmarole that is. The film producer companies have resources, whereas the individuals who have worked in the industry for years and are trying to make their own case do not. It is just not right.  The Minister argued that because there are sectors in which there are a number of different operators and people move between these operators, if someone moves from employer A to employer B and then back to employer A, that is just what happens and that is life. However, I put it to him that there are two big differences in this case. The first is that none of these film productions - and I mean none - would exist without public money. The State has a big responsibility here. The film industry is not like the music industry in this country, for example, because the music industry never got State money until Covid. The film industry is utterly reliant on public money. No films would be made without it and, therefore, the State has a particular responsibility in that regard. Second, if it was just a case of lots of different actors in a particular sector moving from employer A to employer B or from employer B to employer C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and so on, perhaps that case could be made. However, as I said, we know there is actually a relatively small group who are the beneficiaries. Workers will perhaps move from employer A to employer B, and then to employer C, but they are only moving between those three employers. The film industry is a publicly-funded sector in which the various players would not exist without public money and where, generally speaking, the workers are bouncing between the big three or four players.That is not being addressed. Ultimately, unless it is addressed, it will operate to the detriment of the quality of film and to the sector as a whole. Deputy Doherty referred to the North. I agree absolutely about what he said about the living wage although when one is working on a film, one is quite well paid and generally receives more than the living wage. The problem is what happens afterwards, especially if the industry decides it does not like you. It certainly seems to me that in other jurisdictions there is far greater rights for the pool of people to be seen as part of that pool and not to be arbitrarily excluded from the pool because somebody does not like them. That is what I am looking for. To use an analogy, in the worst-case scenarios of the Strumpet City days, dockers would turn up and there were opportunities to load ships for different companies. The scenario was that a company would either take a worker or not, on a completely arbitrary basis. One of the ways that was addressed was through the establishment of a stevedore company where dockers became part of a pool. They might be loading different companies' ships but there was a sort of registered pool of people and, therefore, a bit of fairness in the allocation of work, even though different companies were operating within that pool of dockers. Something like that could and should be done so that we know who is in the pool of employees and who is in the pool of trainees. Even commitments on training mean very little if we cannot track the journey of the trainee. Is the person who was trained on film A still around for film D that is being made by the same producer or group of producers? Has that trainee qualified? Is he or she now accepted as part of a pool of people with skills in the film sector? Is he or she, at any point, excluded from that pool? That issue is not being addressed. I appeal to the Minister and his officials to look at this again to try to tighten it up. If there is uncertainty as to precisely how the working time directive and the relationship between DACs and production companies are playing out and being represented by different groups in the Labour Court, I believe it would be entirely right and legitimate for the Minister to intervene and state what the Government wants and how it wants these things interpreted. If that requires now statutory instruments or legislative change, so be it. I am not even sure it does require those things. The situation needs to be clarified and the Government needs to crack the whip, as it were.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely appreciate the engagement by the Minister on this matter, but more needs to be done. I will come back to this on Report Stage. I ask the Minister and his officials to further consider what I have said. It is unfair that the people who brought this matter to my attention and to the attention of the Oireachtas have, in effect, been blacklisted. While one union may be happy and, indeed, may have benefited from the actions of others in bringing certain issues forward and putting pressure on in terms of those issues, it would be a cruel and unfair irony if the whistleblowers end up being the victims even though they are ones who helped to move the goalposts and to which the Minister has responded. I think that injustice must be addressed but questions remain beyond that particular group. I have recently talked to actors. The dancers who worked on a film called "Disenchanted" made the point that their employment conditions here were much less favourable than similar film situations in the UK. There remains a problem in that people who raise questions are vulnerable. Certain people can make agreements but other people should have the right to question those agreements, at least. They should not be punished and penalised if they question things that others say are fine with nothing to see. We must protect people, give them the right to question things and ensure they are not victimised if they ask questions. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will table an amendment on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will press it on the basis that I can come back to this matter on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not quite understand the section and I ask the Minister to explain it. I have read the notes and the memorandum and I have tabled a parliamentary question. I want to understand what is meant by the change in the terms and the extension of the eligibility for section 481 to cover labour-only services. I am sure the Department officials know that I am concerned about bogus self-employment. I missed the discussion yesterday but Deputy Nash mentioned bogus self-employment in a well-aimed amendment. In my opinion, bogus self-employment must be defined objectively and not left to be defined by the employer, for example in circumstances in which the employer says a job is not bogus self-employment and the particular contractor is happy with the arrangement. Others who work in the industry, or might want to work in the industry, think this is an abuse that effectively excludes them and are concerned about the lack of objective criteria for what constitutes quality employment and training and is thereby eligible for the benefits of the relief. That is my concern. I am not saying I am right to be concerned; I am saying I am concerned. Therefore, I seek an assurance and certainty from the Minister that the relief is not, potentially, going to be abused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I comment on the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise. I was trying to bilocate again, unsuccessfully this time. We had an amendment that, unfortunately, I was not present for. It relates to the extension of the section 481-type relief to the digital gaming sector. We have a concern about this. We want to support things that will create employment in this area, which is one where there could potentially be jobs and so on. We welcome those jobs. I know the Minister sometimes thinks we do not, but we very much do. Any relief should, however, be strictly tied to ensuring quality employment conditions and avoiding bogus self-employment. We are looking for assurances that that will be case. We have expressed some concerns about section 481 as it is currently applied in other areas. We do not want to have the same concerns regarding the extension of the relief to this newly growing sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But Deputy Doherty could possibly speak to the carbon tax amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then I could speak to it too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will boil down to the human level the question Deputy Doherty has outlined very well about the rationale for carbon tax and what it is intended to achieve. I got a call this week from somebody who lives in a council house in which the windows and doors are completely inadequate to insulate the house against the cold weather. She moved into the house just a while ago. The whole row of houses is in that condition, and the residents have to blast the heat to keep themselves warm at a level at which somebody who has a well-insulated home and the right to insulate his or her home does not have to do. Tenants in the private rented sector and council tenants have no right to do that. It is not allowed. Also, in many cases they would not be able to afford to do so even if they did have that right. They must, therefore, expend far more money to heat their homes. The woman who contacted me described how, as the cold weather begins to set in, the cost of keeping the heat on in her house has already completely outstripped her weekly budget. In my area 1% of the social housing stock will be retrofitted next year and approximately 1% was retrofitted last year. That is about 40 houses, and there is no indication at all that retrofitting will ramp up much beyond that. It is worth saying that in the Government's announcements on upscaling the retrofitting of homes, it anticipates, I think I am right in saying, only just over 35,000 homes by 2030. That is out of a total social housing stock of 137,000. The likelihood, therefore, is that many people in either social housing that will not be retrofitted for years or private rented accommodation, where it is up to the landlord, will be pumping money into keeping their homes warm, which they have absolutely no choice about doing, for their own health and well-being, and they will suffer the consequences.Some of those people will get fuel allowances but many of them will not. The woman I spoke to described the draught coming through the door and windows. In that situation, one is just throwing good money after bad to try to keep the place warm. The heat is going straight out under the door or through the windows, which need to be fixed. The fuel allowance increases will not cover the cost and many people will not get the fuel allowance anyway. People who are working and have an income above a certain threshold will not be entitled to the fuel allowance. That is not just transition. Let us be honest about it. It is unfair to penalise that group of people or to imagine that by increasing the price via carbon tax, they will be forced to change their behaviour when they simply cannot do it.  One could give many other examples. Public transport in particular areas is an obvious example. I do not mean rural areas in particular, although they are particularly badly hit by a lack of public transport, but so too are suburbs. It is a significant issue. Certain areas are not well served by public transport. Indeed, there is often pressure to cut back on public transport services in those areas because they are not considered commercially viable and so on. Therefore, the opportunity for people who are elderly or have mobility problems to get out of their cars is not there. They are unable to get to hospital or the shops without their cars. It is in that context we are saying this tax is unfair and the Minister needs to look at it again, particularly given the massive hikes in energy prices that are currently taking place. I would be interested to hear how the Minister responds. What would he say to the woman who phoned me up in that situation? She is now going to face excessive bills because the Government thinks it is acceptable to increase carbon tax this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Was it the Garrett FitzGerald Government that fell over VAT on children's shoes? I am not sure about the Minister's take on the historical debate around climate change and the issues around addressing it or failing to address it and whether he is right that it is a carbon tax. However, if the energy price crisis now unfolding for people continues at the current pace because they cannot do anything to opt for alternatives as those alternatives do not exist then he may have a very serious political problem. Ultimately, the answer is to move away from dependence on fossil fuels, which me must do rapidly to address the climate crisis, and ideally to have more sustainable sources of energy that do not damage the environment and which are not vulnerable to the swings and roundabouts of the market. We need to have the ability to produce our own energy that is in stable supply, is not too expensive and does not pollute and destroy the environment for the future. However, in the meantime, if the policy pursued by the Government is one that ends up punishing the least well-off and those least capable of dealing with the transition, due to the tenure of their homes, their income levels, how the transport issue impacts on them or whatever, I tell the Minister the Government will sabotage efforts to deal with the climate. We know that some of the more dark political forces in this world have actively tried to turn people against the climate action agenda. Pretty much everyone in here agrees that we need to pursue climate action vigorously in order to address this existential crisis. The biggest danger for us in trying to address the climate crisis - I really mean this and it is not rhetorical flourish - is the fear that fairly dark and dangerous political forces might turn people against the climate agenda and use the fact that it is economically punishing them in order to gain traction for climate scepticism. This should not be a surprise to us. The Minister has to do something about the energy price hikes. I accept what he said to the effect that the carbon tax is only part of it, but it does add insult to injury in a situation where people are seeing price hikes of hundreds of euros. There is a big distinction between discretionary spending and non-discretionary spending. It seems as if the Government's approach to carbon taxes does not really see this distinction. It is not discretionary for people to heat their homes. Earlier, the Minister told me to tell the woman I spoke about that we are putting money into retrofitting her home. In fact, I did say that to her. I told here there was a retrofit programme but that I had absolutely no idea when her home would be retrofitted. I can take a pretty damn good guess that it will not be for a few years. I hope I am wrong and that when I speak to the council this week I will be told it will go straight down and do the windows and doors. I strongly suspect that this is not the answer I will get, however. The promise is that at some time it will happen. In our area, 1% of the relevant properties are being done per year. It seems to be the pattern in the Dublin councils that 1% of the social housing stock is being done each year. This is just not good enough. Potentially, the woman to whom I refer could be waiting ten or 15 years at this rate. It will be cold comfort to her, to use a really bad pun, that her doors and windows will be insulated in ten or 15 years' time but that, in the meantime, she has to suck up shockingly high energy costs and, perhaps, get blamed for being a climate laggard because she is not reducing her CO2 emissions. Others who can afford to do this have done it. It is about the level of comfort. I find that ironic. This is why I am not sure about price signals when it comes to these kinds of usages of CO2. In our budget submissions, we proactively proposed carbon-type taxes on aviation, some of the polluting sectors in the economy and the profits of those sectors that make money from pollution. When we are speaking about expenditures that people have no choice but to make in order to live their lives, and stating that putting a price signal on them will change their behaviour, I do not buy it unless there are alternatives. I suggest the Minister takes seriously the warning that if we get this wrong and do not have a just transition, then we may turn off the climate action agenda significant sections of the population and the people we need on our side to make the necessary climate changes and to carry through the climate action we need to deal with the climate crisis. This would be very dangerous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless the Minister can persuade me otherwise, this section should be opposed. I apologise if I am repeating points made earlier. This is effectively a €63 million tax cut for the banking sector. The Minister is planning to exempt KBC and Ulster Bank, which are exiting the market, from the bank levy. The business that KBC and Ulster Bank do will remain and will be taken over by other entities. The projected revenue for the bank levy goes from €150 million to €87 million. We will get €63 million less, even though the amount of banking business that will be conducted in the State will remain exactly the same. The beneficiaries of this will be the remaining pillar banks which will have less tax imposed on them, in terms of the bank levy, than they should for the amount of business they have. Maybe it is Ulster Bank and KBC which are the beneficiaries. The Minister can enlighten us on that. As I understand it, and I am open to hearing what the Minister has to say, this amounts to a €63 million cut in the levy that would otherwise accrue from the banks. It also points to something else, namely, the problem with the banking sector in this country. Given the huge suffering and hardship endured by people in this country in order to bail these people out because of their systemic importance to maintain this banking system.That is the way I want to put it. People will say that some of those banks were not beneficiaries, Ulster Bank, for example, although it was bailed out elsewhere. I question the system. We suffered greatly and are still suffering the consequences of the approach that was taken to the banking and financial crash. The banking sector is still in disarray. Let us not forget that it also charges the highest interest rates of any banking sector anywhere in Europe. It has not exactly done us many favours since we bailed it out. Should the lesson that we take from the financial and banking crash, and indeed from the departure of many players in the Irish banking system, not be that we need to fundamentally revise our attitude to how banking operates and look for a different model of banking? Deputy Barry or Deputy Doherty may well have said this before me but it will not surprise anyone to hear me say that we need to think about a not-for-profit banking model, essentially a bigger version of what credit union banking is about. Credit unions pursue social and societal objectives rather than the bottom line, which is what banks do. That approach leads banks to do certain things or just depart when it does not suit them to do certain things, leaving customers in the lurch, flogging off their mortgages and creating great uncertainty, fear and anxiety. That is a bigger point arising from this. I ask the Minister to explain how this is justified. It seems to be more pandering to the banks when we need to look at radically reforming the banking sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 106:In page 122, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:
“Report of Minister
58. The Minister shall, by 31 December 2022, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas reviewing the financial impact of the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market on Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, whether the levy on certain financial institutions should be increased on Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland as a result, outlining the deferred tax assets still held by these two banks and whether they have increased charges for domestic customers following their increased share of the banking market.”.I covered quite a few of the arguments in my previous contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the same conversation about the exit of these two banks. I do not quite understand, from the Minister's response, how the decision was reached and what precisely he is trying to effect. I am one of the account holders affected by this and it is of extreme concern, as it is for 1 million other people too. It is a major hassle. All the account holders and their business will stay here and be transferred over. My point is that all the business stays here. It is just that Ulster Bank and KBC will leave. I cannot figure out who is benefiting from that. As far as I understand, the levy is linked to the amount of business and the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, obligations of the banks. Do the DIRT obligations change? If they are calculated as they were previously and applied to all the banks, then the DIRT obligation remains the same because there is the same amount of deposits and so on. All of that remains the same. The only difference is that KBC and Ulster Bank have moved out because it suits them. Either they are being rewarded for essentially doing the dirt on a 1 million customers for commercial reasons or the banks that remain, which will now have all of that business and accounts transferred to them, will escape the levy that they would have paid if those people were all their customers to begin with. The amount would remain at €150 million. I take the Minister's explanation that he had not projected it and this is an extension, but assuming the extension was applied to everybody as if all those account holders and business had been in just three banks before, we would be getting €150 million, but now we will get €63 million less. That is how I understand it.We are looking for a report on all this, reviewing the implications of the banks' departure from the market and whether the levy should now be increased for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as a result, including consideration of the deferred tax assets these banks hold. I would like to hear the Minister explain a little more convincingly why he has made the decision. It seems to me somebody is benefiting from an action that will cause a lot of hardship, difficulty, stress and anxiety for 1 million bank customers, who are the same people who helped bail out many of these banks, with the exception of Ulster Bank. They bailed the banking system out and are not getting much thanks for it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am genuinely confused. When we tabled this amendment, we thought we had either got this issue wrong and missed something or we had actually stumbled upon something. The more I hear the lack of a real rationale other than there will be disruption in the sector, which there will be for 1 million people, as the Minister rightly said, the more I think it is the latter. How, precisely, does not extending the levy to the two institutions that are the cause of that disruption and anxiety benefit the 1 million people who will be seriously disrupted by their action? If it is a goodbye reward for the two banks that have just deserted those 1 million people, it is bizarre in the extreme. I do not see how it lessens the difficulty, hardship and anxiety one iota. One would have to assume that it is not that, and this is where I would like clarification, but a kind of boon to the three remaining banks. It is saying that given all of this, and the fact they will be getting all these extra customers, we are not going to charge the levy to the same extent we might in the situation where we made the decision to extend it. Otherwise, I just do not see how this lessens or, to use the Minister's phrase, "add to", the difficulty, hardship and so on he is anticipating as a result of these changes.If it were decided to distribute the €63 million evenly among the 1 million people who had just been disrupted, I could understand the rationale, but that is not what is happening from what I can see. Frankly, I would keep the bank levy going for decades. I take the Minister's point that he had not projected the money so it is not a loss of money to the Exchequer. He decided to extend it by a year. By only levying it on the three remaining banks, less money comes in. However, when there is the same amount of business and it is calculated based on the DIRT payment requirements, which are related to the amount of business, I do not understand why it is less. Does it not mean that the amount of levy being paid as a proportion of the number of accounts is now less? I do not get why is he doing that. Who is benefiting from this? However the Minister might explain it, I do not see how the customers are benefiting. I do not see how not imposing this levy on the institutions is benefiting the customers. Arguably by getting in additional revenue, which he would if he still collected the €150 million, that would be extra money to the public which he could possibly use to alleviate difficulties, hardship and distress. He has some way to go to convince us that it is beneficial to anybody. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And vice versa.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will come back on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments are well directed. The 10% being charged on some residential property, where it is over nine properties, is completely inadequate to deal with the phenomena of the big property investment vehicles coming in here and bulk buying property. No measure has been taken by the Government to prevent them bulk buying apartments. If the levy is imposed on some parts of the housing sector in terms of homes of ten or more, rather than apartment homes, is the Government concerned these vehicles will simply start to set up entities that will do nine? I have certainly seen vulture funds behave in that way in my constituency in trying to get around other regulations, including thresholds such as the Tyrrelstown amendment and they have succeeded. If they cannot evict ten tenants, they will evict seven, even though their intention to evict all tenants is clear. However, they do it over a period of time. I do not see why it is not possible for them to do the same, but that is an aside. These entities are pretty ruthless and profit driven and the last people in whom they have an interest are those who need affordable housing. That is not their interest, at all. They are just here to make money. Indeed, the advertisements on many of their websites to the people who might invest in these entities say they will maximise the value of people's investment. That is how they promote themselves as businesses. They do not say they are trying to do good for housing around the world. They say to people who are thinking of investing that they will maximise the value of their investment. That is the business they are in and they are not the sort of people on whom we should be relying to resolve a housing crisis, which is about human beings accessing a basic human need. I would exclude them completely from the market. Some 17% certainly goes much further than the Minister is proposing. In some ways, I would be inclined to put it at 90%. I just do not see the value of these people. They should be driven out of the market. The direction of amendment No. 110 is correct. I highlighted some time ago on Leaders' Questions the issue of hotels being built, while we have a desperate need of housing and a shortage of construction labour. This amendment tries to get at the same issue. The Taoiseach replied that we needed hotels and told me not to counterpose the two. However, there is a shortage of construction labour in this country. If loads of construction workers are building hotels, they are not building houses. If there is a priority at present, it is to build houses for people to live in, rather than more hotels, which are littering and in some cases destroying this city, because so many of them are being built. They are destroying the city's heritage, as well as directing labour resources which are in short supply and are needed to build homes for people. The objective of these amendments by Deputy Doherty is absolutely right. I am interested to hear whether the Minister really believes the Government's current policies will deter the sort of objectionable activities being conducted by these profit-driven investment vehicles and the damage they are doing.Does the Minister have measures that prioritise the construction of homes as against less essential construction of the hotel kind? Indeed, is he interested in such measures? I know less about the commercial office sector and whether there is an oversupply. It gets my goat when I see the Seamark Building while travelling on the Merrion Road. I do not know whether the Minister has ever passed it. One of the NAMA developers, Bernard McNamara, built the big blocks beside St. Vincent's University Hospital. They are huge impressive looking buildings. There are about seven or eight of them. At least one, which has been advertised for office space, has been sitting empty for ten years. Do we need those kinds of developments or do we need homes? In some areas, there is clearly an oversupply of office space, such that it cannot be rented. I support the thrust of these amendments and am interested in hearing the Minister's response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We discussed this earlier but it is such and important subject that we must put as much pressure as possibly can on the Minister and the Government to rethink their attitude towards these investment vehicles. Sometimes we repeat phrases so much that they begin to lose their value and we forget what we are talking about when we talk about these vulture funds. If anybody wants to remind themselves, they should go on the websites of the funds. Those are the best places to find out what they are about. They tell you, in very stark, frankly ruthless, terms, what they are about and none of what they are about is the provision of housing to people who need it. There is none of that. I am looking at Lone Star at the moment. I was looking at Kennedy Wilson before that. I have looked at Hines and at Apollo Asset Management. You can go through the whole list of these funds and you will not find a single word on their websites about trying to help people into homes. Not a word. Lone Star, for example, says it specifically seeks to capitalize on market conditions "... in markets that have suffered an economic and/or banking crisis, resulting in a dislocation in asset pricing and value opportunities". That is the literal definition of a vulture. We move in on a situation in distress where assets are undervalued and we gobble them up. Then we unlock value. That is another expression. We do value creation. None of that is about trying to build new houses for people who need them. It is absolutely about literally circling the world looking for undervalued assets in economies in distress and trying to maximise the value. Alternatively, the funds look to where there are specific shortages which mean that they can maximise the value. It is not about addressing the supply; it is about maximising the value they can get from having an asset in a market where there is a shortage. I would argue that these entities have no interest in increasing supply, or at least not in doing so to the point where rents or prices would actually fall. Why would they ever do that? They want to ensure that the value going back to their investors stays up and that they get the maximum possible return. Thus, it is not in their interests that the problem the Minister says the Government wants to solve, namely, the housing crisis, be solved. It cannot possibly be solved by people who have no interest in solving it but who actually benefit from rents and house prices being obscenely high. In other words, the value of their assets is obscenely high because that is how the funds look at them. That is the language that litters their websites. It is the language with which those involved try to entice people to invest in their vulture funds. They say come to us because we can make you a lot of money by circling and looking for opportunities to do so. That is their agenda, their objective and what they succeed in doing. The consequences of that are unpayable rents, unaffordable house prices and the domination of the housing sector by people who have no interest in resolving the problem we as a society believe it is important to solve. I do not know whether this is just ideological or whether it is just a mistake the Government has made, but it has got it wrong on this one. Anything we can do, here or anywhere else, to try to make the Government and the Minister reconsider is worth doing because this is a dire mistake. If you want to solve a problem about the basic human need to have an affordable, secure roof over your head, you do not go to entities which, quite literally and unashamedly, are operating as vultures and the objective and raison d'être of which is to be profit-hungry vultures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister asked a legitimate question, namely, are we saying there should be absolutely no private sector involvement in housing? What I would say to that is the State cannot rely on funds, investment entities and property and real estate firms - whatever we want to call the vultures, as they are often described these days - to solve our problem, and we have a problem. It would be very difficult for the Minister to say that the decisions of the period 2011, 2012 and 2013, which have been followed through pretty consistently, have not landed us in a massive crisis. It would be very difficult for the Minister to suggest the decisions made when Michael Noonan was the Minister have not landed us in this situation. Have we learned nothing from what the experience has been of those entities coming in here and landing us in this situation? By the way, while we did have a housing crisis then, it was not a disaster. Some of us did warn about this in those years 2011, 2012 and 2013. When these things were in play, when the big decisions were being made, we said the decision of the State to stop the direct construction of social and affordable housing at that time was going to have disastrous consequences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on a second-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government made the decision to put the money into the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What do you mean from where? From the pockets of the working people of this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. There was a policy choice or a decision made at that time which was to bring these entities in. At least the Government is remaining consistent because it still thinks they should be here. It is defending the decision to invite them in, it is defending the decision to keep them here, and it is suggesting they are going to contribute even now to resolving the housing crisis. I put it to the Minister that every serious assessment of what has happened since these entities came in makes it clear they are contributing nothing. It is worse than that. They have made a bad situation worse because their intention was not to solve the crisis; their intention was to benefit from the crisis. In the process, they have made it worse. What is the alternative? There was an alternative then and that was to have used the NAMA portfolio for what it should have been used for, and some of us were absolutely explicit in pleading-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was. Apologies. I know there is something buzzing behind me. I will genuinely try to be brief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have set out our positions and they are clearly divergent. However, it is necessary to answer the questions the Minister put, so that there is no suggestion that there is a lack of internal logic in the arguments that socialists are putting forward on this point. Our argument was and remains that the assets and the means by which one can produce the housing that is necessary, both financial and otherwise, were effectively in the possession of the State at that time. These were in the banks, because we bailed them out, and in the land assets and property assets necessary to deliver the housing. We made a decision in both cases to work towards handing those back to interests that were not primarily interested in solving the housing crisis but in maintaining their financial position or in benefiting from that. I still think that argument remains the same. The Minister asks who has the capital and says that the State does not have all the capital. First, the State has fairly unlimited access to capital at the moment because of the interest rate situation. There is also huge scope for redistributional taxes in our opinion, as the Minister knows, although I will not go over that argument. Redistribution of taxes would help find the capital. We mentioned the credit unions but let us not forget the banks as well. Where are the savings? One refers to the savings of other countries as being manifest in these vulture funds in coming over here and supposedly helping us with the housing sector. We have our own savings here. Where are they? The are in credit unions and in the banks. The people who hold those savings have a bit more interest in solving the housing crisis than the venture funds, vulture funds or whatever you want to call them in New York. To me, that is self-evident.  There was a time when these funds did not exist. It was the case that 20, 30 or 40 years ago, when this country was much poorer, it was able to deliver social housing. It was able to do so far more effectively than it has been proven to be able to do in the past few decades, when the country has been much wealthier. That is our argument. There are alternative sources for the capital investment. These are the savings that exist in this country in our own banking system. We could access these savings if were to take control of that banking system, which we bailed out, and use them for societal objectives and for social objectives. To be honest, I do not think most people in this country would object to their savings being used for or directed towards solving problems like that.  On the costing of houses, Deputy Doherty has defended Sinn Féin's own position. However, the costings we put in our pre-budget submission were costed by the Minister’s Department. We used the prices for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom, based on estimates provided by the Department, as to how much it would cost to deliver those houses. As for our proposal for more than 20,000 housing units, the pricing for them in our budget submission was based on estimates given to us by the Government.I want to say that for the record.
