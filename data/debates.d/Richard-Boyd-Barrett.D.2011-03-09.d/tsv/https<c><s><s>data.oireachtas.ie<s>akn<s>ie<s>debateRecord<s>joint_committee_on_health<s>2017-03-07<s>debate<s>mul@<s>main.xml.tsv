RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will start with the recommendations made by the HPRA. Dr. Nolan mentioned that the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic have all followed an approached access to medicinal cannabis. It is more extensive than the programme proposed by the HPRA and is in line with the proposals for access contained in Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill. The HPRA has chosen a more conservative approach than the one adopted by the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic.That happily dovetails with the Government's desire to kill Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill and only allow access in the cases that it decides. Why? What is wrong with the approach adopted in the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic? Why did the HPRA make a recommendation in line with opinion No. 14 instead of something that was in line with what had been adopted in those countries? Has it any evidence to suggest there was anything irresponsible in the way the Dutch, the Italians or the Czechs had done things? I suggest it does not. Is the HPRA even qualified to adjudicate on this matter? The delegates made the point that Ireland did not have experience. Countries such as the Netherlands, Italy, the Czech Republic, Canada and so on do. They have set up cannabis regulatory authorities similar to the one included in Deputy Gino Kenny's proposal and are developing specific expertise. Those regimes make a distinction between cannabis and other pharmaceutical-type drugs. It was a political decision. At the very least, we need to debate which is the better option and hear arguments on both sides instead of just one view. Other countries which are just as responsible as this one and which have more experience of this issue have made different decisions. Will the delegates respond to these points? Why has the question of pain relief been omitted? Of the 800,000 people who suffer from chronic pain, 40% report that none of the medications they have tried addresses their condition. They include cancer sufferers who have been left out in the cold in this regard. Only those who suffer from nausea related to chemotherapy will be allowed into the trial programme. Why are the 800,000 people mentioned being left out in the cold? How can that be justified? It is not only me who is asking the question. I ask the delegates to respond to David Finn, professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at the Centre for Pain Research in NUI Galway, who is undertaking research in this area. According to him, it is disappointing that the report does not include a reference to chronic pain because a significant number of patients who suffer from chronic pain could be denied the opportunity to trial cannabis or cannabinoids as a consequence unless the case for their use to treat chronic pain can be strongly argued with the Government such that they will be included in the final legislation. He points out that one in five people suffers from chronic pain, or approximately 800,000 in Ireland alone, which is of an epidemic scale and all the more reason to do what we can to introduce new treatments that could benefit them, especially when we consider that 40% currently report that their medications are inadequate. In addition, he believes the concerns about misuse and diversion in the wider community are not unique to the use of cannabis and cannabinoids, as they also apply to opiates which have been the mainstay in pain treatment for decades. According to him, cannabis has significantly less potential for abuse than opiates and any concern could be mitigated to a large degree were the legislation to allow consultants to prescribe cannabis medicines for the treatment of chronic pain. Ms Vera Twomey was mentioned. She has said this, as has Professor Michael Barnes. I spoke to Ms Twomey in great detail in recent days. She will not mind me saying she is the person who has been denied medicinal cannabis. She believes we are taking too conservative an approach, which is why she has been denied access to it. She does not believe others who are suffering should be denied access to it in whatever approach we take. On the legislative issue, my heart was sinking while the delegates discussed the time that would be required.I do not understand this. We have a Bill before us, Second Stage of which was passed by the DÃ¡il before Christmas, which acknowledges the need for much more research in this area, states we have to have a regulatory authority, states medicinal cannabis should be accessed through a doctor's prescription and attempts to deal with the removal of cannabis from Schedule 1, which is an obstacle as has been alluded to. Why would it take six months, a year or even two years, rather than dealing with the legislation before us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do the same on Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The authors of the Bill have made it clear from the outset that we understand the rescheduling of cannabis would have to happen. Any suggestion we simply want to decriminalise cannabis is not true. We have made it absolutely clear to the Department, and anybody with whom we have discussed it, that we did not feel qualified to make a decision about precisely how to reschedule it, but we have stated clearly the rescheduling should be debated on Committee Stage. I want to make this clear. The Bill states that doctors, and only doctors, should be able to prescribe it. I want this clarified.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is that set down?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two of my questions were not answered at all. Why has pain been left out? Can Dr. Nolan respond to the points made by Professor Finn that I read to her? I want to stress this, particularly after Dr. Breslin's intervention. Professor Finn said that the long list of adverse side effects of recreational cannabis use have very little to do with what we are discussing here, which is about medicinal use. Is it not the case, as alluded to by Professor Finn, that we have a whole range of authorised drugs at the moment where the adverse side effects - there is strong evidence of this - are as bad as, or in many cases much worse than, any evidence we have for adverse effects from medicinal cannabis? OxyContin opiate, known as hillbilly heroin, is widely prescribed as an end-of-the-line painkiller. It is authorised and is highly addictive. Benzedrine and Prozac are highly addictive and there is much evidence of adverse effects. Their efficacy is questionable and it is certainly a debatable issue, but they are authorised. There is a much lower bar for how they can be prescribed and who can prescribe them. A general practitioner can prescribe those things, so why and on what basis have we decided that only a consultant can prescribe cannabis for medicinal use? A GP is a registered specialist so why can a GP not prescribe cannabis? None of these things is being explained. A view is being put here but we are not hearing the counter view. We need to hear the counter view as expressed by Professor Finn, Professor Barnes and many other eminent people. No doubt people from the Netherlands, Italy and the Czech Republic would come in here and give a pretty different perspective on all this. That needs to be acknowledged in any debate. That is not to say who is right or wrong. People have their opinions but what we are getting here are opinions, not definitive positions. Nobody can claim to have the absolutely correct position because there are diverse opinions across the medical area and in how states deal with this by way of legislation or regulation. That needs to be acknowledged. Perhaps Dr. Nolan could deal with the specific issue of pain, given the points that Professor Finn has made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Professor Finn is saying that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the points Dr. Nolan is making, Professor David Finn makes exactly the same points about what we do know. I take the point that we do not have all of the evidence. He said, in response to the exact point Dr. Nolan is making, the cases of pain could be diverse, but we know that peripheral and central sensitisation are the neurobiological mechanisms underlying most types of chronic pain and that these mechanisms are reduced by cannabinoids. Does Dr. Nolan disagree?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Dr. Nolan disagree with what Professor David Finn said?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should they not be included in the trial and not excluded, as proposed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Professor David Finn does not agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for the lengthy briefing. I hope there is agreement on it but, as we are concluding, it would be helpful to clarify or acknowledge that the job of the HPRA is, as I understand it, to work within certain EU directives and frameworks to approve a drug to be used an dispensed. As I understand it, it is not about deciding the efficacy of a particular product for a particular patient. I think that is an important distinction and perhaps those from the HPRA or others might want to confirm it. Notwithstanding the clear differences of opinion, I also hope it is acknowledged that other choices have been made and that other opinions exist. These include those of medical professionals as well as regulatory authorities and Legislatures in other States. There is no particular reason to believe that whatever recommendations or opinions are adopted here are superior to the opinions or decisions that have been made by other States. This is, in fact, a matter to be debated. I hope the witnesses agree, and ask them to agree, that to be the case. The distinction between the role of a consultant and that of a GP has not been explained to my satisfaction. When we asked political questions to the Minister in November, we were told it would be a registered doctor but now we are being told it will be a consultant. However, the paediatric neurologists are telling Vera that they do not know enough about this stuff and are suggesting visiting Canada to find out from people who do know. The idea that a consultant knows more than a GP has not been explained to my satisfaction. Why is that distinction being made? The witnesses seem to be saying that we need more data and information on the relationship between cannabinoids and pain, yet they are recommending that we do not include them in a trial where we could gather that data.It is a fundamental contradiction that, on the one hand, we need more information, data and evidence and, on the other, we choose not to gather this evidence by allowing people who suffer from pain into the trial. Perhaps one of the witnesses will explain that contradiction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would no longer apply if the legislation was changed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we need legislative change?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Especially if those consultants are saying they do not know enough about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a one-line question. Mr. Lennon stated that this was ultimately a policy decision. Can he-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Stating that was important.
