RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I do not understand -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand it. Amendment No. 6 not moved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to speak on the same theme.  Deputy Collins's amendment seeks to address a similar issue to my amendment that was ruled out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just referring to the fact.  The legislation contains an appeal mechanism for creditors.  They can appeal if they are not happy with a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement, but the debtor cannot, which is problematic.  The Minister has said we want to strike an appropriate balance between the debtor and the creditor.  I wonder if everybody with a say in drafting this legislation or who may be influencing the legislation has the same view.  I refer to a document concerning the Bill produced by the European Commission recently.  It states:The bill aims at striking an appropriate balance between facilitating the resolution/restructuring of unsustainable household debts on the one hand, and upholding payment discipline and safeguarding creditors' rights on the other.  Earlier concerns with the protection of creditors' rights have been addressed through strengthened appeal provisions and greater involvement of the courts.So the banks' concerns have been addressed by giving them an appeal mechanism.  The document continues: "Moreover, concerns remain with a legal gap that prevents banks from repossessing collateral related to some mortgage loans."  That is the attitude of the European Commission, or the troika.  It believes the banks do not have enough power.  It is glad the banks are getting an appeal mechanism.  This suggests to me that the legislation gives the whip-hand to the banks.  It is not about striking an appropriate balance between the distressed mortgage holder and the banks, but it continues to leave the whip-hand with the banks, which is very problematic.  Part of the problem in that regard is that the legislation is presented as if it is just a necessary updating of insolvency legislation in normal circumstances.  The situation we are facing that prompted this legislation is not normal.  It was not normal circumstances that produced the mortgage crisis, but exceptional circumstances created by the reckless profiteering of the banks.  That is why people have unsustainable mortgages.  Why does the Bill not acknowledge that?  Why does the mandate of the insolvency service not recognise that the vast majority of the cases of unsustainable mortgages or unsustainable personal indebtedness it will address result from an exceptional period when people were landed in that debt because of the greed, profiteering and reckless behaviour of the banks, and consequently shift the balance towards the distressed debtor instead of leaving the whip-hand with the banks?  That is the problem but the legislation and the Minister's responses do not address it.  Setting aside all the window-dressing of personal insolvency and debt settlement arrangement proposals, ultimately the bank can just say "No".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say where we agree.  This is a complicated situation and, of course, small businesses that are creditors have rights, which I accept completely.  However, that would be an argument for saying there should be a separation, if one likes, of a personal insolvency arrangement from a specific mortgage settlement arrangement, so that we separate these two issues, as Deputy Niall Collins proposed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister commented that the creditors are not all evil and are engaging in some level of forbearance at present.  That is the case but I suspect they are engaging in this forbearance to a fairly large extent because they are awaiting the outcome of this legislation.  Everybody has been wondering what legislation will be put in place to hopefully resolve this pretty awful situation.  The bulk of this situation comprises people in mortgage distress.  The Minister spoke about majority consensus, but in reality most of these cases involve one creditor, namely, a bank.  When we speak about majority consensus we are speaking about one vote at a creditors' meeting in the vast majority of cases.  This does not address this fact.  The Minister rightly distinguishes between the ordinary person just trying to put a roof over his or her head and who sought to do so in these exceptional circumstances which were created by developers and lending institutions driven by greed, and others who were a party to the greed and hoped to profiteer from the bubble.  Part of the reason for an appeals mechanism is to examine these circumstances.  One hears stories from people in mortgage distress who say they were actively cajoled and encouraged by their banks.  In some cases they were called in to be asked why they did not buy an extra property as an investment for their kids and that it was a win-win situation because the price of property would always increase.  People were told this.  Those who did not have that much financial savvy but were most of the way towards paying off an existing mortgage and had extra savings thought they would buy an extra property because the bank told them they should do so and that it was a win-win situation.  This must be taken into account when examining personal insolvency or debt settlement arrangements.  The problem is that it will not be taken into account in the mandate of the insolvency service and in how arrangements will be formulated.  The particular culpability of the banks in creating this situation and putting people in the desperate distress in which many mortgage holders now are is simply not being taken into account and neither is providing for debtors to make these points when coming to a fair arrangement whereby they can testify to these situations and we can hear evidence.  I do not see why the insolvency service cannot be the last court of appeal.  I understand it is supposed to be an independent body so why can it not listen to submissions, try to achieve consensus between creditors and debtors but, in the last instance, make a decision if they cannot come to an agreement?  Why can it not, as an independent transparent body operating to particular criteria, ultimately decide if an agreement cannot be reached?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to extend the debate unnecessarily.  The insolvency service, if it is to have serve any purpose, should be able to make determinations in respect of debt and personal insolvency settlement arrangements.  Why can it not do that?  Why can it not be included in its objectives that it makes the determinations?  It will consider the applications for debt relief notices.  Why can it not do the same in respect of personal insolvency and debt settlement arrangements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find myself in the odd position of being outflanked on the left by Fianna Fáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am doing so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The substantial point is the need to be a bit more generous to people availing of the debt relief notices and leave them with a little more to spare in their monthly income.  The proposal of €60 is very minimal and does not take into account that all sorts of exceptional financial demands can occur, particularly if children are involved.  All kinds of unexpected problems can arise, including medical costs and other exceptional circumstances.  I urge the Minister to be a little more generous to people in these circumstances.  It is a self-evident point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept the Minister's statement that we should not do anything that would have negative, unfair or adverse unintended consequences for small business, credit unions or creditors in such situations.  Again, however, one must take into account that much of the ballooned personal indebtedness being faced in the country at present is credit card debt.  That debt is the result of absolutely reckless behaviour by the banks - throwing money at people, raising credit limits when people did not even ask for their limits to be increased and actively encouraging people to spend money but not explaining the consequences that might follow.  That is a huge part of the problem.  It is difficult to navigate those circumstances and the circumstances the Minister describes in a way that gets the balance right in the legislation, but it is important to register that point and state that it must be factored into how we get the balance.  In addition, many of the people in difficult circumstances of personal indebtedness are in that situation because they borrowed money with the reasonable belief that they might still have a job in a few years but then found themselves without a job because of the cataclysmic collapse in particular sectors of the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister made these points with regard to the amendments and I am simply responding to them.  If they were relevant for the Minister, surely it is relevant for me to respond to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps I was not quite as radical in my posturing as Deputy Collins on this, but I believe the Minister could consider increasing the income over and above expenses and be a little more generous in that respect.  That is pretty tight for people.  If any unforeseen or exceptional circumstances arise, as they often do, which go outside the reasonable expenses as defined by the legislation, people could be in serious trouble.  My amendment in that regard proposes to increase it a little and is reasonable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister inserting such a provision?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the same theme, the Minister must reconsider the €6,000 limit because it could put those who are self-employed at a particular disadvantage in terms of getting back to work and accruing earnings that could allow them to discharge their debts.  A musician, for example, could have guitars and drums worth well in excess of €6,000.  Does the Minister really want such people to have to sell the means through which they make a living?  A sound engineer would certainly have equipment worth more than €6,000.  Vans would exceed the limit and many tradesmen have vans.  While the point has been made about tools, a van would be very important to many self-employed tradespeople and it is likely that any van that is functional would be worth more than €1,200.  Are we really proposing that a tradesperson who has a van and needs it to seek work would be forced to sell it if its value is in excess of €1,200?  The Minister must reconsider both limits.  A sum of €6,000 seems arbitrary and overly prescriptive.  Similarly, the €1,200 limit is arbitrary, overly prescriptive and unrealistic.  Would one get a car for €1,200 that would actually drive?  Do we have to have those limits or could the section be reformulated in some way?  I understand the balance the Minister is trying to achieve and we do not want people to abuse the system.  The point regarding ceremonial items does not relate just to jewellery.  People might have other items in their household that are of particular family importance - family heirlooms, for example.  There must be some sort of formulation which is reasonable where, if we are talking about very valuable assets or a significant amount of valuable assets, they would come under the remit of this legislation and people would be required to sell them but other items which are of genuine sentimental value, such as family heirlooms, would be outside the remit and it would be considered unreasonable to force people to sell them to discharge their debts. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume that having opposed the section on that basis we can submit further amendment on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The objective here is self-evident.  One of the key priorities of the Bill should be to protect the family home and avoid repossessions and evictions.  That imperative should be clearly inserted into the Bill in order to prevent any debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement which would require debtors to move out of the family home unless they are themselves of the view that their situation is not sustainable.  The priority of the legislation should be to restructure the debt in such a way that those who wish to stay in the family home are allowed to do so.  Otherwise, nothing will be done to ease the genuine fears and anxieties of people throughout the State that they might lose their family home because of the difficulties in which they find themselves, not through any fault of their own but arising, rather, out of the exceptional economic crisis we are facing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be seeking that the particular amendment be pressed.  The Minister indicated that said amendment is superfluous because a debtor will be obliged to agree to the arrangement proposal.  What choice will be available to such a debtor if he or she cannot reach an agreement with a creditor or if the latter does not agree to the arrangement?  In such circumstances a debtor will not really have any choice other than to opt for bankruptcy.  This will almost certainly lead to that person losing his or her family home.  It is not the case that the debtor, who is the holder of the distressed mortgage, will have much choice.  It is for this reason I am proposing that it should be an explicit objective and imperative of the Bill to protect people's family homes and that the emphasis in trying to formulate arrangements should be to this end.  We must ensure that people retain their family homes and are not forced to vacate or be evicted from them.  This is even more important in light of the fact that the vast majority of those whose mortgages are in distress find themselves in that position through no fault of their own but rather as a result of circumstances which were contrived by bankers, developers and politicians.  People whose mortgages are now in distress were simply seeking to do something very reasonable, namely, put a roof over their heads.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I acknowledge the Minister's undertaking to consider the matters raised by Deputy Creed, other Deputies and myself.  During the lunch break I had a conversation with fishermen, who are another group one might want to think about in this regard.  A small fisherman might own a relatively small fishing boat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a few of them left in Dún Laoghaire, but not many.  A fisherman's livelihood would be dependent on his boat, whose value would be considerably in excess of €6,000.  The Minister might bear this group in mind when considering these issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were quite stocky, actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments seek to delete the provisions in this section which grant creditors a vote on the terms of a proposed debt settlement arrangement.  While we agree that creditors should have the right to attend meetings in order to voice their concerns - I have proposed, in fact, that the Insolvency Service should consider such submissions from creditors, but this was rejected by the Minister - we do not accept that they should have the right to veto a reasonable arrangement.  The question of what constitutes a reasonable arrangement should be determined by the Insolvency Service or another independent body.  This is preferable to the banks or other creditors having the final say.I accept the Minister's point to the effect that not all of the creditors involved are banks. Nonetheless, much of what we are dealing with here relates to the banks. For reasons that would be fairly obvious to most people, I do not believe the banks should have the right to refuse to accept reasonable arrangements to restructure debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister wish to respond to the points I raised?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are back to our old ways here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are dealing with a series of amendments which propose, in the first instance, that there should be an attempt to reach an agreement between debtors and creditors.The Minister said that creditors must also have "an entitlement to express a view". In my series of amendments I specifically propose that creditors should have a right to express a view and to make submissions, and that in regard to the arrangements that they should have the right to propose amendments or modifications but that an independent person would make the final adjudication as to what is a reasonable arrangement in the event that the debtors and creditors cannot come to an agreement. That seems a preferable way to proceed. I do not say there might not be difficulties but the principle of having someone who is independent having the final say if agreement cannot be reached is preferable to the banks making the decision. I accept the Minister’s point that there is a shortcoming in my amendments in that not all of the institutions involved are banks. If there is sympathy for what I am trying to do, it would be to try to distinguish between financial institutions and other types of creditors of the type to which Deputy Creed referred who are concerned that they could be in financial difficulty as a result of such an arrangement and that such issues would be taken into consideration. I make no apologies for distinguishing between creditors who are ordinary citizens and financial institutions. While I would not say they are evil incarnate, they do not have the best interests of the economy at heart. It is one of the stated objectives of the Bill, as set out in the Title, that we want a resolution to debt problems not just because we need fairness for debtors and creditors but because it is in the interests of the economy as a whole to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.  This is at the heart of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The heart of it is simply that the Bill as it currently stands-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know exactly what section we are on and I know exactly what the amendment proposes.  The Bill proposes that creditors get to vote if agreement cannot be reached.  In the case of financial institutions and banks the notion that they should have the final say and essentially be able to veto proposals made by the personal insolvency practitioners or proposals that might arise out of a discussion following submissions from both sides to the personal insolvency practitioner or the insolvency agency is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I made the point and I will not labour it.  I am not happy with the Minister’s response.  I accept the point that has been made by the Minister and Deputy Creed.  My amendments might require a little finessing to distinguish between different types of creditors but it is problematic to leave the final say with the creditors in particular if they are banks.  That becomes even more pertinent as we move through the Bill when we get to the personal insolvency arrangements but even in the context of unsecured debts it is problematic.  In many cases, although not in all -  and even more so as we move through the Bill - there will not be a group of creditors; there will be one creditor, and that will be a financial institution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not submit an amendment on it but make the point that I might do so.  This section on mandatory requirements for personal insolvency arrangements is probably the appropriate section in which to state that it should be a requirement when personal insolvency practitioners are formulating any such proposed arrangement that the exceptional economic circumstances that arose between 2002 and 2008 of a distorted property market and the reckless behaviour of banks and institutions be taken into account.  Particularly because these arrangements are the ones that deal with mortgages primarily, there is an onus on the Government to acknowledge those specific circumstances which are different to the ones that this legislation might normally deal with.  That must be set out explicitly in the Bill and it should be a major factor in putting together a reasonable and fair proposal for an insolvency arrangement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was it the plan to go until 5 o'clock?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not go until 5 p.m. and call it a day?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points were made on the previous section-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----except to say these amendments are more relevant given that personal insolvency arrangements will deal with mortgage debt which, as we are all aware, preoccupies 160,000 households in the country which are in financial difficulty with their mortgages, and many people are very concerned they might lose their family home and their principal private residence.  The purpose of the amendments is to state no proposal should be made which requires the vacation of the family home and there should be no qualifications to this.  The Bill as it stands contains qualifications.  The proposal should not include a suggestion that people move out of the family home subject to certain qualifications, and this reference should be removed.  Under no circumstances should the personal insolvency arrangement involve a proposal for a family to have to vacate its home.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This again relates to earlier points on the debt settlement arrangement.  This section is important as it is the section intended to deal with mortgage distress.  As I indicated, I do not see it as acceptable that the creditors, most of whom would be banks and financial institutions, should have the right to veto through the voting system proposed a reasonable debt settlement arrangement.  I do not intend to elongate the discussion.
