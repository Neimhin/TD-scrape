RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of the general points have been made. I will not go over them except to say that it is utterly unacceptable not to have a complete investigation into all matters pertaining to NAMA so that we can get to the bottom of what has gone on with the vast amount of assets, loans and property for which it has been responsible, and whether it has served the public interest in how it has managed and disposed of those assets, loans and so on. Obviously, Deputy Wallace has played a leading role in exposing issues and scandals relating to Project Eagle. Enough has been said - others will say it, let us put it that way. It is extraordinary that the whole process was not stopped when it was drawn to the attention of NAMA down here and the Minister for Finance that fixers' fees were being paid and that corruption was likely to be at work in the disposal of NAMA assets to vulture funds. That alone requires an investigation. As has already been said, even if NAMA turns the €2 billion profit it claims, the people of the country will take a €40 billion hit on all of this. Talking about NAMA turning a profit is nonsense. We have taken a €40 billion hit and our country has been crucified. I want to raise a specific set of questions.I do not have all the answers, but I want to put this into the domain of issues that need to be examined. I received the folder before me on Monday in my office. It is a very detailed folder about Spencer Dock, a site owned by CIE that was to be developed by Treasury Holdings. I rang someone in NAMA today to try to get the par value of the original loans pertaining to the site and they could not give me the answer. They said they might get back to me. We are talking about a figure in the hundreds of millions of euro. That site is now commencing development again and it is being talked about as a €600 million development. When I asked them on the telephone NAMA would not confirm who bought the site. We know from the National Asset Management Agency Act that the original developers were not supposed to get back the sites pertaining to their loans. The original developer was Treasury Holdings. It was reported in October of last year that Johnny Ronan, formerly of Treasury Holdings, was the preferred bidder in the bidding process, which was launched in February 2016. That site owned by CIE was put on the market at a guide price of €50 million, but CIE had an arrangement with Treasury Holdings. That arrangement was seriously questioned and criticised at the time by the then Minister, former Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and subsequently by former Deputy Pat Rabbitte. In fact, a report was ordered by the then Minister, Mary O'Rourke, into the entire deal between CIE and Treasury Holdings on the grounds that she and others believed that serious questions arose as to whether the public interest had been served in the deal that had been done between CIE and Treasury Holdings as all CIE would get from its site was 17% of the sale value of any development or 17% of the rent. The rest was to go to Treasury Holdings, Johnny Ronan, Richard Barrett and so on. They went into NAMA owing €2.6 billion in total in terms of Treasury Holdings, and €1.67 billion went into NAMA.  With regard to my first question, Johnny Ronan exited NAMA apparently paying off his €250 million debt, but he now has the site again. That figure of €250 million is not €1.6 billion. I do not know the exact breakdown of Treasury Holdings debt, but he has the site again. The guide price for that six acre site was €50 million. Comparisons with similar sites currently on the open market suggest one should be paying about €20 million per acre, which is €120 million, not the reported €42.5 million that Ronan, backed by Colony, a big investment fund which refinanced Ronan's loans, is reported to have paid, although I could not get the answer from NAMA when I rang this morning, which I find extraordinary. They said they could not tell me how much was paid for the site or who bought it but it was reported in October that it was sold for €42.5 million and that Johnny Ronan, backed by Colony, bought it. If that is true and if the comparable prices per acre are in the region of €20 million, that means NAMA sold a site worth €120 million for €42.5 million. That is shocking, and the developer who now has it is the developer who originally went into NAMA when Treasury Holdings was taken over by NAMA. On the valuations, in 2002, the value per acre in the Docklands was €8 million to €14 million. It is very reasonable to assume, therefore, given the massive surge in property values since then, that €20 million is a reasonable valuation. The last question that must be answered in regard to this-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope these questions will be answered because they are very serious questions and they deserve investigation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the extreme centre?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs discussed the issue of the European Commission ruling on Apple's tax affairs in this country? Does the Taoiseach intend having further discussions about the Government's highly reprehensible decision to refuse the €13 billion that the European Commission believes is owed to the Exchequer in Apple taxes after the Commissioner Vestager's testimony to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach? It was an extraordinary irony that at yesterday's committee meeting, all those who were most critical of the European Union and its austerity policy, such as us, commended the Commissioner on at least the Commission doing this thing right and all the members from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who are the most enthusiastic for the European Union, essentially impugning her motives for coming up with these findings. She was a very strong performer. What it boiled down to was her saying there was no way the European Commission could conclude that a company that had no employees, no activities and no offices could possibly have been allocated the profits of Apple rather than the company that was tax resident in this country and carried out real economic activity. That is an unanswerable point. Tax evasion was going on. This was a bogus company and the Government and Revenue facilitated this tax evasion by Apple.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That company was not taxed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has not been lodged yet, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She did not actually say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She said they were free to make a claim.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the central discussions at Davos - ironically, given that it is packed full of multi-billionaires and the world's elite - was inequality. One could not make it up. In so far as it was discussed, Oxfam made a shocking presentation revealing that eight billionaires own the same amount of personal wealth as the poorest 50% of the world's population. The presentation made it clear that the major contributory factor to this was corporate tax avoidance, ironically by the very same people with whom the Taoiseach rubbed shoulders at the forum, and who have engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and evasion in this country.Was the Taoiseach not embarrassed by the stark facts revealed by Oxfam about Ireland's deep implication in contributing to that level of global inequality when the Apple tax ruling confirmed, and it was named by Oxfam at the forum, that it is one of the major culprits in all of this yet we are appealing a ruling in which the EU Commission sought to do something about that? Contrary to what the Taoiseach said in his previous reply, Commissioner Vestager said there was no evidence whatsoever that any other European country had a claim on that €13 billion and that as far as she was concerned, the overwhelming majority of it was owed to Ireland because Apple had allocated profits-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to a company that did not exist and Revenue had allowed that to happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach meets them a fair bit in the Clearing House Group as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They still pay their taxes, do they not? Is that too much to ask?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is because the Deputy wants to go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to know whether the committee has or will discuss several very specific areas of housing. People who do not have drug or drink problems, or who are trying to recover from alcohol or drug problems and are clean of them, are being put in emergency accommodation with active drug users or people with addiction problems. I am dealing with several cases of this nature at present. It is totally unacceptable. It is a recipe for disaster and pushes people in an already bad situation into a much worse one. Last night, I spoke at a meeting with Peter McVerry, who confirmed, as my own experience confirms, this is rampant in emergency accommodation and is totally unacceptable. What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?Has the Taoiseach discussed the issue of individual property owners in Beacon South Quarter in Sandyford? They have been landed with a bill for approximately €2 million for properties that were badly built, with fire problems, health and safety problems and water damage. IRES Reit, NAMA and others can afford to pay the €10 million being demanded by the management company and IRES Reit does not pay any tax but ordinary property owners, who pay their tax and bought them in good faith, cannot afford it and want to know if the Government will provide some kind of compensation fund for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are you going to do anything about it? That is what I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will let those who are on the committee deal with the more technical point that seems to be raised, if they can answer it. Clearly, the suggestion that amendment No. 10 is removing protections is absolutely not the intention. It is also not entirely clear that is what it does. As I understand it, it leaves in place some of the existing legislation, which should be amended.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To deal comprehensively with all the legislative aspects of trying to decriminalise sex work, which is the intent of our amendment, one would require further amendment of the 1993 Act. We take that point, but I do not think the suggestion that what we are doing is removing protection is correct. Deputy Catherine Connolly and others might add to what I said in that regard.On the substantive issue, Deputy Bríd Smith made the biggest point. Everybody here is at one in wanting to ensure we protect women or people engaged in sex work from exploitation, abuse, violence, being treated in a degrading way, objectification and the commodification of women's sexuality against their will. We are probably all at one on that, but we believe a law and order approach is not the way to deal with those problems because in an effort to make things better, one ends up making things worse for the very people one believes one is trying to protect. That is the essence of it. A law and order approach does not and will not work. The evidence for that is increasing. It is obvious that if you criminalise the buyer of sex, prostitution will not end, as has been acknowledged by those who oppose this amendment. It will continue, people will continue to purchase sex and the people who do so will be the ones most willing to defy the law. They will be the more dangerous buyers of sex. The business will be driven underground in a way that will remove protections that may exist for sex workers. That point has been largely made. Some people involved in sex work make a decision to do so. As Deputy Mick Wallace said, we should not stigmatise and patronise all those involved in sex work and assume that at least some of them do not make a decision of their own free will. However, I believe this is a minority, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said. If we want to do something about the majority of women who go into sex work because they are forced to do so, we need to look at what forces them into it. I do not believe it is demand - the fact that there are people willing to buy sex - that forces women who would not do so otherwise into sex work and the degradation involved in it if it is not their free choice. If the Government wants to do something about that, they need to look at the profile of people who are forced into sex work. What categories of people are being forced into sex work and what are we going to do to give them options so that if they do not want to be involved in sex work, they do not feel they have be involved in it? If one looks at things that way, one is immediately into areas like student poverty or people who are denied rights because they are migrants or in direct provision or because in one way or another, they are on the margins or are vulnerable people who do not have other options available to them and who feel the necessity to engage in sex work to survive. That is the issue that needs to be addressed. It is about dealing with issues like low pay and precarious work that affects women. One of the terrible things is the increase in young university students getting involved in sex work because of high levels of student poverty. If you want to do something about that, it is not about a law and order approach, it is about dealing with escalating dire student poverty that is forcing young people in universities into feeling that they must go out and engage in sex work to survive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is just not deleting it. That is slightly different.
