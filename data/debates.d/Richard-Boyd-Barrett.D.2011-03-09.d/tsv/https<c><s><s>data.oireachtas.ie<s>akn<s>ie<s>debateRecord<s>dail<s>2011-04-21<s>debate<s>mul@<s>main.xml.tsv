RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read most of the McCarthy report and I found it terrifying.  It recommends asset stripping of this country which would involve the sale of vital State assets and companies — by any definition, these are strategic assets — to pay off the bankers, gamblers and speculators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the Government's response to this document be brought before the Dáil for debate or in some other shape or form?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has not informed the House with regard to when the matter will be debated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When precisely and under what format will the House discuss a plan to asset strip this country to pay off the bankers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I only received my copy at teatime yesterday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fear is in the report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Irish troops have an honourable record in their deployment in Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.  For that reason, there is warm affection among the people of Lebanon, particularly southern Lebanon, for Irish troops and a recognition that their role, when they were deployed there between 1978 and 2001, was a genuinely benign one and a genuine peacekeeping mission.  I have no doubt, in so far as Irish troops may be deployed to Lebanon again, that they will continue to play that honourable role and will be warmly received by the majority of people in Lebanon.Of course, one must ask whether we should have to send troops to Lebanon.  It is a serious question given the fact 47 Irish troops died in Lebanon between 1978 and 2001.  There is potentially a real human cost for Irish citizens in this deployment.  While one can only praise the bravery of those troops who have been stationed there in the past, or those who might go there on this occasion, for putting themselves in this situation in the interests of peacekeeping, we would all agree this is a serious business and one we would prefer not to have to do.While the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, he also underlined the financial cost to the State of deploying troops, suggesting it would be approximately €2 million, or more.  At one level, this is money well spent if it in any way contributes to peace and peacekeeping in a conflict ridden zone.  On the other hand, however, it is of course money the people in this country would rather not have to spend, given the brutal cuts and austerity that are now being imposed on them, where every euro is precious for users of public services who are under severe pressure as a result of the economic crisis, the IMF deal and so on.  While we may have to do this, it is a pity we have to do it, and we should be aware there may be a human cost, as there was in the past.  There will certainly be a financial cost.Given that, we have a responsibility to ask why we have to send these troops and what we are going to do to address the underlying reasons that peacekeeping is necessary in that area.  I hope the Government will join me in acknowledging the reason we have to send troops to Lebanon is because of the continuous and relentless aggression by Israel in southern Lebanon against its people and the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon.There is a constant, relentless history of invasion, incursion and brutal attacks by Israel against the people of Lebanon.  There was invasion in 1978 and again in 1982, when Israel colluded with the right wing, fascist Lebanese Phalange, which massacred hundreds of people in the Palestinian refugee camps at Shabra and Chatila.  In 1993, there was another heavy military attack by Israel into southern Lebanon and, in 1996, an Israeli bombing killed 100 Lebanese civilians in a United Nations military base at Qana, southern Lebanon.  The Israeli withdrawal took place in 2000 but was followed some years later by another brutal Israeli invasion which saw 1,000 Lebanese people, mostly civilians, killed, devastation of the infrastructure, bridges, villages and roads, and the use of cluster munitions and other vile weapons against the civilian population of southern Lebanon, causing great devastation and destruction.Will the Government agree that, in sending our troops into this danger zone, we must condemn that history of Israeli aggression and demand of Israel that it ceases such aggression in southern Lebanon and ends its occupation of the Shebaa Farms, mentioned by the previous speaker?  Will the Government also agree that the root of this conflict and the problems in southern Lebanon revolve around the issue of the Palestinian refugees?  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees have been living for decades in refugee camps in southern Lebanon, without a nation or rights of any description, because they were ethnically cleansed by Zionist terror gangs in 1948, who drove them from their homeland at gunpoint, using the most vile terrorist and ethnic cleansing tactics.Is it not a fact, and will the Minister agree, that until the Palestinian refugees in southern Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere are given the right to return to their homeland, from which they were displaced by Israel terror gangs in 1948, there will be no peace in Lebanon and we will continue to be forced to send our troops into the danger zone to deal with the consequences of that fact?  Will the Minister state in the House that he agrees with United Nations Resolution 194, which insists that Palestinian refugees who were forced out in 1948 must be given the right to return and have equal citizenship rights in the land that was theirs and was stolen from them in 1948?A resolution demanding their right to return, which has been reaffirmed some 110 times by the United Nations since 1948, would be the simplest way to resolve this conflict.  We should ask the Israeli ambassador to Ireland why his country cannot grant that simple measure which would resolve all of this.  Let the refugees go home, give them equal rights, and let them live as equal citizens in the land in which their families and ancestors have lived for thousands of years.  We would ask no less anywhere else — that Arab, Jew, Christian, Muslim, persons of no religion and so on should have equal rights in that land.  That is what we should ask for in order to resolve this brutal and horrendous conflict which goes on and on, continuing to claim lives and to spur on violence and conflict.Will the Government call on the Israeli Government not to repeat its military aggression against the second international peace flotilla which will try to bring aid and support to refugees in Gaza later this year in an effort to break the inhuman and brutal siege of that region?  Will the Government come out clearly in asking Israel to allow the flotilla to bring aid to the beleaguered people of Gaza?  Given the gravity of a decision to send our troops into this situation, I hope we will take those types of actions and make those types of demands in order to deal with the underlying causes of the conflict in this area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I welcome the fact the Tánaiste is concerned, we need to be honest.  Concern will not be sufficient for the people of Bahrain and neither are investigations sufficient.  A ruthless repression of pro-democracy protesters is taking place there.  In recent days, hundreds of the people who organised the pro-democracy protest, who were calling for nothing more than democracy——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——have been arrested and detained without trial.  The daughter of one of these people is on hunger strike in protest.  It is a brutal situation.  Saudi Arabia has been involved in supporting this regime.  I suggest we need more than expressions of concern from the European Union.  Ireland should challenge at European level and also with our US friends the unbelievable inconsistency of sending bombers to deal with one brutal dictatorship in Libya while doing nothing more than expressing concern and talking about investigations when it comes to the suppression of a democracy movement in Bahrain.  Is the inconsistency in this matter something to do with the fact that Ireland, the European Union in general and the western powers in general, have major trade links with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and in the case of the bigger European powers and the US are arming these regimes to the teeth?  This is why they want to do nothing to support actively the pro-democracy movements in Bahrain nor do they wish to take any serious action to restrain the authorities from crushing a pro-democracy movement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are we going to do about it?  What concrete actions are we going to call on them to take?  I do not believe bombing is the way forward in Libya, but I thought it was absolutely right for sanctions to be imposed on the Gadaffi regime for what it was doing to the pro-democracy movement in that country.  Why are we not calling clearly for sanctions to be imposed against Bahrain and against the regime in Saudi Arabia, which is actively involved in crushing the democracy movement in Bahrain?  I believe we are involved in joint economic commissions with countries like Saudi Arabia.  Our export trade with Bahrain is worth €27 million per annum.  We import some services and merchandise into this country from Bahrain.  Therefore, we have the muscle to do something.  The EU certainly has the muscle to impose sanctions against Bahrain and demand an end to this repression.  Why are we not making such clear and unequivocal calls?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider this issue.  The more widespread and prominent the support that is given to the flotilla, the greater chance it has of getting through and bringing aid and support to the besieged people of Gaza.  If, for example, there was a Government representative on board one of those ships, it would make it far less likely that Israel would attack it.  For that reason, the Tánaiste should reconsider and the Government should put representatives on one of those boats.  The situation is intolerable for the people of Gaza, as the Tánaiste acknowledged and as most people understand.In July of last year, Deputy Joe Costello and Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, Labour Party MEP, asked the previous Attorney General to exercise his duty under Irish legislation and the Geneva Convention to bring charges against those who were suspected of war crimes in regard to Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli assault on Gaza and the attack on the flotilla.  Now that Deputy Gilmore is in government, will he follow through on that and initiate such proceedings against Israel?  Deputy Costello and Mr. De Rossa said it could be done unilaterally in this country so will the Tánaiste do it, as he should?While no one wants to see bombs or bullets going in either direction, as the Tánaiste said, will he state clearly that there is no equivalence in this situation between one and the other?  The basic problem is that Israel refused to accept the outcome of elections in Gaza in 2006 which were acknowledged to be democratic, free and fair.  Its refusal to do that lies at the root of the problem and of the siege that followed.  Will the Tánaiste state clearly that this is the root of the problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to do something; words are not enough.  The Tánaiste did not indicate whether the Government will follow through on the call by his party colleagues, Deputy Costello and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, to bring charges against Israel for its involvement in the brutal invasion of Gaza in 2006 and for its attack on the aid flotilla which was, by any standards, an illegal and immoral act of piracy by a rogue state trying to prevent badly needed aid and support from reaching the beleaguered and crucified people of Gaza.  Will there be more than words?  Will the Government condemn outright, forthrightly and unequivocally, Israel's brutal siege of the people of Gaza and its refusal to recognise free and fair elections?  Whatever we may think of who is elected, must we not say that Israel is obliged to recognise the outcome of free and fair elections among the people of Palestine, Gaza or anywhere else?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Tánaiste not agree that we could take a leaf out of the Icelandic people's book in holding a referendum on our bank bailout?  Icelandic voters were allowed to have their say and that gave their Government a stronger hand in negotiations on how to deal with their banking crisis.  The demand of the people, expressed in two referenda, that the bondholders should pay some of the cost offers lessons to us.  Does the Tánaiste agree that one lesson from the situation following those referenda is that the sky did not fall on the heads of the people of Iceland?  Negotiations continue and the country is probably in a stronger position as a result of the people being allowed to express their view in a referendum.  Perhaps we should consider doing the same.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Tánaiste's support and commitment for sanctions against the Burmese dictatorship and in support of Aung San Suu Kyi.  As has been noted, she is an inspirational figure and her campaigning and that of her supporters have brought pressure to bear on Burma to an extent.  However, I refer to the issue of consistency and double standards in another regard.  Should the Government, within the European Union, not call for sanctions equally as much against any despotic dictatorship that systematically denies democratic and civil rights to its citizens or ruthlessly suppresses political opposition?  Should it not call specifically for sanctions and be a voice calling loudly within the European Union for sanctions just like those imposed on Burma?  In this regard, I refer in particular to demanding an end to arms sales by Western and European Governments to regimes such as those in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Libya when Gadaffi was the West's friend and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to hundreds of billions in arms sales.  Should Ireland not demand clearly and unequivocally, within the European Union, sanctions against such regimes, as well as an end to arms sales?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it appropriate that troops from a neutral country such as Ireland should be involved with NATO in Afghanistan in what is by any serious definition an aggressive military action headed up by the United States, Britain and other large powers in a conflict characterised by atrocious violence against a civilian population, including the use of drones to bomb civilian areas on the border with Pakistan and within Pakistan and actions that have claimed the lives of many innocent civilians in Afghanistan?  Given the Tánaiste's reference to President Karzai, does he not accept the President is a puppet——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——and the elections that brought him to power were rigged?  What are we doing there?  Why have we troops in Afghanistan when we are supposed to be a neutral country?  Why are we linked with the NATO military alliance, a US-led, aggressive, Cold War relic?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are always more of us present, though.
