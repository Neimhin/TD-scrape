RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know how many times we have dealt with developers or consultations that happened at times when few people were likely to be aware that these consultations were happening. Such times can be very convenient for those who would rather that the public did not have a full view of things that may significantly impact on them and their environment. To exclude holiday periods, Christmas periods, bank holidays and so on, as this amendment proposes, is essentially a means of ensuring things do not pass by the public which could significantly impact upon them. It gives people an opportunity to be involved in public participation and the sustainable planning and development of their local areas. This is a very reasonable proposal. I would like to mention an idea that occurred to me when I was reading through the amendments. I have not tabled an amendment on this point, but I certainly will on Report Stage. When we are doing public consultations, as well as having to put things in a national newspaper or on a website, there should be radio advertisements from the Department or the Government on such matters. We regularly hear such material being broadcast to the public in respect of something of significance, including things to do with public health and some social welfare matters. In the case of this legislation, a review of the NMPF or a marine spatial plan should be advertised, just as we regularly hear other matters being advertised. Many people do not buy The Irish Times or the Irish Independent these days. Much of the time people are completely unaware of these notices. There should be radio advertisements. Maybe we should consider social media as well, although I am slightly reluctant to encourage more use of social media, to be honest. Radio advertisements can be quite effective. I think we should include provisions to make this happen when important public consultations are taking place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State comment on the radio advertisements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I missed the first few minutes because I was in the Dáil. My concern, and that of a lot of people, is that we are pushing through legislation which is about facilitating development rather than starting with the proper mapping out of what should and should not happen, where it should happen and when it should happen in the marine environment, and having proper consultation around all of that. In our opinion, consultation has not happened to the degree that it should. We want to see this Bill remedy that as much as possible and ensure that all of those who have an interest in protecting our heritage, marine environment, fisheries, tourism and the general environment are properly consulted as a matter of course on those issues, as well as NGOs and stakeholders who have a real stake in decisions that might be made that impact on the maritime area. It is reasonable that it should be set out who they are and the minimum requirements to consult with them. It is not clear to me who exactly the Minister has to consult with in terms of the granting of MACs, which is what they are called now. I will understand more as we go through the Bill, but as far as I understand it, the suggestion is that a MAC does not attract environmental and public participation obligations. I do not accept that for a moment. It does and should. The problem we have is that developers have essentially selected their own sites, grabbed them and it becomes a fait accompli . Somewhere further along the line we apparently rubber-stamp them, having vetted them, but it is all too late in reality. We want to see all of those gaps plugged to guarantee that we do planning in a proper, sustainable manner in line with EU directives on spatial marine planning and get things in the right order. This is part of that campaign.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment. I am repeating to a degree something I alluded to earlier. I was talking to fishermen in Dún Laoghaire yesterday. The perception is, to use the colloquial language of the fishermen, that "this Bill is going to screw us". That is essentially what they perceive. The Minister of State may say that is not the case but that is what they believe. They believe the selection by developers of sites such as the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank, which are their fishing grounds and are spawning grounds for fish, makes the development of large-scale wind infrastructure on a very sensitive site a fait accompli.The perception is that the Government wants to find the legislative means to facilitate that, rather than take on board their concerns. Their concerns about how planned developments on the Kish Bank will take place have not been taken on board. Similar views are held by groups like Save our Seafront and the Coastal Concern Alliance. There is a group in Waterford that has similar concerns about the impact of development that close to shore and on particular sites. There has not been a consideration of all the potential impacts on everything from heritage to fishing to the tourism amenity to the biosphere in Dublin Bay. We could go through a list of things that are potentially impacted by something of that close proximity. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State respond to those concerns. The groups have a definite view. I largely share their view. They feel they have been excluded and that all of this has essentially been rammed in over their heads. They feel that they will have little say and will be on the back foot, which they believe they already are. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State respond to those concerns. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will add to the points that have already been made. My big concern is that the marine environment is an enormous area that some people stand to potentially make a lot of money out of. Let us call a spade a spade. There were some disastrous mistakes made on land with planning and development, where money had a disproportionate, sometimes corrupt, influence on planning and development on land.There were many dire consequences of that. It contributed to arguably the greatest economic crash the country has ever seen, as well as the disastrous austerity that followed and the housing crisis we face today. We could go through the disastrous consequences of letting money dictate what went on, in planning and development terms, in respect of land. The potential for that to be replicated at sea is significant. The vested interests are lining up and are so far ahead of the public in their working to further their interests in order to make money from the marine environment. As a result, we have to tip the scales greatly in favour of the general public and stakeholders that do not have the resources large corporations and big industry have to pursue their own commercial interests. When we talk about coastal development, the people who have a guardianship role are, self-evidently, the coastal communities that immediately adjoin the area in question. I do not suggest that other people who do not immediately adjoin a particular development do not have a right - they absolutely do - but the coastal communities have a special guardianship role and that is important. It is not just that they have the right to do it; in fact, I want them to do it because I do not trust what certain interests, left to their own devices, might do without the oversight of communities that are directly affected, understand what a coastal zone and so on are and can spot what others who might not live nearby would not see. They have an especially important role in that regard. Similarly, the fishers have been there for a long time and know the marine environment. They know which marine species are operating there and the geography of the area. Moreover, they make their livelihoods from it and should have the right to continue to do so and not be impacted by other people who just want to make money from the marine environment. It is entirely justified, therefore, to guarantee that certain people who clearly have a stake and a role in ensuring the proper and sustainable planning and development of the marine environment will have that role, notwithstanding the need to give everybody the right to have input into decisions about the marine environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To reiterate the point I made about radio, there is a specific reference to newspapers in section 5(b). Will the Minister of State seriously consider including a reference to radio in the legislation? Displaying advertisements in the newspaper only is just not good enough these days.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all have the same amendments that all try to achieve the same end. I was commenting to one of the officials, who I think agreed with me, that this is complicated. It is a huge Bill that is extremely complicated. We are referring to multiple pieces of legislation and there are almost more acronyms than there are letters in the alphabet. We have MACs, DMAPs, the NMPF, multiple directives and MARA and now we have these policy statements. What is the acronym for them? It is MPPS. As a Deputy, I find this difficult. If I was a member of the public, I would be baffled as to how this process will operate. It would be very useful if a idiot's guide with a visual map of how these different elements interact could be produced. In this case, we have a new acronym, which is the MPPS, which is the Minister making statements of principles. How exactly do they relate to all the other different moving parts in this? How do they relate to the national marine planning framework, which will be reviewed from time to time? How will the national marine planning framework or the reviewed version of that framework be informed? What will it be informed by?To what extent will the statements of objectives and policies that the Minister might make be required to be compliant with the various directives? How do they relate to the frameworks and reviews? We need to understand all of this architecture and it needs to be set out in the clearest possible terms. A visual representation of these parts would be useful for us because we will be at this for weeks. I know one cannot be produced overnight, but it would be helpful. Ministers cannot make any old statement that throws everything in a particular direction just because that is what they like doing, or can they? Who might be influencing a Minister when he or she is coming out with particular statements in respect of policies and objectives? One of the amendments deals with the representations the Minister may receive. We need to know about those if statements are being made. Critically, we need to know that the governing framework for policy statements dictating how planning and development are done and what type of planning and development is done in our marine environment is informed, constrained and regulated by all of the various directives in terms of marine spatial planning, protection of biodiversity and habitats, and so on. We need to know that the tail is not wagging the dog in how we undertake marine planning and development. That is a brief summary of the logic behind this series of amendments. I would like to hear the Minister of State's response. I hope to hear a positive signal from him and his officials about them putting together the kind of map I mentioned to show how these various elements relate to one another, given that it is not entirely clear. Things are floating around, to use a marine metaphor.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not quite clear how the elements interact with one another.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The policy statement comes at the top and that is the Government deciding what it wants to do. Below that comes the marine planning framework. Is that not what the Minister of State suggested? I will consider what he said but my worries start there. There are certain things that have to constrain our political whims concerning what might happen in the marine environment, namely, the need to meet certain obligations relating to biodiversity and environmental protection directives we are subject to and so on. They are there to protect the public's right to participate in sustainable planning and development and to protect our environment, habitats, livelihoods and so on. I am worried about that relationship. The Minister of State said the Oireachtas cannot become a planning authority but the Minister will become a planning authority. The Minister of State might like to come back on that point. He might have concerns about the Oireachtas being a planning authority; I have significant concerns about a Minister being a planning authority. Our development plans for local authority areas are far from perfect but they allow for fairly intensive public engagement and a democratic process for the designation of particular areas for particular activities. That is done in an open, transparent and democratic way where elected representatives say houses can be build in such a place but not in another place because it is a protected environment, that a certain amount of land must be allocated for educational facilities, sport and so on, and certain things cannot be done in certain places. Where are the guarantees that we will have a similarly democratic and transparent regime when it comes to the designation of different parts of the marine environment for different types of activities? The public deserves an answer to that. The fears are that we will not and Ministers will be able to dictate, possibly under the influence of lobbyists, that the marine area regulatory authority when established will not be fully transparent and that the issuing of licences, consents and so on will not involve a transparent, open process. I would like to hear the Minister of State respond to all that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is saying the Minister's statement will be subject to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be put as a resolution to the Houses of the Oireachtas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not amendment No. 33?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one more question on amendment No. 33. Our amendment makes reference to the need for the policy statement to be consistent with the marine spatial planning directive. I apologise. I see now the Government has that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just to clarify, the Minister is supposed to be compliant with the marine spatial planning directive the Government is setting out of this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 40:In page 24, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:“(3) The Minister shall publish as part of the public consultation on a proposed marine policy statement, details of any representations made to the Minister or his Department in respect of such a policy, including representations made in the 3 years leading up to the enactment.”.Amendment No. 40 requires that the Minister will publish as part of any public consultation the details of any representations that have been made to him or her in respect of such a policy, including representations made in the three years leading up to the enactment of the policy. It is self-evident that the amendment seeks to address concerns about lobbying. We know that lobbyists operate for certain corporate and commercial interests operating or seeking to operate in the maritime area. We want full transparency and visibility for lobbying that takes place around policy matters pertaining to the planning and development of the maritime area. It is reasonable to make such a request so we know who seeks to influence policy decisions made by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It inserts that into section 31.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the whole point. That is what we are looking for. Amendment No. 117 relates to section 31 under which, if I read it correctly, an SEA will be required for any of the things that are set out in amendment No. 117.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That relates to our amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one final question on amendment No. 41 and our request that public consultation on the policy statement would be for a period no less than 42 days. Has the Minister of State commented on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, Chairman, but we did not get a response on query on lobbying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The request here is that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While people can of course go chasing stuff through the lobbying register, freedom of information requests and all sorts of avenues, the ask here is that details relating to all of those who make representations in respect of a particular policy or policy statement would be made fully visible as a matter of course in order that the public can see what sort of lobbying and representation has taken place. Deputy Ó Broin already made the point. This is to save the suspicion that there are untoward things happening and to have information such as that relating to the people who have lobbied, who met with who, what representations were made available up front, and that we list those out as a matter of course in the context of policies or policy statements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept the Minister of State's answer because there is a difference between two things. One is that the information is available if people go looking for it. They can go looking on the lobbying register, which most people probably do not know how to do, or they can go looking via freedom of information, which is hassle for people. They can find it and it is possible, but it is hassle. However, if we make a decision on this critical issue of the development of our marine environment in terms of policy, policy statements, guidelines, consents and anything to do with that, it will be a matter of course that attached to those things will be a detailing of all representations that were made. It is just there for people. They do not have to go searching for it and they do not have to wait for some Government Department to come back to them or possibly strike out bits. It is just there. There is a difference. I do not accept the Minister of State's response. While I accept people can do what he says they can do, this is doing something different. This is just making it readily and easily available, transparent and visible. I do not see that it is a very difficult thing to do and, in fact, it is quite an easy thing to do. As Deputy Ó Broin said, we will all be lobbying on various aspects of these things, so the Deputies who lobbied, the NGOs who lobbied and the corporate or commercial interests that lobbied are there for everybody to see. That is very reasonable and I do not think it is a major hassle to agree that.
