RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Monday, 114 workers in the La Senza lingerie chain were informed by either e-mail or phone call in curt notifications that their jobs were gone.  They were not given information about the work they did over Christmas.  There were no P45s given out, so they are unable to sign on.  It is outrageous and shameful treatment of these mostly young women workers, single mums, people with mortgages and students who have been left high and dry by the company, La Senza, and by the administrators, KPMG, who must have known this was coming and allowed these workers to continue to work over Christmas in good faith believing they would be treated properly and receive proper notification of any change in their position.They cannot sign on and they do not know about redundancy.  If it must be paid by the State it could be a year before they receive it and they have no idea when they might be paid the moneys they are owed for Christmas.  It is bad enough to treat workers like this at any time, but to do it just after Christmas is absolutely horrendous.  Yesterday, some of the workers at the occupation were in tears telling me about their plight.We do not just want a condemnation of La Senza, although it is roundly deserved.  We want the Government to use its influence and contact KPMG to demand it immediately appoint an administrator and that the workers' wages are immediately paid.  The Minister should move to urgently fast-track social welfare applications so the State provides assistance to these workers and they can sign on.This speaks to a bigger problem.  La Senza is just the latest victim of the retail collapse in the country and the latest of the tens of thousands of victims of the austerity which is crippling the economy.  At the very least, if the Government is to continue with austerity it should put in place legislation or some type of insurance fund to protect workers who are left high and dry by unscrupulous employers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a welcome step forward that the Minister of State has indicated his concern for the workers' plight and is willing to meet them, but what the workers want to hear is concrete commitments to deal with their situation.  Will the Minister of State contact KPMG and tell it to pay the workers the moneys, salaries and bonuses owed?  Will the Minister for Social Protection fast-track their social welfare applications and ensure they have immediate financial assistance given that they have not been paid their wages?  Will the Government introduce emergency legislation to ensure employers cannot do this and that an insurance fund is set up for workers who are left high and dry by employers?  What the workers want is concrete action, not just words of concern.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As everybody in the country is painfully aware, from the comfort of the Merrion Hotel the so-called troika is injecting the poison of austerity into the economy and inflicting it on citizens.  I ask the Taoiseach, at the very least, to publicly invite the troika to this Chamber-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----for a special sitting of the Dáil-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- or the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to enable the people who are actually directing the legislative programme of this country-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- and dictating economic policy for citizens-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is also about Dáil sittings-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and the legislative programme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the troika is directing our legislative programme, can its representatives come here-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to tell us what their demands are in order that at least the debate would take place in public?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I have a response from the Taoiseach?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about having a special sitting of the Dáil to bring the troika here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not up to the Taoiseach to decide on sittings of the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about special sittings of the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had a special sitting of the Dáil on Europe Day, with MEPs present.  Could we not do the same?
