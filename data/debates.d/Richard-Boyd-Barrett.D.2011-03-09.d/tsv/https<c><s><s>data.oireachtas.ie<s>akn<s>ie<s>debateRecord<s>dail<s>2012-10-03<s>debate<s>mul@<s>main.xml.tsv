RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister realise how much fear and anger there is in the country at this time? There is fear in the hearts of ordinary people that they will be pushed over the edge into poverty with cuts in child benefit, the imposition of property taxes and water charges, as well as more hikes in mortgage interest this week. There is anger that this should happen at the same time that €1 billion is handed over to unsecured bondholders in Allied Irish Banks, and at the same time the Minister for Health has torn up the criteria for locating primary care centres that prioritised areas of deprivation and instead bumped up locations in his own constituency to the benefit of a Fine Gael supporter, Mr. Murphy, who owns the land on which the centre is to be located.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The action would also benefit another Fine Gael supporter who gave a political donation to a Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this not reminiscent of the Fianna Fáil sleaze that the Government would have denounced so quickly a few years ago? Does the picture of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, with Mr. Murphy not look reminiscent of the pictures of Mr. Brian Cowen with Mr. FitzPatrick?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this not the sleaze that we thought would be left behind? It seems it has returned with a vengeance. Is this not proof that yet again, as with the last Government, we have a Government of the rich, by the rich and for the rich while ordinary people are being slaughtered with cuts and austerity. What is the Labour Party doing propping up a Government like this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not just us who are inciting protests. This week, in The Irish Times, Mr. Paul Krugman, the well known and respected economist-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----stated that the protestors in Greece, Spain and elsewhere in Europe who resisted what he termed "cruel" austerity were absolutely right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He argued that the troika is wrong and the policies are unfair, cruel and crippling for the European economy and economies like ours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister think people have the right to expect not to have what is displayed in these pictures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do people not have the right at least to expect, when cruel austerity is being imposed, cuts in home help, property charges-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and mortgage interest hikes, that a golden circle is not being protected and looked after with what a former Minister has called stroke politics? Do the people not at least have the right to expect that stroke politics would be ended and that the golden circle would be broken up so that it will not only be the poor and the working people who will suffer pain in the recession?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The national newspapers report again today on the Government's continued commitment to sell off the harvesting rights of 85% of Coillte forestry, a decision some of us-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----believe is criminal and stupid economically and in every other way. When will we get to debate the forestry Bill and the issues surrounding it? Will the Minister give a commitment that we will have that debate before the Government moves ahead with the sale of harvesting rights on Coillte lands?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will still be voting together against the Government's budget.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Were they in addition to the 20?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The individual would be kept in business.
