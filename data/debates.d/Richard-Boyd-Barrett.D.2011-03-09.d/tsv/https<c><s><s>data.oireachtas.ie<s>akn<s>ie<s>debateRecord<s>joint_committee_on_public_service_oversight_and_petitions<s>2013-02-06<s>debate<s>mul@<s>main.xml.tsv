RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister repeat those figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To cut a long story short, what the Minister is telling us is that the State is too broke to give disabled people their legal rights and entitlements. That is appalling. The Ombudsman is just doing her job, and she expressed indignation to this committee that the laws which are supposed to apply to everybody are not being implemented by the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She is expressing the view - it is right to hold the view - that the law is the law and the State should uphold the law. I do not see how the Department can evade that responsibility. Given that the Minister of State said she would take a serious look at the scheme, can we take it she has not done that since the matter was brought to her attention in 2009? That would appear to be the case and that is the sense one gets from the report and comments of the Ombudsman which is a serious failing on the part of the State. The Minister of State said no legal cases have been taken. I am not a legal expert but on the face of it if anybody takes a legal case he or she will win, given that she has admitted the schemes are not compliant with the law. The law provides that the changes should be made and these people should be eligible. If they take a case they will win and, frankly, since the issue is in the public domain I would be surprised if people do not start to take cases because they are legally entitled to do so. Not only this Government but the last Government failed to address this serious issue but it cannot be evaded any longer. The Government has to act urgently. What the Minister of State appears to be saying is that she does not know what to do. This Government and the previous Government have been sitting on the issue for the past few years and do not know what to do. It is proposing to invite experts in to try to figure out what to do but it is not compliant with the law. That is a drastic state of affairs. Has the Minister of State nothing more to say other than that she will get somebody else to look at the scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give suggestions in a minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is one option the Minister of State is not considering, namely, to review the budgets. What she is saying is that the allowances have to be reduced to such an extent that they are meaningless or make other savage and unpalatable cuts elsewhere in the health service or some combination of both. What the Minister of State is not considering, or it is simply not on the agenda for discussion, is that she comply with the law and look at the budgets and increase the budget to make the schemes legally compliant. Why is the Government not considering that option?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Governments have options. When it comes to the rights of disabled people, the Government does have options. For example, it can raise taxes. There are other options but the Minister of State appears to consider only the unpalatable ones from the point of view of either the health services or people who are legally entitled to these allowances. Is it fair to say that is the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If there was an easy solution I would be for putting it forward. I will think about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If there was a cost-neutral way of dealing with it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to be honest. I commend the Government on the establishment of this committee because it is a positive development and it is a good day for democracy that an issue such as this can be brought forward. However, there are consequences to such things, and this is one of them. As much as I want to be sympathetic to the plight, is it not the case that what the Minister of State is telling the committee is that the budget cannot be broken but the law must be broken? That is really what she is saying. I ask her to confirm that the budget cannot be broken and, therefore, the law must be broken, and that this will continue for at least another six months. Is it the position that the Minister of State will continue to break the law - I know she does not want to do it - for six months and deny people their rights and entitlements under the Equal Status Act because looking at the budget is not an option? That is not acceptable. That is on the legal side. I think she is trying to square a circle that is difficult if not impossible to square. Deputy Harrington said that perhaps we need to look at the equality legislation.I can see, because of the thinking running through this, why one might think that, but it is very dangerous to believe that the way to resolve this is to begin to unravel equality legislation. I urge the Minister of State not to even consider doing that. It seems the Department is faced with looking at changing eligibility criteria. This is serious, because that implies that some of the people who are currently eligible for grants do not actually need them. It is a serious road to take to suggest that might be the case. Is it not a matter of equality that if some fully able people are allowed to drive cars, those who are disabled should get grants in order that they can drive cars also? The use of language such as "mainstreaming" and other jargon does not get away from the fundamental fact that people with disabilities have the right to drive cars and should get grants for that. I do not believe we should try to unravel that. I put this to the Minister of State, but I will think further on the issues. First, is it acceptable for the Minister of State to continue to break the law for the next six months? Second, can she seriously tell us there is any other way of dealing with this other than by looking at the budget caps? I do not believe there is.
