RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also raised this issue on Second Stage. Obviously, my comments come in the context of general support for this Bill, which is a very welcome Bill that acknowledges the reality of diverse family relations in our society today. However, the issue of unmarried fathers having to pass a criterion of having lived with the mother for 12 consecutive months, including for three months after the birth of the child, is very arbitrary and does not make any particular sense. While I apologise for not having been here earlier, I would be most interested to hear the Minister's justification for this. Obviously, there are circumstances involving a father from whom the mother of the child is separated, or with whom she never had any long-term relationship, where the mother may believe there are reasons he should not have automatic guardianship, and I certainly think we have to allow for that in some way. However, on the other hand, in the vast majority of cases fathers and mothers, married or unmarried - the parents - want to play a full part in bringing up their kids. I do not believe we should start from a presumption that any category of parent has to have extra hoops to jump through in order to benefit from automatic guardianship. If the Minister needs to put in safeguards which allow a mother to debar a father whom she thinks might be, for example, a threat to a child or to herself from having guardianship, then such provisions obviously need to exist and may be spelt out explicitly. Obviously, people can go to the courts, and the best interests of the child are firmly established in the Bill. However, I do not see why the Minister has this particular category and these fairly arbitrary criteria when, probably in the majority of cases, there is no difficulty with an unmarried father who does not happen to fit these criteria having automatic guardianship. I say that as an unmarried father myself. I think I would probably just about fit these criteria, so I think I would pass. However, a person could be on the borderline. It is very arbitrary. I would like to hear the Minister's response and I hope she will be open-minded in how she deals with this when it moves to the Seanad in order to take on board these concerns.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister have more time to reply?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody wants to hear the Minister's views.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree there are complications in giving automatic guardianship to any category of father, and there should be conditions in this regard. There is no reason to believe a father who is the parent and happens to be married is any more suitable for automatic guardianship than an unmarried father. The opposite could just as easily be true. In other words, the unmarried father might in some circumstances be more suitable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The relevant clause indicates:6B. (1) A man whoâ€”(a) is, under section 5(1)(b) of the Act of 2015, the parent of the child,and(b) has married the mother of the child,shall be a guardian of the child.The 12-month cohabitation is dealt with later. Just because somebody happens to be the father and happens to be married to the mother - or was married to the mother - does not make him any more suitable for automatic guardianship than an unmarried father. One can argue for conditions, but they would apply to both groups. There is a distinction being made between married and unmarried fathers, with one seen as automatically suitable for guardianship while the other is not. That does not make any sense and is completely arbitrary. If we think there should be conditions, we could indicate that the father of the child should get automatic guardianship as long as there is no reasonable objection made by the mother. That would be regardless of whether they are married, as bringing marriage into the process is discriminatory. It harks back to all the stuff that we have been trying to deal with.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the interests of the child?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the percentage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a good amendment because we need to re-examine this section. The Minister should take it on board. If we can get this right for the Seanad, the Minister should be open-minded about it. There are two conflicting perspectives which need to be reconciled. First, Deputy Coppinger raises the legitimate concern as to why, in a situation where the parents do not live together and where they no longer have a relationship, the father should get automatic guardianship because there are many circumstances where that could be problematic. She is correct. There are many circumstances where it could be problematic and, therefore, it should not be automatic. Equally, and this is my problem with the Bill, the Minister's criterion for giving automatic guardianship, where the parents live together for 12 months, including three months after the baby is born, is arbitrary and meaningless. It is a criterion for which the Minister cannot provide any rational justification. It is arbitrary and therefore discriminates against unmarried fathers who happen not to live with the mother of the child. I have a friend who is about to have twins with his partner and they will not be married. They do not live together and they will not be living together. To get guardianship, he is going to have to go through an extra hoop over and above somebody who happens to live with their partner. That makes no sense. The way to deal with this and to level the playing field is to remove subsection (3) in page 39 and the related paragraph (b). In this way, for an unmarried father to get guardianship, he would merely have to sign a declaration. That way one would not have these two different categories. One would merely have to sign a declaration. In addition, it should be made as easy as possible for that declaration to be made, unless the mother has an legitimate objection, which she might well have, and there should be a requirement on the State to inform parents about their right to make that declaration. This arbitrary criterion the Minister has created jars and makes no sense. I have explained how I think we could resolve this. The Minister should do that. In that context, Deputy Coppinger's requirement that there would be a report on all this later on to see how it is working and whether there are unexpected consequences is a sensible amendment and I support it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The more one discusses this the more complicated it gets. I agree with Deputy Mathews that one cannot put a stop-clock on human relationships. If I come up with any brilliant ideas before this Bill goes to the Seanad, I will mention them to the Minister, and any necessary amendments can be introduced there. All we can do is air our concerns, provide for a review and consultation and monitor this closely. The point I was making was that these particular criteria are totally arbitrary. It does not make any sense to me. An argument can be made for either the status quo or automatic guardianship for unmarried fathers, which could be problematic for the reasons outlined by Deputy Coppinger. How we reconcile this will require a stroke of genius on our part between now and the Seanad consideration of this Bill.
