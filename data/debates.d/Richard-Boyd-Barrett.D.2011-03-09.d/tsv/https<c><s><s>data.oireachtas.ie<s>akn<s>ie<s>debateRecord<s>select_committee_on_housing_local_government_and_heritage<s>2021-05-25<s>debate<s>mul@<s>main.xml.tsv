RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly agree with this group of amendments. As the Minister said, the debate around these amendments relates to the fundamental differences between the Government and many in the Opposition in terms of what a land development agency should do. It is interesting that the Minister mentioned the Shanganagh Castle development as an example of a fundamental difference. Shanganagh Castle shows exactly that the LDA is now replacing the role of the local authority. To put the Minister straight, the Opposition parties certainly did not delay the development of Shanganagh Castle. I was campaigning to get public housing on the Shanganagh site from the moment it was handed over by the Department of Justice to the local authority 15 years ago.  Since then and up until now, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has continued to be run by a combination of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-led councils. In all those years I campaigned to get public housing on that site, we never got a sod turned. Some of the time, it was because of the lack of enthusiasm from the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-led councils. Most of the time, it was a combination of that with the failure of central government to offer any money to do it anyway. I can, however, tell the Minister that those of us who now feel there needs to be a different role for the LDA were precisely the ones who were campaigning for public and affordable housing on that site. Of course, what delayed it was the policy that was introduced, of which the LDA is the latest and most developed example, of insisting that private money came in on the development of the site. There was an established pathway to sourcing money for the solely public development of a site whereby one applied to central government, which approved money because it was public housing.What has stymied and slowed it to the point where we still do not have a sod turned 15 years on was the insistence that in some shape or form the site had to be marketised and private finance had to be brought in. Then we had years of Departments and local authorities scratching their heads and asking how they can make it work if they bring private finance in. Private finance completely skews the pitch because it has a completely different objective and approach from what a local authority has and to the way local authorities traditionally build public housing. It ends up in a scenario with all these different tenure types, different financing models, different notions of affordability, references to the market and all the stuff that has been crystallised in the Minister's Bill. The LDA is substituting for the local authorities, it is delaying the delivery of public and affordable housing and it is effectively a marketising of public land with the replete references in this Bill to local market conditions, market rents, market prices and all the things that should not be relevant at all to the development of the public land bank. What should the Land Development Agency do rather than what the Minister is proposing it will do? It should aggressively go after the speculators, land hoarders and people sitting on vacant buildings. It is infuriating to people when they look at empty buildings being sat on by speculators and investors. They want the State's Land Development Agency to go after these people and take the empty buildings and zoned building land they are sitting on and drip feeding into the market at a pace that suits them to keep land prices up and essentially manipulate the market. That is what we want a Land Development Agency to do. That was the general thrust of the Kenny report many years ago. We do not want a Land Development Agency as a substitute for the local authorities or to marketise public land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. We have had a masterclass in sophistry from the Minister and of course he thoroughly misrepresented the situation. The original proposals, quite a long way back, for the development of Shanganagh were to have private development. The People Before Profit Party in particular tabled motions insisting that the development would only be public and affordable. Then there was a big battle on the council and eventually that position was won. The original plan, even before the LDA, was to have some of the site privately developed. Yes, we, through campaigning and very significant local public anger at the thought that the site would be in any way privatised, forced a position where there was finally a commitment that the site would only comprise public and affordable housing. What I am worried about, given the make up of the LDA, is that the victory in establishing that the Shanganagh site will only be public and affordable will unravel because of the insistence in this Bill about relating affordability and rents to local market conditions thus rendering references to "affordable" meaningless in the context of the Dún Laoghaire constituency. Of course, our rents and market houses prices are so off the Richter scale that about 99% of working people are excluded from the market. If, as this Bill proposes, that affordable purchase, affordable or, indeed, even rents, as the Bill explicitly states, are related to local market rents and prices then the affordable will not be affordable either in terms of house prices or rents. So that is why, just to explain to the Minister, my later amendment is an attempt to put an insurance policy in against what the LDA might do to a hard-won position of establishing Shanganagh as a 100% public and affordable site. That position was won in the teeth of very significant opposition from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I never got to make a comment on amendment No. 44 and will do so now, briefly. It refers to the issue of the LDA engaging in commercial activities, which is a slippery slope in our view. This is where private finance and commercial priorities start to dictate the LDA's agenda, and affordability and the social objectives of the agency start to go out the window. That is the logic behind it. At every level, this Bill is opening the door to commercial logic and to private finance. We are concerned about what that will do to affordability and the other social objectives that should drive the development of the land bank. On amendment No. 227, I would like to hear the Minister's note before I comment but broadly speaking, this is focused on the public land bank. This is about opening up the public land bank to the LDA rather than doing what it should be doing, which is dealing with the impact of what private investment and the search for profit has done to the private land bank and the private housing sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 8, line 11, after "of" to insert "public and affordable".Essentially, what we have done with these first few amendments is to insert "public and affordable" where the current Bill, as proposed by the Government, only refers to "housing". The reason for this is very simple. There is a notion, which has been peddled for a very long time, that if we just increase the supply of housing, the prices will become affordable. This is an ideological notion, to use a term that Deputy Higgins used earlier on. It is not based on reality whatsoever. The clearest example that increasing supply does not lead to reductions in price or produce affordable housing is the Celtic tiger.During the Celtic tiger we had housing supply at unprecedented levels, with some 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year being built during that period. Did prices go down? Not at all. They went up because the housing was not being built to provide public, affordable or social housing but to make profit. Those who were looking to make profit completely controlled the housing sector and during that same period when we had unprecedented levels of supply in the general sense, albeit profit-driven supply, we also had pretty much the turning off of the tap of direct build social housing on public land, starting with Fianna Fáil and then carrying on through with Fine Gael Governments. It is not an ideological point. It is a statement of fact that increasing supply, no matter how great that supply is - and we had the greatest supply in the history of the State during the Celtic tiger - did zero to deliver public, social and affordable housing. It did exactly the opposite and then it crashed the entire economy. The whole point about the utilisation of the public land bank is that developing not-for-profit housing to deliver public and affordable housing is the only way to keep prices down, not only to deliver public and affordable housing on public land but also to dampen the entire market. That is the purpose of these amendments. It is to ensure that we do not repeat the disastrous mistakes that have been made in the private housing sector over recent years on the public land bank and to make sure the public land bank is used for what it should be used for. It should be used to serve the interests of the public, specifically those who are on the housing waiting lists or those who cannot even get on those waiting lists because their incomes are higher than the social housing thresholds but whose incomes would not allow them to buy at the grossly inflated house prices that are available in the private market or rent at the grossly inflated rents that exist out there in the private market. The sole purpose and usage of the public land bank should be to do that. The other important point to make is that we want affordable housing. Insofar as we have affordable purchase housing, we want it to be affordable in perpetuity so that no part of the public land bank will ever be marketised. Even if people have the right to purchase affordable housing on the public land bank, it should be the case that they would have to sell it back to the local authority and that the profit would not be made from affordable purchase housing that was delivered on public land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, Chair. I put up a hand, but it does not matter. I need to set the record straight. I presume that Deputy McAuliffe, who is referring to the Bill, has read it. The Bill very clearly refers to the setting of affordable prices and rents and relating them to discounts on local market conditions. It refers to the establishment of DACs for the different parcels of land that will be developed. It also refers to commercial activity. Without a shadow of a doubt, all of these elements marketise the land. Why would one relate affordability to local market conditions? They are not even average market conditions. If we averaged out rents and prices across the places in the country with high rents and house prices and those parts with low rents and prices, we would get a bad enough figure for affordability, but the Bill refers to local market conditions. In all of the areas where the affordability and housing crises are at their most intense, this would be a disastrous benchmark against which to set affordability. Average rents in my area are anywhere between €2,500 and €3,000. Average house prices are between €500,000 and €600,000. Benchmarking affordability against local market conditions means that, even if there was a 20% discount, a price would be unaffordable for the vast majority of people.Affordability has to be benchmarked against income. A teacher's pay is no different in Dún Laoghaoire than in Leitrim. The pay of a nurse, a council worker or a bus worker is not different because he or she happens to live in a different part of the country. Affordability has to be benchmarked against people's actual income but this Bill opens up the public land bank to develop housing that is linked to market conditions, private finance and to commercial imperatives around designated activity companies. We are not scaremongering when we say that this is the marketisation of the public land bank and an opening of the door to the privatisation of that landbank; it is there, in the Bill. Our amendments, which all work in conjunction with each other, aim to protect the public land bank against marketisation and to ensure that it is used solely to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing, with affordability benchmarked against people's income.
