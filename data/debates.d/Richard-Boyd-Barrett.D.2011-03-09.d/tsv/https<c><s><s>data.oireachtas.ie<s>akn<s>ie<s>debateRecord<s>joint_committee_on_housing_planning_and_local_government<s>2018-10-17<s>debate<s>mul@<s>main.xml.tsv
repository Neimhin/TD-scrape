RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know where to begin. How many staff are employed in the agency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will it be a voluntary or paid board?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many will be on it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who will decide what they will be paid?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the timeline for the agency in having a full staff complement?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but it will be 12 months before the agency is fully staffed. Mr. Coleman mentioned eight sites. Will he identify them for the committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will any of the agency's staff come from NAMA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All three current staff members are former NAMA staff?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Coleman agree that, to some degree, the work of the LDA is to undo the damage done by NAMA in selling €40 billion worth of property at pretty low prices to developers who are now hoarding and speculating on vast amounts of land? Does he agree that the agency is needed to deal with the consequences of what NAMA did?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure everybody will agree that 25% is a pitifully low level of delivery. We do not even know how low it is because we are continually given different estimates of what has been delivered. According to the CSO, 14,000 houses were delivered last year, which is pitiful and way below the 35,000 houses per year which according to the ESRI we now need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand its mandate which was totally misguided. Nonetheless, it is a fact that it has unloaded a vast amount of property, for the most part, at the bottom of the market, with which nothing is happening. According to Mel Reynolds, of the 114,000 houses mentioned, approximately half are local authority houses. The remainder will be provided through NAMA. There are 60,000 acres of zoned land in the ownership of NAMA, on which 60,000 units could be delivered, yet nothing, or very little, is happening on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but the housing crisis indicates otherwise. I will move on.  I am in favour of and have argued for having a centrally planned agency, although the local authorities should be the main source of housing delivery. Co-ordinating that delivery in a strategic planis the right way to go. However, I have a problem with the fact that within this plan 60% of housing will be privatised. This will create huge problems. Once the State interacts with the private market we will be back to the problem we have with NAMA, in that it will have to negotiate with people whose interest in the process will be to make money. The State will have to negotiate with them an arrangement, whereby they will make money from land that it is giving to them. Mr. Coleman has mentioned that this land will be serviced. The agency is trying to drive down the cost of the land, which means that they will get it on the cheap and then walk away with a profit. They will not get involved if they will not make a profit.As Deputy O'Dowd mentioned, it causes a range of difficulties, including the question of transparency and whether we will be able to find out the price at which land is disposed of. The answer is that probably we will not. Perhaps the Land Development Agency deputation might tell me. When it disposes of land public land to private developers, will we know the prices? Will we be able to know the conditionality surrounding the sale of land in the context of housing delivery?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, that does not really answer my question. It is not enough for Mr. Coleman to simply assert that the agency is cognisant of the need for transparency. He has also said there are commercial sensitivities. I simply do not see how the two can marry. The answer to the direct question of whether we will know the price at which the agency will sell land to private developers is "No", unless Mr. Coleman can tell me that we will know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under Rebuilding Ireland, the Government has identified a requirement to deliver 137,000 social housing units. If it actually delivers them, it will effectively account for all projected housing development. The ESRI maintains that there is a need for approximately 35,000 units per year. Thus, in the coming four years, to deliver on Rebuilding Ireland, everything will have to be social housing. In reality, it will not because 100,000 units of the total to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland will be accounted for under the housing assistance payment scheme. In other words, we expect the private sector to deliver them. We will then rent back from the private sector. That is the plan. Am I right in saying that is essentially what the agency will be doing? Will it be trying to deliver on these targets instead of the State directly trying to ensure these targets will be met by it in building public and affordable housing? We will deliver a small portion directly and the agency will work with private developers for the most part to build on public land. The State will then end up renting the properties back from the developers to which it will have sold the land. That is the balance and they are the targets. There will be 37,000 units delivered directly by the State. Of the total of 137,000 units, 100,000 will be covered by the HAP scheme, the rental accommodation scheme and leasing arrangements. These figures are all for social housing. I do not see how anything else will happen other than that. Is there not something a little mad about it? The agency will help to deliver directly a small proportion of the units to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland in conjunction with the local authorities and approved housing bodies. It will flog off the majority to developers. If we are to meet the targets set, the developers will have to lease back the properties to the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one last question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Overall, the arithmetic does not work out. The other day Mr. Brendan Kenny said to us that if Dublin City Council were to build property directly on its own land, it had one port of call, namely, the Department. That is where the council must obtain approval, money and so on. However, with all of these mixed tenure arrangements, essentially the agency will have three ports of call. Am I right in saying that? The arrangement for the public housing element will involve the Department. There will then be another set of financing arrangements for the affordable housing element. There will be another set of financing arrangements for the property to be disposed of to private developers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Barry has prompted one question because people need to understand the seriousness of the situation in Dún Laoghaire. To my knowledge, from my clinic in Dún Laoghaire, there are people who have been on the housing list for up to 19 years. I would be interested to know if Ms Keenan has figures on the average waiting time. In any event, it is shockingly long. Does Ms Keenan believe we can meet the housing need? She might clarify the position on the latest figures in Dún Laoghaire. How many people are on the housing waiting list and how many on HAP transfer lists and the rental accommodation scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman for the steer but I am heading towards that because the appropriate use of public land depends considerably on what the needs are. It is, therefore, very relevant to the issue of-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, and they might have it but if not, they can pass them on to me. They are still relevant questions. To meet that demand which, in total, depending on how the figure is calculated, will be approximately 5,000 households in real terms over the next few years, and to reduce those waiting lists, we would have to have a considerably higher level of delivery than we have currently. I do not see how we can do that with our current plans for land use. If we take the Shanganagh site, for example, we are only talking about 200 social houses. Ms Keenan might clarify the number of Part V housing units she expects to see delivered. She can extrapolate from the figures she gave on planning permissions, although getting planning permission is not the same as houses being built. I refer to all the other sites also. Work on the Shanganagh site will not start for some time. Ms Keenan indicated it will take nine months just to get through the various bits and pieces that have to be done. The houses must then be built and so on. After that, I do not see where the rest will come from for years. Is that a fair assessment of the dilemma we face? How can we accelerate the process? Does it not necessitate getting a much higher proportion of public housing on the lands we have, rather than entertaining public private partnerships, PPPs, and so on, which will lower the proportion of public housing we get on those sites, never mind the complications that might arise? Ms Keenan seems to be saying the public spending code is limiting her because of the threshold. She inferred that the threshold should rise. Is it not a major problem for the council, in trying to work out what affordability is, that there is a requirement to have a proportion of affordable houses and also, as she stated, to consider PPPs? The need to consider the finances of all of that is slowing everything. The council cannot progress because it must consider a PPP, which is, I presume, related to the financing of the rest of the sites, and must also consider affordable housing, with which it is having difficulty for the reasons Ms Keenan outlined. These include that the housing market in Dún Laoghaire is highly inflated and trying to work out what affordable is and how it can be financed is a complexity. Would it not be easier to develop the entire Shanganagh site as public housing because the council would not have those problems? It would also mean that we would get close to hitting our targets in terms of social housing need. On another issue I raised previously with Ms Keenan, Mel Reynolds has made a suggestion which, given the scale of the demand, I believe we should consider. On sites like Cherrywood and other private development sites, we are waiting for the social or Part V element to be delivered. We do not know when the developers will deliver it and we do not get it until the developments have been completed. Mel Reynolds has said we should take 10% of the land upfront to avoid being dependent on the developers. If we did that in Cherrywood, we would have sufficient land on which to build 800 houses. Four or five different developers own Cherrywood and we have no idea when that housing will be delivered. We have to wait until the end of that process to get our portion and we will have to negotiate prices with the developers, which almost certainly will be very high. Would it not be better for us to get the 10% of land upfront and build out ourselves, rather than waiting for the developers to build? Would that not accelerate the delivery of the Part V housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a brief supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know there were a lot of questions, so I am not criticising witnesses for not giving an answer. However it is worth getting an answer to dramatise the problem we are facing with waiting times in Dún Laoghaire, because they are shocking. A wait of eight years is shocking. That relates to the question about the plans for direct public housing provision by the local authority itself. I accept that we need affordable housing. Of course we do. People who are not eligible for the list have to be housed, and even more so when the median price in Dún Laoghaire is €527,000. However, if we are trying to meet the demand to reduce those shockingly high lists, it seems to me that the planned council housing provision cannot impact in any significant way on them. On a site where we could have got 500-odd units we will get 200. After Shanganagh I do not see where the rest is coming from. The witness said that 197 are coming down the line. Re-lets will account for 150. I was not quite clear on how many Part V units we hoped to get. If we add it all up, we might get 1,500 over the next two or three years if we are lucky. So much for council housing, against a list on which people have been waiting for 17 years. I do not see how we are going to get anywhere close. In the intervening years more people will join the list, which will further reduce the impact we have on it. We have to have a plan to house anybody on that list. We do not have one. One way or another, we have to ramp up the planned provision of public housing. I would like the witnesses to answer that. I know part of this is to do with Government policy, but that seems to be a statement of the obvious fact that we are not going to be able to meet the need for public housing. On affordable housing, do we not have a real dilemma? The witnesses are alluding to it. They have to be careful in what they say but if €50,000 below the average price is considered affordable, and the average or median price in Dún Laoghaire is €527,000, "affordable" means nothing in Dún Laoghaire. It is complete nonsense. We cannot deliver affordable housing on that basis, at Shanganagh or anywhere else. We have to have another scheme. Clearly the Government scheme cannot deliver affordable housing on the basis of that price minus €50,000. To what extent does that conundrum slow up progress at Shanganagh, and is it likely to slow up other sites? In other words, how can we get the affordable housing we want to get, when we cannot get it because it is totally unaffordable? The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown submission states that as part of the public spending code we have to consider public private partnerships, PPP. Could the witnesses elaborate on that? I want to know what that means. Does that mean that when we are looking at Shanganagh we have to consider the possibility of selling part of it off in order to finance the unaffordable affordable housing and the public housing? That is a mess. In that context, would it not be easier to just build council houses? Then we would just have to go to the Department and say we are building 500 council houses. Maybe we would need to alter the eligibility scheme for it, maybe we could even decide on our own affordable scheme afterwards. However, that mess seems to be delaying the whole process.  Lastly, I take Ms Henchy's point on Cherrywood. However, is it not fair to say that we have no control over when housing is going to be delivered there? Hines has just flipped some of the land to Cairn Homes, and Cairn Homes has told its own shareholders that it is drip-feeding to keep the price up. They have actually told the shareholders they will drip-feed and not build all of it out, in order to keep the value of the property up and to keep the dividends flowing to the shareholders. Is it fair to say we have absolutely no control over that? Is there anything we can do to take hold of that process? Ms Henchy can remind me of the planning permission that did go through with Hines. Was it 1,200 units? I am told it will start at the end of the month. When are we getting the Part V allocation from that? Will that come upfront? What price will we pay for it? Has that been negotiated yet? It has been bandied around that Hines will sell the houses back to the council for up to €430,000, on land that was originally sold to them by NAMA. Can the witnesses give us any further information on that? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman for answering my questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman always answers my questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is Ms Keenan discussing with the NDFA? She and I can sit down and have a discussion now. It takes an hour or two. We have our discussion and then move on. What is the sticking point with the NDFA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but it has to be turning on the question of affordability and how one pays for affordability given the market prices. Ms Keenan is saying we have go to PPPs. If we do not like it, what does that mean? What does that consideration involve? If it were just about building the houses, it would just be a matter of our going to the Department to outline our scheme and ask for the money for the houses. Instead, we are going through a process that I do not fully understand. I do not understand what these modellings are. Essentially, they seem to revolve around the insistence that we consider PPPs and figure out the finances regarding affordability, which is difficult in the context of Dún Laoghaire. When did this end?
