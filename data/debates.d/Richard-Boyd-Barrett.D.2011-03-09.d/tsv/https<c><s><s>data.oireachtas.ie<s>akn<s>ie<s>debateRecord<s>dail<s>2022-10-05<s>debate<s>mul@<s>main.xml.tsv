RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Independent Group for tabling this important motion. People Before Profit strongly agrees with the introduction of free and frequent public transport and has campaigned for it for a number of years. We have budgeted for it in all of our budget submissions in recent years. Despite the Government's claim that it is committed to trying to address the climate crisis and reduce car use, it is resisting introducing what is an obvious measure, that being, making public transport free and frequent. Public transport has to be both. The lack of decent public transport blights rural Ireland to a great extent, leaving many people isolated and without services, but it is also something that affects us here in Dublin and elsewhere in urban Ireland. Besides an immediate move to free public transport, I will make two suggestions. First, we have a great deal of windfall money from our corporate tax receipts. Some of that should be invested in purchasing social and affordable housing, but another large chunk of it should be used as a one-off capital investment to expand the national bus fleet considerably. This is obvious. Our fleet lacks capacity. We can see that where schoolchildren and rural Ireland are concerned. Expanding our public transport fleet would be money well spent. I urge the Government to do this and to buy electric buses, not only as part of the climate transition, but also to provide services for people. Second, we need to abandon the stealth privatisation of public transport. One of the reasons for buses not turning up is that, as part of the competitive tendering out of routes and privatisation of public transport, these companies - Go-Ahead Ireland in particular - cannot recruit and retain enough bus drivers. The only thing that private operators can do to try to get in on a route is to drive down labour costs and labour conditions. It is a race to the bottom in terms of the treatment of bus drivers and other bus workers. This flows directly from the competitive tendering out of routes and means that people do not want to work as bus drivers any more. If we want to build the public transport capacity that we need, we must abandon the competitive privatisation of routes, renationalise the entire public transport system and treat our transport workers properly instead of constantly putting pressure on them in terms of wages and conditions.

Anybody who is on illness benefit, enhanced illness benefit, occupational injuries benefit, maternity benefit or disabled benefit, however, does not receive the fuel allowance. Recipients will not, therefore, get the â‚¬400 payment, the double payment or the Christmas bonus. What is the Taoiseach going to do for those cohorts of people, many of whom are ill, have hurt themselves at work, are on maternity benefit, or are jobseekers, for that matter, on jobseeker's benefit? They are going to receive none of the one-off assistance payments to deal with the question of being able to heat their homes and pay for the energy price hikes over the winter. The Estimates Book is very clear about this that only people on long-term social welfare payments will receive these payments. Is the Taoiseach going to address that issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are they not getting the ones that others are getting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned shared island activity around the issue of arts. Later today, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight will, at my request, meet representatives of actors and other performers - the Equity union - and representatives of film crews. Something they will point out is that the pay and conditions of performers and crew in this State are far worse than they are in the North and Britain because film producers here, who are in receipt of a great deal of public money, are essentially pursuing a race to the bottom and providing much reduced pay, conditions and access to residual or royalty payments for people's performances.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's refusal to raise the income thresholds for social housing or social housing supports means that thousands of people affected by the housing crisis are being denied any assistance. Here is an example communicated to me yesterday. Leaving out the name, the message stated the woman concerned, her husband and her two children were homeless in Nenagh. It went on to say the family had been told by the council that the woman earned too much to receive any help, with the result that these people are now staying in a tent. As winter approaches, she said she was very worried for two children, both of whom are autistic, and how they will be able to manage. In another communication the person spoke of already being stressed about returning on Saturday to emergency accommodation where the person concerned had been for four years. The person was back to sharing a room with their 14-year-old son. They said they were being left to rot in emergency accommodation with no way out and feels trapped. The person said they hate living in this country because the Government is doing nothing. This person is working but cannot afford to rent or buy a home. They are also affected by the income threshold . What are the Taoiseach and his Government going to do about this scandal where people in the situations I have described are even being denied the housing assistance payment, never mind social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been hearing that for five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The person's income was over the threshold. No social housing support whatsoever-----
