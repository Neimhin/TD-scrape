RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It might be helpful if the six main questions asked by recipients of the schemes that are to be abolished were answered. I have some specific questions in addition but would it be possible to read those questions into the record?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of those affected by this asked me to convey how urgently this must be resolved. One person said that if it is cut, he will have to go to St. Vincent de Paul and it would be devastating for him. He pointed out that the funds allow for those with disabilities to enjoy real autonomy and that minibuses and so on will seriously degrade their quality of life if that is the alternative that is being considered. This allows people to operate at some level as autonomous individuals with self-determination. Public transport can take a person to certain points but they will then face the huge extra difficulties getting from the public transport node to the place of work or residence. To take this away will seriously degrade people's quality of life and they want to know that is not going to happen. The question at the top of the list for those who are losing out is if there is any plan in place in case this has not been sorted out by 27 March. There is a review group that is undertaking discussions to come up with some sort of long-term solution for this but what happens if the Department has not come up with a solution that is acceptable to all stakeholders by that date? People would be reassured by an answer to that question telling them a plan is in place and that people will not suffer after that date. It was said no decision had been made the last time we met. Was it being contemplated then? If it was being contemplated, it was wrong not to let this committee know and not to let the public and those who might be affected by the decision know. That would have given everyone a sense of urgency in coming up with a solution and would have shown some respect for the committee and, most importantly, for those who might be affected by this shocking announcement the Department made.Following on from that, given that the people affected by this announcement are aggrieved at the sudden and shocking nature of this announcement and have been left in a state of uncertainty, what assurances can the Secretary General give that the concerns, needs and wishes of the people affected will take pre-eminence in the consultations of the review group? Who is involved in the group and to what extent does it genuinely represent those affected by the recent decision, the stakeholders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those of us on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform deal in billions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In a way we must wait and see what the outcome of the review will be, but I hope the Secretary General will take a message from this meeting. It might be already clear to him. While he has a technical and legal problem and a difficulty resolving it, the parameters within which that problem must be solved should be ones whereby he will ensure that the quality of life of the current recipients of the grants and allowances is not degraded in any way. I do not know if he can give an assurance that this will be the case, but it is an assurance that would go a long way towards reassuring and quelling the anxiety of the people who were here today and others who are in receipt of these grants and allowances. Whatever technical, legal or other difficulties the Secretary General, and we collectively, have, we should not degrade their quality of life and mobility capacity. It would be very good if he could give that assurance. Deputy Mathews mentioned something very important. It is not just an issue for the witnesses, but for Departments and the Government generally. There is an adage to the effect that a problem shared is a problem solved. Sitting on problems and hiding them away or disguising them to external view does not help to resolve them. It is far better to put them out there-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly. If the problems are made public, we as a society can try to resolve them in a fair and practical way. Sitting on something and hoping it will go away is a guarantee that it will explode in one's face at some point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has it just been called?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could give it another two or three minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank them for coming in and thank those in the gallery for coming in as well. First, I can fairly say that the committee is dealing here with members who are completely sympathetic to Mr. McCabe's view on this and its objectives in safeguarding the grants and allowances. The big question we need to discuss is how we will do that, given the current situation, and what is Mr. McCabe's view about how we can do it. The Government's position, as I see it, is to say that it wants to safeguard the resources necessary to provide those with disabilities with the existing allowances and grants but, because of this legal situation, it can no longer do it anymore and if it simply opens up the scheme to all those who would be entitled to it, it would cost the State more. There are questions as to whether the Government is grossly exaggerating how much more it would cost or has it any basis for making these assumptions. Those are legitimate queries and questions that we should be asking. However, nobody can fully answer that. It is possible it will cost more, perhaps not as much as the Government says. Against that background, I would like to know the centre's attitude to that. I know my attitude. This is what I am trying to get at here. My attitude is very simple, that those with a disability have a right to these allowances and anybody who has disabilities who requires this allowance or grant, whether over 66, under 66, only needing it only in their latter years or have needed it all of their lives, as far as I am concerned, should have it. The scheme should be opened up and the State should find the funding. If the Government says it has not got the funding, I say the Government has it for the bondholders, the rich or whatever. That is my attitude. I wonder whether that is Mr. McCabe's attitude. That is one way of approaching the problem, by simply saying we demand the resources, they should be provided as there is a right and entitlement to them. Finding the resources is the Government's problem. The alternative approach is to accept the Government line that it wants to give the allowance to the existing recipients but it does not have any more than €10.9 million, and on that basis, work out a solution with the Government around how that €10.9 million continues to go to those who currently get it. I wonder what is Mr. McCabe's attitude to that conundrum.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I completely agree with the approach of the witnesses and it is the right way to go. Earlier I asked the Secretary General a question on who was involved in the review group trying to resolve the problem. Are the witnesses involved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do they believe they should be involved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is agreed so we should recommend this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mobility grant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we need to pass a motion or agree by consensus before the committee makes a recommendation? Perhaps the committee secretariat can inform us what the appropriate procedure is for doing so. Do we simply say that we recommend that the Centre for Independent Living is represented on the review group? Must we write to the Department and the Minister stating our recommendation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we make that proposal? It seems we have the agreement of the committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we need to write it or can we just say it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can commence with, "That this committee requests of the Minister". Are we posing the question to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, or the Minister for Health?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That the committee recommends that the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, invites the Centre for Independent Living on to the review group that they have established to look at a replacement for the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----motorised transport grant and mobility allowance. Do those words work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a grammatical point, we have the words "requests" and "recommends". We should just say that this committee "recommends". We do not need to repeat ourselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. Is the secretariat happy that is in order?
