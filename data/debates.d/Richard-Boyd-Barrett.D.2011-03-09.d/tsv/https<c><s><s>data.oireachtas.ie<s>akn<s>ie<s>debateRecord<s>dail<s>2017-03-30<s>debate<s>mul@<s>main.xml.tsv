RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pay tribute to United Against Racism and the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland - I know Mr. Memet Uluda and Mr. Lucky Khambule and others are in the Visitors Gallery - for their efforts in bringing about this debate and in pressing the motion which has been signed by 37 Deputies. I think it is a matter of vital importance. The Taoiseach was praised and praised himself lavishly for his comments in Washington about immigrants, both Irish immigrants and immigrants generally, and how he was a champion of immigrants. It is a little ironic, is it not, that he could do that and indeed at points imply criticism of the outrageous policies of US President Donald Trump vis-à-vis immigrants and asylum seekers in the United States and continue to stand over a degrading, inhumane, cruel system of direct provision, which is guilty of child neglect and abuse if nothing else. It is guilty of many other things too. The treatment of children living for years in this system of direct provision is a scandal beyond scandals. It is not an exaggeration to say that allowing this to persist is on a par with industrial schools and the Magdalen laundries. Tinkering around and reforms, while they may improve things marginally, are just not good enough. The key here is the issue of right to work that has already been alluded to. Nobody doubts that there is a housing emergency. We believe it can be solved, and with the right policies, everybody in direct provision and on our housing lists can be housed. A real move away from direct provision will not happen overnight, although a lot more could be done on it quickly if there was a change in policy, but the right to work is critical. It is unacceptable that people are expected to live on €19 a week, are imprisoned in these direct provision centres, not allowed to work, and are treated as second-class citizens. They are treated as a sort of subhuman group in the same way as those who were slaves in the Magdalen laundries or who were prisoners in the industrial schools were treated. All the crocodile tears or shame and regret about the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools can only be viewed as hypocrisy if the Government does not move to get rid of the system of direct provision and allow the people in that system - asylum seekers coming to this country who are here for any substantial period - the right to work and consequently integrate into society and be treated the same as other human beings who happen to be citizens of this country. I appeal to the Minister of State and Government to do this and they will have done something important and historic in allowing asylum seekers the right to work and to be treated as dignified human beings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will stay with the theme of disability. Probably 1,000 people outside the House are extremely angry regarding the failure of the Government to honour the promise made in the programme for Government. As the Minister knows, there have been several protests in recent months demanding that the Government stick to its promise. It is too late to stick to its promise to ratify the UN convention but it should deliver belatedly on it. What is the delay? The Minister keeps saying we need the legislation but we do not. Can the Minister confirm that? There is nothing whatsoever to stop the Government from ratifying now. The legislation can follow afterwards. Ratification would really be a great relief to the people outside, who do not want to be there. Many of them were saying how difficult it was to get here because of the transport difficulties. They also said they would continue to come back, however, if the Government did not indicate it would ratify the convention. Why does the Minister not just save them the hardship and ratify now, after which we can deal with the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will speak in a similar vein. I have not been a participant in the debates on this Bill to date but I am very supportive of the legislation. I believe it is a significant step forward in a progressive direction to have supervised injecting facilities and to try to create a safer environment for people with addiction problems in which to inject. I would not support any amendment that would cast doubt over the value of moving in this direction rather than having things driven underground into parks, alleyways, subways or wherever it is. However, I do not think that is the purpose of this amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we discuss this on a regular basis, see how it is going, monitor it closely and try to improve things as we go along. We are entering, for this country at least, into new territory, and it is good territory as far as I am concerned. It is territory that brings something out of the shadows, acknowledges the reality of it and tries to address it. I believe it is a sensible amendment. It might set a precedent for other debates of a similar nature that we are going to have in the next few weeks on the question of medicinal cannabis. I know that in that area, the Government and possibly some others in the Opposition are going to express concern about potential implications and knock-on and spill-over effects, as they might see it, of decriminalising medicinal cannabis. I do not share those concerns, but if, as I hope, the medicinal cannabis Bill passes, I suspect that the Government and those who have those concerns will propose an amendment just like this one and state that the House will need to constantly review matters to see what the impact, efficacy, benefits and shortcomings of it are. I think that is a sensible approach. It would therefore be inconsistent for the Government to oppose this amendment and to then, very likely, make the opposite argument in a few weeks' time when we come to debate another area of decriminalisation around particular drugs, during which the Government will argue for caution, monitoring and so on and so forth. I think the Minister should seriously consider this amendment and accept it. There is nothing to lose. There are no dangers in this. It is just a sensible measure to ensure that this issue stays in focus and that we move from this positive step on a trajectory of making things better over time to address the reality of what is a fact of our society, that is, the injection of these drugs. I hope the Government will accept the amendment. Aside from the Government's concerns, everybody else in the House seems to share that view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This debate on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention) Bill 2016 is important in and of itself. It also raises several issues about our role in conflict, however. While I support the Bill, I will consider tabling amendments to it on Committee Stage. I am also concerned about the motivation behind this Bill and why the Government is introducing it now. There is no question about how good it is that we should sign up to a convention where we commit to protecting humanity’s cultural and artistic heritage from destruction in war. However, when the Minister set out the case for supporting this legislation, not surprisingly, he referred to Palmyra and recent events in Syria. Of course, those events should be mentioned. Any discussion of the destruction of cultural artefacts and heritage in conflict could not but include mention of the appalling scenes we saw of Daesh deliberately destroying an absolutely irreplaceable part of humanity's cultural heritage in Syria. We witnessed the remains of one of the great ancient civilisations being systematically destroyed. What is incredible is that the Minister only referred to what happened to the Arch of Triumph in Palmyra. That is a pretty extraordinary one-sidedness when we are debating the rationale behind signing up to a convention about the protection of cultural property. Why would the Minister not talk about the destruction of the National Museum of Iraq and the damage done to the ancient site of Babylon during the US-led war in Iraq? According to those people and organisations charged with the protection of humanity's cultural heritage, the worst act, bar one, of cultural destruction and vandalism was the destruction of the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad and the damage done to the ancient site of Babylon, one of the most ancient locations of early human civilisation, during the US-led war in Iraq. At these sites, there were three different fires. Ancient documents were looted and burned. Contamination and destruction were visited upon the ancient heritage site of Babylon. The latter was done explicitly by the US forces which, incredibly, used that site as their military headquarters during 2003. All of this happened, despite warnings from universities and organisations - in the US itself and other countries - representatives from which with Pentagon officials on several occasions before the war was launched. These individuals pleaded with the American authorities to do nothing that would lead to the destruction of that heritage site and the museum and cause irreversible damage to our human heritage.The Pentagon ignored them and did absolutely nothing to protect the Baghdad museum, even though they were pre-warned. It is not as if this just happened and they were not warned in advance. They were warned again and again that this was going to happen if they went ahead with their planned invasion and bombing without taking some measures - setting aside the debate about the war itself - in terms of having specific measures to protect that heritage but they ignored those warnings. Donald Rumsfeld, who was questioned about this after the first looting began, completely dismissed it. They maintained the military base on the Babylon site and then handed it over to the Polish forces afterwards. They used the soil and sand there, which was packed with archaeological artefacts, for sandbags for the US soldiers, which they set up around the site. They brought in diggers and tractors, dug up the ground, contaminated the site and removed soil containing artefacts which will never be recovered. The Baghdad national museum was completely looted.  I will tell the Leas-Cheann Comhairle something even worse about all this. At the time all the serious and respectable cultural institutions and universities met collectors, museum directors and so on who were lobbying the Pentagon prior to the war. If the Minister remembers back to 2003, as anti-war activists our biggest concern was about the human destruction that was going to be visited on the population of Iraq but we also warned, as did many, about the cultural destruction that would take place in one of the most ancient civilisations in the world bar none. At the time, another small group called the American Council for Cultural Property was founded in late 2002. That group, which had very close contacts with the Bush Administration, started lobbying the Administration for a different approach to the cultural property that might fall into US hands when the war started and it said that as soon as they got into Iraq, they should relax the laws on the collection, export, sale and the putting into the market of artefacts, documents, heritages pieces and that might fall into US military hands. When the Baghdad museum was looted - although some looting was done by common thieves and some of it involved Iraqi people who were trying to protect their heritage and took artefacts away until after the conflict - the reports were clear subsequently that much of what went on involved people who were organised and who knew exactly what they were looking for and that such artefacts found their way into the market and were sold for profit. This had been well organised in advance by outside forces. We can put those two things together, namely, the failure of the Bush Administration, despite warnings, and the military forces under its auspices to protect these artefacts and then an organised theft of much of those artefacts taking place. Nobody stopped them and this was at the time that the world was screaming about what was happening. When the first looting started Rumsfeld and his gang said there was nothing to see there. It was only weeks later that they eventually put in some tokenistic protections when the horse had already bolted, the destruction and fires had happened and all the looting had taken place. I will tell the Minister what I believe. I believe our friends, the American Council for Cultural Property, founded months before the invasion in late 2002 and with close contacts with the Bush Administration, had a well-organised plan, which was facilitated - or at least a blind eye was turned deliberately - by the US forces. Is that not what they went on to do to the rest of the country - to its resources and its oil? They went in to loot the country and, of course, most importantly, kill 1 million people while they were doing it. I find it amazing that the Minister did not mention this. I would also mention in passing what Israel has done in Gaza. Does the Minister know how many mosques were destroyed by Israel in Gaza during its recent assaults? A total of 203 mosques were attacked during Operation Protective Edge, 73 were completely destroyed and two churches were also extremely badly damaged. These include, for example, the Al-Omari Mosque in Jabaliya, Gaza's oldest and largest mosque built in the seventh century and named after the second caliph, Umar bin Al-Khattab. It dates back to 649 AD, making it 1,365 years old and it was totally destroyed by Israel. The time available does not permit me to go through the rest of them on the list but systematic deliberate destruction of ancient Palestinian heritage, and also human heritage, part of the ancient civilisations of this area, took place.  I wonder why the Minister does not mention these matters. They are recent events. Why do we not talk about that? Why do we talk only about Palmyra and the crimes of ISIS, which, of course, must be mentioned and roundly condemned? I suspect, like everything else, that we are completely one-sided in our apparent concern about these matters. When one side that is deemed to be the enemy, the adversary or the problem engages in such destruction, we will condemn it but when our allies do it, we keep shtum, even when they are signatories of this convention. The US signed the first protocol. Israel is probably not a signatory, I am not sure about that - the Minister can probably confirm that - but the United States certainly is a signatory. Why does the Minister not mention those matters? I suspect it is because there are two different standards, particularly when it is applies to the United States. This brings me on to another point I want to make. I welcome the fact that the Minister or Fianna Fáil are supporting the Hague Convention-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or Sinn Féin, of course, but there is also the Hague Convention of 1907, which defines neutrality. It is very clear in its definition of it. Article 2 of that convention states "Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power." That convention also states "A neutral power must not allow any of the acts referred to in [Article 2] ... to occur on its territory." That is the internationally accepted definition of neutrality. I should read into the record Article 29 of our Constitution which deals with neutrality. It states:1 Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.2 Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.3 Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other State.I wish to refer to what Mr. Justice Kearns said when Ed Horgan took his case about the goings on in Shannon Airport through which 2 million US troops passed on their way to conduct the war in Iraq, which has claimed 1 million lives and which opened the door to the destruction of the cultural heritage of Iraq that I have outlined. In fact, ISIS would not exist were it not for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and I do not believe any serious commentator would suggest otherwise. ISIS is the bitter fruit of that assault by the United States.
