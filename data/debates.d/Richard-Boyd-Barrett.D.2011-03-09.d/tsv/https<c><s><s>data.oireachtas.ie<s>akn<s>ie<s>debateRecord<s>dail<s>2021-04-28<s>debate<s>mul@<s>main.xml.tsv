RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Paul Murphy and Barry. I thank Deputies Ó Broin and Conway-Walsh for using Private Members' time to bring forward this Bill. Most importantly, I commend and congratulate the USI on what already appears to be a successful campaign of people power. That should be said. As a result of its campaigning on this issue, it appears that it has forced the Government to respond, somewhat belatedly, in respect of an issue that has been raised from the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Indeed, the issue of the lack of proper rights for student tenants predates the Covid crisis, but it has been particularly highlighted during it. An absolute minimum requirement to support our students is that they should be extended the same rights as other renters or tenants, although it should be said that the rights of renters and tenants who are not students are also completely inadequate. However, at a minimum students should not have to pay more than a month in advance and one month's deposit, and they should be able to get refunds where they are unable to take up accommodation because of Covid-19. The fact that the Government is allowing this Bill to progress to Committee Stage and that it is also talking about a Bill of its own to cover the same issues is a victory for people power. I hope students understand that. It is campaigning and people power on the part of students that is forcing change. They deserve the biggest credit. This Bill touches on just one of a large number of barriers. I should say that barriers continue to be erected. It is not just that they are not being dismantled, in many ways barriers are continuously erected against students, particularly working-class students and those from lower-income families, to be able to access third level, higher, further and postgraduate education. Students are caught up in the disaster of the housing crisis and extortionate rents. The situation is being exploited by investment funds in the context of shockingly extortionate, so-called purpose-built student accommodation and by universities that are increasingly acting more like big business than places of education to support students getting through their education and fulfilling their potential. That is absolutely unacceptable. We must control the price of student accommodation. We need purpose-built, public student accommodation with affordable rents in order that students can afford to study in comfort and that they and their families will not be not put under massive financial pressure, a pressure that is added to by the disgrace of the student contribution fee, which is one of the highest in Europe. Then there is the total inadequacy of grants, for those who can get them, in terms of finding accommodation.I highlighted this issue recently. I will use this opportunity to raise it again because another aspect of the story emerged this week . This is just one instance in terms of postgraduate education whereby psychologists, who face huge fees of €7,000 to €15,000, must work on placement for free and are then somehow expected to pay the rent. How are they supposed to pay these rents? To add insult to injury, however, this week, the HSE advertised assistant psychology posts, with a full range of duties at 20 hours per week, for people who are mostly trying to get on to doctorates of psychology, where they would work for the HSE for free. They would deal with clients and GPs, write reviews, deal with the literature and do all the work of psychologists while working for free. How are they supposed to pay the rent? It is absolutely unbelievable. The head of the HSE is getting in the region of €400,000. A massive pay increase is being talked about in respect of the Department of Health and yet student psychologists are being asked to work for free for the HSE. It is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the last couple of hours, I have been informed by the four national representative taxi groups that the Garda has banned their planned protest, which was due to take place outside Leinster House tomorrow, on Merrion Street. This is a shocking development. There would be no threat to public health because the taxi drivers were going to be in their cars. That was clearly outlined to the Garda, yet the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, has banned the protest on public health grounds. Given that the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021 is up for debate today and the acting Minister for Justice will be in the House, I request that she make a statement on whether this interpretation of the public health guidelines to ban a legitimate and safe protest by taxi drivers is in line with the Government's view of public health guidelines. She should also find out what on earth Drew Harris thought he was doing in using public health as an excuse to ban a legitimate protest by taxi drivers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. I held back on speaking to Thursday's business until now. The Ceann Comhairle knows I raised this matter at the Business Committee last Thursday. The idea we will pass a motion on the national marine planning framework on the basis of a 50-minute debate is utterly unacceptable. For the Taoiseach to suggest that we are somehow trying to paralyse the process is utter nonsense. Unless we have proper planning of the marine environment and offshore development, we will end up with the sort of wild west we had in housing that led to the crash. It is happening as we speak and fishermen are being ridden over roughshod in Dublin Bay and the Codling Bank by private companies that have grabbed the offshore and that are only interested in profit. There is no proper regulation in this regard. There are serious threats to biodiversity in the offshore, particularly the near offshore. This matter requires proper scrutiny and it should not just come under one committee; any committee with an interest in it should be allowed to scrutinise it and stakeholders should be allowed to give evidence. The idea that the Government would try to push this through with no debate at all or, as is the case now, with five minutes for each party to contribute, is completely unacceptable. I reiterate, in reference to a previous matter, that the taxi drivers would have been in their cars. An operational decision was not made in this regard. Rather, it what is happening is political policing. We should have a statement from the Minister for Justice about this matter.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In five days, Abdulrahman al-Sahdan, who is a Red Crescent humanitarian worker from Saudi Arabia, will be sentenced by the Saudi regime to 20 years imprisonment for a tweet. Him and about 70 other democracy activists are facing sentences of between ten and 30 years each. They are persecuted by the Saudi regime, which, let us remember, carved Jamal Khashoggi into pieces in the Saudi embassy in Turkey, almost certainly at the behest of Crown Prince bin Salman. This young man will get 20 years in prison for a tweet even though he is a totally peaceful activist. Even Nancy Pelosi has called on the Saudi regime to release Abdulrahman. I ask that five days before this sentence, if the Taoiseach believes in anything like the right to peaceful and democratic protest and the right to dissent, he would call out the Saudi regime and ask for Abdulrahman's release. This is shocking stuff compared with what some people have to put up with, and I would not make the sort of loose comparison that Deputy Mattie McGrath made earlier on. However, I find it worrying that under the guise of public health restrictions we are seeing political policing by Drew Harris of a protest planned tomorrow by taxi drivers that would have been fully compliant with public health guidelines. The Taoiseach should call that out too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think I am next on the paper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is noted on the actual book here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Citizens' assemblies have obviously done very good work in a number of areas. Many of the issues identified in the programme for Government as being ones on which we should have citizens' assemblies deliberate are extremely positive. If one were to ask people right now what they believe we should have a citizens’ assembly deliberate upon as a matter of urgency, I believe a very large number would say that we need one on the mental health crisis which is affecting young people and many other age cohorts and which has been magnified by the Covid-19 crisis. In general terms, the problem in this regard stems from the failure to resource basic mental health services in order to allow them to address it. The Taoiseach should consider that. There is also an issue with regard to education. I do not think we can wait for a citizens' assembly to be established. I raise again with the Taoiseach the matter I have raised in recent weeks, namely, that relating to the psychologists and the desperate need that we have in this regard. We are 400 psychologists short of the number we were promised in A Vision for Change. I have pointed out that the fees and the unpaid placement work that students are having to do are acting as a huge barrier to getting psychologists qualified who could help address the mental health crisis that exists across a range of areas in respect of which there are massive waiting lists. The HSE advertised this week for assistant psychologists to work for it for 20 hours a week for nothing. That is outrageous. I appeal to the Taoiseach to investigate that because these young psychologist trainees should be paid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach discuss with President Biden the issue of the TRIPS waiver for vaccine technology and vaccine formulae? Even the United States Government, as I have pointed out to the Taoiseach previously, has used wartime legislation to direct private companies to do certain things to respond to the coronavirus. This is in the heart of capitalism, if we like. It does not go far enough as far as I am concerned but even the US understands the need to use emergency measures to tell for-profit commercial companies what they had to do in response to the coronavirus. Shockingly, the Government and the European Union are dancing to the tune of the vaccine-producing companies that do not want to share the vaccine formulae and technology with countries such as India and others where we see disaster unfold.It is morally obscene when we know that in order to see the back of this pandemic, we need the world vaccinated. The awful terrifying cost of that is being seen in countries such as India, notwithstanding, by the way, the shocking right-wing irresponsible attitude of the Indian Government, which was like Trump and Bolsonaro. Nonetheless, it is unconscionable that Europe is holding out against a waiver of intellectual property on vaccines.
