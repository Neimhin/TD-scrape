RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Time and again the Minister has told the House that the justification for a low tax regime on oil and for licensing arrangements whereby ownership of our gas and oil reserves has effectively been handed over to oil companies is that we only have potential reserves, not actual reserves. If that is the case, could he explain how this jar of light crude oil, just a small sample taken from a tanker-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will put it down. An oil tanker was filled-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in 1997. A week's pumping filled a tanker. Where did it go, who took it and did we get any money for it? This is real oil, not potential oil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The story shifts as we investigate further. I will quote something that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, told me a while ago. He stated: "Since the early 1970s, we have had four gas finds and no oil finds."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not say "no commercial oil finds". He said "no oil finds". Now it is "commercial". However, we have discovered that a tanker of oil was pumped out of the Connemara field. Although it was plugged, one of Statoil's then directors, Mr. Stein Bredal, has since stated publicly that doing so was a mistake, as technology has caught up to the point at which the pressure problem can be addressed. I presume this is the reason other oil companies still have an interest in the area. They know there is not potential oil down there, but real oil. They are waiting for an opportune moment to extract it, just as property developers sat on land banks for ages-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----until they could get maximum profits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of Statoil's former directors has since said that handing the licence back was a mistake, as modern technology allows-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking a question. The former director has acknowledged that it was a mistake and that the field could be commercially viable. Can there be a justification any longer for the ridiculously and pathetically low tax rate, the lack of royalties and the effective handover of ownership, through our licensing system, to private oil companies of a reserve of oil that will almost certainly be commercially extractable and profitable in the very near future, if not this minute? We know the oil is down there. It is only a matter of time before it is extracted. Under the current regime we will get nothing from it. We will probably get as much as in a little container of oil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we still get to discuss the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We get to discuss the amendments only.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In addition to the points made by Deputies Doherty and McGrath, I also cited a further example which is relevant to the argument for not excluding newly built houses. I referred to NAMA properties or properties that are currently empty, but which should be occupied.We should do something about the ghastly situation whereby according to the CSO there are 320,000 empty properties throughout the country. If this incentive were to encourage people to purchase these and fit them out such that they were attractive for people to move into or buy, it would have a useful purpose. It would also provide employment to tradespeople and builders if we did this. I can imagine that houses that have been sitting empty for a few years will have wear and tear and will require work simply because of the time they have been vacant. There would also be work which would make them more attractive to a potential buyer. Obviously I am only speaking about cases in which these houses would be purchased as principal private residences. On these grounds we should not exclude completely new properties from the tax incentive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should the legislation not the refer to "years of assessment"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had an extensive discussion on this tax relief on Committee Stage. My amendment splits the difference between the figure we proposed in committee and the Minister's threshold of €5,000. I do not generally favour tax breaks and, in so far as they are discussed in the Chamber, I spend most of my time railing against them because they are given primarily to people who do not deserve them and serve little purpose in terms of the development of the economy and society. This relief, however, is a good one that is well targeted. Its beneficiaries are likely to be ordinary citizens having home improvements such as insulation works carried out and tradespeople who are a key focus of the measure. Given that many tradespeople are in serious difficulty, it is a good idea to have a targeted measure which will, I hope, generate some employment for building workers and those with a trade.  In arriving at the threshold of €5,000 has the Department drawn up a list of works that could constitute refurbishment? Deputy Doherty cited a number of examples of such works and I also set out a number of cases on Committee Stage. Many works that would cost less than €5,000 could not be described as day-to-day repairs that would be carried out in the normal course. I accept the point that the purpose of the relief is to generate work that would not otherwise be generated. This is the Minister of State's concern regarding the proposal to reduce the threshold and it is, I believe, what is meant by the term "dead weight" - I love these new phrases that people come up with. If the Minister of State's argument is that we cannot afford to provide tax breaks in respect of works that would be done at any rate and the purpose of this relief is to encourage new activity, that is fair enough. However, I can think of numerous examples of works costing between €1,500 and €5,000 that one would describe as new activity. For example, in the case of a person I know who is considering landscaping her garden, I suspect the work will not be done if the threshold remains at €5,000 because she could not afford to have it done. I am not batting on behalf of the individual in question but her garden could probably be landscaped for-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the garden of a former council house in Sallynoggin. I suspect it could be landscaped for €2,500. This tax break could be the difference between the work being done and not being done. Deputy Doherty referred to the replacement of windows, which is another good example of works that would be done if they fell within the scope of the relief. It would be positive if such works were carried out as we want people to have better insulation and so forth. I used some rubber material on a dodgy window recently to stop it banging. In such circumstances, one faces the choice of having spanking new, double or triple glaze windows fitted, which are much better in terms of insulation, or having a stop-gap job done. The difference is that in the latter case, one is not having new work done, while in the former case, one is genuinely providing employment for tradespeople that would not otherwise be provided. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister of State to consider splitting the difference between his figure and the figures proposed by Deputy Doherty and me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have discussed the matters at length, but I make one point that has not been made but was sparked by Deputy Michael McGrath's comment. One could argue the opposite of what the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is arguing. Somebody might be more likely to make bigger refurbishments or adaptations to his or her house anyway, to use the Minister of State's criteria, because he or she has more money whereas those on the margin are perhaps the ones who are not getting the works done, and it follows that it would be better to bring the threshold down. I take the point that there is a balance to be struck. One does not want to take the threshold down so far that one also gets routine repairs where there is no extra work being drawn into it. However, many of what could be described as reasonably substantial home improvements would fall between the figures, below €5,000 but above the cost of mere day-to-day repairs. I suspect that works in that category, as against the works of those who have a fair bit of money who have not been hit too badly by the recession and can press ahead with more substantial improvement works to their homes, are the ones most likely not to be done at present. On those grounds, the Minister of State should reconsider, perhaps in the Seanad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, why can it not be moved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it counterpoised to amendment No. 5?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I know it was discussed with that amendment, but do we not have to go through the formality of pressing it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Standing Orders are such fun.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 16, line 35, to delete “continuously”.Again, we discussed the matter fairly extensively on Committee Stage. It is hopefully a point of agreement between all of us that we need to do something about long-term unemployment and that we must take measures that avoid people falling into long-term unemployment or help them to get out of long-term unemployment and back into work. The tax relief proposed for unemployed people who start a new business is a reasonable proposal.However, I have a difficulty with the requirement that somebody be unemployed for 12 months before he or she can avail of the relief. There is a big problem not just with this relief but also with a number of schemes targeted at the long-term unemployed. There is a requirement that one must be unemployed for a certain period in order to avail of benefits. The alternative would be to allow people to join schemes immediately on losing their jobs so as to prevent them from becoming unemployed for protracted periods. As we all know and as I suspect the Minister of State would acknowledge, the longer one is employed, the more difficult it is to get back to work. It creates anomalies and causes frustration for people. They identify a certain scheme such as the back-to-education scheme which might help them to further their careers or return to work only to be told they cannot join until they have been out of work for one year. Is that not pretty stupid? Since the State has to pay for somebody who is unemployed, why should it not give relief immediately to somebody who wants to do something? Thus, there would be a chance that one would not have to become dependent on social welfare. The Minister of State might say in response that the State must take specific measures to help those who are out of work for longer periods. I agree and believe special assistance and various measures are needed in this regard, but I do not believe the Government's approach is the way to achieve this. In response to Deputy Pearse Doherty the Minister of State made a point on singling out particular groups, in this case the disabled. He has said the tax code does not work in the way described and that it should be more general. He has also said it cannot be discriminatory in the way described, yet that is precisely the nature of the relief under discussion. It involves the tax code discriminating by stipulating somebody unemployed for more than 12 months can avail of a relief to enable him or her to return to work while, somebody unemployed for six months cannot do so. The latter must remain another six months in unemployment before being able to benefit. That does not make sense. The Minister of State must think of other ways to address the specific problem faced by those who become long-term unemployed through no fault of their own. In so far as the Government is providing a tax incentive designed to prevent people from falling into unemployment or to get them back to work, it should make the relief available to anybody who is unemployed. As soon as a person loses his or her job, he or she should be able to avail of a range of schemes to help him or her to return to work rather than having to wait 12 months to get support.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had an interesting debate and it has given me much to think about as we moved through the different Stages of the Bill. However, the more often I hear the Minister of State's case on this particular issue, the less I agree with it. His main argument against my proposals is the very implausible suggestion that a person might give up his or her job in order, the next day, to avail of a scheme which, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, is fairly marginal in its likely impact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay; we will call it very modest. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was very frank in his acknowledgment at the committee that several of the initiatives he has brought forward are experiments which may or may not work. That is an honest approach. Given the scale of the crisis we face, we have no choice but to thrash out different ideas and schemes and give them our best shot. It is in this spirit that I put it to the Minister of State that what he just said does not stack up. I cannot envisage a scenario in which somebody would give up a job in order to avail of this scheme. It is simply not plausible. The issue is one of deciding to whom this modest scheme should be available. Just as it is wrong in the case of other schemes administered by the Department of Social Protection, including the back-to-education allowance, it is wrong in this instance to stipulate that applicants must be unemployed for 12 months before they can avail of it. That does not make sense. I cannot count the number of times people have come into my clinic lamenting this bizarre requirement and saying how much they want to get back to work. The last thing they want is to slide into a situation in which unemployment becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and they become depressed and less motivated to return to work. When people lose their job, their first instinct is to get back into the workforce immediately. I agree with the Minister of State in so far as he is arguing that this scheme should be aligned with other social protection measures, but my argument is that the latter must also be changed. We should not have a time lag for eligibility of 12 months in any instance. Instead, we must try to get people back to work as soon as possible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister took the opportunity to trumpet the Government's successes and initiatives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to disagree on the there-is-no-money argument and agree to use a different language when it comes to profit and entrepreneurship. I accept people want to get back to work and it is largely through no fault of their own that they do not have jobs. If the Minister of State wants to blame Fianna Fáil for that, then that is fine by me too. When someone loses their job, are we telling them they have to wait 12 months for us to give them a hand getting back to work? I believe we should not. I am proposing that there should be no time gap through this amendment. While I accept this would need to be aligned with the Department of Social Protection, we can start it here with the Finance (No. 2) Bill. I accept there are issues with those who end up long-term unemployed but this should be addressed separately. We need to give those with energy and enthusiasm, those who are used to earning a living, the opportunity to get back into work instead of telling them they have to wait six or eight months to be eligible for this relief. A clenching point in accepting my amendment is that it would not cost the Government anything. In fact, it costs the Government to keep people on social welfare. If someone wants to get back to work, then the tax break under this scheme will not cost the Government anything in the end. The amendment is the correct approach and the Minister of State should concede as he has no arguments for not accepting it. Amendment declared lost. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had some discussion on this. The initial proposal was an absolutely wrong and disproportionate hit at single parents, mainly single fathers, who do not live full-time with their children, but who play a considerable role in looking after them and who take responsibility for them. As I pointed out to the Minister, the proposal was indicative of a conservative perspective on the family that fails to recognise families have changed. The modern family is not the sort of nuclear family of the de Valera period, which involved two parents living together with their children. We have different types of families now and this must be recognised. Deputy O'Sullivan was right to challenge in committee the language used, which used the terms "primary" and "secondary". I should have done the same. I have been thinking about these terms and have realised these terms refer to my situation. I am a so-called "secondary" carer as I am a father who does not live full-time with his children, but who plays a full part in my children's lives. I do so to the greatest possible extent, financially, personally and every other way and I get on very well with their mother, my ex-partner. The language used in the legislation is problematic in that it creates a hierarchy in a situation where two parents happen to be separated and one of the parents has the children living with him or her full-time while the other does not. The number of days proposed in the legislation - 100 days - requiring the carer to have the child living with him full-time could be problematic. I mentioned the issue of parents who are out of the country, but I suppose those parents who are out of the country might not get the tax relief. More realistically, what about where a parent is required to live and work in a different part of the country? That parent could be on the phone to his children every day and could be having them stay with him every weekend that is possible, but because of school and work commitments and so on, there could be long periods of time when that parent does not see his children. This does not mean he is not playing a huge role in their lives or not paying maintenance etc. The legislation fails to recognise the human reality of many modern families. I accept the Government has acknowledged some of the anomalies in the proposals and has tried to address them, but the legislation still does not go far enough. For example, the requirement for the secondary claimant to have the children resident with him for 100 days is problematic. There will be cases where fathers or parents who play a big role in their children's lives - not a secondary role, but who do not live with the children - will be hit unfairly by what is being proposed. My amendment tries to nuance this slightly by reducing the requirement to 50 days, although I do not think this is satisfactory. I also suggest that the proposal should not hit parents where the parent manifestly plays a substantial role in the care and financial maintenance of the child.  My proposal is not perfect because, as Deputy Doherty said, we were told of the deadline for amendments, the day before the deadline. I accept that although the deadline was 11 a.m., we were allowed to submit them somewhat later, but we had a very short time to work out a complicated problem. There is recognition by those who represent single parents that there are problems with the current situation. We need to work on that, but what the Government is doing is unfair. It is neither right nor satisfactory. We were put in a position where we had no choice but to lash in whatever amendments we could at the last minute to meet the deadlines. This is not a satisfactory way to deal with the serious issue confronting families. We must remember that at the heart of these families are children and that it is these children who will be hit as a result of this. Much of the cost will fall back on the State, in so far as maintenance payments may be reduced. This will impact on social welfare payments, rent allowance payments and various other areas. The proposal has not been thought out fully and must be re-examined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I listen to this debate, I am becoming more frustrated and angry about the way in which this issue is being addressed. I keep thinking I am the single parent about whom the Minister of State is talking because I do not live full-time with my children. He makes comparisons with cohabiting couples who have been hammered by cuts in child benefit, income reductions and other changes. It would be a damn good idea to consider tax breaks that took account of the general costs hard-pressed parents pay in bringing up children. However, the Minister of State should not use comparisons with cohabiting couples to justify a cruel attack on one particular group. As Deputy Pearse Doherty noted, €200 per month is a big chunk of money for the vast majority of those who have benefited from this tax credit. There is a major issue in this regard. Irrespective of how many days of the year my children spend with me, I must have somewhere for them to stay.Whether it is the Minister of State's 100 days or fewer, where are they going to sleep when they come to stay? Are they to sleep in a box? One must have a bigger house. Both sets of parents must have a place for the children to stay, and that generates an extra cost. The Minister's provision completely fails to take typical situations into account. For example, there are cases of working parents in which the single father would take the children every second weekend. Such fathers cannot take the children during the week because they are at school, and they take them every second weekend. The parents alternate but they make big financial contributions, and then the fathers would go to see their children during the week for half a day, for instance, to go to a football match or to go out shopping, and take them for extra days at the holiday period. Such parents might not fit into the Minister of State's criteria, but they incur significant extra costs because a key feature of ferrying children back and forth in that situation is extra transport costs that one would not have to pay for otherwise. The Minister of State is not taking these matters into account; he is hitting at a group of persons in a big way and, by extension, no doubt he is hitting at the children. It means parents will see their children less. That will be the effect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I make a point of order on this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No discussion. I am not revisiting the debate, just making a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendments tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath and me are insertions, so I do not understand why they were not dealt with separately from amendments that propose deletions. I can understand how amendments proposing to delete a provision of the Government's legislation are directly counter to one another and that the amendments fall if the words stay, but I do not understand how an amendment that proposes to insert something new, and not to delete something the Government has said, is not voted on as a separate matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very briefly, with respect-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surely I am allowed to make-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendment does not propose that they do not stand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendment does not ask that the words do not stand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe in health insurance at all. As I listened to the discussion with Deputy Naughten and heard about all the problems and anomalies that can develop, it made me realise what a load of nonsense it all is. It is the irrational working out of a two-tier system in which one gets better health cover if one has money than if one does not. That is a rotten idea. Universal health insurance sounds good, but the key word is “insurance”. What the public hear is “universal health”, and they like the sound of that, but they do not get the bit at the end - that is, “insurance” - which involves private insurance companies that want to make money. That is the real agenda. The extreme manifestation of the system is in the United States, where more money is spent on health than anywhere else yet tens of millions of people do not get proper health cover because vast amounts of money are eaten up by the private health insurance companies in administration and billing. It is a complete waste and has nothing to do with delivering health care. In principle, I am against all of that. However, we must deal with the sad reality that the alternative to privatising the provision of health care via the insurance market is a national health system which is paid for through progressive taxation based on one’s ability to pay. It is simple, because the money comes out of income tax and one does not have administration, the billing, the waste, and all the millions spent on advertising or corporate branding, none of which has anything to do with health. One just gets the health service. Is it not blatantly obvious that such a system would be far better? However, we do not do that. What we are doing is slashing the public health system and forcing people who would much rather go to a decent public hospital and not have to wait on a trolley or spend a year on a waiting list for a procedure to take out health insurance that they cannot really afford because they are terrified of having to deal with the bargain-basement version of health care that one gets in the public system. Ironically, in a way, the Government then goes after those people. It punishes them for taking out an insurance policy against having to deal with the chaos the Government has left in the public health system. The Government then hits such people, which is rotten. It is another significant hit for people whom even Fine Gael purport to represent. My amendment is an attempt to minimise the damage the Government is doing and the cost that will be imposed on people. I agree with Deputy Naughten that this measure will tip many people over the edge and they will not be able to afford health insurance any more. In many cases, such people will not go to hospital when they are sick. They will hold back. Many people are doing that already because it just costs too much. Because they do not have a medical card they do not go to the doctor, or else they wait until they are really in pain or more sick than they would otherwise have been if they had not had to take into account the financial imposition involved in going to hospital. The measure is completely retrograde. My amendment is merely an attempt to minimise the damage. This is another example of how the Government must completely reassess its thinking on how we provide a health service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mind; I just wonder how it works. I get pulled up on protocol fast enough. It is ironic that the Minister used the argument one would expect us to use about subsidies for private health insurance to justify what he is doing. I agree with him, if the other side of that equation were a significant upgrading and increase in resourcing for the public system, so that we are not subsidising a two-tier system, which is wrong. The vast majority of people who take out private health insurance do not want to be in a two-tier system but feel forced to, and now the Minister is punishing them because he will not do what is necessary - that is, fund a proper national health service through progressive taxation. It is interesting to hear the Minister go through it. The Minister cuts public health budgets. He also cuts subsidies to private health insurance, which will hit the middle group. When we say there is no elasticity in private health insurance, that means the very rich will always be able to afford it. The people in the middle, who are just above the threshold but not rich, take it out because they feel they have to. In many cases they cannot really afford it and this is just enough to push them into a situation in which they feel they cannot afford it. People may feel they have particular ailments and therefore they need health insurance. Simultaneously, the Minister is reducing medical card entitlements, so many of those people who might be entitled to medical cards will not get them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The net effect is that the private health insurance companies will make more money from the rich people who can afford private health insurance while everybody else will be pushed back on the public system as they cannot afford it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes; I was approximately ten seconds over time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly endorse Deputy Broughan's comment regarding the media and so on. He is absolutely right. He might be interested to know that I received a strongly worded letter from the gentlemen I mentioned yesterday about certain comments I made about him in the Dáil. These people certainly know how to pursue their agenda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not apologise. The Minister of State must be joking. We end up batting back and forth with claim and counter-claim about the impacts of budgets. I am convinced that as a result of measures taken by the Government, the gap between rich and poor is growing. I do not believe everybody is feeling the pain to the same extent.There is a fair bit of evidence that corporate profits are increasing, and the value of financial and property assets are also increasing, according to the CSO, but we are told everybody is feeling the pain in the same way. I do not believe it for one minute, but the Minister of State states that it is true that everybody is feeling it equally and we go around in circles. Why do we not have an agreed basis for assessing the impact? We could then let the public assess whether the parties here actually care about issues such as equality and the impact on vulnerable groups or whether it is rhetoric. If we have an agreed basis for assessing these things, that would allow an objective judgment by the public on the impact of various measures. I commend the civil society and anti-poverty groups who have pushed the agenda of equality budgeting, but we need to specifically add into this mix anti-poverty budgeting. We can have equality and prosperity and we can also have equality and misery. Equality and misery is not much good, so we need to include in the criteria and indices the extent to which measures push people into poverty. We also need agreed definitions of poverty based on real consultation with civil society and various stakeholders so we do not have to have these ridiculous arguments. To my mind it is blatantly obvious that poverty is increasing as a result of the measures being taken, but let us have objective criteria to assess these matters.
