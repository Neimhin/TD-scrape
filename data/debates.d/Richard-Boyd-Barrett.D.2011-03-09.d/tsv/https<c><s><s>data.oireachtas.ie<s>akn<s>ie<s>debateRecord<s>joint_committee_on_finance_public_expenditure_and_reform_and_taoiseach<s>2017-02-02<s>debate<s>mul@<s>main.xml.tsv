RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to follow up on the previous round of questions. The Minister should know the answers to these questions because he has decided to appeal a Commission ruling which states that we are owed €13 billion plus interest, money this State could do with. I want to know, and I suspect many in the wider public want to know, why the Minister decided to pay millions of euro to lawyers to ensure we do not get €13 billion when an EU Commissioner came here this week and explained in very simple and convincing terms why that €13 billion is owed to this State. It is entirely reasonable to ask on what basis the Minister has made that decision because she made a very simple argument to the effect it is not credible to allocate profits to a company that has no real existence, no economic activity, no employees and no office. That is the basis of her case. We are owed an explanation for why the Minister thinks there is some problem with that because it is self-evident that these companies did not have an economic existence, yet Revenue thought it acceptable to allocate and record profits in a company that has no real existence and the Minister is willing to go to court to defend that decision and say no to €13 billion. Can he please explain that to us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not based on facilitating tax evasion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The explanation for why Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour might have decided to support the appeal is of course that they were all in government over the years that this took place and if the ruling goes against the Government and Apple, they are all implicated in this.That is why they have decided to vote against it. The Minister has not given an argument that is in any way convincing or could be understood by lay members of the public, who have a big stake in this given that the sum in question is €13 billion, as to why he believes the Commissioner was incorrect in her basic assertion. Ironically, the representatives of the various parties on this committee tried to impugn her motives and suggest she was being political when, in fact, she was very convincing in saying she was just looking at the matter on the basis of the state aid rules. Instead, individuals were suggesting this was really about an assault on Ireland's corporate tax rate and implying the Commission and other states in the European Union were jealous. This is blurring the issue and being political. Even in the Minister's response just now to me, he said we are doing what we are doing because it is in the best interest of Ireland. Surely when dealing with a matter as serious as this, the decision should be based on what the Minister believes to be the truth about it. It should not be a case of acting in a partisan way, regardless of the truth, to do what the Minister believes is in the best interest of the State. Amazingly, he believes refusing €13 billion is in the best interest of the State. How can the Minister seriously suggest it is reasonable for Apple's profits to be allocated to a company that has no existence? That was the essence of the matter. The Minister still has not answered the question. On the question of the other states in Europe being owed moneys, it could not be a question of the American sales because they are dealt with elsewhere, as Deputy Doherty said. What the Commissioner said is that any other state is free to make a claim on the €13 billion but it would have to provide the evidence. The fact is that no other state in Europe has made a claim on it. No figures were provided. The Commissioner said that, as a consequence, the only place to which the profits could reasonably be allocated was a company with a real economic existence, that is, the company that was tax resident here in Ireland. It was stated the profits should have been booked and taxed here and that it was not reasonable to allocate them to a company that had no existence and was tax resident nowhere.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The IP does not rest in the United States.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was incorporated in Ireland in a ghost company operating out of a company that was tax resident here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is difficult to contain one's frustration in all of this. In my case, I put forward a motion to this committee in 2013 asking that Apple representatives be brought in to answer some of these questions. The Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour parties all banded together to ensure that it did not happen. They even turned off the cameras while we were discussing it. This is the frustration that some of us must put up with in trying to get to the bottom of this. I understand that the Revenue representatives have some constraints but I hope they will tell us as much as they can. Is it Revenue's responsibility to identify loopholes, possible tax evasion and possible tax avoidance and to bring it to the attention of the Government?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know this. Time is very short and I do not wish to be rude, but I understand those distinctions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Revenue not have any obligation if Ireland is being used in some way? Any company that is incorporated in Ireland is using Ireland in some sense. For example, the witness mentioned earlier how Ireland is ultimately under the jurisdiction of the European Court as a member of the European Union. Does Revenue not feel any responsibility or obligation whatsoever if Ireland is being used in some way to facilitate tax avoidance or evasion, or in exploiting loopholes? Does Revenue not feel any obligation to flag that whatsoever?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not really what I asked Mr. Cody, in fairness, and my time is extremely limited here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not asking Mr. Cody what Revenue does. I am asking him a very direct question: does he feel an obligation to do anything if he believes a company is in any way using Ireland to exploit loopholes to evade or avoid tax or does he simply say that if it does not affect us, we are not bothered? It is a very simple question, in fairness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. The suggestion, which is very clear and which I think Mr. Cody understands fully, is that all of us find it simply incredible - not credible - that Revenue did not notice quite some time ago, long before 2013, that a company that was incorporated here was stateless, that the profits from a company that did have a real economic presence here were being siphoned into the stateless company and that those taxes were therefore not being paid anywhere.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Revenue did not flag it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point. Mr. Cody is saying the US Administration knew beforehand. If any reasonable person saw that an incorporated company was either resident in the Cayman Islands or stateless - certainly if Revenue did - he or she would think there was something going on there. We are a little surprised that Revenue did not flag this - or did Revenue flag it way back when, when it became apparent that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Mr. Cody to remind me, as a matter of interest, when the criteria of ownership and control, the distinction between a tax resident and an incorporated body, were introduced in legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will move onto another aspect of this because one can come at it from many different ways. If Niall Cody develops a phone and holds the intellectual property for that phone and if he sells the intellectual property to me, the profits I generate from selling the phone accrue to me, do they not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did Apple Inc. have the intellectual property rights for the sales of Apple products in Europe, Africa and Asia? Mr. Cody referred to them and kept saying, as the Minister has said, that we know Apple Inc. was managed in and controlled from the United States and that that is where the intellectual property was developed. However, it is irrelevant whether it was developed there. The issue is who had the intellectual property rights for the sales in Europe, Africa and Asia.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who did have them? A company incorporated in Ireland but not tax-resident in Ireland had them. Is that not the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will move onto that, but I think we have clearly established that Apple Inc. did not, so it is a complete red herring for anybody to talk about it developing the intellectual property or in any way the tax being owed to it because it had sold the intellectual property to another company, which was incorporated in Ireland but not tax-resident in Ireland. Mr. Cody himself referred to ASI carrying out "routine functions". These are almost the same words as Commissioner Vestager's. The question is how Revenue established ASI was carrying out any functions when it had no staff, no office-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, the branch, which has thousands of employees, an office, a headquarters and so on, is a branch of this company that holds the intellectual property rights but which has no staff and no office, and Mr. Cody says it carries out routine functions. What routine functions does it carry out if it has no staff and no office?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am reading from his statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It refers to "these routine functions."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I fail to believe or find credible is that Revenue could accept from Apple that this company, which is incorporated here but not tax-resident here, has any economic reality that would allow the branch to allocate the profits to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask Mr. Cody a very short question about that? My time is nearly up. Even on that basis, which I do not accept-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not accept that it is credible-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept it as credible. Even on that basis - and I think this is more or less what the CCTB attempts to do - even when Revenue was trying to assess what the Cork branch did, I think a reasonable understanding of this is that there is a place where the intellectual property is developed, then there is a hub for selling that intellectual property and then there are the countries into which those sales are made. Would Mr. Cody accept that Cork, the Irish branch, was the hub for doing that selling? Nobody else could have done it because there was no staff and so on. Therefore, when Mr. Cody refers to what they did, is that not what they do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does Revenue-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
