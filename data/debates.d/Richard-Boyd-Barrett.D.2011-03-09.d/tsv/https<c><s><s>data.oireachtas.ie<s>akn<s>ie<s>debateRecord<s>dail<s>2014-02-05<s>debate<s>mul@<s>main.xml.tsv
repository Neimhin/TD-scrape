RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The worrying rise of sectarian violence, confrontation and attacks in the North in recent years, most recently during the flag protests, is an indictment of the failure of the structures established under the Belfast Agreement, the failure of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and the failure of the political architects of the Agreement in the North, Britain and the South.There is a conventional narrative about the peace process in the North which is that visionary politicians from Ireland, North and South, and from Britain dragged a reluctant population into some sort of peace agreement. I have never accepted that narrative and always thought that it was the other way around. Ordinary people in the North had had enough of communal violence. Catholic people, irrespective of whether they supported the republican movement and its struggle, realised that the armed struggle had hit a cul de sac and could go no further. Ordinary Protestants were sickened by sectarian and communal violence and wanted an alternative to it. Only months before the cessation of hostilities, people will remember the massive walk-out from Harland and Wolff by Catholic and Protestant workers after the shooting of Maurice O'Kane. Protestants and Catholics who were disgusted by sectarian violence appealed to political parties in the North, Britain and here to come up with a solution. The solution they came up with was the Belfast Agreement. Now, more than a decade later, we have to ask if that agreement brought an end to sectarianism. Is it capable of bringing an end to sectarianism or has it, in fact, institutionalised sectarianism in the North? I think the jury has come in on that; it has institutionalised it. The structure of the Northern Ireland Assembly is almost exactly the same as that which was established in the Lebanon with such disastrous consequences at the end of the First World War. It encouraged sectarian conflict in the Lebanon which festered with disastrous consequences and continues to do so because everything is based on communal and sectarian quotas.  In the North, everybody has to designate themselves as either Nationalist or Unionist, while the other category is completely marginalised in any important decisions. Therefore everything is a communal balancing act between two communities. Indicative of this is the fact that the number of peace walls - in actuality, they are separation walls - has doubled since the peace agreement was signed. Sectarian violence continues to fester and spills over in particular because of the failure of the Northern Ireland political institutions to deliver the promised peace dividend. People expected that the agreement would improve the lives of ordinary people in the North but it has failed to do so. Unemployment, poverty and the housing crisis all persist. In Protestant areas the levels of deprivation have significantly increased. Whereas in past decades, Protestant workers could have expected jobs in the big manufacturing industries, these have now gone, so levels of deprivation and poverty have risen. There is a perception, encouraged by sectarian politicians, among alienated deprived Protestant communities that Catholics are benefiting from the arrangements. That is not true, of course, because the levels of unemployment and deprivation are still higher in Catholic areas than in Protestant ones, but they are rising more rapidly in Protestant areas. Third level education is an example of this. There are twice as many Catholics as Protestants in third level education in the North. This is indicative of the rise in deprivation in Protestant areas. This situation is being fuelled further by neo-liberal attacks such as the cuts that were mentioned, the raising of the pension age and talk of introducing a spare bedroom tax. Disgracefully, there is also talk of abolishing the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, thus essentially privatising social housing. I understand that none of the major parties in the North has protested against that. It is worth stating that the whole conflict in the North started with battles over housing. We are now abandoning the Northern Ireland Housing Executive in favour of a more sectarian way of allocating housing, which will fuel sectarianism. We need to break from communal politics, which have failed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Donnelly on his excellent work in putting the Bill together. The Government’s response is extraordinarily disappointing if not entirely unpredictable. There is a very clear pattern with the Government. It is one it shares with the previous Government, namely, that it will move hell and high water to protect big corporate and financial interests but when people come forward and attempt to suggest things that would assist, support or to use the jargon of the day, bail out, the small business – the people at the bottom of the pile - it is just not interested. The excuses the Government puts forward for not allowing the Bill to continue to the next Stage are utterly bogus. They truly smack of political cynicism on the part of the Government because the Ministers know quite well that to say the very least there is a debate on the two main objections that have been raised, which could be had on Committee Stage and Report Stage. The Government has far from given a conclusive rebuttal to Deputy Donnelly but it will not allow the debate to happen. The Ministers just snigger away, as they always do. When we criticise the Government we are told that all we ever do is criticise the Government and we are asked why we do not bring forward our own positive proposals. When we bring forward positive proposals the Government rubbishes them, dismisses them and ignores them. That is the cynicism of the Government. It is ironic that a socialist has to get up and attack the Government over its failure to take seriously the plight of small and medium enterprise. There is an irony. The Government bangs on about it but does absolutely nothing. The Bill is a well thought-out concrete proposal to assist small and medium enterprise and the Minister just dismisses it out of hand with entirely bogus arguments. Deputy Donnelly explained on Leaders’ Questions this morning, as others have done tonight, why the creditors would benefit from moving to a cheaper, more streamlined and easier to access examiner process. It is because it would make it more likely that the company that owes them money would stay in business. Is it not blatantly obvious that if the company that owes one money stays in business there is a better chance one will get one’s money back? A child could work that one out yet the Minister gives a rubbish argument about how he is defending the small creditors who have been crucified, yet the Government has done virtually nothing for them. Small and medium businesses have been crushed and crucified and the Minister is not doing much to change that.Similarly, as Deputy Joan Collins rightly said, the Minister fell back on the old chestnut of property rights, the Constitution and legal advice without even furnishing it to us. Not challenging that interpretation, as Deputy Pringle said, is laughable. It is no surprise to see the two Ministers opposite, Deputies Sherlock and Bruton, laughing now because they do not take these matters seriously. It is all a game to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does speak to the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just explained how the Minister’s main argument against the Bill is to defend creditors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Members opposite are cynical, petty politicians who do not give a hoot about the people they claim to represent. They dismiss positive suggestions and will not even allow them to be discussed further. They have also dismissed out of hand suggestions we might examine a regime of differential rates to give a break to small and medium-sized enterprises.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have made umpteen submissions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a pity the Minister keeps interrupting me. The Government’s response was sad but predictable.
