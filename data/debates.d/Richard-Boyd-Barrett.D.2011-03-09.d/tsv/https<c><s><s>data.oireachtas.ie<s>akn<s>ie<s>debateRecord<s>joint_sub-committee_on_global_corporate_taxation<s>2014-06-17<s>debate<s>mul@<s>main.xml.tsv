RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank both witnesses for their attendance and highly illuminating submissions.  Is Ms O'Brien's argument not that we are being held hostage by multinational companies and we have no choice but to submit to their blackmail?  Is it reasonable or sustainable for an economy to operate in such a manner and that, out of fear that multinational companies will up sticks and leave, we must tread softly in terms of how we treat them as we seek to ensure they pay a reasonable contribution to the State and society that facilitate them in making so much profit?  Is Ms O'Brien not stating in polite language that we must accept blackmail because multinational companies are essentially blackmailing us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms O'Brien made that point very well already.  If I were to translate the technical language she uses into layman's language, is she not stating that we are submitting to blackmail out of fear that companies will leg it if we try to force them to make a slightly greater contribution to the economy?  Is that not really what is taking place?  Is it not the case that if one submits in this way, one becomes part of a race to the bottom?  Ms O'Brien has acknowledged the statement made by Deputy Michael McGrath, who, unlike me, is a great supporter of our corporate tax regime, that investment is already beginning to migrate elsewhere because other locations are joining the race to the bottom to generate revenue from corporations.  Even if we bend our knees and submit to the multinational companies, as Ireland has done, these companies will still move elsewhere because everyone else will join the race and bend their knees even further.  Is that not what is happening?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To draw an analogy, is that not like the argument about nuclear disarmament: we are all in favour of it and will get involved in a long process of negotiating it but meanwhile we had better build as many nuclear weapons as we can?  We are talking about getting a new international framework but there is a race to the bottom in respect of corporate tax, to the advantage of the multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not as optimistic as Ms O'Brien.  The G8 was dealing with global poverty and inequality ten or 15 years ago.  We have not seen much movement on that front.  I admire Ms O’Brien’s optimism.  I commend Professor Stewart on challenging the consensus in this area.  What he has said today is very important.  It runs counter to everything that is being asserted by mainstream commentators, the Government, and the political establishment.  They say there is nothing to see here in the way of low effective rates.  Professor Stewart says there is.  Can he confirm that the general rule for allocating profits in Ireland and internationally is that if a company is incorporated in a particular place it pays tax in a particular place but this does not apply in Ireland in respect of multinationals?  There is a more favourable regime for them.  This is central to how they avoid paying tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Professor Stewart saying that the people advising the Department of Finance in this area are people who have a vested interest in interpretation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Three cheers for that perspective.  I could not agree more with Professor Stewart.  We make one law for domestic industries and another for multinationals in the area of tax liability.  Does this also apply to the taxes registered in Ireland, for example, those on the Department’s tables which show a pre-tax profit of €70 billion and €4 billion paid in tax?  There is some debate about how the effective rate applies to this as well.  I would calculate tax paid as a proportion of gross profit, which shows an effective rate of 6.4% whereas others maintain it is much closer to 12.5% because there are deductions and allowances and so on.  How would Professor Stewart compare that with the treatment of the ordinary PAYE taxpayer?  Is the effective rate calculated in a much more favourable way for companies than for the ordinary taxpayer who does not get a lot of allowances, reductions and write-offs before the tax liability is decided?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one can afford, which few can, to hire high-powered accountants and tax experts to minimise one’s tax liability, one can do very well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an important cross-over between what is declared and what is not liable for tax because it is not resident here, in the money paid as administrative expenses to shelf companies for the use of patents and software and so on.  Can Professor Stewart give us his opinion on how to tackle that?  Professor Stewart says the law is very straightforward most of the time, in that if a company is incorporated here it is liable here and all the money would be allocated here but without legislation could the Revenue Commissioners view the rules differently?  Any reasonable person looking at the companies we are talking about would say this money is not being made in the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands, if it is to be allocated anywhere it should be here.Within the existing rules they should be allocating those profits to Ireland. Is that what any reasonable person would presume?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To cut a long story short, there has been a very heated debate on the issue of the effective rate.  In Professor Stewart's opinion as an expert in this area, the effective rate more reasonably calculated and studied is closer to the 2% that has been alleged than the 11.9% being claimed by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is quite a different view from that articulated by Ms O'Brien.  A reasonable assessment of the effective rate would actually put it closer because the normal rule is if a company is incorporated in a place, it is taxed there.  While it can be interpreted as that is what the Government and the Department of Finance are doing, if one is being consistent
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In Ms O'Brien's view is the way we are defining residency reasonable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Ms O'Brien seriously believe that these companies we are discussing are managed and controlled from the Cayman Islands?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the case of one of the companies at the centre of much discussion at the weekend it was discovered it does not even have offices in the alleged place.  However, Ms O'Brien thinks it is a reasonable proposition to suggest that a company that does not have offices in a place is actually managed and controlled from that place.
