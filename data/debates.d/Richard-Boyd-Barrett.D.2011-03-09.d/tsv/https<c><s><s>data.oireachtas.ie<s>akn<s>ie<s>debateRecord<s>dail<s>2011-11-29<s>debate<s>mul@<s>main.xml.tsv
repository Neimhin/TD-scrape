RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister be making the statement in the House?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the opportunity also to express my sympathies on the Taoiseach's family loss.Does it give the Taoiseach any pause for thought in implementing the policies of austerity dictated by the troika, given the massive mobilisation that will take place in the North of Ireland tomorrow which will see 80,000 to 100,000 public sector workers come out against attempts to essentially cut their pay and increase their pension contributions to pay for an economic crisis they did not create?  This will be an unprecedented mobilisation in the North and across Britain of people, our nearest neighbours, who are saying they are not accepting this and that it is not right or just that ordinary workers should have to pay for a crisis other people created.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the proximity of these events make the Taoiseach pause for thought in that we are pursuing the same policies here and imposing the same unfairness on public sector workers, other workers and vulnerable sectors of society?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was that discussed at the Ministerial Council meeting?I would also like to ask about the Aughnacloy to Derry upgrade.  It is lamentable that the State is pulling back from these infrastructural projects.  Given that there is some level of commitment to continue with this project, can the Taoiseach investigate suggestions made by some of our party colleagues in Derry that there are serious questions to be answered about the huge expenditure on consultants that has been sanctioned to date both by the Northern Ireland Executive and by ourselves, in so far as we have any involvement in it?  We are talking about millions of euro going to big consultancy firms.  The Government should look into how money is being spent on these infrastructural projects, who is getting the money and what precisely these consultants are doing for a project that has not yet moved one inch.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, are we discussing the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I wish to comment on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is part of the proposal.  Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the second or third proposal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think they know that by now but I appreciate the point.  It is completely unacceptable to impose a guillotine on this Bill.  The financial emergency measures are taken in the context of the current economic crisis that we are facing.  We all agree that emergency measures are necessary but one must have time to debate them.  People throughout the House will have ideas about what is in the Bill and what should be in the Bill.  We want time to hear and consider the debate and to put forward amendments and suggestions for the type of financial emergency measures we need to deal with the current economic situation.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to lift the guillotine and to allow for a proper debate and proper consideration of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could relate to other measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are other matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody pays tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except Denis O'Brien.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everything Deputy Durkan says is wrong, but we do not interrupt him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Catherine Murphy, and I eagerly await the barracking from the other side.There is a pattern developing with this Government in the legislation it proposes and the statements of policy it outlines.  It tries to tap into the huge sense of outrage felt by ordinary working people, the less well off, the lower and middle income earners in our society, who cannot get over the injustice of being forced to pay such a severe price for an economic crisis that was caused by others.  Whether it was the last Government, this Government, the troika or the hallowed markets, all of these people insist that they keep paying year after year with vicious and brutal austerity.That is the view outside this House and the Minister knows this.  He knows that people are outraged.  He knows that one of the causes of that injustice was the gross inequality in the distribution of wealth and earnings in our society.  Another cause was an economic system that actively promoted inequality and an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor, and between the high earners and the low earners.The mentality at the top which thought it was okay to earn €400,000 per annum, €600,000, €700,000, or €2-3 million per annum, was the same mentality that led us to the catastrophic crisis in which we find ourselves now.  Meanwhile people in the public sector were chasing the chief executives of the large corporate firms who were on obscene salaries.  They suggested that they should be paid the same because they had to discuss and negotiate with them and that if the bankers were getting €1 million per year then the head of the NTMA should get €500,000 or €600,000 per year.Such was the logic driving the top of our society and the system generally in Europe and throughout the world.  There were obscene salaries and pension arrangements at the top leading to extreme inequalities in wealth.  It is important to note that this is not simply a gross injustice, although it is certainly that, but it is the major reason for the economic crisis.  It is a fact that this grossly unequal distribution of earnings and wealth that has accumulated over time has lead to a situation where the behaviour of 1% of the population dictated the economic fate of everyone else.That is what led us into this mess.  Do we not know this?  Have we not realised, based on CSO figures and the Credit Suisse global wealth report, that 1% of people in this country have an estimated €131 billion in wealth?  Following the crash, a mere 1% of the Irish population has €131 billion in wealth.  A total of 50% of this is held in financial assets, not even in property.  This remains the situation and this is what must be addressed.  These are the emergency measures we need.  We must ensure that people believe there is some intent towards fairness in dealing with this crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those at the top who had grossly inflated earnings and a vast accumulation of wealth used that wealth, their position and their earnings to drive an economic agenda that has crashed our economy and the entire European economy.  People want to know that we are serious about doing something rather than offering tokens and it seems to me this is tokenistic.  The Government knows there is anger with high earners and it has decided on some measures and has made a song and dance about them.  It held a referendum but it related only to judges and it provides for tokenistic reductions to €200,000 for the politicians or some top civil servants but it does not really address the problem.This gives those in Government cover to claim that they are being even-handed and it attempts to justify the real agenda which will be meted out on Monday and Tuesday of next week when the Government will lay into social welfare recipients and the lowest income families, either in the form of cuts in child benefit or rent allowance, increases in VAT or whatever nasty, socially regressive austerity measures the Government decides is the best way to implement the diktats of the EU-IMF group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose that it is absolutely unjustifiable for anyone paid from the public purse to earn one cent more than €100,000.  It is unacceptable——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is five times the earnings of someone on social welfare who has lost their job through no fault of their own not enough?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is five times that figure not enough?  Is five times the earnings of the worker who has lost their job through no fault of their own not enough?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would go further on pensions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should let me finish.  He had his chance and he will get his chance again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have argued for an earnings figure of €100,000 for five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, we should not mix up this figure with appropriate pension limits.  The pension of a public sector worker earning €100,000 will be approximately €50,000.  I propose no more than €50,000 for pensioners.  Is that not enough for the Minister or for the heads of the semi-State companies or top civil servants?  It is extraordinary that we do not have emergency measures to get back these vast pay-outs and lump sums to the heads of the NTMA and Departments and so on.  Where are the emergency measures to do so?  Where is the will and energy of the Government to go after these people?I see no justification for these people to continue to get these payments.  One individual will get €147,000 per year.  This is unbelievable when people are being slaughtered at the bottom.  There is no justification for people to earn more than three or four times the average industrial wage.  Do such people honestly believe they are worth five, six or ten times more than a nurse in an accident and emergency unit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am keen for someone to explain and justify that.  However, this speaks to the bigger issue.  It is not simply about the pensions and pay of public servants but the lack of willingness of the Government to take emergency measures to go after the wealthy.  Where is the wealth tax?  Earlier, I referred to a sum of €131 billion owned by 1% of the population.  If we include the top 5% then this figure becomes greater than €200 billion.  Can we not simply place an emergency levy on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, not on farm land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our proposal is simple and does not relate to private residences, it is limited to assets worth more than €1 million and not to farm assets worth less than €5 million.  As I pointed out to the Minister, the financial assets make up approximately one half of the figure of €131 billion to which I referred and the figure is rising.  These assets have risen significantly in recent years.  The money is there and there is a pot of gold despite the Minister's denial of its existence.  However, the Minister will not go after it because he invited those who have the pot of gold and who live as tax exiles to advise the country on how to get out of the economic crisis at the global forum on economic recovery.  That says it all.  The Government is willing to slaughter the people at the bottom and continues to adulate the tax exiles and billionaires, who became billionaires through dubious circumstances.  Let us put it no stronger than that.  Why not take the measures that the United States, hardly a haven of revolutionary socialism, has taken in terms of tax exiles?  Serious measures were put in place there.  Why does the Minister not consider what the United States has done in terms of tax exiles and provide for emergency legislation to recoup some of their money?I propose a cap on public sector pay of €100,000 to include executives, chief executives and politicians; a cap on public sector pensions of €50,000; that the Government should go after the tax exiles and provide the necessary emergency legislation to do so; and the imposition of a super levy on the super wealthy.  I believe such a measure should be ongoing but in the context of the current economic crisis could we not demand such a super levy?  Dare I mention the sacred cow of corporation tax?  Could we not tax profitable multinationals or such firms as Tesco on an emergency basis?  Should they not be asked to make an emergency contribution to the country's economic plight?  Would such firms really run away if we put in place a levy for a few years on their vast profits which run into ten of millions and billions of euro?  These are measures the Government could take if it were serious but, naturally, it is not serious and the real business will be done to ordinary people on Tuesday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Technical reasons are always given to explain why people at the top cannot be brought into the net.  On the other hand, it is always possible to bring those at the bottom into the net.  I do not understand this and I do not accept that if there is a will, a way cannot be found.  The Government is arguing that it has the will to do this, but it is technically difficult to find a way.  It does not seem to be technically difficult to hit the people at the very bottom.  I disagree with the level at which the Fianna Fáil Party is pitching this.  There is a certain irony in its belated conversion to reducing the salaries of people at the top of the public service.  The basic principle underpinning what it is saying — that we should consider imposing caps on the earnings of anybody who is paid with public money, including people across the public service — is absolutely correct.  It is disappointing that the Minister is putting technical obstacles in the way of this proposal.  My response to all that has been said about retrospective legislation is that such legislation has been introduced in the UK.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can change our Constitution.  The lesson to be extrapolated from the recent referendum on judicial pay is that people want the salaries of top earners who are paid with public money to be reduced.  The Minister knows that is the case.  It is why he proposed the referendum.  The people did not concern themselves with the detail.  They accepted the principle that the salaries of people at the top of the public service who are paid excessively should be reduced.  That is why they voted in favour of the proposal.  The people would have no problem voting in favour of a constitutional amendment that would open the way for similar reductions to be imposed on officials in semi-State companies and people who previously served in the public sector.  The Minister knows that people would back him if he had a serious intent to amend the Constitution in that regard.  The problem is that the will is not there.  I appeal to the Labour Party, in particular, to recognise the sense of injustice that is felt by people.  He should show some measure of willingness to extend——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking on the proposal to extend this principle across all sectors of the public service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to establish the principle that the pay of everyone who is paid with public money should be capped.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not all doctors are that greedy.
