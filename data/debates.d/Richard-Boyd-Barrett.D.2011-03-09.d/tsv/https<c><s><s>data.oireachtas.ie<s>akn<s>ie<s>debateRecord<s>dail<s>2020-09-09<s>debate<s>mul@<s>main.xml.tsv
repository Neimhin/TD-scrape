RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By any standard, the students who enter higher education in 2020 will have a very greatly diminished student experience. Against that background, it is completely unjustifiable to charge the highest student contribution fee in Europe. It is completely unjustifiable to charge students anything at all but to charge them €3,000 a year when they have no ability to get part-time work, their family incomes may have been hit and they will have a diminished student experience is unacceptable. The Minister should abolish or dramatically reduce those fees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Germany, Iceland, France, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Slovenia and the Czech Republic have no student contribution fees. Spain, a country that was hammered by austerity, has an annual student contribution fee of €500 yet we are charging €3,000. Now we are going to be charging that for a hugely diminished third level experience for the class of 2020. Any additional funding is welcome but the key metric is funding per student. Under various Fine Gael Governments, that has dropped by 43%. The numbers in higher education are going up. They have doubled since 2000 and another 40,000 additional students in higher education are projected over the next decade. The actual funding per student has crashed. If the Minister wants to know why there is a mental health difficulty, at least part of the answer is the enormous pressure and stress, financial and otherwise, put on students because of the chronic underfunding of higher education.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just pointed out a number of European countries where they do not have a contribution fee. That is the standard we should reach rather than having the highest fees. The level of investment per student in this country for most categories of students is less than the amount of public investment into horses. I like horses but I prefer students. I think they are more important and they add something very significant over their lifetimes additional to Exchequer revenues and so on. We need to dramatically increase the investment. Where could the Minister get it? I will give him a simple idea. I have said this many times. Some €700 million and rising is going in research and development tax relief to a handful of multinational corporations that are already supremely profitable. Has anybody done a cost-benefit analysis of whether that €700 million is better going to Google, Facebook and Apple or to our public universities? I bet no one has but we should. I think we would find it would be a lot more socially and economically beneficial to this country.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need a referendum on the right to housing. I submitted a Bill to that effect, looking to change Article 43 of the Constitution to delimit the rights of private property in order to vindicate the right to affordable, dignified and appropriate housing for all in the last couple of weeks. The Taoiseach should support that Bill and fast-track the move towards a referendum. The scandal of land hoarding and sitting on empty buildings was an outrage prior to Covid but now it is absolutely unjustifiable. I will give an example of why this is important. I met a woman who I would say was in her 80s on South Great George's Street. This was during the height of the lockdown. She pulled me aside and said she wanted me to walk up Aungier Street and look at a block on that street to see the disgrace of a line of buildings sitting empty for a decade at least that could be used to house people in the south inner city where there is desperate overcrowding and many people on housing lists.I met a social worker who works in that area on the street on the way in today and he told me there has been a Covid-19 outbreak there today. He pointed out that his community centre, where social distancing was possible, will close down because property developers want to develop the site. The problem is evident in that little microcosm. Private property ownership by landlords, developers or speculators is preventing the development of sites that could be used for housing in an area where there is chronic overcrowding in the social housing sector and where there is a lack of social housing. That property should just be taken by the State to provide the housing people need in the area. Instead, it is sitting there taunting people who are now suffering Covid-19 outbreaks. What are they supposed to do if they are in overcrowded housing where two or three generations - as is happening all over the place - are living cheek by jowl? How do they socially distance or self-isolate where there is Covid-19? We need aggressive action and the Constitution needs to be amended to say that private property rights cannot trump the need for immediate action to take property, refurbish it and provide housing for people who need it so they do not have to live in overcrowded, dangerous and unhealthy conditions.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Imperial arrogance is the stock in trade of the British Tory establishment. Johnson's announcement of his intention to breach international law is very much in line with that rotten and arrogant tradition but it is also a direct snub and insult to the Taoiseach and to the people of this country. It is a reckless and dangerous assertion by Boris Johnson. It endangers peace and stability in this country and once again summons up the prospect of hard borders and all the conflict that can ensue. The Taoiseach needs to be very clear and very tough with Mr. Johnson in stating that he is not accepting this and that his recklessness is not going to lead to hard borders. I believe this is further evidence of the need to start talking openly about the need to end partition, for a Border poll and about the unsustainability of partition. There has never been a better time to make that case, when there is such a rotten Prime Minister as Boris Johnson, who embodies the worst of British imperial arrogance. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Rural Independent Group for putting forward this motion. It seeks to achieve exactly what our amendment to the Bill last week sought to do, namely, remove the emergency power being given to the Minister to make regulations which have not been properly debated or scrutinised in this House penal offences. It is a very wide-ranging and draconian power which we do not believe the Minister should have. This is not just about regulations in pubs. It is about whether we should give powers to a Minister and, in particular, a Government which has, frankly, made a mess of communicating public health guidelines and is losing the faith of the public in terms of the rationale, consistency, purpose and effectiveness of their public health strategy. It is also about an Opposition that is, for the most part, also inconsistent and, frankly, confusing in the position it is taking. Last Thursday, we proposed an amendment to the Government's legislation. I scratched my head the next day when I saw Deputies from Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and the Social Democrats who voted with the Government jumping up and down decrying the very powers they had given the Minister as bonkers when they voted to give him these powers. It is quite extraordinary and it is still not clear to me which way they will vote on the motion. What is at stake are very important civil liberties issues.  People who have been listening to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response should listen to what the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the Law Society have said about their concerns about the inability of the Government to communicate its public health messages and the blurring of the lines between what is a legal offence and what are public health guidelines and concerns. The ICCL opposed the criminal sanctions with regard to movement in the early phases of the pandemic and was worried about the significant criminal sanctions attached to ongoing regulations and the right to protest, the lack of clarity around policing of those protests, the obligations on organisers, the hooding of detainees and the unnecessary and inappropriate pub regulations and their proportionality. One can go down through the list. There is a real problem. Members of the public have shown themselves to be ahead of the Government when it comes to adhering to public health guidelines when they understand the rationale behind them. The idea that it is okay to open the pubs, but that we may not be able to have a sister over to a house and to do so might be made a criminal offence does not make sense to people. When the State puts people into overcrowded housing conditions, direct provision centres and so on it is not committing an offence whereas having more than six people in one's house might be. It makes no sense. We do not believe that Minister should have powers to, essentially, make things penal offences on a whim. We should explain the rationale behind regulations, educate the public and bring them with us and listen to them to determine what is necessary in order to effectively combat this virus, rather than giving draconian powers to the Minister for Health.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We just witnessed another reason the manipulation of the speaking order is very regressive step. The senior Minister has left before the opening spokespeople of four different groups in the Parliament will have a chance to put points to him, whereas he has heard three or four from his own party before that. It is a disgrace. In the two minutes I have left I will say this: the Minister questioned some of the Opposition over pointing to the inconsistencies in the guidelines and the messages and he says that we have the information, we know and we should not be pointing things out. That is not true. We do not know what NPHET thinks. More important, we do not know what the experts and scientists on the expert advisory group, which advises NPHET, think. I have been saying this since March. Fianna Fáil were backing us in this point beforehand when I asked for the expert advisory group, that is, the actual scientists, to publish their minutes. They eventually published a few of them. Does the House know how far behind they are on those minutes so that we know what they are thinking about all these measures? The latest minutes were published at the end of June. That is how much of a gap there is between the considerations of the scientists and experts and our knowledge. The latest NPHET minutes were published on 12 August. We, therefore, have no clue what the experts think and whether it bears any relationship whatsoever to the ham-fisted, contradictory, inconsistent guidelines, communications and statements from the Minister. The result is we are losing faith and the people are losing faith in the Covid-19 strategy of the Government as infections rise. Let us consider even the publication of information today about private houses. This information states that we can open the pubs and do not need to worry because it is all in private houses. I thought: how did it get into the private houses? Did it come through the walls? Did it magically appear? No. As Professor Sam McConkey helpfully pointed out on the news, it probably came from work or whatever. Are we gathering that information? No.The HSE's data hub has next to no information. We have no clue where the community transmissions are coming from because we do not gather the information. That suggests that the contact tracing system is a mess because we are not gathering the data that would allow us to track and trace the virus.
