RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not suggesting for one minute that this piece of legislation is the solution to the housing crisis or homelessness. This Bill is simply a measure to ensure that people in the most desperate situations, who are victims of the failure of successive Governments and housing authorities, are not further persecuted and victimised beyond what they have had to endure so far from the lack of long-term solutions to the housing and homelessness crisis. It cannot be described as anything else. People are now putting sprinkler systems to sprinkle cold water on homeless people lying under doorways outside shops or businesses. As if it is not bad enough that their lives are in danger or that, when they ring an emergency number, they cannot get accommodation which they are not terrified to go into because of the drug use and alcohol problems in hostels and the fear that their clothes and goods will be stolen, meaning they are forced to sleep on the street, they then have to face the humiliation and indignity of a sprinkler system set up to sprinkle cold water on them while they are sleeping on the streets in winter. In other cases, spikes, bars and other barriers are put up to prevent them finding some sort of shelter from the cold and the elements. I will not believe the credentials of the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy English, or the Taoiseach until we get an apology for statements made in the past couple of weeks on this unprecedented homeless crisis. The Taoiseach should not tell us he has compassion or that the Opposition does not have a monopoly on compassion. He should apologise for suggesting the homelessness situation in this country is somehow normal by international standards. That minimises a shocking and unacceptable crisis. The Minister of State, Deputy English, suggested that those who continue to protest and shout out about the homelessness crisis are somehow damaging our international reputation. What a shocking attempt to turn the tables on those who are calling out the failure of the Government and the authorities to deal with this obscenity. Is the Minister going to demand an apology from Eileen Gleeson of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, who made the extraordinary statement that people ended up homeless as a result of years of bad behaviour? That is a shocking statement for anyone to make, or for Conor Skehan, head of the Housing Agency to talk about homelessness in this country being normal. If that is the attitude at the top, a situation which is already disastrous is destined to get worse. There should be apologies for this. The Government should pull back from this cynical and obviously orchestrated campaign, probably run by the strategic communications unit, to try to minimise the crisis. The Government needs to face up to it and do anything possible to stop the further persecution, suffering and hardship of people who are at the sharp end of this catastrophic failure by housing and governmental authorities. That is all this Bill does. Beyond that, it allows for the right of advocacy groups, the homeless themselves and others to oppose planning permission for anti-homeless measures - the phrase itself is extraordinary. What will happen if we do not stop these anti-homeless measures is that we will get more deaths. If someone cannot sleep under a shelter that exists at the side of an office building or shopping centre, or under a bridge at a canal, where will he or she end up sleeping? Will this person magically get somewhere to stay? No, he or she will not. This person will end up sleeping in an even more dark, dingy, dangerous, unhealthy environment, down a back lane where we know that the likelihood of death is greatly increased, and deaths will increase significantly. That is what this specific measure proposes: it is to end the further persecution of the homeless. Beyond that we are saying that the solution to this crisis is a massive increase in directly provided council housing on public land, rent controls that bring rent down to affordable levels, where rents are set at levels to prevent vulture funds or unscrupulous landlords from increasing rents to unaffordable levels, and stopping economic evictions by landlords or vulture funds. I will conclude by answering why we keep going on about council housing. I have heard the Government's response, which accuses us of only wanting to talk about council housing but that it is providing other types of social housing which is just as good. It is not just as good. There is a reason we are going on about council housing and its miserable levels of delivery. Can the Minister answer how many council houses were built in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is one of the best performing areas for meeting the Government's targets? There were six. There are 6,000 people on the housing list and that will be 10,000 by the end of the year. Last year the council managed to build 54, so the figure is decreasing but it looks better because we have approved housing bodies and more Part 5 schemes. That is not good enough and I will give a few examples why that is the case. Nicola is 13 years on rent allowance and after all that time she is 98th on the list. She has four children, of 13 years, nine years, three years and one eight months. All four children are in one bedroom. The mother's bedroom is too small for even the travel cot that the eight month old is in. The three year old is also in a cot which is far too big for the room and the 13 and nine year olds are in bunks and have to get dressed in the one bathroom. They have no hope of getting housed. She does not want to get a HAP, which is social housing, because at least the landlord of this rotten, insufficient, over-crowded place happens to be a not-bad landlord who will not evict her. If she goes to a HAP house that could be slightly bigger, she could be evicted and homeless again within weeks because HAP is not like a council house. One can be evicted from it and people are regularly. In the case of the Joyce family, there had been ten of them in a two bedroom house. Most of the members of that family have been in and out of homeless accommodation all their lives. Kayley, who is one of the children in the family, and is now a mother herself, decided that emergency accommodation would be better than living in those overcrowded conditions, with ten people over three generations in a chronically overcrowded house. Sarah Jane has four children. Her sister, who also had four children, passed away and now she looks after eight children in a three bedroom house and no garden. She is in an approved housing body house. The problem in this case is that it is not possible to transfer from approved housing bodies to a council house because of overcrowding. HAP is not like a council house. It does not give the sort of security, support and back-up that a council house provides. That is why we keep going on about council houses, but the Government continues to resist building them or is doing so in miserable numbers even though, as highlighted last week, we have sufficient land to build 38,000 council houses, where last year the Government built 400. The targets are miserable compared to demand. That is the solution: the Government must start using public land and resources to build council houses so we adopt a serious long-term solution to this crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then why does Fr. Peter McVerry support this Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are just telling the Minister that Peter McVerry supports the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am always suspicious of capital allowances, given what has been happening with capital allowances in other areas, for example, the scandal of the intangible assets, which we will discuss later. Anyway, a range of other allowances are simply mechanisms through which profitable enterprises avoid tax and reduce their tax liabilities. I assume the logic the Minister is putting forward in this case is that these allowances should be given because of a major shortage in child care capacity. I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say on that point. There are insufficient child care places and we need more. Therefore, the Minister is encouraging greater provision. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the point. Is it only for employers? Is it simply for workplace-based child care? Does it apply to investment in child care places generally, including businesses providing child care? Who exactly is getting the tax break? Even if providing more child care places is a laudable motive that we should encourage, what is to stop it being abused? I presume the other measure is about encouraging physical fitness and so on, possibly to tackle obesity or address general health. Perhaps the Minister can elaborate on that. What is to stop abuse of the provision? What is to stop people putting in minimal facilities to benefit from the allowance without doing much in terms of providing child care or fitness facilities for employees? Perhaps the Minister can come back on that point. Can the Minister clarify whether it is only applicable to workplaces? Does it apply for more general provision of child care by businesses in that sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I echo Deputy Pearse Doherty's point about introducing detailed amendments at such a late stage when Deputies have not had an opportunity to properly study them. We do not have the explanations that are normally provided in the explanatory memorandum of a Bill, as initiated. While the Minister has an explanation available to him, Opposition Deputies must work out what this proposal, with its various unexplained references to principal Acts and so forth, means. If we are to deal with these types of amendments, we should have an opportunity to read the notes provided to the Minister before the debate. This is also true of other significant Report Stage amendments. The Minister did not answer the question as to whether these allowances are available to people who are in the business of providing child care services or fitness centres. I ask him to clarify this matter. Deputy Doherty's question brought to mind another question which follows on to some extent from the point he made. Must the facilities be made available to all employees free of charge in order that the provider can benefit from the allowances? One could imagine a scenario in which an employer or the top executives of a company build a very nice child care facility for themselves which they do not make available to other employees in the workplace. In such circumstances, the facility would be a major boon for the bosses but of no benefit to the workers. Similarly, one could imagine a nice spanking gym being provided for the executives or owners of a company, which would be of no benefit to general employees. Has provision been made to guard against such a scenario and ensure every employee is a beneficiary of the facilities for which the allowances would be provided?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, we did not receive answers to some of our questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Seriously, it is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a genuine question. If these facilities are charging users, are they businesses within the business?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no way I will allow the amendment to pass unopposed if the Minister does not answer our questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendments have been recommitted previously. We have genuine questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I have some concerns about any possible abuse of this, for the Minister not to consider it when it has been raised on a number of occasions and not try to tie down any possible unintended consequences but to deal with the substance of what Deputy Donnelly is seeking to do would be a gross inequity, given that in many cases vulture funds have been given a tax holiday on rental income or capital gains to the tune of millions. Many of these funds will walk away having paid literally nothing in tax unlike those who are caught up accidentally in a situation which is largely not of their making but the making of another generation of property speculators. That amounts to a supreme irony and inequity. Even if the Minister thinks there is a problem with, or flaws in, this amendment he should explain what he is going to do on the substantive point for the people who are genuinely caught up in this situation through no fault of their own.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a good precedent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was a part of the discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. We have also tabled an amendment. Like Deputy Doherty, I welcome the fact that the Government has acceded to the suggestion that we need a report on a vacant home tax. I will not press our amendment, as the Minister has tabled one, but urgency is critical. I said something on Committee Stage that bears repeating, given that the Minister and the Department will decide how fast to move on this matter. It is immoral that there are, according to the CSO, 180,000 empty units when we are facing a shocking and appalling housing and homelessness crisis. Something that might not be underlined enough is that, also according to the CSO, 65,000 of those houses have been empty for five years. Deputy McGrath cites, and the Minister probably cited them as well on Committee Stage, complexities and various reasons these units are empty. I accept that, but I do not accept 180,000 units being empty when there are people dying on the streets. That is more unacceptable than a few unintended consequences of the measures taken to deal with it. The crisis is beyond any kind of excuse in light of the hardship and suffering it is imposing on people. The main priority is to get people who have no place to live into properties that are sitting empty. I do not believe that a vacant home tax is the only solution to this, given that more needs to be done, but it may be part of the solution. We must find out the status of every empty unit, particularly in areas where the crisis is most acute in terms of homelessness, housing lists that are a decade or more long and where there is nothing available for people on ordinary incomes to rent or buy, and get as many of those units as possible into use as a matter of urgency. While I welcome the Minister's decision to insert an amendment along the lines of the Opposition's proposal, it needs to happen quickly and the wider issue of determining the status of those vacant units and doing everything that is necessary to get people who need homes into them should be a priority for the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We propose to replace the property tax with a landlord tax, which mainly involves wanting to deal with the inequities of the local property tax. In our alternative proposal of a landlord tax, we make a distinction between people who have one additional home and those who own multiple properties and are running a business. A simple distinction could be made in terms of thinking about a vacant home tax. A dispute in a family over an inheritance may mean that a number of family members are involved in legal issues and so on. Vulture funds, major commercial landowners and so on have multiple properties. Once a person owns more than three or four properties, he or she is involved in a business. It is unconscionable that such people are sitting on empty properties. I cannot think of many complexities in a situation whereby someone who owns multiple properties leaves them empty. This is happening on a major scale. In the committee, I cited an example of which I have intimate knowledge in my area, namely, the Robin Hill flats in Balally. NAMA sat on them, as it were, and then flogged them to a vulture fund which sat on them and tried to evict tenants because it was profitable for it to let flats lie empty and appreciate in value. That sort of thing is, quite frankly, disgusting. Urgent action could be taken on that, notwithstanding the need to examine the more complex issues relating to families and individuals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very serious questions have to be asked about the value of this scheme. Property prices are out of control in my area and are completely out of the reach of ordinary working people. It is not just that 6,000 people are waiting for 15 or 18 years on housing lists. Others who cannot even get onto housing lists because their incomes are slightly over the threshold do not have a prayer of buying a house in my area, where average house prices are €400,000 or more.This is no use to them but it is a benefit for people who could afford a house anyway. It is not helping those whom we need to help because it has just increased house prices. They have risen 12.3% so far this year and they are going up approximately 10% per year. This is wiping out any benefit for ordinary people but giving a nice boon to people who could probably afford to buy houses anyway. The scheme has helped drive up property prices, as the Opposition predicted it probably would. We did not do a cost-benefit analysis and there is no real evidence it is doing anything to help the housing crisis. We need to reconsider its point and whether this money would not be far better spent on directly providing the housing we need or in some other way helping the people at the sharp end of the housing crisis. This scheme has not helped; it has, arguably, made things worse. There may be an unintended benefit for the people who do not need it. I do not see an argument for continuing the scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Deputy. I believe the scheme should be abandoned, but at the very least we should have the cost-benefit analysis and the Minister should set out clearly how he is going to monitor the benefits and effectiveness of this. To the minds of a very broad spectrum of opinion, including expert opinion, this is something that has actually contributed to the spiralling house prices. It has accrued no real benefit to those at whom it was to be targeted but has had unintended benefits for people who frankly do not need them. Given the squeeze on resources and the desperate need to put resources where they will actually have an impact on the current housing and homelessness crisis, anything less than a proper cost-benefit analysis of this measure, which costs a lot of public money, is not really acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 25:In page 20, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:“13. The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Dáil a report on the introduction of a Vacant Home Tax.”.I will withdraw the amendment on the basis of the commitment given.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 26:In page 20, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:“13. The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Dáil a report on how he will monitor on an ongoing basis the effectiveness and the value for money of the Help to Buy Scheme.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was on the finance committee when these REITs tax breaks were first introduced. I opposed them from the word go although I did not fully understand what they were, but I knew it was a tax break for people investing in property. I thought it was unbelievable at the time and said so. After the property bubble and the crash that we had gone through and the devastating consequences which it wreaked on the entire country, I found it hard to comprehend that the Government planned to introduce new tax breaks for property.As Deputy Wallace said, the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told us at the time that we needed professional landlords to come in and that this would sort of modernise the property sector and be to the benefit of tenants. As against the dysfunctional property sector that had led to the bubble and the crash, we were going to get a new and improved professional, streamlined property sector. However, that is not what we got. We got another property disaster only a few years after the previous one which produced the worst economic crash in the history of the State. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I find the websites of guys such as Deloitte incredible. I quoted from PwC's website earlier and I will quote from Deloitte's website now. Referring to real estate investment funds and the changes in the Finance Bill 2016, it states not to worry about the changes because "the vast majority of Irish regulated funds continue to be exempt from Irish tax on their income and gains with no Irish tax on payments to non-Irish resident and exempt Irish resident investors". Brilliant. It is brilliant if you are a non-Irish resident or an exempt Irish resident speculator in property because there is no tax on income or gains although income and capital gains in the sector are going through the roof. Last week Hibernia REIT plc had yet another half yearly report on the absolutely unprecedented increase in its profits. Its half yearly profits were up 118% - you could not make it up - and its rental income was up by 31%. They are creaming it off. I-RES REIT plc is similarly creaming it off and making an absolute fortune from the property chaos that is going on in this country due to the mad decision to give tax breaks to these guys and unload all of this property from the banks via NAMA to them. They must think all their birthdays have come at once. They will walk away without paying any tax and the Minister is now letting them know he will close the door. However, it will be long after the horse has bolted, which is no good to anyone. It is no good closing the door after the horse has bolted but that is what is being proposed. We should close the door as soon as possible to try to recover something from the disastrous policies that have brought us to where we are today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My comments are on a similar note. The points were made in the earlier discussion as well. We have a similar amendment. What has happened in recent years in this country is really extraordinary. The approach that Fine Gael and its partners, the Labour Party and the Independent Alliance, have taken to the property sector is quite extraordinary given what had happened previously. We could talk about amnesia. How could anyone think it was a good idea to incentivise property speculators after a bubble and crash that was caused by property speculators? How could anyone think of bringing even bigger property speculators in to replace the mostly-domestic property speculators that helped to produce the crash of 2008? It beggars belief. Those responsible must be literally off their rockers. However, that was a concerted policy for real estate investment trusts and vulture funds. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, or Department officials had 64 meetings with these people in the period when many of the tax changes to benefit these entities were brought in. It was a conscious decision to bring these players in in the belief that it would restore the property sector. The last thing we needed to do was to restore the property sector to enable it to do all of the things that led us to the last property bubble and crash. However, that is what we have done with these tax breaks. As a consequence, rents and property prices are now spiralling out of control. Moreover, there has been a massive hand-over of property assets which, for a brief moment, we had in our hands. That is the awful thing. For a brief moment, via NAMA, we actually had these assets where we needed to have them, that is, in the hands of the State. We could have taken that opportunity and utilised those property assets and the revenues that were derived from them to provide housing and help small and medium-sized enterprises with office space. Had we done that, we would have done society a major favour and we would have prevented the possibility of crazy booms and slumps of the type that have wrecked the country in the past and that are likely to wreck the country again. Instead, we handed over the assets to an even smaller bunch or clique of enormous funds and international property speculators, mostly from the USA. I wish to highlight an additional point that has not been made. We do not even know how much tax is forgone in all of this. That is the other extraordinary fact. In the case of most tax loopholes, allowances and reliefs, we know how much tax is foregone. That allows us to assess whether any benefit arose, and we can carry out a cost-benefit analysis. In this case, for the cost analysis one need only look at the property sector, with the unaffordability of property and rents and the vast profits that keep rising for these entities. However, we cannot even assess the revenue side because we simply do not know. We cannot get figures. The Government cannot even tell us how much tax was forgone. Really, the Mafia could have designed a scheme of the sort that we have seen with NAMA, with the combination and interlocking of the hand-over of NAMA assets with the myriad or array of tax breaks. PricewaterhouseCoopers was the firm that advised these speculators to come into the Irish property market. It referred to the array of tax breaks that will allow certain organisations to walk away paying no tax whatsoever. We do not even know how much that tax foregone is. The figure is in the hundreds of millions of euro, without question. More likely, it is in the billions of euro. The Government cannot even tell us. The least we could do is produce a report on all of this to establish the consequences for the property market, including the residential market, in terms of the taxes forgone. People need a proper explanation and understanding of what the Government has done and what the consequences have been for all of us. That should include the consequences for the economy in a macro sense and for people who must now pay a fortune or who simply cannot afford the prices and rents that these entities are seeking for the properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two Ministers sitting there. The second Minister could answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is another Teachta Dála so he can answer the question. We have withdrawn some previous amendments on foot of commitments by the Government to look at these things and I note the Government has conceded on producing a report on the vacant homes tax. As far as I am concerned, this is part of an array, to use PwC's term, of things that we need to know more information about, for example, what the impact and cost, or benefit for that matter, is to the people of this country. This area is not all of the problem but it is a significant part of the problem. The percentages the Minister of State quotes are slightly misleading because the question is how much property is actually moving at any point in time, and how much of the available property is being grabbed, and the Minister of State also concentrated on particular areas. We see that the combined impact of these entities, along with some of the other entities that are buying up large blocks of property from the banks or from NAMA, is having a very distorting, damaging and adverse effect on the property market. More important than the markets are the people who need housing and accommodation. We need to know what commitments the Government is making to produce a report that will tell us what the impact is on the property sector, and in regard to the taxes paid and the taxes foregone on the various tax breaks that have been given to these entities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 32:In page 30, after line 40, to insert the following:“19.	The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Dáil a report on the impact of Irish Real Estate Funds and Real Estate Investment Trusts on the Irish Property and Housing sector and the effective tax rates on the profits paid by these entities and their shareholders.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 30, after line 40, to insert the following:"19. (1) The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the potential to raise additional Corporation Tax revenue by closing down loopholes, examining the extent, legitimacy and abuse of all corporate tax expenditures, exemptions, allowances and deductions, such as losses forward, R&D tax credits, the Knowledge Development Box, Intra-group Transactions, allowances on Intangible Assets and establishing a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5 per cent on gross trading profits and incomes.(2) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a specific report and comparative study on the relative social and economic benefit of Research and Development Tax Credit expenditures, benefitting private corporations as against the investment of the equivalent funds into Research and Development in public universities.".As we approach midnight it is appropriate that we would discuss the dark side of the Irish tax code, where the wealthiest corporations and the individuals who own them succeed in sucking vast profits using our tax system out of the view of the public and out of the hands of the tax man to enrich themselves to extraordinary levels. Sadly, most of this stays in the dark because the Government and the main opposition party, which acted similarly when it was in Government, have colluded to cover up the extent to which our tax code ensures that some of the most extraordinarily profitable corporations in the world have dodged tax and used Ireland as a base from which to do so. This amendment seeks to require the Government to produce a report which will go through all the tax loopholes, the black holes in the tax code, forensically. These suck out tens of billions in terms of profits made by these corporations out of taxable income through the mechanisms of allowances, deductions and reliefs. These are tax loopholes which I believe were designed deliberately in order to facilitate tax avoidance by these corporations. These are a select group. The European Union found Ireland guilty of state aid but I have no doubt that it was not only in respect of Apple. It was the company which was exposed but more cases will follow. A select group of corporations benefitted from this. They were corporations which had the ear of Ministers for Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach through bodies such as the IFSC Clearing House Group and so on, who more or less wrote Finance Bills in the area of corporate tax, in order to benefit themselves. These are loopholes which, for the most part, do not benefit small and medium enterprise in this country, which do genuinely pay the 12.5% corporate tax rate. These huge spectacularly profitable corporations get away with murder because of the tax loopholes. Seamus Coffey's report is an eye opener on this. I refer particularly to page 120 where he details the extraordinary growth in loopholes. He says figures published by the Revenue Commissioners allow us to get a better insight into the allowances and deductions used to off-set against gross trading profits to arrive at taxable income for the years since 2011. He says that these allowances and deductions have increased from €18.9 billion in 2003 to €97 billion in 2015. That is extraordinary. Most of the jump from €18.9 billion to €97 billion has happened in recent years.Of a whole array of tax breaks, the one most recently exposed is that relating to intangible assets. We have another amendment which deals specifically with that. This tax break benefits big IT corporations such as Apple and Facebook, which, faced with the prospect of the double Irish tax scam being closed down, moved to exploit another tax loophole in respect of tax allowances for the purchase and use of intangible assets. Coincidentally, at exactly the time they were forced, due to popular and political pressure, to move away from the double Irish tax structure, lo and behold another loophole opened up in the form of the intangible assets cap being moved from 80% to 100%. As a result, all of the purchases of intangible assets from one arm of a corporation to another become tax free. There is then an absolutely extraordinary jump from just more than €2.5 billion in allowances in this particular area in 2014 to, I think, €28 billion in one year. This benefits the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google, which move their intellectual property assets around to exploit loopholes that were conveniently opened up for them by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. There are plenty of others as well. The research and development tax credit jumped considerably between 2014 and 2015. Intra-group transactions jumped from €2.9 billion to €9.1 billion in one year. Massive loopholes are opening up all of a sudden to the benefit of these corporations and this is against a background where profits are absolutely going through the roof. They reached the extraordinary level of €149 billion in gross trading profits in 2015, which is double what they were earning only five or six years previously. However, because of these €90 billion worth of allowances, the actual taxable income is reduced to pitifully low levels so that they can avoid billions in tax. These loopholes, and many more I have not had time to mention, need to be investigated. They need to be exposed and closed down. The public needs to know how much money we could have for health, housing and education if they were closed down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be absolutely clear: we want jobs, if there are decent well-paid jobs, from wherever they might come. However, those companies making astronomical profits should pay a fair share in taxes. The Minister has yet again quoted figures to do with effective rates and so on. I will put some figures to the Minister. In 2015 the figure for gross trading profits plus other income equalled €161 billion. The tax paid in that period was €6.2 billion. That is an effective rate of less than 4%. In fact, it is approximately 3.9%. That is not 12.5; it is 3.9%. If the Government charged 12.5% on that, it would get €20 billion. That is what is at stake. We were more modest than that in our pre-budget submission. We simply said that we should close the loopholes to the extent that we would double corporate tax revenue for the Exchequer. That would only bring the minimum effective rate up to 8%. That is modest. The Government could do that even if it had no wish to go as far as we might want to go in terms of taxing these corporations. Why would the Government not do that when everyone knows that these companies are avoiding tax? Why would the Government not close the loopholes to ensure that these companies pay more? All the evidence points to the fact that we facilitate these companies with loopholes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He suggested we could do it by closing the loopholes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we discuss the amendment on intangible assets tomorrow, we will discuss the specifics of one particular loophole. I suggest the Minister read Mr. Seamus Coffey's papers on this issue. He points out, for example, that following their introduction, the other changes in the area of intangible assets provided for in successive budgets from 2009 onwards applied to all claims made under the relevant allowance. This is the first time this has not happened, as the Minister stated the change will only apply in future. Mr. Coffey stated explicitly in his paper that the Minister did not have to make that choice and if he had not made done so and instead applied the 80% rate to all claims made under this measure, it would have generated an additional €1 billion in tax revenue in 2018. That point was not made by us but by Mr. Seamus Coffey in a paper and I will quote the relevant passage tomorrow.
