RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many pressing issues in this increasingly failed State. However, there is no greater emergency than the housing and homelessness emergency. The report of the Constitutional Convention was absolutely clear in its instruction to the Government on the issue of housing. Fully 84% voted at the Convention for the right to housing to be inserted into the Constitution. The Government has done nothing about that. The convention also overwhelmingly voted for all the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to be inserted into the Constitution. Yet, this week, the Government is going to vote down Deputy Pringle's Bill on the matter. Later today, I will bring a Bill to insert the right to housing into the Constitution by referendum. However, the Government refuses to support the insertion of these rights into the Constitution and it intends to vote down the Bill. This is despite the fact that the convention set up by the Taoiseach has called for it. Why on earth were the non-housing related economic, social and cultural rights referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government? It was perfectly right to refer the housing question to the committee but it gave us the disaster that is the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness document. Why were all the other rights demanded in the report referred to the housing committee? What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When are we going to do that?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned the fact that he passed on his sympathies and condolences to Prime Minister May after the atrocious attack in London last week. We all condemn that attack as absolutely murderous and appalling and sympathise with the innocent victims. I wonder how many more of these atrocities have to take place, not just close to us in London or Paris, but also those that continue every single day in Mosul, as we speak, in Syria, where hundreds have been killed in the past week, and in Afghanistan, where 1,400 people have been killed in over 1,000 airstrikes, mostly carried out by the US? How many more of these atrocities, whether in the countries to which I refer - and which are rarely mentioned - or closer to home, as we saw last week, have to occur before somebody such as the Taoiseach says to Theresa May that the best way to stop terrorism is to stop participating in terrorism? We are participating in terrorism by allowing US troops to go through Shannon Airport on their way to kill 1,400 people in Afghanistan, not to mention the 1 million dead in Iraq and a state that is destroyed. The idea that this would stop atrocities in the West has been proven wrong by appalling events like the one that took place last week in London. When is the Taoiseach going to come to the realisation that we need to stop participating in terrorism ourselves or we will continue to be appalled by the sort of atrocious attack we saw last week?

I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.I feel impelled to bring forward this Bill which seeks to insert into the Constitution an imperative to establish specifically the right to secure, affordable, dignified housing appropriate to need for all residents of Ireland and, as part of that, to delimit the right to private property where it is necessary to ensure the common good and vindicate a right to housing for all residents. I believe that is necessary because it has often been cited that the constitutional protections regarding private property are a block to establishing a secure right to housing. That is something of an excuse put forward by political parties of the establishment in this country, mostly Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which wish to protect the rights of landlords, developers and the property-owning class to make money out of property and housing. Nonetheless, it is important to clarify the Constitution and insert this imperative so that it becomes an obligation and duty of any Government to secure what is the most basic right, namely, the right to a secure, dignified and appropriate roof over one's head. This is something the current Government has singularly failed to do, as have previous Fianna Fáil Governments. I was not aware until recently that, at the time of the debate on the Lisbon treaty, one of the derogations the then Fianna Fáil Government sought from the Charter of Fundamental Rights was, incredibly, in respect of the article on the right to housing. This indicates the disposition of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, which we saw last week with their position on Deputy Pringle's Thirty-Fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are absolutely resistant to establishing a right to housing in the Constitution. This is despite the fact that 84% of those involved with the Constitutional Convention, which the Government set up, said they wanted the right to housing to be inserted into the Constitution. Even its own body has injuncted the Government to establish this right. We have an unprecedented housing emergency that gets worse by the day. The Government's plans have utterly failed to address this but it still resists inserting the right to housing in the Constitution. This is the most elementary right. A Government which cannot secure the basic right to put a roof over the heads of our citizens does not deserve to be in office. If it cannot do that, what the hell can it do? It self-evidently cannot do that. Rebuilding Ireland is an abject and utter failure. Every day the situation gets worse. It is all because of the Government’s ideological commitment to private interests which make money from property. Last week, I raised the case of a young homeless woman, Sinead, who was told she had to travel 12 km with her young daughter to Francis Street. In fairness, I did get a call from the Minister because he was obviously embarrassed by this. Sinead is now self-accommodated in a hotel in Dún Laoghaire. However, she told me this morning it is only until 7 April, when she will be left insecure again. Will she be put into squalid tenement housing, as some people are, or accommodation with chronic damp, full of drug users, as others have been? Alternatively, will the State have a legal obligation to give her a secure roof over her head? What about child welfare? The homeless child is subject to all of this. What about the case of Antonia, a woman with two children, whose father suffers from motor neurone disease? She has a four-bed housing need and was granted housing priority in 2012. In the past few weeks, however, she has been given notice to quit by her landlord. When average rents in Dún Laoghaire are €2,300, housing assistance payment, HAP, offers €1,900 for housing which does not exist. This is what is going on. This is the human suffering. Will the Government listen to the Constitutional Convention, take seriously the housing emergency and support this Bill to insert the right to housing into our Constitution?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Tánaiste think it is necessary for senior Garda management, particularly the Garda Commissioner, to enjoy the confidence of the public in order for that Commissioner and management to function effectively? It seems to me that has to be the case. If it is not the case that person is not suitable. Can the Tánaiste honestly tell us with a straight face that the public has confidence in Nóirín O'Sullivan? Is it not the case that, if there is even a whit of truth in the fact that she was involved in a smear campaign against Maurice McCabe, that she is trying to go after Dave Taylor because he blew the whistle or that she failed to act on a culture that could produce 14,700 wrongful convictions and 937,000 fake breath tests, she has to go and heads have to roll right across the board? If that is a possibility – and it is one without prejudging it – can the Tánaiste seriously suggest the public can have confidence while she remains in position? As an extension of that question, we have suggested that Nóirín O'Sullivan be suspended without prejudice since the Maurice McCabe affair. We suggested that was normal practice for public and civil servants. The Tánaiste disputed that when I suggested it a few weeks ago. I then asked in a parliamentary question how many people under the Tánaiste's remit had been suspended without prejudice on full pay and discovered that there were 26. That is the highest number of any Department. Subsequently I asked were they in the Garda or where were they, and despite the normal practice of answering a parliamentary question within four days I received an answer to the effect that the Tánaiste could not answer the question. I suspect a lot of those people who have been suspended on full pay, without prejudice pending investigations are in the Garda. That however does not apply to Nóirín O'Sullivan. Is there one law for Nóirín O'Sullivan and another one for people under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and in the Garda?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying they are allegations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste did not explain why 26 people under her remit have been suspended without prejudice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste will not tell us whether it is in An Garda Síochána. Why was it done?
