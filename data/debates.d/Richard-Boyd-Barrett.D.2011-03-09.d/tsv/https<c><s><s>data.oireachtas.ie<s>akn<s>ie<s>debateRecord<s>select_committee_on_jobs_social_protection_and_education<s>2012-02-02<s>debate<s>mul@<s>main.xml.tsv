RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I protest in the strongest terms at the ruling out of order of the amendments on the Swedish derogation.  It is unacceptable and defeats and undermines - perhaps it is designed to do so - the thrust of the legislation.  The bottom line is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In terms of complying with the EU directive, the thrust of the legislation is set out in Part 2, section 6(1), which reads:the basic working and employment conditions to which an agency worker is entitled shall be the same as the basic working and employment conditions to which--(a) a comparable employee is entitled,This is good, but it is undermined one paragraph later.  We might as well not have the first paragraph.  It is a charge on the State to comply with the directive and treat workers equally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the point in even discussing the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept the Chairman's bona fides in trying to interpret Standing Orders, but this is an EU directive.  Many EU directives, for example, on environmental protection and various other issues inevitably involve a potential cost for the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Chairman seems to be saying is that we are not even allowed to discuss an amendment if a charge could be incurred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the public understands this because it is crazy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The section fundamentally undermines the legislation's purpose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make the same point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These derogations provide a recipe for agencies to circumvent the legislation by hiring workers on a permanent basis.  They will be able to pay people half the normal rate and exclude them from most of the directive's protective provisions.  I can absolutely see that happening.  It will be a bonanza for agencies and the State will be happy because it will have a second tier, yellow pack, reserve workforce which it can bring into the public sector.  Unless we remove these derogations, that is what will happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness to the Minister, it appears as though he is trying to respond to the spirit of the amendments at some level.  However, as with all such matters, one must look closely at and study the fine print.  This is difficult to do when one is flitting from one amendment to another, trying to figure out where one is and one is getting very dizzy.  The Minister appears to be giving a reasonable response, but, obviously, I reserve the Technical Group's right to fine-tune this provision on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a procedural question.  We are strongly opposed to section 6(2).  We have had discussions on some of the other elements and our amendments in this regard have been ruled out of order.  We do not want to agree to the section when that subsection is contained in it.  Do we say "Níl" to it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, the amendment we had related to the Swedish derogation and it has been ruled out of order because of a potential charge on the Exchequer.  We have asked the Minister to consider it as we are not allowed to table the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, we want it out.  We do not want section 6(2) in the Bill because it undermines the legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that the Minister's amendment has made a genuine attempt to deal with the issue of comparators.  As I stated earlier, we will have to look at this closely, although I accept the Minister's remarks in that regard.  The concern we raised is different, and I hope the Minister will take it on board.  We will raise it again on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 27:
In page 10, subsection (4)(c), to delete lines 4 and 5.We have a big problem with this.  Section 7(4)(c)(ii) indicates “in the opinion of the Labour Court, sufficiently representative of agency workers;" and this wording is problematic.  It is very difficult for unions to have majority membership among people employed by agencies, so unions may never be able to reach that criterion of claiming to represent workers employed by agencies.  Unions may often represent the comparable worker in the public or private sector and represent a majority of them but may not - or likely will not - represent the agency workers brought in as comparators.  This is a recipe to deny agency workers union representation and on that basis it should not be included in the Bill. of agency workers;" and this wording is problematic.

This is a recipe to deny agency workers union representation and on that basis it should not be included in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem arises because the section refers to it being sufficiently representative of the agency workers.  If, for example, it was worded to the effect that it was representative of workers in that sector or comparable workers - I would have to think about the wording - that would cover it.  However, it refers specifically to agency workers and being sufficiently representative of the agency workers.  If the Labour Court were to deem that a union is not sufficiently representative specifically of the agency workers, collective agreements that pertain to a workplace or sector would not apply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think so, to be honest.  This matter was raised with us by the UNITE trade union.  The point of this legislation is to ensure the protection of agency workers who are a more vulnerable group of workers, more open to exploitation and abuse by unscrupulous employers because they are not tied and directly employed in a particular established workplace where there is established pay and conditions.  In those established workplaces where pay and conditions are reasonably well established collective agreements would be in place, but agency workers, by their nature, in many cases will not have a collective agreement with the agency because they are a diffuse group of people, not fixed in a workplace where they would have established arrangements with an employer.  To have a requirement that for a union to represent the interest of those workers, it must be sufficiently representative of specifically agency workers effectively means that they will never have union representation or that such representation will occur in very few circumstances.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point.  We have registered the point and the Minister has made his point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As long we can have it considered on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister is acknowledging the points made by Deputy O'Dea and we had tabled a similar amendment in this respect and this is a problem, why would we assent to this section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not flag that amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not accept the section.  We have not accepted it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand.  We are opposed to section 12(2), but if I understand this correctly, I am even more opposed to the Minister's amendment.  Is he withdrawing it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I seek clarification of the Minister's position which I do not understand.  We have a problem with section 12(2), but the Minister has proposed an amendment which is actually worse.  He need not push it if he is acknowledging there is a problem with it.  Why would he press it if there is a problem with it?  I accept that he wants the Bill to be passed, but why is he pressing the amendment?  It is not included in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We oppose the section.
