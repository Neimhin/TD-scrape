RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  They have helped advance somewhat my knowledge of these opaque financial entities.  I will have to think long and hard before I understand everything.  People can call me a Luddite but this is part of the creation of a global casino in speculation.  These money markets are creating a casino in speculation that is at yet another remove from any control or probably understanding of state authorities and the public and, against that background, like on the financial transactions tax, FTT, when the EU recognised that these instruments are dangerous and potentially destabilising for the European economy and want to take some action to regulate it, Ireland yet again says that while we would like to regulate and while we see the need for it, we ask that there not be too much regulation because we might lose out.  That logic will scupper the FTT and has prevented us from imposing it and the same logic is being applied in this opaque area of international financial speculation.  Could Mr. Carrigan respond to that allegation?  The Member, referred to by Deputy Twomey, who has raised alarms about these instruments says that one of the key features at the heart of the financial crisis was the move by banks away from prudential lending practices.  Banks began to lend way more money than they had and when the loans went bad, there was a massive hole. We ended up with a massively destabilised economy and somebody had to pay the piper.  Is this not the same?  Money markets are so far away from prudential banking practices as to be a dangerous example of the over-financialisation of the international economy and we should try to rein them in completely, if not stamp them out.  I do not see the value of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On risk, there are risks that people can see and understand and can say they see the point of them.  For example, they could take a risk in investing in developing renewable energy because we need energy and if they invest in that area, they might develop resources that would be useful for the State and create a few jobs.  That is a risk I can get.  Let us take the risk of investing, for example, in afforestation because that will lead to jobs and the development of an energy source, social housing and so on.  However, this measure facilitates risk in an opaque area.  We do not know what is being lent to whom or for what purpose but it seems primarily to be about speculation on prices going up and down and the value of assets going up and down.  I do not see how that can be anything other than a dangerous activity.  The FTT is a revenue-raising measure but one of the key reasons it was first proposed was to regulate the financial services sector, which many people in Europe rightly said was out of control and needed to be cooled down by imposing a tax on it.  We are out of step with much of Europe in saying this industry should not be regulated too much and an FTT should not be imposed because it could be bad for the Irish Financial Services Centre, even though there is a good reason Europe is pushing both of these measures, which is this industry is potentially dangerous and destabilising and measures need to be taken to control and regulate it.  We seem to be out of step in saying we kind of like the idea but we do not want too much regulation because it might hurt us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have to agree to disagree, because I think this is dangerous.  I shall give a further example to press the point.  Credit unions, very sensibly, do not lend out money that they do not have, because they know it is a dangerous practice.  We have recognised the need to increase core tier 1 capital in banks because the levels were dangerous. They were lending out way too much money as against what they had in capital.  There should be loan-to-deposit ratios which do not become dangerously out of step with one another.  We should recognise the need to move in that direction.  I worry that Mr. Carrigan is essentially saying that the buffer, which seems very similar to having proper capital reserves or proper loan-to-deposit ratios, is not possible.  That buffer is a step towards saying that we should not lend out large amounts of money which we do not really have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a one line question: why does Mr. Carrigan insist that the risks are low?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one brief comment and then a question.  It seems in all of these matters it is a case of the chicken and the egg.  Whether it is corporate tax, financial transaction tax or now shadow banking, we cannot do anything because it is a big international matter anyway and, therefore, we will merely protect our own interests and not worry about the bigger picture.  It means the bigger picture never gets worried about, or there is no effective way for us to do anything about the bigger picture.  I put that forward as a theme that constantly re-emerges.  Given their impact on the global economy, I do not accept that we must sit here and accept these matters.  Are the witnesses saying that Ireland, with its somewhat outlying position in this regard, is acting as a bridge for an American approach to financing the economy, with 80% financed by this shadow banking sector and only 20% by the traditional banking sector, whereas Europe has it the other way around and is seeking greater levels of regulation?  Are we positioning ourselves with an American approach to financing the economy, which is a more deregulated banking system?  That is what we seem to be doing.
