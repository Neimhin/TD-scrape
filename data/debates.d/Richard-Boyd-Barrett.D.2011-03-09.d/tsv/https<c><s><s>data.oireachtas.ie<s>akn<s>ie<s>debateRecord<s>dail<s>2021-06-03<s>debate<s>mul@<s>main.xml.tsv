RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tairgim: "Go léifear an Bille don Dara hUair anois." I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."It is worth noting that we originally tabled this Bill in the previous Dáil in September 2017. At that point, not surprisingly, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voted against it and, as a result, it did not pass. In the context of the earlier debate, let us be absolutely clear: we wanted to put the right to secure, affordable, dignified and appropriate housing into the Constitution and make it a right for every person living in this country. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voted against it. People need to hear that fact. This Bill seeks to delimit the protections given to private property in favour of the common good, which does allow, even under our Constitution, the Government to override private property rights. However, it does not define clearly what the common good is and, specifically, it does not include in it the right to housing as a clear part of the common good and give it priority. This is what we are setting out to do. I will not read all the wording but the Bill states:The State, in particular, recognises the common good as including the right to secure, affordable, dignified housing, appropriate to need, for all the residents of Ireland and shall guarantee this right through its laws, policies and the prioritisation of resources.It goes on to state that we will delimit the right to private property in this regard. Why is this necessary? Why did the Government, or the two major parties in government, oppose it on the previous occasion? The Green Party supported it so it will be interesting to see whether it is consistent with its previous position on trying to get the Bill passed into law to get a referendum so we can insert this right. Why is it important to do this? I will not rehearse the obvious about the absolutely shocking, obscene and outrageous housing and homelessness crisis we have in this country. We only have to walk through the city centre to see the tents of people who are homeless littering the streets. We only have to think of the 100,000 families on housing waiting lists. In my area, they have been on these lists for up to 20 years, waiting for social housing they will never get. We only have to think of the fact that 70% to 80% of working people in this country do not have a prayer of being able to buy a house when property prices have increased by almost 100% over the past seven years. Rents, certainly in my part of Dublin, are now running at an average of €2,000 a month, with €2,500 being common and €3,000 not uncommon. How is anyone supposed to pay for this? It is a disaster. All along, the Government has facilitated the vulture funds and the corporate landlords who are profiting from this crisis. Its policies are designed to facilitate them and prioritise their rights over the right of people to have secure and affordable housing. Today, we had residents from St. Helen's Court protesting. I have raised their case in the Dáil I would say 30 times over the past four years. They are still in the desperate plight they have been in for all that time at the hands of a vulture fund. Vulture funds were invited into this country by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government in 2012 and 2013 and they have profited handsomely from the housing misery people are facing. The residents were protesting today because they are now overholding and have been evicted from where they have lived for years by a vulture fun. They are part of the community. Some of them are elderly and some are unwell. The council is telling them that it has nowhere for them to go and that they will probably have to go to homeless hostels. They are looking for affordable tenancies but cannot find them. The rent they were paying before they were evicted by the vulture fund was €900 a month but the problem is that same landlord can now get €2,000 a month for the same properties. This is why it wants them out. Over the past two years, it tried on five occasions to get them out. Now it has succeeded because the law that protects tenants is not robust enough to deal with the ruthless profit hunger of these vulture funds and the Government does nothing because we cannot interfere with private property rights, that is, the right of corporate landlords and vulture funds to make profit by making other people homeless. This is why we need to change the law and put the right in the Constitution to protect tenants, stop unfair evictions and take action against vulture funds, land hoarders and property speculators who profiteer from the housing misery of other people. The Government has consistently failed to do this because it is dancing to the tune of these landlords.The Irish rich have always got rich through property, through landlordism and through their investments in these kinds of investment vehicles. They now want to move into the public land bank. People are getting very rich from property, and specifically from the housing misery and homelessness of huge numbers of people - those who are in the dire situation of being homeless and those who are trying to get to buy a home or trying to rent something that they can afford. If you are a tenant, there is the constant insecurity that you could be put out on the street. This Bill will remove the obstacles and excuses to taking the effective action we need in order to have rent controls, in order to give security to people and in order that the State will prioritise the resources it has to make housing a basic right for everybody in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not that we want to personalise things in any way or comment on the Minister of State's background or anyone else's but there is absolutely no doubt that the policies that have been pursued are the problem. I first entered the Dáil in 2011, the year Fine Gael and the Labour Party went into government. I have been in the Dáil for ten years now. That Government, under Enda Kenny, in its programme for Government promised to end homelessness in its lifetime, but what followed was not the ending of homelessness but a spiralling out of all control of both homelessness and the housing crisis. Ten years on, the situation is as bad if not worse than ever. In fact, it is very considerably worse. I feel immense frustration on a personal level because from day one when I came into Dáil Éireann, I could see the writing on the wall in terms of the housing crisis that was going to come because of policy decisions that were made in those first couple of years. Problematic policy number one was the decision made in June 2011. I remember the circular so well and I highlighted it in the Dáil but nobody took a blind bit of notice at the time. When I pointed it out, most of the journalists did not even know what RAS meant. The Government had not yet come up with the term HAP. Essentially, the document said that the State was not going to build council houses any more but would provide social housing through RAS. I tried to point out to journalists, who did not know at that point what RAS was, that this would be a disaster. It was a conscious policy because it was linked to the policy of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, of inviting in the vulture funds to refloat the property market. Undoubtedly, the deal with them was that they would be getting money through RAS, which later became HAP, from local authorities because the State would not be building council houses anymore. It was a plan but in whose interests did that plan operate? It self-evidently did not operate in the interests of the 100,000 families who are still on the housing list or of the HAP recipients who are in completely insecure tenancies. It did not operate in the interests of the working people trying to buy an affordable home or the renters who are now paying €2,000 or €2,500 per month. In whose interests did it operate? Who benefited? It is a famous adage - who benefits? It is obvious the people who owned property benefited. The developers, vulture funds and cuckoo funds benefited enormously and it was all set up for them. What was driving them? Was it ideology, belief in the market or was it the fact there are a disproportionate number of landlords in the Dáil? It was a combination of all of these things and it was a disaster, an absolute disaster. The Minister of State used the term "fantasy economics" earlier. When we said at that time, and it was in every budget document we produced from 2012, that we needed to build about 20,000 public and affordable homes every year, we were accused of engaging in fantasy economics. Year in, year out, we were told, "What a load of nonsense." I remember that during one of the first Leaders' Questions debates I ever did in 2012 I warned we were heading back towards the tenement conditions that Seán O'Casey described in his plays at the turn of the last century. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Deputies were rolling in the aisles with laughter. There were hoots of derision that I would even suggest such a thing. I was met with absolute contempt.What was driving me was the housing misery of the people who were coming into my office. It is still driving me and they were out there with me today. The tenants of St. Helen's Court are four years and two vulture funds on. Decent working people are being told by the council that there is nothing for them and they are going into a homeless hostel. I have been citing this example for four years. This is an apartment complex where there are 13 perfectly refurbished apartments sitting empty. The representatives of that vulture fund went into the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to secure the eviction and the barrister representing it said that it was not very pleasant but that his or her client had to maximise the value of the property. The Government allows that. That is the point of this Bill. It is to say that such ruthless greed for profit is not more important than the right of those people not to be put out on the street next week. This Bill will not sort it all out but it will dramatically shift the legal balance in favour of the right to secure affordable housing and it will clear away the excuses the Government has consistently used to say that we cannot have rent controls, stop unjust evictions or take action against all the empty properties that are being sat on by these property owners that one of the other Deputies spoke about when it could be used to house people. We could take aggressive action. Every time we say we need rent controls, we need to stop unfair evictions and we need to take action against the speculators, we are told the Constitution is a blockage. We are proposing therefore to remove that blockage. In addition, the Government needs to accept that the policy approach it has taken has been a disaster, that maybe the left was right and that maybe we need to start to invest in public and affordable housing on our own land and push the vultures, cuckoos and people who see housing as an opportunity to make profit out of the picture.
