RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for their contributions, which I always enjoy and learn from, and I welcome them to the committee. I know that they are reluctant to comment on particular policy proposals but in their report, they are willing to go as far as using the word "appropriate" when it comes to, for example, the decision of the Government to borrow to finance Covid spending. Can the witnesses use the words "appropriate" or "legitimate" when it comes to the issue of wealth taxes as a possible response to the hard choices they say we have to make as a result of the risks that exist including Brexit, Covid, possible changes in the global corporate tax infrastructure and so on? Is it fair to say that it would be appropriate or at least a legitimate thing to consider that rather than continuing to borrow, which we cannot do indefinitely, it might even be more prudent to introduce wealth taxes, as is being done in places such as Argentina, on the back of the Covid crisis?I ask in particular because it is now becoming clear that while some sectors have been very hard hit, others have done well during Covid. Even from the point of view of balancing things up, is the introduction of redistributive taxes to pay for Covid expenditure, additional capital expenditure and so on, rather than borrowing, something that should be actively considered and taken seriously, as it is in other places in the world but rarely here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Barnes for that because I want us to legitimise the debate about wealth taxes, which has generally been considered to be off the radar to date. It is interesting that countries such as Argentina and others are now beginning to introduce these taxes on the back of the Covid-19 crisis. I will press Mr. Barnes further on the question of wealth taxes, although I acknowledge there are limits to what he can say. Borrowing entails borrowing from those who have surplus money, at interest, to make up for the lack of money available to finance necessary expenditure in health or capital expenditure, for example. In the case of wealth taxes, instead of borrowing the money at interest from those with a surplus, one takes it from them. From a prudential point of view, does it not provide better value for the State to take the money from those who have a surplus rather than borrow from them at interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will press Dr. Lawless on that. I take her point. The wealth tax that we in People Before Profit have designed and proposed in our budget submissions excludes the family home but is there not a fairly simple calculation to be done? We have approximately 1.8 million or 1.9 million family homes in the country. We can work out roughly what they are worth on average. If we multiply one by the other, we get what component of property wealth in this country is comprised of family homes and what component is comprised of multiple homes, large tracts of land and other property. Any reasonable assessment of the enormous amount of property wealth will show that the bulk of it is not family homes. Rather, the main part of it, which is growing, is people with multiple properties and large tracts of land. These are not about putting a roof over their heads.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is nearly up, so I might ask a couple of quick questions. A lesson we have learned from Covid is that, if we scrimp on health spending, particularly on capacity, staffing and so on, it can have more dire economic consequences in a health emergency. To a significant extent, our requirement to close down large sections of the economy was linked to the low level of capacity within our health service. That is a calculation that we must start thinking about. We might believe that we should reduce spending because it is fiscally prudent but it might suddenly catch up with us in a major way because we do not have the health capacity, thereby costing us more. Have the witnesses an opinion on reconsidering the relationship between these two matters in terms of whether it is more fiscally prudent to have the health infrastructure, which might cost more initially but save us in the long run? In terms of reviewing our expenditure and so on, I am interested in tax expenditures and the fact that we do not examine them closely enough.Do the witnesses believe it would be important to examine those tax expenditures closely and make a comparison? This committee and its predecessor have heard evidence from an economist - it may have been one of the witnesses, but I cannot remember - that, in general, direct expenditures tend to be better than tax expenditures. What is gained from direct expenditure is more quantifiable whereas tax expenditure is more indirect and can often be a runaway train without anyone being sure what we are getting from it.
