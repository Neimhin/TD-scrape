RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a straightforward, fair and reasonable request that carers, who do an enormous service to this State by caring for the disabled, sick, old and infirm, would be acknowledged and afforded the full benefit of a PRSI contribution. This would mean that when they finish caring, they would be entitled to non-means-tested benefits, which would be fair and would acknowledge the hugely important work they do for the State, work for which the State would have to pay a hell of a lot if carers did not do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although I am not doing so, it would be very reasonable to ask for carers to be paid the minimum wage, at least, for what they do, or alternatively to be paid an amount equivalent to how much it would cost the State to provide home care packages if carers were not doing this full-time caring job. The State is getting this service from carers for €204 a week, or approximately €5 an hour. Rather than asking for carers to be paid the minimum wage, we are calling for all carers to be afforded the full PRSI credit so that they can avail of benefits like jobseeker's benefit or the contributory pension. This is the least we should do for them in light of the very cheap service they perform for the State. Can the Minister respond to that reasonable proposal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the wider-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I take the Minister's point. I am glad to hear he is looking at the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know. Is the Minister saying he is considering giving carers a full entitlement to the credits that would allow them to get non-means-tested payments when they cease caring? Is he going to move towards that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The State could pay the contributions for them in acknowledgement of their service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are the only workers on €5 an hour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chair is very amusing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Michelle Millar report is a damning indictment of the cuts that were imposed on lone parents in the name of so-called labour activation. It clearly indicts the cuts imposed by Deputy Burton as having increased deprivation levels by reducing the incomes of lone parents who go out to work. Will the Minister act on the Millar report, which was commissioned by his Department?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I get to respond?
