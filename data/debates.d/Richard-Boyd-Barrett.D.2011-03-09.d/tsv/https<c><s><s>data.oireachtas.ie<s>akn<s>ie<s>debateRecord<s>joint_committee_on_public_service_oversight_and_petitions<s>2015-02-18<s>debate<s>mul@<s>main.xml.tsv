RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How long do I have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman is giving me licence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister. I wish to follow up on his understanding of neutrality. He has stated this is a foreign policy matter, but it has been put to him that he is part of the Cabinet and that, therefore, there is collective responsibility. In so far as he must adjudicate on the civil safety and security aspects of any application made for the use of civilian airports, in doing so he must also make a certain judgment on what the potential security risk might be and, consequently, not only consider whether he believes a flight would accord with neutrality but also how others who might be security threats might consider it. In deciding whether it is safe to use Shannon Airport, he must consider whether others might consider it a target. It seems it is part of his remit to consider whether it would be in danger for whatever reason, even if he thinks it is all fine in terms of neutrality, as others might not perceive it as such, including those who might want to target the US military in some way. The sheer scale of the numbers of US troops and munitions, in some cases dangerous munitions, which pass through Shannon Airport, particularly in the context of the Iraq and Afghan wars, massively outstrips any other licence or exemption given by the Minister to any other country and means that any outside observer is likely to see us as participating, given that it involves disproportionately US weaponry and US personnel in their millions heading into the theatre of war. Is it not reasonable to be concerned that others might think that, no matter what we may say, we are participating and that consequently Shannon Airport is at risk? The Chairman took certain thoughts from my mind because I was going to use the exact same analogy in terms of somebody coming into a house. I will extend this analogy. Let us say a very good friend of the Minister's, whom he has known for years and trusts and with whom he has very good relations, drops in and states he has guns in the car and is on the way to take out somebody whom he believes is a terrorist. He then states he does not have bombs in the car but has stashed them outside the Minister's property. The Minister would not let this person into the house no matter how well he knew him and how well he trusted him because he would consider it to be participation or support for the action about to be taken. Any reasonable person would say it would amount to participation. If anybody involved in a criminal investigation - if it was not about military issues - was to question the Minister subsequently were he to allow it to happen, he would be considered to be complicit in the conduct of a crime. Is that not the case and is it not how any reasonable outside observer would look at it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach uses them quite a lot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given what the Minister has just said, I will move on to specific issues with regard to the 19 applications he turned down. I want to burrow into this issue a little. The Minister must have had some suspicions. He states we do not search aeroplanes, but for some reason he refused these 19 applications. What he seems to be saying is that generally the reason applications are refused is aeroplanes would be carrying indiscriminate weapons. As opposed to personal guns or rifles which are unloaded, apparently, such aeroplanes would possibly be carrying indiscriminate weapons such as cluster bombs and missiles. For some reason, the authorities, the Department or whoever assessed the risk of what might be carried on board, decided the particular flights might be carrying these things. On what basis did the Minister come to this conclusion? I share his concern, but I wonder why he suspected and refused 19 applications and does not equally suspect all of the others in respect of which he grants permission without having some evidence as to why he singled out these 19 applications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If 2.3 million US troops passed through Shannon Airport, representing the bulk of those who went to Iraq and Afghanistan, because it was the easiest route for them to take, as the Minister rightly pointed out, does it not stretch credibility to believe their weapons and munitions took a longer route around Irish airspace?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about that matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the diplomatic notes to which the Minister refers apply to civil flights?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Regarding military aircraft, it is given by the Americans to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To obtain clarity, as it is all rather confusing, what are the assurances? We do not have diplomatic note assurances in respect of civil aircraft, or do we?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I understand the situation correctly, we receive diplomatic notes in respect of military aircraft-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----with assurances that they are not breaking the rules and that tell us what is or is not on an aircraft. Are we receiving the same assurances and diplomatic notes in respect of civil aircraft?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then what assurances are we receiving that we are being told the truth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are relying, not on a sovereign state, but on a private company to give us accurate information on whether there would be munitions or loaded weapons aboard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A private company.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This seems to be important. It is being asserted that we are receiving solemn assurances from a sovereign state, namely, the United States. We should not be, but we do. It is a high level assurance. Now we are referring to assurances from private companies. Would we accept such assurances in any other arena without performing checks to ensure compliance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have covered most of the ground I wish to cover. When dealing with these matters, is there a different regime for the United States than for other states?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to think of an example. If Cuban, Russian or Israeli flights were to pass through, would we apply the same regime in accepting assurances?
