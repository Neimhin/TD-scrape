RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments are really quite extraordinary. Clearly, the Minister is giving himself draconian powers in advance of the G8 summit. The British Government, the authorities in the North and now, sadly, this Government are party to whipping up a climate of hysteria and fear before the G8 summit, and these amendments are part of creating that climate of fear. It is a cynical strategy of tension in advance of that summit and is designed to discourage legitimate protests and demonstrations against the policies of the G8. That is the reason these amendments are being made at such short notice. That is the context for this Bill and it is why it is entirely legitimate for us to point out that what the Minister should be doing, instead of cynically whipping up a climate of fear to give himself power to discourage and scare people from engaging in legitimate protests against the G8, is facilitating a discussion about the policies of the G8 and how they represent a far more serious threat to human life, the environment and the welfare of citizens throughout the world than any so-called terrorist threat the Minister tries to conjure up to justify this legislation. I will support that assertion. Incredibly, this set of amendments is being tabled at the same time as 3,500 police are being drafted into the North from Britain to create a ring of steel around the G8. Drone airplanes which have been used to wreak death and destruction on thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan are being deployed in the North of Ireland around the G8 summit. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, has announced that a former army base is to be opened to detain protesters and that there will be special sittings of the courts in the North on Sundays. That is absolutely unheard of. To put it in context, the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, which is supporting this, does not even allow children's playgrounds to open on Sundays. Now, it wants courts to open on Sundays in advance of the G8 summit. Against that background, the Minister has brought forward these amendments at the last minute and without proper debate to deal with potential terrorist threats and is using that to justify him having the power to interfere with mobile telephone communications in advance of the summit. He knows that demonstrations will be organised by anti-poverty, environmental and anti-globalisation groups, trade unions and many other groups in civil society against the militarist policies of the G8 and against the policies the G8 use to protect and promote the interests of multinationals and financial speculators at the expense of hundreds of millions of ordinary citizens around the world. Rather than discussing a bogus terrorist threat, the Minister should be discussing the fact that there are 900 million people starving in the world as a result of the policies of the G8. Let us put this in context. At the last G8 summit, a commitment was made to give €20 billion to deal with world poverty. It is a pathetic figure when one compares it, for example, with the €400 billion that are given in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry which is destroying our climate. However, the G8 did not even deliver on the €20 billion commitment. It is a tiny fraction of what the G8 countries spend on weapons and war. The United States, for example, accounts for 41% of all military spending. They are responsible for taking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq and tens of thousands in Afghanistan. They have a massive nuclear arsenal, paid for with trillions of dollars. The Minister talks about the terrorist threat. They are the terrorist threat, and the Minister is putting a ring of steel around them instead of having a serious discussion about who represents the real threat. This is clearly designed to discourage protests, demonstrations and serious debate about the policies of the G8. It is absolutely right in this context to raise the issue of how these superpowers have been facilitating the financial and corporate interests that caused the economic crisis that now besets the globe. We have found more evidence yet again of how these interests are not even paying taxes in this country or any other country to contribute to the societies from which they generate their billions and sometimes trillions in profits, which should be going back into society but are being hoarded by a global, super-wealthy elite. Why is the Minister not discussing the damage that is doing to our economy and society, the damage their militarism is doing to millions of people around the world and how their policies contribute to global poverty and environmental destruction? It is cynical on his part and on the part of the authorities in the North. It is somewhat disappointing that parties in the Northern Assembly, including those which are represented in the Dáil, are not speaking up very loudly against this and demanding that this climate of fear the Minister is trying to whip up be abandoned. The Minister should allow protests and not try to discourage, intimidate or interfere with them.For example, will the Minister use these powers to try to prevent protesters from communicating with one another in advance of the G8 summit in County Fermanagh? We have absolutely no safeguards to suggest he will not abuse these powers in that way. In 2002 I was in Genoa at the G8 summit when a young Italian was murdered by the Italian Carabinieri which ran amok against peaceful protesters protesting against the policies of the attendees at the summit. I hope the Minister will assure us that the authorities of the State and in the North will not abuse their powers and do the same to peaceful protestors in County Fermanagh.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is the one who has a conspiracy theory about terrorist threats.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, will the Acting Chairman confirm that we are being asked to accept the motion in order to allow these amendments to be introduced on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments are an abuse of process as they have nothing to do with the original Bill which deals with money laundering and financing terrorism in what the Minister described as a technical Bill. It is debatable as to whether it is a technical Bill but it certainly has nothing to do with these amendments. Amendments which fundamentally change the Bill’s character and involve giving the Minister for Justice and Equality, as well as his successors, pretty draconian powers by any definition should not be brought in at the last minute or tacked on to a Bill that has nothing to do with the issues they concern. The only explanation for this odd state of affairs where the Minister introduces these extraordinary amendments to a Bill which has nothing to do with the issues in them can be the timing in advance of the forthcoming G8 summit in Fermanagh. There is simply no other reason it would have to be rushed in this way, other than the fact that Minister is meeting a schedule to prepare for the G8 summit. He should at least admit that and tell us why he is in such a rush to bring this legislation which, at the very least whatever he may think, requires serious scrutiny. There is an irony in the Minister accusing others of engaging in conspiracy theories when the whole basis of these amendments is a conspiracy theory that there is a real and imminent threat to cause explosions when there is no basis for such an assertion whatsoever. These supposed threats must be justified by the Minister. He must give us credible evidence that such a threat exists, that these powers are necessary and proportionate, and that they are likely to be effective in dealing with such a threat, if it exists. The Minister, of course, does not want that serious scrutiny of these amendments because that is not the purpose of this Bill. This set of amendments is timed to coincide with the preparations for the G8 summit. It is cynical to engage in this. Will the Minister give us an assurance that these powers will not be abused during the G8 summit or other protests? I do not accept the rationale behind these amendments. I have not heard sufficient argument from the Minister’s side to justify the amendments. Even if I accepted the rationale, should he not make a distinction between a bomb threat, a weapons threat and peaceful protests? The definitions as they stand are vague. They refer to possible threats to human life. How will these be construed? If the Minister said there was credible evidence that people were running around with guns in a particular vicinity threatening lives, then he might have a more credible argument for saying we need these powers. However, the amendments as they stand are much more vague and general than that. As I see it, there is nothing whatsoever in the way these amendments are worded to stop the Minister and the Garda making the decision to turn off mobile phone communications in and around a protest. It is not a conspiracy to suggest that such actions may be considered. I refer again to my experience in Genoa during protests at the 2001 G8 summit. It was not a funny experience as much as the Minister might smile wryly about it. A young man was killed there by Italian police. It produced a huge reaction from the Italian people about what went on. What happened there was absolutely disgraceful. It might be of interest for the Minister to know that the Italian justice Minister directing these actions at the time was Gianfranco Fini, a fascist supporter, an ideology the Minister opposes. What is to stop a Minister in the future abusing these powers? That needs to be discussed and that is why these amendments should not be tacked on in this way. I do not trust the timing or the rationale behind the provisions. There are also serious questions as to how these powers could be abused in the future. They should be debated separately from what the Minister describes as a technical Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the debate. We differ in our views on it but I will respond once more to the points the Minister made and will leave it at that. If I understand him correctly, the Minister seems to be acknowledging that there is a link between the last minute bringing forward of these amendments and the proximity of the G8 summit. I find that timing a serious matter of concern, in particular where things are happening around the G8 summit which I do not believe are justified. It is extraordinary that it has been announced that a military base will be opened in the North to detain, or possibly detain, protestors and that special sittings of the courts will be held on a Sunday. It is really extraordinary that drone planes will be deployed, which we know best as planes deployed in Afghanistan with devastating consequences and around which there are very serious moral questions about their use at all. It is also extraordinary that 3,500 police will be brought over from Britain. Let us be honest, they are not short of police in the North in the first place. It is against this background that the Minister rushes in legislation which gives seriously draconian powers to the Minister to cut off mobile telephone communications if he or she believes there is a serious threat, as defined by him or her. I do not believe these things are coincidental, and the Minister seems to be acknowledging that there is a link. He asked if I was disputing protection for people from attack. Of course, there should be protection. I am opposed to terrorism and to unrepresentative minorities trying to use force to achieve political ends, but I do not believe there is any evidence that such a threat exists to the G8 summit in the North despite the level of mobilisation of security and police forces. In terms of the general level of hysteria being whipped up, these amendments are part of that because the legislation is being rushed through. Why rush it through other than to play our part in creating a certain type of atmosphere around the G8 summit? The big thing one needs to think about is the possibility of a conspiracy, to use the Minister's words, or a potential conspiracy to bomb the G8 summit. Has the Minister any evidence of, or has it been suggested to him by anybody, that such a threat exists that necessitated him rushing these amendments through? I would like to know. If the Minister said we have serious intelligence that such an attack might take place, that certain groups are believed to be active in considering such an attack and that this, therefore, justifies us bringing forward last minute amendments giving us these powers, we would at least have to take the discussion a bit more seriously but he has not said that, nor have I heard it said anywhere else. All we have is police, politicians and governments creating this massive security operation around the meeting of eight individuals. I do not believe it is justified but I believe there is a political purpose to it. I am afraid there is a history of this, and it is not a conspiracy. People in Italy will tell the Minister about a long history of using what is known as the strategy of tension in advance of protests in order to justify big police operations, usually resulting in confrontations at the time of the protests, and to portray protestors as people likely to engage in violent acts, or acts of violent confrontation. It creates a certain atmosphere which is not justified.  People will protest, and I will be one of them. There will be significant mobilisation in the North and in the South but it will be made up of anti-poverty groups, NGOs and trade unionists talking about issues of global poverty, militarisation and so on. We probably disagree on a lot of the issues but they are entirely legitimate points to be made. There is absolutely no doubt that this kind of thing will scare people and I do not think it is justified. I think the Minister and the police in the North know it will scare people when they hear 3,500 police will be mobilised. At a very simple level, if one is a parent and decides one wants to protest but thinks there is a possibility mobile telephone communications could be switched off for six hours while one is in Fermanagh and that there is a possibility one might not be able to telephone one's children if anything happens, there is absolutely no question but that would be a deterrent and certainly some people - maybe this Government - are conscious of that.  This has happened repeatedly around these summits. The Minister said there is evidence of people engaging in violent confrontation at these protests but there is not that much evidence. It is now emerging that the vast majority of the violence in Genoa was orchestrated by the Italian police, including some of the so-called protesters engaged in protests. There are serious investigations into police involvement in stirring up the violence in Genoa. I was there and that was very evident. Police columns came out of nowhere and brutally attacked peaceful protesters with the result that one of them, Carlo Giuliani, was killed. It is not paranoia; there is a record and experience of this. I do not believe this is justified on that basis. The Minister said the words "serious threat" refer specifically to explosion but the point is that he and the police authorities will be the ones who will decide what construes a serious threat.  Over the past decade or so - this is not something the Minister can dispute - there has been a pattern of talking about terrorist threats to justify various extraordinary measures, including massive military interventions, which have had pretty horrendous consequences. It, therefore, concerns me that language is now being bandied around in Ireland. We have a history of conflict in the North, of paramilitary groups and so on and the Minister is right to talk about the anniversary. The vast majority of people in the North do not want violence, which ended precisely because they did not want it.I do not think there is a particular threat from these groups to the G8. Perhaps the Minister might suggest there is evidence of such a threat. If the threat is not coming from them, where else in the country is it coming from? Do we really want to have these draconian powers and create this atmosphere when there is no such threat? I do not know whether the Minister, the American Government or the British Government are pressing for this. I do not know from where the pressure for it is coming. To my mind, it is absolutely unjustified. At the very least, it deserves more serious scrutiny. This should have happened over a longer period. It should not have been rushed just to facilitate the agenda of the G8.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his reply. It is more than three years since four workers were unfairly dismissed and left without redundancy or wages owed to them by Connolly Shoes in Dún Laoghaire, a firm which they had worked for, in some cases, over 30 years. They were dumped on the scrap heap by an unscrupulous employer. The LRC and the EAT, as the Minister said, have found on every occasion, based on the issues that have been brought before them, that the workers were right and the employer was wrong. Yet, three and a half years on, John Mulpeter, who has written to the Minister several times, is still picketing outside the premises. The former director or CEO of Connolly Shoes has set up another shoe business under another name and is still operating, with other employees having replaced those who were unfairly dismissed and forced to picket for the past three years. How can it possibly take so long for workers such as those in Connolly Shoes to get justice? Can we have the Minister's assurance that whatever new regime he is considering setting up will prevent this unacceptable situation happening again, and prevent unscrupulous employers treating workers like this and being able to set up the same business under another guise and carry on with impunity? I note the power of the parliamentary question. John Mulpeter has written to the Minister on several occasions looking for answers and miraculously received a letter yesterday, for which I am sure he is very grateful. He should not have to resort to asking a parliamentary question in order to have a letter answered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the information the Minister has given and his commitment to dealing with these issues. They are applicable not only to the workers at Connolly Footwear, but also those at La Senza, Vita Cortex, Jane Norman and many others. I hope the Minister can prove in the measures he proposes to take that we have a machinery that is capable of delivering justice for workers who are unfairly treated. Looking at the experience of the past two years, one might conclude that the most effective way for workers to obtain justice in these matters is to occupy their place of employment. That seems to be the only means of fast-tracking a fair resolution in these cases. People should not have to do that, just as they should not have to wait three years for a conclusion. I am sure the Connolly Footwear workers are awaiting a verdict with bated breath. Given the duration of this particular case, I hope the Minister will keep an eye on proceedings. He must ensure for the future that there is proper enforcement and compliance in such cases. The measures he is proposing must deliver a system that works in an efficient and timely manner and delivers compliance when employers are found to have behaved wrongly towards their workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Shane Ross, Seamus Healy and Tom Fleming. I wish to comment on the irony of Deputy Nash's contribution, which referred to Stalinists being opposed to the European Union.I remind him that the most prominent former Stalinists in this Parliament are now leading the party of which he is a member. Maybe it is a telling fact that the current leadership of the Labour Party, in their previous incarnation as the Workers' Party, had a slavish commitment to the centralised, totalitarian and undemocratic regimes in Eastern Europe and made regular pilgrimages to Eastern Europe, North Korea and China to kneel before the supposed glories of communism which we all know was a brutal, totalitarian abomination. It seems since their faith in those horrific regimes has collapsed, their belief that there is any alternative to tooth and claw capitalism has collapsed along with it.  Maybe there is a sort of perfect circle in their political trajectory because there are some similarities - I do not want to extend the analogy too far - between the centralised, undemocratic and overbearing communist regimes and the trajectory on which the EU is now beginning to travel. It is increasingly beset with a democratic deficit, where unelected Commissioners, central bankers, European Councils, troikas and all the rest are dictating policy over the heads of ordinary citizens and their elected representatives. Maybe they feel comfortable with the EU as it is currently developing because it reminds them of the good old days of Stalinism.  If there is a worrying growth in the far right in Europe, as there is - people have alluded to it - who is to blame? It is those who are at the helm of the EU and the policies which are being pursued by the EU which created an unprecedented economic crisis and produced a situation whereby we now have 11% unemployment across Europe and far higher levels of unemployment among young people. Some 24 million people are unemployed. It is those conditions of economic crisis, mass unemployment and enormous alienation from the political structures of the EU that are producing a very worrying rise in the far right. The people who should put up their hands and say they have to bear responsibility for this worrying development are those at the helm of the EU.  Let us be absolutely clear. Asking for a review of our relationship with Europe and the policies of the EU is not a statement of wanting to return to some sort of isolated, "go it alone" policy. Rather, it is about questioning the current trajectory and policies of the EU which have led us into the crisis and asking whether should we look at alternative visions of Europe or internationalism.  Let me state clearly for Deputy Nash and anybody else on the other side of the House that I am a thoroughgoing internationalist, as, I believe, are most of those who support the motion. The question is what kind of internationalism and EU do we want. Do we want an EU dominated by corporate interests, bankers and unelected bureaucrats or should it be a social union which prioritises jobs, democracy, environmental protection and sustainable development? That is the Europe we were told in treaty debate after treaty debate that we were getting, but the truth was revealed when the economic crisis hit.  The priorities of the EU were first and foremost to protect private banking interests across Europe. Mass unemployment, huge social dislocation, mass impoverishment for many people and forced emigration was just so much collateral damage we have to put up with in the so-called structural adjustment programmes which have been applied to us. Refusing to even consider alternatives to blind and slavish adherence to the euro and current euro policies is precisely the sort of groupthink and herd mentality that led us into the crisis in the first place.  That is what Nyberg said about the financial crisis. He said the political establishment in this country was gripped by groupthink and herd mentality, and dismissed out of hand contrarians, as he called them. We dare to be contrarians and ask whether the current policies are working, against a background where the whole of the EU is contracting, there is deep alienation from the structures of the EU, some countries are talking about pulling out and the periphery countries have been devastated by the current policies of the ECB and the troika. I laugh when I hear that we will be saying "goodbye" to the troika. We will say "goodbye" to the troika and "hello" to the six-pack, the two-pack, the EU Commission, the ECB and the fiscal treaty. That is the troika; we are saying "goodbye" and "hello" to the troika. There is an alternative.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He would not think much of the ECB.
