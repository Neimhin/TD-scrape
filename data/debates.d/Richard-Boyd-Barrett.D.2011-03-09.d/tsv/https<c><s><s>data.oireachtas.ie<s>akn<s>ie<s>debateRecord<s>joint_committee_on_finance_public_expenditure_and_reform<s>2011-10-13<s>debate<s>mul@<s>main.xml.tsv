RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Mr. Broderick and Ms Doherty on their presentation.  It is important that they came before the committee and gave us the view from the bottom, so to speak.  I agree strongly with what they stated.  They spelled out in general their view that we needed a public policy in terms of banking but I ask them to flesh that out in more detail.  I understood them to say that shareholder value, that is, profitability and so, being the driving force behind the banking system, and the profit and bonus culture that went with that, was at the heart of the problem that led to the crash in our financial system.  They may not have added, but I do so now, that it was actively facilitated by the political culture of the time.  They might spell out in more detail what they believe the alternative view of banking should be because it seems to me, and they might indicate whether they agree with this, that banking must be about social and macro-economic goals and not just about the short-term return for shareholders.  Issues such as employment and ensuring that people have homes are the type of goals that should be central to a public policy on banking.I note in that regard, despite my ideological left wing leanings, that even in the United States, which would hardly be described as the most left-wing place in the world, the Federal Reserve has a mandate that goes beyond simple financial or profit maximisation.  It is a regulatory requirement that maintaining full employment, or almost full employment, and providing housing be objectives of the American banking system.  That thinking was absent in our banking sector and, from what I can ascertain based on measures taken domestically and at EU level, there is no sign of efforts to effect change so as to include such social, macro-economic and other economic developmental objectives.  These must be part of creating a different banking culture that will not result in a recurrence of the problems that got us into our current fix.I strongly endorse what was said about bank branches.  Members will probably feel the same as me on this.  I refer to returning banking to a level that involves good interaction between local banking staff and clients looking for loans or seeking to do business.  When I went into a bank to talk to local staff with a view to getting a small loan - this has changed since my becoming a Deputy - the local official would tell me I had a good credit history and accept that I always repaid my loans, yet, when my application passed up the line, I would be told I would not get the loan.  That is part of the problem.  The people at the top have a completely different set of priorities from the ordinary bank worker, who knows his area and customers and can look somebody in the eye and recognise whether he is a good bet for a loan.  With the massacre of jobs in the banking sector, we are moving in exactly the opposite direction to the one in which we need to go.  Will the IBOA state whether this is true?Irrespective of how correct it has been to be very critical of what the banking system has done in contributing to the economic crisis, most members and I do not attribute the crisis to the ordinary bank staff.  They are part of the solution.  We need a banking system that works.  One that works is one with more front line bankers and fewer bankers chasing performance-related bonuses at the top.  We often use the term "front line" in terms of public services.Will the association elaborate in a little more detail on its views on the measures being put in place under the new State-owned banks, and on the measures of the European Union and Government?  The credit institutions Bill, which has just passed through the DÃ¡il, falls very short in defining the sort of regulation we need and providing new objectives that would ensure the viability and sustainability of the banking system.The delegates made a very interesting point on the coincidence - perhaps it is not a coincidence - that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, two of the worst offenders in terms of sharp practice in the banking sector, are the two banks that were most anti-union.  Consequently, ordinary bank workers had the least say in how those banks were run.  Perhaps the delegates will agree.  The corollary is that we need more people at the lower levels in the banking sector with representatives on the boards of banks to scrutinise what is occurring and to bring the perspective from below to bear on the running of the system.The current policy of restoring the banking sector to health seems to be a question of the State stepping in to nationalise the sector temporarily out of necessity and then handing it back to the private sector after we, with our money and through the sacrifice of ordinary bank workers' jobs, have nursed it back to health.  We will be handing it back to the same characters who got us into the mess in the first place.  These circumstances are absolutely crazy.  Do the delegates, as representatives of the employees, have a view on that?  We should take the view that the aforementioned policy is wrong for the banking industry.  If we are to reform and restructure the banking system, requiring vast sums of public money, we should retain public control of it when it is put back on its feet.
