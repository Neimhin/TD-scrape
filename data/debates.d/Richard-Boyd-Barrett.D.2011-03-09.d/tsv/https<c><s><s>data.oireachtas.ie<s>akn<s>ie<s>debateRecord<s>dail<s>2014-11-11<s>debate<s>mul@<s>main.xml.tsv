RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The workers at the centre of this dispute are in the Visitors Gallery. To be honest, the most fruitful thing that could come out of the short time we have is for the Minister to agree to meet those workers to hear for herself the story they have relayed to us which has left them out on the picket line outside the Kishoge site for the past 11 weeks. What is going on there is an absolute scandal. Rhatigan has approximately 50% of the publicly-funded school building projects which this Government has trumpeted as a stimulus measure that will create employment. However, we have discovered that the company which got those contracts is treating workers in this way and is engaged in what looks to me like fraud. There is really no other way to describe it because there are certain rules and criteria about what a subcontractor is and the workers do not fit that. They are not self-employed subcontractors. They were taken on and employed by Rhatigans, which did not pay them for weeks, and then they were told they were subcontractors.  The money paid for the work of seven people over all those weeks amounts to an unbelievable €5 per hour, which is less than the minimum wage. This is absolutely outrageous. Is this what is going on with the jobs the Government claims it is creating with these stimulus measures on all of the other Rhatigan sites or on other publicly-funded sites?If it is, that is an absolute outrage. What we and these workers want to hear is that the Minister will cease payments to Rhatigan until these matters are fully investigated. I appeal to the Minister to speak to those workers now. She will be shocked at what they have had to put up with. It is absolutely outrageous and we hope that the Minister will respond positively and tell us that she will take immediate and urgent action on this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no point in the Minister’s reading off the rulebook for public contracts when it is not working. If it was, these workers would not be out for 11 weeks and would not be in here today. The Minister mentioned self-declaration. That is an absolute joke. The basis on which Rhatigan is able to undercut other bidders for these contracts is by playing fast and loose with the relevant contracts tax, RCT 1 system and classifying as subcontractors people who are not. Unbelievably, 40,000 of those working in construction in this country are being classified as subcontractors, which they are not. This is a rampant abuse of the subcontracting system by principal contractors who can then say it is nothing to do with them, it is the subcontractor. The living proof of that is the workers in the Visitors Gallery who were asked by Rhatigan to start working in good faith without being paid for five weeks. When they looked for their money, one was paid and told he was the subcontractor for the rest of them when it was clear that he was not a subcontractor. He is here and will tell the Minister this. Is the Minister going to do something about this or will she just read off rulebooks that do not work?The workers engaged with CAS, which was frustrated by Rhatigan. CAS cannot get to the bottom of the matter because it does not have any teeth, as Deputy Coppinger said. Where are the inspections? Where is the enforcement? Is there any will on the part of the Government to expose, stop and clamp down on this abuse of the RCT 1 system by these contractors? I hope the Minister can indicate that such a will exists, and that the Government will start by meeting these workers and listening to their concerns. It should stop paying Rhatigan while these most serious allegations are in the air.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The unprecedented popular rebellion seen on the streets in recent weeks was focused on the issue of water but in fact was an accumulation of all the anger and bitterness against six years of injustice and unfairness. Much of this was centred around some of the most vulnerable sections of society being absolutely savaged with brutal cuts. I refer to lone parents, people dependent on rent allowance, cuts to child benefit, back-to-education allowances and telephone allowances and the entire raft of cuts that have been imposed on some of the least well-off people. This has left Ireland in the shameful position in which it has one of the highest levels of child poverty anywhere in the OECD. An incredible 28.6% of our children are living in poverty, which is a shameful situation. The minor concessions, which are a drop in the ocean compared with what has been taken from people over recent years, will go nowhere to addressing this absolutely unacceptable and shameful situation of poverty for huge numbers of people and in particular for children. It does not get any worse than that and a state that cannot protect children and other vulnerable groups against poverty is a state that deserves nothing but contempt. Any minor give-backs, which go nowhere near reversing the unfairness and cruelties of the past six years, in any event will be wiped out by the introduction of water charges. If for no other reason, I oppose this Bill on the grounds that it is premised on the idea that water charges are coming in when the people have told the Government in absolutely unequivocal terms that they cannot take any more and do not accept water charges. Water charges are regressive by nature and it does not matter at what level one sets them. It does not matter if one sets them at 50 cent as they are regressive, because they hit the least well-off disproportionately compared with the wealthy. Moreover, once one gets them in, that regressive tax will continue to escalate, thereby increasing the unfairness and inequality, as well as the tax injustice in the way in which the tax system works. One message I wish to give to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, as he and the Government ponder what they will do in the face of the revolt against water charges, is that nothing will stop this revolt other than the Government scrapping these charges and accepting that Ireland's taxation system and how public services are funded must be done in a progressive way. User charges are inherently regressive. One does not need to be a rocket scientist or a socialist to work that one out. This is what people are saying and beyond that, they seek some fairness in how wealth is distributed, as well as a taxation system that ensures a fairer distribution of that wealth. Members of the Government often state that Deputies on these benches imagine there is some sort of pot of gold somewhere or that there is something else that could be taxed rather than these measures the Government imposes. However, there is and the Minister of State should read the quarterly reports produced by the Central Bank. I have just read the latest one, which shows there is €508 billion in household and financial wealth here, which constitutes an incredible 13.7% increase since 2012. A new international wealth report has just been published by Credit Suisse showing that in Ireland, the top 1% have 20% of that wealth, that is, of the aforementioned €500 billion.The richest 5% own over 40% of that wealth. If the Government imposed a 2% tax on the incomes of these individuals, it would raise billions. They would not even feel the imposition of such a tax because their money probably generates more than 2% in returns from that in which it is invested. However, the Government has chosen not to examine the enormous position with regard to wealth listed in the Central Bank's report or to tax a small part of same. Instead, it continues to hit the least well-off. The result of this is that children are living in poverty. The other result is homelessness. There is a glaring omission in this respect in the Bill before us. Each week I am visited by three or four people who are being made homeless. Just yesterday, I met a woman who had just been made homeless and who is now on the street with her two daughters. They are homeless as a result of the rent allowance caps which have been cut by the Government in recent years. In the context of those caps, there is simply nowhere for families on low incomes to go. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, stated that community welfare officers would show flexibility. When one goes in search of that flexibility, on many occasions one cannot find it. People are being told they must find properties to rent for €1,100. There is nowhere in south Dublin which can be rented for €1,100. As a result, families such as the woman I referred to and her two daughters are on the streets. Where are the measures in the Bill to provide increases in the rent allowance caps or extra funding for community welfare officers in order that they might demonstrate real flexibility and help people avoid becoming homeless?
