RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the best ways to protect the children of the State is to provide them with secure housing.  In the Visitors Gallery is a small sample of the 96,000 families on housing waiting lists.  They are the victims of housing cuts and policies imposed by Labour Party Ministers.  Leanne Massey who has four children was recently made homeless because of rent allowance cuts.  She is now separated from two of her children and sleeping on a sofa in a two-bedroom house with her grandmother and great-grandmother.  Mandy O'Brien, Nicola Lapraku and Elizabeth Martin were all recently made homeless as a result of the reduction of rent allowance caps.  Paul Corcoran was homeless for seven years and recently forced back onto the streets.  Michelle Murphy spent four years at No. 3 on the medical transfer list.  Peter Cleary faces homelessness.Is it not an obscenity that there are 96,000 on housing lists and waiting up to ten years to be housed, when the census figures show there are 230,000 empty dwellings in the State?  Is it not an outrage that we are paying €500 million a year in supplements to private landlords and developers when, if we provided council housing for those on the waiting lists, we would save the State €500 million a year and probably generate another €250 million in rental revenue for the State?Why is the Labour Party abandoning the policy of direct provision of council housing and, effectively, privatising the social housing market to the benefit of private developers and greedy speculators, the very people who bankrupted the country?  What is the Tánaiste going to do for those on the housing lists and in the Visitors Gallery?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an unsatisfactory and disingenuous response.  We will continue to subsidise private landlords unless the State directly provides council housing.  If there are 230,000 empty dwellings, many of them in the hands of NAMA and State-financed banks, they should be transferred directly into council ownership, but that is not what the Government is doing.  Instead, it is continuing to pay State money to private landlords, banks or whoever are the private owners of these properties.  This is, effectively, privatising the provision of social housing and creating the conditions for a new slum landlord class and tenement housing reminiscent of that at the beginning of the 20th century.There are people in the Visitors Gallery who are homeless as a direct result of the Government's reduction of the rent cap.  Does this not prove that its policy is a failure?What will the Government do to get those people off the housing list and put them in council houses, either NAMA properties taken into public ownership------
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or through the direct provision of council houses to end the abomination whereby 96,000 people are on the housing list at a time when we have nearly a quarter of a million empty properties in the State?  It is an obscenity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should just take the properties into public ownership.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those people who are facing homelessness will be in Buswells Hotel if the Tánaiste wishes to meet them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are trying to get them housed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Murphy for proposing the debate, which is very much welcome, as this is an important subject on which we should make our voice heard.  I strongly welcome the Minister's commitment to uphold a proud tradition in this country of opposing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and playing an important international role in seeking to prevent the proliferation of such weapons and to bring about nuclear disarmament, hopefully to move us as quickly as possible to a world free of such weapons.I suspect the majority of people in the House and in the world believe nuclear weapons are an utter obscenity.  I find it difficult to comprehend the mindset that came up with such weapons or that states would wish to develop weapons with this obscene destructive power.  Following the horrors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima where hundreds of thousands of people were vaporised in an instant and the entire cities laid waste in a few seconds, the notion that any state could claim to be interested in democracy, peace, stability and progressive values while involved in promoting, developing or threatening the use of these weapons is appalling.  The madness of nuclear weapons is even more starkly highlighted in the current economic crisis faced by the world where vast numbers of people across the globe, including in Europe, are living in poverty and lack sufficient access to basic public services.  While states claim they do not have the money to provide them, in excess of $1 trillion a year is spent on weapons, a considerable amount of which is spent on maintaining nuclear arsenals and producing nuclear weapons and the various industries used to develop them.We must do everything we can to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons.  The Minister is correct that every effort must be made to ensure states that are considering the development of nuclear weapons, outside of those that have them, do not do so whether that is Iran, Syria or any other country.  I do not believe claims that countries are trying to prevent nuclear proliferation has great credibility when they fail to deal with the enormous issue of double standards on the part of the main nuclear states and the largest powers in the world, including the US, Russia, China, Britain and France.  The other states that have developed nuclear weapons such as North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel could not have done so without the assistance, co-operation and involvement of the major nuclear states.If we are serious in confronting this issue, we must address the hypocrisy and double standards in our attitudes to the major powers and their refusal to dismantle their own nuclear arsenals.  The Tánaiste referred in his speech to the many specific requirements being imposed on Iran to comply with the non-proliferation treaty and the demands of the International Atomic Energy Authority, but there are no similar demands made of Israel.  I do not understand the double standards that operate in regard to that country.  It has 200 to 400 nuclear weapons but refuses to sign up to the NPT, which, incidentally, Iran has signed up to and is compliant with.  There is no credible evidence that the latter is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capacity, yet it is subjected to threats of military attack while nothing is done about Israel.  Last year the United States increased its annual military aid contribution to Israel from $3 billion to $4 billion and has, in recent years, made arrangements to take nuclear waste from the country.  We do not know where waste from the Dimona nuclear reactor is going, but many in Palestine suspect that at least some of it is being dumped under Gaza and Hebron, areas with large Palestinian populations.  The credibility of this State is seriously undermined by the involvement of companies based here in the production of components for the nuclear weapons industry and the arms industry generally.  We disgrace ourselves further by continuing to facilitate United States warplanes involved in brutal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
