RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, it is a struggle for the parents of children with autism to obtain the services and support they need, even more so in the current climate of cutbacks. As such, it is utterly inexplicable that he would make the welcome announcement of an additional €3 million for the provision of these services only for us now to discover, through a freedom of information request, that only 10% of that funding has been allocated, all of it to Beechpark Services in the Minister's constituency in north Dublin. Why was that area prioritised, while others, where there is just as much need, have been left to wait? There are 138 people awaiting services in north Dublin, while 241 are on the waiting list for services provided by Beechpark Services in south and west Dublin. Will the Minister explain the anomaly, whereby north Dublin, although undoubtedly in need of funding, was given priority in the provision of services over areas in the city?These questions have greater strength given the debacle over the issue of primary care centres in the Minister's constituency and how two were bumped up from an original list, which led to the resignation of the former Minister of State. The Minister has to answer the question of whether he is the Minister for Health or the Minister for north Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make it absolutely clear that I am delighted that people on the north side of Dublin, whether from the Minister's constituency or other parts of north Dublin, are to receive extra services. What is not clear from the Minister's answer is why only a small portion of the money that he initially announced at the end of 2011 has been allocated and why the money that was allocated has been allocated first to north Dublin, the Minister's political heartland. Could he explain why that is the case? What are the criteria for selecting the areas to which money is allocated, and why has it not been allocated? On the face of it, according to the waiting list figures, there is as much demand and need in other parts of Dublin and other parts of the country as there was in north Dublin. Otherwise, inevitably, there lingers a suspicion of favouritism for particular areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also welcome the Government's announcement that it has rowed back on what would effectively have been a cut. The Tánaiste suggested earlier this week that this was not a cut because the amount allocated was the same as last year but, as the Minister acknowledged, there is much greater demand and significant additional numbers of children are entering primary education. The requirement for SNAs and resources to support children with special needs must increase, therefore, to keep pace in order that there is not a de facto cut in the provision and supports for them. I welcome the fact that the Government has acknowledged this. I do not wish to crow because I take this issue seriously but this is yet another victory for people power. The Minister recognised this saying there was intense lobbying of Labour Deputies, in particular. The INTO and the Special Needs Parents Association had also planned protests tomorrow and against that background the Government parties changed their mind. People should take inspiration from that because there is a clear pattern that where unfair and unjust cuts are opposed in a determined way by them getting out on the streets and organising a broad coalition to say, "That is not acceptable. We are not putting up with this and we intend to fight it", it can yield results. It yielded results regarding the planned cuts to DEIS schools provision, the plan to sell off Coillte's harvesting rights and in special education needs provision. I do not say that glibly or flippantly. The Labour Party has employed a logic since entering government in imposing what the Minister often frankly acknowledges are unacceptable cuts to justify that approach by saying it is better to be in government to do what one can rather than to be on the outside protesting about it. This issue shows that is not true and we are better off fighting externally through people power, as the parents of children with special needs have done, to force Governments to accept the cuts are unjust. The problem with this tremendous victory, which is a welcome acknowledgement by the Government that what was proposed was unacceptable, is that the Minister has admitted he will have problems elsewhere in his budget. Overall, education cuts will still occur against the background of the Government's commitment to the troika. That is also unacceptable. I do not know where the Minister will make the cuts but it is difficult to imagine them being anything other than unpalatable and unacceptable whoever is hit. I cannot see how cuts would be good to any element of the education budget. Sometimes the Government tries to package cuts as reform but in reality, particularly in education, I cannot see how they can be justified. The Labour Party should not be a party to these cuts and its Members should be out with the people.They should be out on the streets fighting this injustice and arguing that we should not be paying the debts that were incurred as a result of the type of disgusting behaviour in which, as we have now explicitly seen, these bankers were engaged. This is the flipside of the activities of these gangsters in Anglo Irish Bank. Why are any cuts acceptable against that backdrop?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment even though I am not convinced of the need for a presidency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are to continue to have a presidency, ordinary people should be able to influence the process of selecting candidates. That process should be as open as possible. This amendment is a reflection of the need to set a low bar when it comes to the ability of ordinary citizens to put candidates forward. Deputy Kelleher's point about the party Whip system is generally true. This change will cause a problem for the parties in here. Luckily, the citizens will have another conduit for nominating candidates. I refer to the Independent group and others that do not operate party Whips.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are open and diverse. We listen to the people. The amendment speaks to a more fundamental problem, to which others have alluded. I am in favour of the abolition of the Seanad because it is undemocratic and it needs to go. There is a serious danger that the Government will be defeated on this, however. People are worried that the parts of our democracy that will remain after the Seanad is abolished will not deliver what they want. I think the Government is shoring up trouble for itself. It would be ironic if those who would like the Seanad to be abolished in order to facilitate a greater level of democracy end up voting against its abolition because they do not trust the rest of the system to deliver real democracy for people. While I support the abolition of the Seanad, the manner in which the Government is providing for it is a big problem, as is the imposition of a guillotine on what should be a much more detailed discussion about the alternatives. The Government promised a debate on how we can enhance democracy. That should have been part of the package. Regardless of what one thinks about the Seanad, it is a worrying harbinger of the Government's attitude to this issue and this debate that it has sought to impose a guillotine on this substantial change to the way politics is done in this country and to the Constitution. I support the amendment, but I think the Government's attitude is causing it to career towards a bit of a disaster on this issue. It should give serious consideration to that.
