I was one of those who opposed the sell-off and it does not altogether surprise me that since privatisation, what the witnesses appearing to be hinting at is occurring. Since the national lottery was first established 27 years ago, we have had 27 years in which the lottery worked perfectly and which never experienced an outage. Its brand recognition and credibility were untarnished in all of those years and as soon as it was handed over to Camelot and this other gang called PLI, things started to go belly up. That pretty much tells its own story, does it not? I acknowledge that the witnesses are here to ring alarm bells and many of the questions must be directed towards PLI. However, apart from smiling and talking to the witnesses in an open way, do the witnesses think the national lottery is taking on board the concerns they have raised with it in terms of adequate investment and the right decisions on technology and the data? Jobs were mentioned and is there evidence or do the witnesses know whether the numbers of people employed have reduced or are inadequate? I invite them to elaborate on that a little.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps, as he stated, Mr. Jennings does not wish to shake up the glass too much but implicit in what he is saying is that these operators have come in and they simply wish to milk the brand that has all this credibility, while cutting investment and running the thing down in a manner that potentially could derail and damage the entire credibility of the national lottery. Does Mr. Jennings suspect that is what is going on? The owners just want to get the money and are not really-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am wondering whether this is what Mr. Jennings suspects. The witnesses are ringing the alarm bells.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two further brief questions. Mr. Jennings drew a distinction between the lottery management and the company standing above it. If it is not the management, about who specifically are we talking? Does Mr. Jennings think the problems are with Camelot or the people above it, that is, with PLI?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are the witnesses getting evidence from customers that they are fed up with all of this and that their attitude towards the lottery may change?
