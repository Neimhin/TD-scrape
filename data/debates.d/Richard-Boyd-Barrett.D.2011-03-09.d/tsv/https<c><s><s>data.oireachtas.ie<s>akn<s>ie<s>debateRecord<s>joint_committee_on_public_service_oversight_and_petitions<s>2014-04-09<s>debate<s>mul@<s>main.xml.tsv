My understanding of this case is that the person has a lot of evidence that his good name has been taken.  That seems to have been acknowledged in the report of the Ombudsman.  I am baffled by the case and the fact that quite senior politicians seem to have acknowledged the injustice that has been done to him.  I am baffled that he has not been vindicated.  I accept we are not in a position to do that, but I hope that somehow he will be vindicated.
