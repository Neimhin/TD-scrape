RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dr. McDonnell said it should be a precondition that the lowest households do not suffer from the carbon tax and that they see some benefit. Should retrofitting people's homes not also be a precondition? Before there is any question of additional fuel costs, the mechanism should be made available and the resources provided to achieve it, to ensure they do not suffer as a consequence. The fear people have - I certainly have it - is that the carbon tax will go up but the person in an old council house with poor insulation and damp, as the case in a lot of social housing, will be hit with this while it will be years before there is a retrofit programme. At an absolute minimum, any hit that people might take in that regard cannot happen prior to the retrofitting of their home so that they have the opportunity to reduce their energy costs. I wish to raise something that is never talked about and is never an objective of budgets, although I know the witnesses all think about it.Interestingly, an exit poll in the recent elections said that something like 85% to 90% of people thought the gap between the haves and the have nots should be reduced. That is an overwhelming majority. It is never an objective in budgets to try to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor and to look at how that will be achieved, although it is beginning to be debated everywhere, even in the United States interestingly. They are starting to debate this because the gap between rich and poor is growing everywhere and even when there is economic growth and slight improvements to people's incomes, the gap is growing and growing. Should that be a budgetary objective? If it is, what should be done to begin to redistribute wealth? I see mention of wealth taxes. I do not know who put those ideas forward and I welcome it but they are quite modest. For example, 1% on assets over €1 million is suggested. Those assets are probably accumulating additional value at about 3% or 4% in reality. Should we not be more radical and ambitious in trying to have wealth taxes that will redistribute wealth? I have a specific question on childcare. I was at a Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, briefing earlier on where it was pointed out that one of the impacts of the national childcare scheme is that, because it will do away with other targeted supports for vulnerable parents who get some support for childcare through childcare employment and training support, CETS, schemes, and community childcare subvention, CCS, schemes, those parents will lose dramatically because of the national childcare scheme as the targeted supports for them will go in favour of the universal scheme. Are the witnesses aware of that and do they have any comments on it? There is a general acceptance that our over-reliance on foreign direct investment, FDI, and a small number of multi-nationals and the corporation tax receipts coming from them is a vulnerability. How can we diversify away from that? Into what should we be diversifying? To use one example, our committee has said we should look at a research and development tax credit. Some €700 million, which is rising, largely goes to a small number of multinationals. If we are to diversify, do we not need to dramatically reduce that and redirect those research and development funds towards the sort of areas that would give us a more sustainable economy such as public education, public research and development and other strategic areas of the economy that would be more sustainable. Do the witnesses have any comments on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We support a wealth tax. What is the Deputy talking about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I ask Dr. McDonnell a question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I not ask my question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Dr. McDonnell believe, as he implied earlier, that house prices would fall if we ramped up supply, per se, to more than 40,000 units a year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is nice to have the witnesses to myself. I thank them for their contributions. I strongly agree with them on some of the points they made and disagree with them on others. I fully agree on using the surprise corporate tax receipts to fund key strategic areas of infrastructure and diversify the economy. The witnesses may be surprised to learn that this approach would be the thrust of the industrial policy of People Before Profit. There is, however, a contradiction between that view and the concern the witnesses expressed about a potential minimum effective corporate tax rate. We do not know how long the bonanza will last but it will come to an end at some point. Would we not be better off facing that reality? From a moral point of view, we should address that issue in any case because much of this tax income is from a small number of corporations whose long-term value to the economy is a little questionable as we are vulnerable to what they might do. Would we not be better off closing down some of the tax reliefs they get and redirect them precisely into the areas the witnesses advocated, for example, diversifying the economy and ensuring we have the necessary infrastructure to do so. An obvious example, which was mentioned earlier, is research and development tax relief, which has jumped to €700 million and overwhelmingly goes to a small group of IT companies. Would it not be better to redirect that money into ramping up our ability to produce the apprentices that have been mentioned or developing the infrastructure necessary for more balanced regional development? I will not list all of the things we could do with the money. Even if we took half of the €700 million and redirected it to some of those areas, it would be very good for developing a more sustainable domestic economy that would act as a better buffer in the long term against the ups and downs we may experience. I put those questions to IBEC. The Construction Industry Federation has issued a stark warning and we should all take it very seriously. Its claim that we will not meet the Rebuilding Ireland targets because of various bottlenecks and problems is very worrying. I ask the witnesses from CIF to elaborate on that point. Before the meeting, I spoke informally to them about this issue and I am not sure how to get out of this dilemma. As I pointed out, despite buying land from NAMA at relatively low prices, developers and builders are having extreme difficulty making a profit when they build on this land. I know some have bought land at the more inflated prices that have developed lately. Even where they bought at very low prices, however, it seems to be very difficult for the construction industry to build and sell at a profit. Maybe that explains the low level of output. Mr. Lucey gave the stark message that the current level of output will not increase much more and will certainly not reach the level we need unless something changes. My solution is that if the developers cannot do this, the State must intervene. Would it not be better for developers to have the State decide to contract them to develop what we need to build? The State must accept that we need a certain level of output come what may. This means asking developers how much it would cost to build the amount of housing needed because we have no choice in the matter. What seems to be happening at the moment is that delivery of housing is dependent on whether developers can make a profit. Consequently, housing is not being delivered to the scale required and, according to the CIF, we may hit a wall fairly soon. I am very interested in apprenticeship, not least because my son has just started an apprenticeship to become an electrician, which I am delighted about. Is the problem with apprenticeships that it is too expensive for builders to take on apprentices or is it that there are not enough young people who want to avail of apprenticeships, or both? What can we do to address the problem? I am slightly worried about the suggestion that we should reinstate the student levy. Would students have to pay the levy? Surely we should make it more attractive for young people to go into the trades. Perhaps the State could give an additional subsidy to improve pay rates for first and second year apprentices. They might then view apprenticeship as an attractive option rather than being required to pay an extra student levy to take the pressure off the builder. I take the point that was made about builders. I read that a relatively low percentage of builders can afford to take on apprentices. However, loading the cost on the apprentice does not seem to be the best way to deal with the problem. The State needs to employ more apprentices or at least support them in order that apprenticeship becomes more attractive.
