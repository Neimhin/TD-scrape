RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the figure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, the underspent amount.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and his team. It has become a bit of a staple of the new Government, including the Minister, to have a go at the left, with various adjectives attached to it, including "extreme", "far" and "hard". I note the Minister recently talked about people resisting change and saying we do not want change. It is an interesting development in the political narrative of the Government and it is a sort of deflecting tactic. It is about having a go at the others and calling them names so we do not examine in detail what the Government is doing. I will put the record straight. The left is talking about change and we want such change. The very particular change we want is to address what we think are big elephants in the room in terms of the available resources to fund what our society needs, particularly at this time. They are housing, health care, vital infrastructure and so on. I put it to the Minister that the €500 million, or if he pulls a rabbit from the hat with a few other tens of millions of euro nearer the budget, does not go anywhere near what is necessary to invest to the degree we need to in the likes of social housing, primary care and our education system to reduce student-staff ratios.There is a whole range of areas but I will not list them. Broadband and sustainable energy projects are examples. Notwithstanding the ding-dong of political name-calling and all the rest of it, what does the Minister have to say about the central question the left raises about wealth and profits and the need to look at these areas to tap extra revenues for things such as housing and health? The big hidden story of recent years is that while incomes have been kept low for most people or cut and not really restored, public expenditure has been kept on a very tight rein and profits and wealth have gone through the roof. It is not just me saying it. We got a report from the Department on 2015 figures and under almost every heading of economic activity, profits had gone through the roof. Manufacturing profits were up 110% in one year and those in professional and scientific activity were up 63%. In wholesale and retail, the increase was 60%; in administrative support, the increase was 40%; and in accommodation and food, profits were up 37%. I could go through the list. Profits are going through the roof. While everybody else is being told we have to be prudent and we do not have much money, profits are going through the roof. There has been a succession of reports on wealth which show the wealth of the very richest in Irish society has dramatically increased. However, the Minister ignores or dismisses calls from the left to look at these areas and to look at increasing the effective rate of corporate tax, wealth taxes and financial transaction taxes which would give us a much bigger pot for all the things we need to invest in. What does the Minister say to that? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will check it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I might come back in the time that is available-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To begin, I doubt very much that I referred to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, as a dictator, or mentioned North Korea for that matter. I want to set that record straight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I might have said that the Minister was neoliberal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will set that aside. I also play the policy and not the man. What the Minister is not acknowledging in his answer, which made reference to the Gini coefficient and so on, is that there have been a succession of reports showing that there has been a very significant jump in the wealth of those at the very top. The Wealth-X report during the week said that the number of high net worth individuals in Ireland who have between €30 million and €50 million each jumped last year by 6%, and those 1,300 individuals now have between them €133 billion in personal wealth. I find it extraordinary that we would not think about taxing them specifically on their wealth. Whatever can be said about comparing inequality, the fact of the matter is that on a global level, and Ireland is no exception, inequality is growing. In the Minister's stance is there any recognition that we need to begin to redistribute wealth to deal with growing inequality in this country and elsewhere? Is the Minister going to revisit the 9% VAT rate, given the profits in that sector? Has he worked out how much extra money would be available if the rate was restored to the previous rate? To what extent does the Minister put the low receipts of income tax down to people in low paid, precarious, part-time work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will be glad to know that I will not quibble about the fact that the water charges are being abolished and the cost will be met by the Central Fund. I just believe that the Central Fund should be larger by tapping into other sources of revenue. Will the Minister confirm that the cost of abolishing water charges will not impact on the water infrastructure capital investment plans over the coming years? Regarding the economics and finances of the Government's housing plans, has the Minister any interest in the point that much of Rebuilding Ireland depends on the delivery of HAP, leasing schemes and so on - approximately 75% - rather than the direct provision of social housing? It is under review, but does the Minister for Finance believe it is sensible that, of the 110,000 target of various types of social housing to 2021, the bulk will involve ongoing current expenditure as opposed to directly provided housing? The upfront capital cost of the latter would be greater, but that housing would eventually become a net source of revenue. The alternative does not make sense. Has the Minister any comment to make on it? From a medium-term point of view, it would be more sustainable and sensible to build more of our own housing stock instead of leasing and so on. How much will we spend on legal costs in 2018 to defend the Apple case and try to prevent us getting the €13 billion? Is the €13 billion in the escrow account yet and does it generate any interest? If it does, what are we going to do with that? How much motor tax revenue do we generate and what exactly will be done with that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was always on the balance sheet of the Government. It never moved off it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Irish Water never got off the balance sheet.
