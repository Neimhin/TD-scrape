RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is not taking on board the serious question marks that stand over the extremely sensitive and comprehensive information about Irish citizens that will be gathered by the census.  To say that CACI International has not been prosecuted is not dealing with the issue.  CACI International currently has——

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking a question.  Will the Minister of State explain why the Government does not have greater concern about the integrity of the census given that there are 200 Iraqi plaintiffs seeking to mount lawsuits over CACI International's involvement in Abu Ghraib Prison.  There are another four Iraqi plaintiffs before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia.  In so far as CACI International has prevented proceedings in other cases that have been taken against it, it is because the United States Court of Appeals ruled that the company falls under the United States military chain of command and thus has Government contractor immunity——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister of State about a very serious matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is not responding to the question I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not making a statement.  I am asking whether the Government takes these matters seriously.  CACI International has avoided legal cases against it by seeking immunity on the basis of its status as a defence contractor, with most of its income coming from the Pentagon.  These are serious allegations and simply to point out that the company has not been prosecuted is not good enough.There are serious issues regarding the census.  Some people — and I am not suggesting they should do so — are saying they will not fill out the census form because of the questions arising from the involvement of CACI (UK) Limited.  What will the Government do to guarantee the security and integrity of the census and to reassure the many people who are deeply concerned about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said I was not encouraging them to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should be reassuring people about the integrity of the data.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand its importance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This company is providing the hardware, software and the data processing systems for the census process.  Can the Minister of State assure us that the company has no access to the information in the census?  Is he aware that the Registrar General in Scotland, where a census is also being conducted, has observed that the "sneak and peek warrants" provided for in the United States PATRIOT Act would allow the CIA or the United States Government "secretly to enter a business, either physically or virtually, conduct a search and depart without taking any tangible evidence or leaving notice of their presence."  That is what American law allows to be done to American companies.  Can the Minister of State guarantee that the company in question will not have access to the census information and, consequently, that the American military or intelligence services will not also have access to it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does the Minister of State know?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister made an amazing suggestion yesterday that the Government's banking policy was a success because Bank of Ireland's share price had risen in the aftermath of its announcement.  What planet is the Minister living on that he thinks rising share prices in Bank of Ireland mean anything to the majority of people in this country who are suffering brutal costs, have lost their jobs and are struggling to make ends meet?  That view is absolutely extraordinary but it is also indicative of the mindset of the Government and the twisted priorities it seems to have inherited from its predecessor.The Minister also said that the objective of the bank restructuring proposal was to recapitalise the banks in order to restore credit to the economy.  That was the justification for providing an additional €24 billion to bail out the banks, bringing the total recapitalisation cost to €70 billion.  This excludes the €25 billion for NAMA, which brings us close to €100 billion.  I ask again what world the Minister is living in.  The €46 billion already provided has not resulted in credit flowing into the economy.  What makes the Government think the provision of a further €24 billion will have that effect?  It is clear that the priority of the banks is to make profits and to restore their balance sheets.  They do not give a hoot about the economy or jobs.  That is not what they are there for.  They are there to make profits and they do not consider it profitable to invest in the economy according to social need or the requirements of citizens.Nor will this plan work in the future no matter how good the balance sheets of the banks, because the other side of the coin is the IMF and EU demands for austerity and cutbacks which are savaging the incomes of ordinary people.  The banks are not lending because there is no demand in the economy as a consequence of the savage cuts in incomes.  People do not have money to spend and the businesses in which they formerly spent money are going out of business.  Why would the banks, recapitalised or not, lend money to those businesses?  They will not do so because they are in the business of making profits and they are not fools.  Seeking to restore demand into the economy and at the same time imposing austerity on ordinary people means we are moving in opposite directions at once.The Minister also heralds the shrinking of the banking system down to two pillars and suggests this is an indication of the success of the new policy.  It is not new policy; it is exactly what the former Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said he would do, at the diktat of the EU and IMF.  The only likely result of that will be major job losses for ordinary bank workers.  It is certainly not a new departure and it offers no great hope for people that the issues arising from this crisis will be resolved.The madness goes beyond that.  As part of this radical restructuring we are selling off the profitable portions of the banks.  We are putting €24 billion into zombie banks in order to pay off bondholders while the profitable arms such as Irish Life, which made profits of €160 million last year and employs 1,000 people, are sold off.  Why do we not retain the profitable sections which are generating revenue that could assist the finances of the State?The alternative is to repudiate the bad gambling debts of bondholders and bankers.  We are in debt because we have put on the shoulders of ordinary people the gambling debts of private financial institutions at the behest of the EU and IMF, which are seeking to protect their banks.  Why are we protecting their banks at the cost of ordinary people in this country?  Let us repudiate those debts.  Instead of using the National Pensions Reserve Fund to bail out the banks we should use it for its intended purpose, as a rainy day fund to assist when the economy is in trouble by investing in jobs programmes, restoring demand in the economy, creating employment and reviving economic activity.  Let us have a State banking system that does not take responsibility for private gambling debts.  Such a bank would be viable and able to access credit on the international markets.  It is the madness of taking on the private gambling debts of bankers and speculators that is sinking our economy.  It is a tragedy that this Government is continuing down the same insane path as the last Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have listened to the arguments of the Government in opposing our call for a referendum and the argument seems to run thus: in January and February of this year we believed that bailing out the banks at the expense of ordinary people was, in the words of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, morally wrong and economically unsustainable and in Deputy Gilmore's words, it amounted to economic treason.  That is what the Minister stated.  Presumably, unless he was trying to deceive people then, those words still stand, the policy is unjust, unacceptable and is still economic treason.  However, the argument follows that because the Government is in a straitjacket, there is nothing it can do about it and it has no choice.To use a somewhat hackneyed phrase, it is an appalling vista that the Government has no choice but to do something that is morally wrong, economically unsustainable, which amounts to economic treason and which is now bordering on political treason, in so far as before the election those now in Government said one thing but they are now doing the opposite.  The justification for this argument is that if we say "No" to the EU-IMF package, they will pull the plug; that unless we do their bidding and continue to pay off the bankers and the bondholders at the expense of ordinary working people and families, our public services and the sale of our State assets, the EU will pull the plug.  Let us consider this point because it is the Government's only argument.  The suggestion is that they will pull the plug on the State.  What the Government is really telling us is that we must concede to blackmail and bullying by the EU and the IMF, institutions which are acting on behalf of the bankers and speculators.Should the Minister not show a little dignity and backbone and stand up to the institutions and interests in Europe, which are simply bullying and threatening us to defend the interests of bankers and bondholders?  The Minister also maintains that he is doing what he is doing to get liquidity back into the banks and, ultimately, to create jobs.  However, what the Minister will not accept or acknowledge is that the austerity cuts that the IMF demands to pay off these bankers' loans are doing the opposite; they are taking money out of the economy and forcing more job losses.  The Minister's logic is somewhat like the American logic in Vietnam: they took the view they had to bomb a village to save it; the Minister believes he must create unemployment to deal with the unemployment crisis.  It makes no sense whatsoever.Perhaps the Minister could do me the courtesy of listening for one minute rather than chitchatting for the final part of the motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Minister that the EU's threats are empty.  They will not pull the funding on our banks because the reason this policy was introduced was to save their banks.  That is why they demanded that we put in place a guarantee of the banks and that we pay off the bondholders.  It is to protect their banks.  They realise that if our banks go down, their banks go down.  This is the bargaining power we have but the Minister refuses to use it and that mystifies me.  One can only conclude it is because the Minister is part of a cosy club of the elite in this country and throughout Europe which is protecting its interests at the expense of working people.  I put it to the Minister that if we say "No"——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——they must come back and negotiate with us because they cannot afford to let the euro, which is so important to them, collapse or to let the banking system in Europe collapse.  If we say "No" or if we have the right to vote or consider the possibility of saying "No" to this economic madness and social injustice, we would be joined in calling for a proper debate on the matter by the people in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain who are being asked to accept the same austerity to protect the international system.The Government maintains it has no alternative.  Our alternative is simply to repudiate the gambling debts of these private, for-profit institutions.  There is €100 billion in deposits in our banks.  Why not put this into a State bank which does not carry the debts of these bankers and speculators?  We could access finance on the international markets.  Such a bank could invest in jobs, strategic infrastructure and industry in this country.  It would not cost the people their future, their public services, their incomes and their livelihoods unlike this insane policy.  Will the Government at least give the people the opportunity to debate the matter in a referendum?  If they do not agree that is fine and the Government will win the debate, but if they agree such is their choice.  The Minister should let the people decide, withdraw his amendment and allow the people to vote on their future.
