RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I have a bit longer than a minute and a half?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not planning to use them all. Do not worry. I just wanted to clarify we have 15 minutes. Something interesting has come to my attention about the census. Given the scale of the housing crisis in this country, there has quite correctly been a focus for quite some time, extending to years, on the question of vacant and derelict properties in the country. Many people, including me, have for some time been asking that as part of trying to address that crisis we identify the number of vacant and derelict properties. Many Deputies have time and again cited the number of such properties in their own areas, towns and villages, along with their frustration and that of the people that these properties are not being used to house people affected by the housing crisis. I have learned something because a person has been communicating with my office and the CSO. In the previous census, in 2016, the CSO did not do any count of derelict properties. It did a count of vacant properties and the figures were fairly eye-watering, identifying 183,312 such properties. It is a pretty staggering number and if even a reasonable portion of them could be quickly turned around, refurbished and made available to people affected by the housing crisis, it would have a very significant impact on it. What is apparent from the correspondence I have received from this person, who is communicating with me and the CSO, is that eye-watering figure of vacant properties did not include derelict properties. That means there is a very significant number beyond that of derelict properties that could also potentially be used for housing. A note from the CSO indicates dwellings under construction and derelict properties were not included in the count of vacant dwellings, and as a result empty housing units were classed as a vacant house, vacant apartment or holiday home only if the dwelling was considered fit for habitation by the enumerator. In the case of newly constructed buildings, this meant the roof, doors, windows and walls had to be completely built or installed and for older dwellings that were unoccupied, the roof, doors and windows had to be fully intact. We can think about this even with the most cursory walk down the streets of Dublin or anybody's town or village. We can imagine many of the older buildings with a broken window or a door or window boarded up that were not counted in the 2016 census, despite that census identifying an absolutely staggering 183,000 vacant units. It was apparent in yesterday's Oireachtas committee meeting when Dublin City Council officials were questioned on the matter that they did not have a clue. The biggest local authority in the country has no clue about derelict properties in Dublin city. It has done one walk-around survey of approximately 45 properties in 2015 and that was it. There is no working definition of derelict properties. I ask the Minister of State to take this very seriously. It is a matter of urgency for us to identify the housing stock that could potentially be useful for addressing the incredibly severe housing crisis we are now facing. We need a working definition and absolute certainty that derelict properties will be included in the census to be conducted in 2022. Frankly, local authorities should be instructed before that to have an operating definition of derelictions and should have a systematic and scientific approach to identifying them even before that because it is an absolute scandal there are so many vacant and derelict buildings. We cannot even begin that work unless we have a clear definition of what a derelict site is and the properties are being counted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will support the amendments insofar as they seek to facilitate planting of native trees on small parcels of land and provide for schemes to be set up to allow that to happen relatively easily. However, as others have said, there is concern about the way this has been sprung on people and the lack of consultation with stakeholders who are concerned with forestry, including those in the industry and environmentalists. I have my sources in forestry and they usually contact me if anything is moving. They have not heard any word of this and they are on top of everything. That is a problem and there are concerns about it. As others have said, measures like this cannot be used to camouflage our failures in other areas or to substitute for the necessary action that needs to take place in other areas where we are failing. The backlog in the issuing of licences has been mentioned as a major concern. Net deforestation may take place in the country, as suggested by the greater number of felling licences being issued compared with a fraction of that for afforestation licences. A few years ago, the EPA signalled that it believed there was a danger of net deforestation because felling was happening essentially dictated by market concerns rather than by the best stewardship and guardianship of forestry.  I recently flagged another concern with the threatened sale of Killegar Forest near Enniskerry, from which I am glad Coillte backed off. However, it posed very serious questions. I subsequently tabled parliamentary questions trying to understand what on earth possessed Coillte to imagine that it might be a good idea to sell an amenity forest when we are supposed to be meeting climate and biodiversity targets. There was a similar threat to a forest close to Kinsale, County Cork. Coillte is carrying out significant sales on an ongoing basis. That is linked to the mandate of Coillte, which at one level we are told is trying to pivot towards biodiversity and so on, but in reality much of what it does is about clear-felling and then replanting 90% to 95% with Sitka spruce, perpetuating a failed forestry model and not doing much in the way of active afforestation. Against that background, its selling of amenity forests makes no sense and suggests something is fundamentally wrong with the mandate of Coillte, it being operated on a sort of commercial basis.The other issue, which relates to Deputy Cahill's point, is that I would like to think we could break from the Sitka spruce industrial forestry model. If we are to do that, which I think we have to for climate, biodiversity and all sorts of reasons, it must also be a new forestry model that delivers a decent living for farmers engaged in forestry which at the moment many feel can only be delivered by the Sitka spruce monocultural model. We need to break from that, while also giving real supports to farmers to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We support the extension of the EWSS and the CRSS schemes. Are we dealing with all the amendments together?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The debate, though, is a short one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We support these schemes for the obvious reasons. The pandemic continues to impact particular sectors of the economy. We should remind ourselves that these are the ones that have been hit the hardest and most consistently right from the beginning through to now. Everybody has been affected by the pandemic in one shape or form. To be honest, the past two years have been pretty grim. For some people, the impact suffered has been psychological, social, to do with their children, etc. For other people, however, the experience of the pandemic has brought a repeated financial and economic hit in addition to those broader health, psychological and social impacts. It is absolutely right, therefore, that we should continue the supports, such as the EWSS, to maintain the relationship between employees and their employers and to ensure that these support schemes can cover some of their ongoing costs. It is not enough to do that, however, given that the Minister is tabling last-ditch amendments, and he is correct to do so, in respect of the businesses that benefit from these schemes. In that context, why is it that the people who have been short-changed throughout this entire pandemic are, yet again, the ones primarily affected in this regard? I have had repeated engagements with the Minister, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, concerning, primarily, the plight of the self-employed and what I think are called ancillary workers in the context of the EWSS. These are people who are considered ancillary but who are impacted by the beneficiaries of the EWSS. They are excluded. Critically, tens of thousands of self-employed people are not getting the support they need, even though they have had to fight the hardest and have benefited the least from the supports that have been available. Why are last-ditch efforts not being made to ensure that they also have supports going into Christmas? Maybe this perspective has not got through to the Government, or perhaps it is deliberate. I made this appeal to the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform last night. I am going to keep doing it until the last day of the Dáil in order to try to get some movement on this issue, or at least some answers and clarity. Thousands of people are experiencing confusion, anxiety and concern regarding whether they are going to have any income, what level of income they may have or whether the income they will be given will be sufficient to support them because their work has collapsed as a result of Covid-19. Those people do not benefit from these schemes. They had previously benefited from the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and some of them also benefited from the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS. I do not understand why last-ditch moves or amendments in this regard are not also being rushed through the Dáil this week as well. I just do not understand why that is not happening. In case the Minister is not aware of this situation, as we speak, hundreds if not thousands of musicians, entertainers, taxi drivers and people involved with the night-time economy are being refused the PUP. We were told last week that they would get the PUP, but they are being refused it. They are receiving letters stating that if they cannot show that they had four weeks PRSI contributions in the week before 7 December, they will not be eligible for the payment. That is a ridiculous request to make of the self-employed because they do their taxes at the end of the year. By definition, they are not getting any support from these schemes even though their work has collapsed. Other people are still on the PUP. The Minister will remember that there are different cohorts in this regard because people were being phased off the payment, from €350 down to €250 and then down to €205. They were finally forced onto jobseeker’s payments. If people had signed off, and then, on 7 December or after, went back on the PUP, it is possible for them to get to €350 if their applications are not refused on the basis of this PRSI contribution requirement. Theoretically, however, it might be possible for people in that situation to get the PUP. People who were on the lower rate because they were being phased down the PUP payment rates will not now be able to apply for the higher rate, even though the lower rate was phased down on the basis of the fact that the amount of work it was possible for people to do and the level of income it was possible for them to make was rising when that happened. That was the whole principle behind those changes in the payment. All those people, though, have now seen the additional income they could earn because of the lifting of restriction collapse again overnight. I am getting desperate calls from drivers telling me that all the night-time work is gone and that they are waiting for four and five hours at the airport, but there are no fares. All the office workers are being told to stay at home, so all that kind of work is gone as well. It is possible that further restrictions are will be imposed at the end of this week, which could impact their ability to work even more. There is some shopping activity and some people are going to work around town, so it might be thought that there is loads of work. There is not, however. The situation is even worse for musicians, because their work is just gone. All the gigs they expected to have in December are not happening, but they are being asked in interviews relating to qualifying for social welfare payments if they can prove that they have lost income. How exactly are they meant to prove that? Do they have to get letters from all the people with whom they had arranged gigs in December and then bring them to the Intreo office if they can get an appointment over the next week? I would say there is a fat chance of that happening. It is ridiculous stuff. Let us remember what the Government said at the beginning of this crisis. It stated that the PUP would be given to everybody because everybody is impacted and the eligibility criterion for the PUP then was that people’s income and ability to earn had been significantly reduced or had gone. We did not give people loads of hoops to jump through. What we are doing now, though, is refusing people's applications or giving them multiple hoops to jump through, which they cannot possibly do before Christmas. It is grossly unfair. I reiterate that these people who are facing this situation a week before Christmas are the same people who have been repeatedly hit the most often and the hardest right from the beginning of the pandemic. Yet they are now being hit again in the week before Christmas. I appeal on their behalf to the Minister to do something before Christmas for the people in these categories, who, self-evidently, have been impacted by the latest round of health measures and by the arbitrary date concerning when the measures were brought in, namely, 7 December. It is ridiculous. Many people scaled back their social activities and outings last week-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know, and I want to be fair to others. I just want to get this point across because this is my last chance to do so. Then I will stop. The arbitrary date of 7 December is ridiculous because much of the work for musicians collapsed in the weeks before that date. This arbitrary cut-off means that people impacted on or after that date are okay but anything that happened before then does not count for those people who apply or who were on something else. I am asking that the PUP be given to these people who have self-evidently had their work and incomes hit or reduced and that this PRSI contribution requirement be taken out of the qualification criteria because it does not apply to the self-employed. That is what they are being told is required, however. In addition, the MEBAS scheme for musicians will apparently not be reviewed until January 2022. Can we put some money into that scheme now, because the ongoing costs for that cohort of people are continuing even though there is no work for them?
