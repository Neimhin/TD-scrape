RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the GSOC witnesses for appearing before the committee. Mr. O'Brien has used the word "clarity" many times, but I am not getting clarity. I would appreciate it if we could have short, succinct and direct answers to questions in order that there can be absolute clarity. I am trying to sift through what is being said. Will Mr. O'Brien tell the committee very simply in order that the people who are watching can understand if it is his opinion there was a leak at a high level within the Garda ombudsman's office of this report to the media and that the office is now looking for that mole? Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, we have a leak of secret documents from the Garda ombudsman's office to the media and Mr. O'Brien has indicated more will be leaked, probably in next Sunday's newspapers. How many people would have had access to the secret report?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Mr. O'Brien tell the committee who they are?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a serious issue. A small number of people, approximately seven, had access to a secret report, yet that report has found its way into the hands of the media and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is investigating the matter. That is a serious revelation. Mr. O'Brien has also said that what prompted GSOC to do the security sweep and enlist the British security experts was that it had suspected it was under surveillance. In fact, he did not use the past tense in his statement or some of his earlier comments. He has said he suspects GSOC was under surveillance. Does he still believe that, apart from the leak which amounts to a very serious matter, GSOC was under surveillance? I am aware that he has said GSOC does not have definitive proof one way or another and does not have definitive evidence, but does he believe and suspect GSOC was under surveillance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point, but it appears there are two different things which could or might not be connected. We have clearly established that Mr. O'Brien believes there was a leak. Who has access to secret information within the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and is giving it to people in the media? That is a very serious issue. On what initially led GSOC to enlist the security firm, it was in the context of a higher profile for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission after he had made public comment that he was not receiving adequate co-operation from the Garda. That was one context. The other was that there seemed to be high level information in the public domain that he could not explain; presumably, it should have been information that was secure within the GSOC organisation. Given the context in which GSOC had initiated the security sweep, was the possibility of surveillance discovered, with the three anomalies which have not been explained fully, one way or another, but which could have malign or benign explanations? What is Mr. O'Brien's view on whether GSOC was under some form of external surveillance? Is he now of the opinion that GSOC was not under surveillance? Can GSOC be secure in view of the problem that there is an internal leak or has Mr. O'Brien concerns about external surveillance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Time is short. In order to leak a secret document one does not need surveillance equipment if one has access to the document. This is where two things can potentially be confused. One only needs access to the document to get it out. There may be a question about how one got it out, by photocopying it or whatever else, but one does not need Government level surveillance technology. We have established that a secret document was got out, probably by a small number of people who had access to it. What I am asking about is the other side of the story, the security anomalies and the possibility that surveillance equipment was being deployed against GSOC. As that issue has been investigated, we do not have any definitive answer, but the two-piece threat is not so alarming, so to speak, but threats two and three are quite alarming. On threat two, after the test had been done, the possibility of somebody ringing back immediately at 1 a.m. was described as remote to zero by the security experts. I am alarmed by this. There could be a benign explanation, but the balance of probabilities suggests there is not and that is what the security experts believed. Is that correct? Is that not something about which we should be deeply concerned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a final question. Is Mr. O’Brien’s concern that his recollected reasons for initiating the security investigation are different from those in the report that he believes may come out in the newspapers this Sunday? Can he tell us more about that? Can he explain why the possible conflict of explanations as to why the investigation was launched in the first instance exists? It seems pretty strange that Mr. O'Brien has one version of why he initiated the investigation while somebody who may leak a report on Sunday has a different one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can Mr. O'Brien explain his expressed fear that there are two different explanations as to why the investigation was initiated? This would give cause for public concern or concern on the part of anyone examining the matter. Mr. O'Brien seems to intimate there are directly conflicting explanations as to why the investigation was launched in the first place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except whoever leaked.
