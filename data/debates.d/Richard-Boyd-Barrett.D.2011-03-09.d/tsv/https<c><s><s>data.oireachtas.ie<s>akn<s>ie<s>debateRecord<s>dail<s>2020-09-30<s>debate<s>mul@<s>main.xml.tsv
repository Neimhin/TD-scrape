RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government includes multiple commitments to sustaining rural life and to strengthening communities and yet, in the past week or so, postmasters have pointed out that An Post's network and many of our local post offices are on the brink of collapse because of a lack of Government support. In my area, two post offices are under threat as a result of the outsourcing model which means that the system depends on people being willing to take up the role of postmaster. There is no commitment to maintain the only publicly owned network to reach into every community, rural and urban. There is no commitment to sustain that network and to run Government business of all sorts through it in order to protect jobs, communities and the vital communication network provided to all communities in which An Post is represented. What does the Taoiseach say to the concerns raised by the postmasters?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite all the talk of us all being in this together, I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government is progressively abandoning many of the workers and sectors that have been most harshly hit by the public health measures it has put in place. By definition, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is given to people who have lost employment because of measures the Government has taken. They have done nothing wrong but they are being victimised with across-the-board cuts to their income. In the same week, the halt on mortgage repayments that could be used by those people is being lifted and they can now face further harassment from the banks at a time when their employment position may be deteriorating because of renewed restrictions. Despite repeated calls that I have made for months on behalf of taxi drivers to respond to their requests for assistance, their industry has been absolutely decimated and is being decimated again. They are going to be taking to their cars for a protest on 9 October out of desperation because of their situation but we have had no commitments or assurances. The arts, music and entertainment sector is worth €3.5 billion, with 35,000 people whose livelihoods have been decimated, and there is no clear commitment or assurance of financial supports to sustain them through this period. The Debenhams workers, whose employer used Covid-19 as a cynical excuse to execute a tactical liquidation, have now been on the picket lines for more than 170 days and the Government has completely abandoned them. It is absolutely outrageous. I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government must support all these people. Money is being given out hand over fist to sections of big business in this country which have not lost anything close to the amount of income that these sectors have lost. The Government has no problem giving the money to them. People involved in arts and music, the taxi drivers and the Debenhams workers have meanwhile been just abandoned. I ask the Taoiseach - and, more important, these people ask him - to do something for them. They are in trouble through no fault of their own.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The leaving certificate class of 2020 have suffered unacceptably because of a series of mess-ups. It is quite unconscionable that they are going to suffer yet again as a consequence of a gigantic and inexplicable cock-up. After all they have gone through and suffered, we now have this situation of uncertainty which could have very severe implications for those already in third level courses, those who may have missed out, and those who got the wrong grades. It is truly extraordinary. The Minister must come into this House today to make a statement explaining what the hell went on and what she will do to rectify it. The fact that outsourcing may have played a role in this is very telling. That speaks to the general lack of investment in education, which is at one of the lowest levels anywhere in the western world. These are the sorts of consequences that inevitably flow in difficult situations from a lack of investment in education. The class of 2020 are going to suffer as a consequence. We need explanations and we need to know what the Government is going to do to rectify the situation in which thousands of leaving certificate students now find themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister come before the House?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She should come to the House to answer questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We bailed out the banks to an enormous extent. They have not repaid society for that bailout in any substantial way. In fact, they have persecuted many mortgage holders who were in arrears and dispossessed many from their homes. We cannot have a repeat of that. The mortgage break ending opens up the prospect of that happening again. I heard Government spokespeople on the radio earlier saying that the banks would deal with people individually and take their personal circumstances into account. We have heard that nonsense before. What actually happens is that people suffer extreme anxiety and hardship and are pursued. That cannot happen in a context where the people are in financial difficulty because they have complied with public health measures directed by the Government. The Government must step in and provide that protection and ensure that those breaks for those who cannot manage to meet their mortgage and loan repayments are not persecuted and further punished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's policy is to rely on the goodwill of the banks to be humane towards borrowers in financial difficulty. That is pathetic. To call it naive would be a gross understatement. Remember what these banks did to borrowers who got in trouble as a result of the financial crash. They harassed and harangued them and put them through the wringer. People tried to engage with the banks. Banks would appear before the finance committee and say that they were being reasonable and were open to engagement, but in reality they were hounding, harassing and dispossessing people where they could. These are the same banks that are part-owners of the Debenhams consortium, dumped 1,000 Debenhams workers on the scrapheap and are allowing them to be treated in the most contemptible way. The Government's policy is just to let them at it. That is not a fair or acceptable policy to protect music workers, event workers, taxi drivers and people involved in tourism, transport-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and all sorts of other sectors who have lost income and employment because of Government measures. The Government needs to do more for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A big credit union.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not one big credit union?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Minister of State is doing now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State has got his headline now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will be opposing this Bill for a number of reasons. First, the manner in which this Bill is being pushed through is a disgrace. Even at this point, we are scrambling around and trying to get our heads around huge numbers of amendments, which will never be debated and discussed in any event. All of those amendments have been collapsed into the Second Stage debate and the legislation will be rammed through in a way that makes a mockery of legislative scrutiny and the democratic process. The fact the Green Party is a party to this is shocking beyond belief because I do not know how many times I heard members of the Green Party wax lyrical about the need for a sustainable forestry model and the critical importance of forestry in terms of climate change and biodiversity. Yet, it is assisting the bigger parties in the Government in ramming through this Bill, which will not address the huge crisis we face in a fundamentally dysfunctional forestry model and which could do significant damage. Aside from almost anything that is in the Bill, the process is a disgrace. That is a good enough reason to oppose this Bill because we will not have time to properly scrutinise it. Then we must consider what the Bill is facilitating, namely, the propping up of a rotten, dysfunctional and environmentally damaging forestry model. This model is driven by profit and that does not even come close to reaching the economic and employment potential that a proper forestry model would have. We are propping up a forestry model that is carrying out intense environmental damage. To give an indication of why I say that, in one day in 2019, some 824 separate felling licences were issued to clear 6,669 ha of public forest. Over the next three months, a further 345 more felling licences up to December 2019, covering a total of 9,527 ha of public forest were issued. Many of those might be subject to appeal. We should think about those figures. That is 15,000 ha of public forest that will be felled and that is just in the period of about half of last year. Many of those fellings could cause potentially significant environmental damage and be subject to appeal. Those figures are telling when one considers that we are planting about 4,000 ha of forest per year and for the most part, it is the wrong type of forest. In a short period of time, licences seeking to fell 15,000 ha were issued but we are only planting 4,000 ha. The Irish National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, has talked about us reaching our afforestation targets and getting from the abysmal level of forest cover, which has been mentioned a number of times, of 11% as against a European average of 30%, in a country that has the best conditions for growing trees anywhere in Europe and we have consistently gotten nowhere near those targets. When one adds together what I have just said and what we are planting against a push for accelerated harvesting, it is not surprising that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, among others has expressed deep concern that we may be in a situation of net deforestation. We are going from an already bad situation to a worse situation, therefore. I had some lobbying from some of my colleagues earlier who legitimately worry about the people who move the logs, the hauliers and so on, and those who participate in the work of cutting down trees or planting forests. Those concerns for employment and for people who earn their living from forestry are legitimate but I ask those colleagues to consider that in Wallonia, which is a quarter of the territory of Belgium, there is a timber industry worth €4.5 billion employing 18,000 people. In other words, in an area much smaller than this country, they have far more people employed in forestry and the revenue is far greater. There are 12,000 people employed in Irish forestry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I stated, in Wallonia it is worth €4.5 billion. We are massively underperforming in terms of the employment and revenue we could generate if we had a good and sustainable forestry model instead of the monocultural industrial forestry model that may result in net deforestation. As the model is largely based on one species of tree, it is quite damaging to soil and water. As it makes our forests more prone to disease and so on, it is a fundamentally unsustainable industry. It may also be worth pointing out that this industry does not generate quality employment. For example, when Coillte was set up in 1989, there were 2,500 staff in the forest service but today there are 600, with half of those being administrative staff. The people getting jobs in forestry are often poorly paid. It can be immigrant labour with very insecure work that does not amount to a job at all. Bogus self-employment is rampant, with worker rights, pay and conditions subject to widespread abuse. It is not a sustainable or beneficial forestry model from an employment perspective, a macroeconomic perspective and a biodiversity perspective. Against that background is the idea that we will try to restrict the right of people to object to planting or felling that is contributing to sustaining or propping up an unsustainable forestry model. That is not acceptable as far as I am concerned. We need a thoroughly independent review of the entire forestry sector rather than something that is trying essentially to cover the tracks of a failed policy. If we did forestry right we could create thousands of new, decent and quality jobs. It could be a forestry model based on diverse forest species, native woodlands and tree species that would generate all sorts of knock-on industries from a different type of forestry. It is a shocking fact that in a country where we were once covered with native hardwood trees, there is almost no native hardwood industry at all and we import much of our hardwood. It is shocking when we have supreme conditions for growing quality hardwood trees but it is not the short-term profit model favoured by pension funds, sawmills and the big corporate interests who dominate Irish forestry. It would nevertheless have a genuine benefit on the environment, employment, the economy and real communities with ordinary working people. It would of course also contribute to addressing the climate and biodiversity crisis, as we must. On this basis, we will oppose the Bill. We have tabled a number of amendments, most of which have been suggested by environmental groups, which should give the Green Party pause for thought in its support for the Bill. Those groups have described the Bill as shocking and the Green Party would have worked with these people closely. Perhaps its Deputies will explain why many of the people they have campaigned and worked with over many years believe this Bill to be retrograde and in need of being radically amended. It is not the legislation we need to develop an environmentally sustainable and genuinely economically beneficial forestry sector in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The logic pursued by the supporters of the Bill is rush, rush, rush. It is a dangerous rush and it is one that may well lead to people cutting off their nose to spite their face. I fully understand the anxiety, concern and pressure among small farmers who invested in forestry and who feel the need to gain a return on that investment. They should certainly be supported, as should people who rely for an income on forestry and investments they made in that regard. If, however, proper oversight of the impact of the felling of forests or the planting of the wrong types of forests is thrown out, it will ultimately damage not just the environment but also the conditions, the soil and the environment that allows a living to be made and employment gained. Of course we need to speed up the appeals process but we have to remember what we are dealing with. I understand Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's analogy, and this is not a criticism of him, but building a house, with all the objections and the planning permission that go with it, is one thing; a forest is very different, and particularly a large one. It has huge implications for the stability of the soil and the mountains, which forests keep up, and for ensuring there is not dangerous, poisonous run-off that affects water and so on. I do not want to overstate this but it cannot be overstated. Take, for example, Derrybrien and what happened there because a proper environmental impact assessment had not been carried out. We are still paying the price as a State. The damage was done because a proper environmental impact assessment had not been carried out. In the broader scope of history, however, the issue is even more significant. The truth is that places such as Iraq or huge parts of Greece that are now deserts were not always deserts. They became deserts because the trees were cut down, and the trees were where moisture gathered. The environment there was destroyed, with a short-term objective of felling wood, and in achieving a certain objective, the conditions in which the people made a living were destroyed. The lowlands below them were destroyed too, as a result of the damage done to the sides of mountains and so on when trees were being cut down. These are serious matters. It is not that some sort of vexatious objector is concerned about them; they have real implications for farmers, rural Ireland, the stability of soil, the quality of water and our wider environment. That is the nub of the debate on this. We should speed up the appeals process but qualified people who know what they are talking about should assess the applications and what the consequences might be. That means beefing up the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the forest service with jobs for people who have the skills, such as ecologists, who can process these matters properly, and not just because we are in a rush to get it done. If that means there is some delay, the farmer should certainly be compensated. Let us not set good ecological and forest management against the farmer, nor make them enemies of each other. Farmers should be compensated and supported. Nevertheless, we must bear in mind what I mentioned earlier. These are facts that were given to me. Coillte last year granted 800 felling licences in one day for 6,000 ha of forest to be felled, and on another day in December, 350 licences for another 9,000 ha. That is some of the backlog. These are not small farmers; they are large plantations that can have very serious consequences. Similarly, there is the sort of planting that is alienating communities and is not doing any good. It is not creating the sustainable model we want or employment. There is not much employment in this monocultural-type forest model. There is some employment for planting and felling but very little in between. As I pointed out earlier, a point my attention was brought to is that there are 12,000 jobs but, given the conditions for forestry that exist in this country, there should be a hell of a lot more. It should be generating a hell of a lot more revenue. The forestry model in many other countries throughout the world, on the same or less land, generates many more jobs and much more revenue because they have a proper forest model, or a better one, than what we have. Simply processing all these appeals rapidly, without properly doing the necessary assessments and ensuring we are making the correct decisions, with properly qualified people looking at those appeals, is a mistake that will ultimately damage farmers and rural Ireland and will not help us move towards the sustainable and better forest model we need. It will have the opposite impact. I had intended to read out the following earlier. It is such a brilliant quote from a surprising source and it puts the whole debate in historical context. It is from Friedrich Engels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Friedrich Engels's life partner was a woman from rural Ireland called Lizzie Burns. He stated:Let us not [...] flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first. The people who, in Mesopotamia, Greece, Asia Minor and elsewhere, destroyed the forests to obtain cultivable land, never dreamed that by removing along with the forests the collecting centres and reservoirs of moisture they were laying the basis for the present forlorn state of those countries. When the Italians of the Alps used up the pine forests on the southern slopes, so carefully cherished on the northern slopes, they had no inkling that by doing so they were [...] thereby depriving their mountain springs of water for the greater part of the year, and making it possible for them to pour still more furious torrents on the plains during the rainy seasons [...] Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature — but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.To me, that is the basis of a sustainable forestry and ecological policy that bears considerable relevance to the debate. It is in that context that I intend to move our amendment in this grouping, amendment No. 59.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mary Byrne.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find myself, strangely, in agreement with Deputy Fitzmaurice, or perhaps it is not so strange. We should not be debating this Bill. We certainly should not be rushing it through in this way. I have learned a lot from the Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and others. I genuinely bow to their knowledge and experience of certain situations, the views of farmers and all of those points. However, I also believe that our current forestry model is a problem. That is not the fault of individual farmers. Rushing through legislation that could have very significant knock-on consequences to solve a particular problem is not the answer. We should be allowed to consider this properly and come to a solution that is beneficial to all. That is now what this is about. I am not quite sure who is driving the agenda here, but I suspect it is far bigger players than those represented by Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae. The forestry appeals committee should not be tied to a particular timeline. Our amendment No. 59 is about ensuring that the forestry appeals committee carries out all the necessary checks which are required of the Minister by law and complies with all the relevant EU directives. That must be done, however long it takes. The forestry appeals committee should have the same legal obligations as the Minister in that regard. Unfortunately, those obligations will sometimes take time to fulfil. Deputy Mattie McGrath or Deputy Danny Healy-Rae might say it is just not realistic to give financial compensation to people whose decisions are held up. I understand that, but I think we should give such compensation. If they planted in good faith, their investment or employment is on the line and they face problems because of the requirement for proper environmental oversight, they should absolutely get support from the State.However, I do not think the two should be set against each other. We need to have proper oversight and should not be tied to arbitrary timelines as proposed in some amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the benefits of democracy, when it works at all which is not that often, is that one learns things. Even better, people are watching and are hearing the debate, which I am certainly learning from. They then bring to bear facts that impact on the debate we have heard. I have received one communication that is very interesting in that regard. It challenges very strongly the rationale behind the Bill and the rationale of many of the Deputies who have spoken in favour of this amendment. The rationale behind the Bill is that all these blackguards are appealing felling licences and this has caused a huge problem with people employed in the forestry sector sitting idle. To be honest, listening to the debate I thought maybe this is the case. I thought that maybe I had missed something because forestry is not huge where I live, although it is substantial enough in County Wicklow, which is not far from me. Of course, the Government has more or less been saying the same thing. The rationale is that we need to fast-track the appeals process, albeit not as fast as some Deputies want, but there is the problem of a massive backlog, and also that somehow these two things are connected. There is a backlog but is it connected to what we have heard here, factually? The Minister has not provided any evidence. However, somebody has helpfully provided a little bit of evidence which blows the argument completely out of the water. Let us have a guess as to what percentage of afforestation licences in 2019 were appealed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us have a guess. Seeing as all these blackguards are out there causing uproar, somebody must have a rough idea of the percentage of afforestation licences were appealed. The answer is 1.1%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What percentage of felling licences were appealed? It was 2.77%. In 2020, just over 1% of afforestation licences were appealed and 75% of felling licences were not appealed. There was a jump in the number of appeals in 2020 but it is still considerably less than one would be led to believe from the argument that there is a massive load of blackguards out there, clogging up the system. What might explain the clogging up of the system is the Department, not the blackguards-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been hearing a lot of rhetoric about blackguards, presumably environmental blackguards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must be getting somewhere-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must be touching a nerve now; that is all I can say. I must be touching a nerve.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decisions being made by the Department, not the appeals, are way down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Decisions issued by the Department on felling up to the end of August were way down, from nearly 3,500 at the end of August last year to just 1,040 this year. The issue of the supply of timber to sawmills lies at the door of the Department, not the environmental blackguards or the appeals committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Deputies can provide me with alternative statistics, I invite them to do so. I listened very carefully to everything they have said. If they have statistics that challenge those I provided on the appeals percentages, I would be happy to hear them. I am an open-minded person and I listen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is wrong with hugging trees? Deputy Mattie McGrath might do it to calm himself down occasionally. This suggests that the problem lies with the Department, not with blackguards or the appeals process in particular. If these facts-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is Deputy McGrath's source, other than references to blackguards? There are lots of blackguards out there, unnamed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us try to find agreement here. Would empirical evidence be useful in this debate? I think it would be quite useful. Maybe the Minister or Minister of State can provide us with some empirical evidence about the extent of the appeals against afforestation and felling licences. We need numbers on this. Is the problem being referred to by the Deputies here - and obviously there is a problem - to do with appeals or with a very dramatic drop in the ability of the Department to make decisions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us find out. That is the Deputy's opinion but we need facts. Let us have evidence-based decision making.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I listened very well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should provide empirical evidence to back up her arguments. It would be short-sighted, without that evidence, to in any way short-circuit, limit or narrow the basis upon which people can, for good reason, object to or appeal licence decisions. According to my source, the Department's ability to make decisions has dropped off because it was found that the method of appealing licences was not in compliance with EU law. That is actually what has happened. Compliance has required a considerable slowing up of the process. We have a dysfunctional forestry model and the EU has found us out. As a result, we have had to put a hell of a lot more resources into processing licence applications and that is what is slowing the process down. What do we do about that? It seems that we have to comply and we need to put the resources into complying with a sustainable forestry model while also clearing the backlogs and so on. We must do so in a way that is not environmentally damaging or in breach of environmental directives, laws and obligations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A deadline would be reasonable if the resources were made available and if the Department could guarantee that there was full compliance. If we just ram a decision through in an arbitrary eight weeks and are not in compliance, we will be in court the day after anyway because somebody will take us to court for having breached the directives. What we need is for the Department to put resources into ensuring that we are in compliance and that we change the forestry model so that we do not find ourselves in these difficulties again in the years ahead.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand Deputy Cairns's frustration, but these circumstances were set up the moment the Government tried to ram the Bill through. It was always going to happen that we would be in this situation, which is why I kicked up about it on the Order of Business yesterday. The normal process of pre-legislative scrutiny would have meant we would have dealt with much of this earlier. We would have dug into the detail earlier, as well as the debates and the proper consultation that should have happened, and it would have been sequenced. There would have been time between each Stage. That is what is needed for proper legislation. The Government, however, wanted to ram this through and it was always going to be a mess. Our group has tabled more amendments than anybody, so I am just as frustrated as Deputy Cairns. We are dealing with a group of amendments, and if I were her-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will. I am dealing with the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a group of amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a group of amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the amendments in the group centre on the same subject.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every amendment in the group centres on the same question, namely, whether we should rush things through and short-circuit the process or instead protect the process by which citizens can appeal. That is what the debate is about and it is what all the amendments in the group are about. Our amendment in the group is amendment No. 59, so that is what I am speaking to, but I am also speaking against the idea that solving the problems that have been highlighted will be done by introducing an arbitrary timeline of eight weeks. That will not solve them. To respond to Deputy Mattie McGrath, the figure he mentioned is a reasonably significant number of appeals, and if somebody is lodging all of them, that is a bit much. I do not know who the person is. It is interesting, however, that 61% of those appeals were accepted, so there is a problem. I reiterate that rather than us tearing out one another's eyes over this legislation, which is a set-up, we should look over at the Government. I disagree with Deputy Carthy, who blamed us for this. That is wrong and he is wrong to back the Government on this. The legislation will not solve the problem and it will not address-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the Deputy's opinion and I disagree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, the Deputy is trying to spin it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was having a pop. That is what he was doing. For the information of Deputy Mattie McGrath, the decline in output in the processing of applications by the Government dwarfs the figure he mentioned. It is a decrease of 2,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy wants to know why there is currently a backlog in the industry. It is not the few hundred appeals he referred to, although I do not deny that is an issue; it is the decrease of 2,000 in the processing of applications, most of which would not have been appealed. They would have gone through but they are not being processed, and that is the problem.
