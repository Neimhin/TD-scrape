RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decision of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party to drop the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 and leave it out of the proposed programme for Government is a disgrace, and a betrayal of the Palestinian people and of any semblance of commitment to human rights for people generally, specifically for the long-persecuted Palestinian people. Was dropping the Bill the price of getting the seat on the UN Security Council? Given the reports of lobbying by the Israeli ambassador and US congresspeople, will the Government furnish to the House and the public any and all records, memos or communication between the Government and the Israeli ambassador, or between civil servants and the Israeli ambassador, and similar communications between the Government and representatives of the US Congress? We need transparency about who lobbied the Government, what it said and what conversations led it to sacrifice the Palestinian people in this appalling way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister aware of how frustrated and annoyed teachers and parents are about the lack of clarity regarding the reopening of schools in September? He needs to be. Every primary school knows or learns quickly that one cannot put a square peg into a round hole, but it seems that the Minister and the Government think one can and are determined to try to put a square peg into a round hole. The square peg in this instance is the Minister's determination to reopen schools as normal and the round hole is, pre-Covid, the most overcrowded classes and most underfunded education system in Europe, and now on top of that is the requirement for social distancing. One does not fit into the other and everybody knows that is the case. The round hole becomes even less able to take the square peg when, in the framework document that the Minister produced on 12 June, he categorically ruled out the thing that could resolve this conundrum by stating, "It is also not feasible to consider the wholesale splitting of classes and recruiting extra teachers – given that there are significant teacher supply issues currently." If that is the case, we are banjaxed. The Minister can insist he is going to put the square peg into the round hole, but it cannot be done. It does not matter whether the Minister talks about pods or bubbles because, as one teacher put it, we already have pods and bubbles, and they are called classes. To give the Minister an idea of what those classes look like, in one DEIS band 2 school, a teacher who I will not name has 30 children in sixth class. She says that almost all of the kids in that class are taller than she is. How will that class be turned into bubbles and pods with social distancing and isolation when somebody has symptoms? Where will that person be placed? Who will look after the room in which someone is isolated? It does not work unless we have extensive recruitment of teachers and significantly expand the capacity of our system, providing the necessary funding and resources. The Minister is ruling that out. Many cleaners would need to be recruited for the necessary sanitisation of the classrooms to try to manage this. Even in the best case scenario, I know that this is difficult, but the Minister seems to be insisting that he is not doing the one thing that could possibly point the way to resolving this conundrum. I put it to the Minister that this cannot and will not work. It is reliant on blind optimism about what the Minister hopes might happen in September. Even then, is it compliant with what NPHET and the expert advisory group say about social distancing? I do not see how it could be unless they say that no social distancing is necessary in schools. Will the Minister please resolve that conundrum? I put it to him that what is necessary is a call for Ireland, but a better one than we had for healthcare workers. We need a call for Ireland to appeal for people who are qualified and for cleaners and so on who will be offered proper, paid jobs in education to give us the smaller class sizes where the bubbles and pods are possible. Recruit all the school secretaries. Are they expected to sign on for the dole again this summer after all the work they have done? Can we treat special needs assistants with respect and pay them properly too? They are angry about how they have been treated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I saw the Taoiseach on "Prime Time" having fun at Sinn Féin's expense and referring to it as-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, "Spin Féin". Listening to it, I thought that it was ironic. I thought it was even more ironic when I listened to the Minister and to Deputy Donnelly today. Frankly, the performances by the Taoiseach on "Prime Time" and those of the Minister and Deputy Donnelly today suggest that it is more about "Spina Gael" and "Spina Fáil". I mean that in all sincerity because there is almost nothing I disagree with in the Minister's speech. It was a great speech, heaping praise on our health workers, saying we must never go back to where we were. It was absolutely brilliant. I do not know if the Minister wrote it or a speechwriter did but I could not agree more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then the truth is revealed when Deputy Donnelly gets up to speak and it is very clear that the party with whom Fine Gael has just agreed a deal, and the deal itself, make a clear and explicit commitment not to go forward, but to go back. That commitment is to reopen private healthcare and to source the additional capacity that we now need more than ever. We needed it badly before Covid but we now need it even more badly. More capacity is required, but is going to be sourced through the NTPF where we are going to rent it from the profiteers in the private healthcare sector rather than move immediately forward, and not back, as the Minister suggested he wanted to do, to a national health system which would be a single-tier universal national healthcare system. We can have all the aspiration toward Sláintecare with words like "in ten years" and "accelerate", but in actuality the plan is to immediately move back to the two-tier system and to source additional capacity by renting it at extortionate cost from Larry Goodman, Denis O'Brien and all the people who make a fortune out of this stuff. There is the spin. Is it not the case that the heaping of praise on healthcare workers in the same context rings deeply hollow and is, in fact, hypocritical? What is capacity in the Irish health service? Before Covid we were running at 100% capacity. In the case of ICU capacity, we were 50% below where we needed to be and now we need even more. In the general system, we need an increase in capacity of at least 20% and with social distancing, we need more than that. If we are going to have a single tier health system, it should be permanent capacity and not rented from the private sector. We need more ICU capacity. What then is that capacity? It is the staff. It is not the beds because we can get the beds pretty quickly. How are we treating the staff? We know the answer. Some 70,000 people who the Minister lauded and on whom he heaped praise, and who deserved to be praised, volunteered to come back and work in the health service but the Government will not recruit them. The Taoiseach then says on national television that anyone who wants to work in the health service will be hired - this is the spin - if there is a post. It is brilliant. Of course, the number of approved posts is nowhere near what is necessary to give us the additional permanent capacity because the Minister will not approve the posts. Is that not the truth? Instead we recruit people on agency contracts, hire them and fire them contracts, and we can throw them back out. By the way, the fourth year student nurses can be thrown back out there as healthcare assistants and so on. There is no real commitment to the permanent increases in capacity. I will give the Minister 20 seconds to answer that.
