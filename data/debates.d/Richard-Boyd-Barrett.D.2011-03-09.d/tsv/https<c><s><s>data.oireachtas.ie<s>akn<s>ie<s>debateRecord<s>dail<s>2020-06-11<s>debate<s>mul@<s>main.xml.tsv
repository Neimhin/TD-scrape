RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. I have raised on a number of occasions my disquiet at the fact that the Minister decided to go through recruitment agencies, such as CPL, to recruit staff for the health service during the pandemic. I refer to the 70,000 people who bravely volunteered for the Be On Call for Ireland initiative. I asked a question recently of the Minister which was passed on to the HSE about the cost of using CPL and agencies like that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Recruitment agencies. I simply did not get an answer. I got other answers but not the answer about how much it cost. What I was told, which is fairly extraordinary, is that of the 70,000 people who applied for the Be On Call for Ireland programme, 111 have been recruited.That is pitiful. It is against a background of a dire need for increased staffing for Covid and non-Covid care, where we were already in a chronic situation in terms of capacity with poor levels of staffing before Covid, and we have additional needs. These agencies have managed to recruit 111 people. Some 663 people are job-ready and available for employment when they are required, which suggests we are deliberately not employing people even though they are qualified to do the job. We are just sort of keeping them on hold, which is extraordinary. Insofar as there was an explanation as to why we had gone through these agencies, it was because it would threaten the stability of the existing HSE payroll structure, which is just nonsense. Will the Minister shed any light on this pitiful failure by these agencies, the refusal to recruit people through Be On Call for Ireland, and that bogus explanation as to why we use these agencies in the first place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The agencies' pitiful failure, and leaving not recruited hundreds who are qualified, is inexplicable, as is the Department not outlining the cost. I have a question about St. Mary's Centre on Merrion Road, run by the Sisters of Charity, who say the centre will have to close because it is unable to meet the HIQA requirements. This is a centre for the vulnerable and elderly where there were no Covid cases, which suggests it is not a bad place, yet the charity is saying the centre has to close because it cannot afford to come up to HIQA requirements. It is unacceptable that the Sisters of Charity, for reasons best known to themselves, will close a nursing home for the vulnerable, the blind and the elderly. For whatever reason, that should not be allowed to happen and the State should step in and take over that nursing home.
