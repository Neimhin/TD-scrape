RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Feely and Mr. Moran of Age Action. I apologise for being late and missing their contribution but I read their statement. As others have done, I commend Age Action on its ongoing representation of, and advocacy for, older people in this country.A major issue which we all have heard about, and on which I have received representations, is the number of pensioners, particularly women pensioners, who have been significantly adversely affected by the changes introduced to the way the contributions to the contributory pension scheme are calculated combined with the lifetime average method of calculating ultimate entitlement and the failure to backdate the period spent as a homemaker to those who left the workforce before the specified dates by the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in 2012. People have been dealt a triple whammy, which has negatively impacted on 36,000 pensions, particularly women. The issue has been raised with the Minister and he indicated a willingness to look at it, but I have not heard anything since. Has Age Action heard anything further about what the Government proposes to do? Nobody could fail to acknowledge this injustice and how it impacts on gender. This injustice will get worse if it is not addressed. Has Age Action any estimates or projections on the numbers that will be affected as time goes on? I would have thought that another cohort that will be affected by this measure as time goes on, unless it is changed, is the people who had to emigrate, and we have had successive waves of emigration in recent years. An issue that I do not think was mentioned, or was referred to briefly is the thresholds for entitlement to a medical card. This was in spite of the significant resistance and struggle of people to protest at the time the automatic entitlement to a medical card of a pensioner was attacked. The then Government rolled back under the impact of the protests by pensioners and in particular the bodies, including Age Action which organised the protests. Is there an ongoing creeping problem of pensioners losing their medical card and then having to apply for a discretionary medical card? That puts people through the hardship of losing the card and having to reapply for a medical card. Will Age Action comment on that?  Another issue which I have been chatting to Mr. Moran about is the issue of motor insurance for pensioners. I know that our older population are one of the groups that are being particularly hard hit by the extortionate rises in motor insurance premiums. A number of categories are being hit, but older people are definitely a category that are being discriminated against. Is that something that we can and should raise in the context of requiring some sort of action in the budget that would begin to address the unfairness of motor insurance premiums?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has Mr Moran been hearing this from quite a few of his members?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of income supports, I may have missed this point, has Age Action outlined a figure of what it is looking for in terms of the increase in the budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While we are on the subject, there is obviously a big controversy in the area of public sector pensions at the moment. I presume that some of the members of Age Action are public sector pensioners. What is Mr. Moran's opinion on the moves being mooted, as I and many workers and unions see it, and on the talk of further eroding public service pensions? There is talk of increases being linked only to inflation rather than to half of career-end earnings or the average earnings, which was the first phase of attacking those pensioners. Has Mr. Moran any thoughts on that subject? It may be a controversial area to get into from Mr. Moran's point of view but there is a school of thought around improving the pensions for low and middle-income pensioners and for ordinary pensioners on the State pension, which is to do something about the huge tax breaks for the very wealthy on their private pension contributions. They get very nice pensions at the end of it and a huge proportion of the tax breaks available for this area actually go to that cohort. If we began to look at that measure then we could use the money to increase the level of the State pension. Does Mr. Moran have views on that debate? I will move on to my last question. I know that Mr. Moran spoke of home-care packages and the increasing demographic pressure to provide for our growing, older population. Mr. Moran said he would rather start with a vision on what it is we want for people and then afterwards talk about how we would pay for it. I believe this is the right starting point but we on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight must consider how to pay for it. I agree that we must start with the vision but we also need to think about how to pay. The unions have been pushing, quite rightly, on the whole issue of employers' PRSI and the very low levels of employers' PRSI being paid in the State compared to the rest of the European Union. I believe it is fairly indisputable and is just a fact. Calculations have been done that show if Ireland moved anywhere close to the average EU PRSI contributions, a huge pot of money would accrue from that. It would actually begin to generate the sorts of revenues we need to deal with the problems and needs of an ageing population. Perhaps Mr. Moran would comment on some of those suggestions.
