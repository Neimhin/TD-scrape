RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question concerns the raging debate about the need to consider options such as biomass as opposed to plans for industrial wind farm, which have been the subject of much of the focus. Some €3.8 billion is planned to be spent on boosting our transmission system to facilitate controversial large wind turbines. There are major arguments against this and I do not have the time to go through all of them, but many people believe that this is not the best route to take. For example, the simple measure of converting Moneypoint to biomass would go a long way towards meeting our greenhouse emission targets at a fraction of the cost of industrial wind farms. Is the Government considering this option and what is its response?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must consider matters such as this holistically. We plan to spend €3.8 billion to boost the transmission system so as to facilitate plans for industrial wind farms. This affects people in the midlands, but there is also major concern about and opposition to the proposal to build one of the world's largest wind farms on the Kish bank in Dublin Bay. Conversely, it is estimated that it would cost approximately €380 million to convert Moneypoint, just 10% of our planned spend. It is true that there is not enough biomass in the country to fuel it, but it is also true that the largest coal-burning plant in Britain was recently converted to biomass and has found a source of biomass to supply it at a fixed, reasonable cost. There are strong arguments to the effect that biomass is much better at helping countries to meet targets. We would need to expand our biomass capacity indigenously, but it is important to note that Coillte has a significant amount of land that could be developed to expand biomass. According to the McCarthy report, 500,000 acres of its land are not being used to grow trees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's statement that we must get together to discuss this matter. Many people with enthusiasm for, knowledge of and interest in this issue must be included urgently. If we do not believe that industrial, large-scale wind farms are the answer, we must develop alternatives. We need that debate quickly. I am convinced that the industrial wind farm model does not give the best value for money and is not the best way to reduce carbon emissions. Although it needs to be investigated, biomass appears to be a better option in the long term and more appropriate for this country, in that we are capable of growing trees at a fast rate and have a great deal of land on which to do so. For example, Coillte has 500,000 acres of land with which it is doing nothing. We could utilise that land to develop alternative forms of renewable energy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister can see there is a theme to all my questions today on the area of renewable energy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This particular aspect relates to the public service obligation. As the Minister is aware, there is much anger about sneaky, regressive charges imposed on people in respect of property, parking, water or whatever. I seek detailed information about what is actually happening to the public service obligation levy of €64 per annum that is imposed on people's electricity bills. The levy increased by 50% this year, which is another burden on many hard-pressed families. Where is the money going because it is increasing the cost of living for people? I acknowledge the need to meet our sustainable energy targets but I have concerns or suspicions about where this money is going and whether it is being used in the best way to develop renewable energy and a secure energy supply for this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise; that was a mistake.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I need to study the Minister's answer carefully, and I can see it contains quite a lot of detail. What I want to know is the extent to which this money is being used to subsidise private companies. There are many aspects to the anger around Irish Water but one aspect is that money out of people's pockets could be going into the pockets of highly paid executives and consultants and into what is legally a private entity which might be privatised further down the road. Essentially, we are subsidising making other people very rich. I want to know if that is happening with the public service obligation levy. Is the money going into the pockets of private companies? How much of it is going into the pockets of private companies? What are they doing with the money? Is it being used to pay people exorbitant salaries, big bonuses and God knows what else and to make other profits for the shareholders in private companies? I want to know that detail. Can the Minister give us information on the companies that are getting it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly. We have the ESB, Coillte and Bord na Móna, all of which are hugely successful, and we at least have some capacity to have oversight of those, although I believe we need more, but what oversight is there of private companies? There is fury and anger over the bonus culture in Irish Water, the salaries of its chief executives, the potential that we are subsidising a private company and so on. The Minister is aware of the anger about that. What is going on with €300 million of public money coming out of people's pockets? To whom is it going? Is there any oversight of the way it is being spent? Is this the best way to do it rather than through our own semi-State companies that we own, where all the benefit and value comes back to us and over which we have some real oversight? There have been allegations of political cronyism, particularly in the area of the wind turbine business, that people are in senior positions in that business who have political connections to the Government parties. We need transparency on this and I want to know who the companies are, the mechanisms that are in place to make sure this money is not just being put into consultants' pockets or going towards the payment of big salaries, bonuses and so on. Can we get detailed information?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not saying the Minister does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The thread of these questions continues so I might take up where I left off. A major concern is that private wind energy companies is not the best way to invest our money in terms of developing renewable energy. In an article in The Irish Times, which the Minister probably read, Dr. Anthony White, who is the co-founder of BW Energy and is a low carbon and power market specialist, stated:If wind power is so cheap, why does it need special treatment, in the form of guaranteed feed-in tariffs, and why are Ireland's household power prices today 20 per cent higher than the European average?If it is so "green", why have Ireland's CO2 emissions per kWh from power generation actually increased since 2009.Those are serious questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made the point. Serious questions need to be answered, and Dr. Anthony White raised some serious questions about whether the significant investment of €3.8 billion we are putting in in a particular area of industrial wind and so on is the best place to invest it. We need to answer those questions very quickly. When the Minister says he wants to consult with all those who are interested, what is he proposing in that regard because there is a lot of stakeholders and people interested? I note with annoyance and anger that it costs €1,000 to attend some of these big conferences.Could we have a conference that ordinary people interested in this area could attend to discuss these matters? A proposal put to me by people interested in afforestation, and which I believe is implemented in many parts of Europe, is for district energy heating systems and local energy co-operatives. Under the proposal, there would not be a big, centralised, industrialised model; rather, one would determine the extent to which specific areas and towns could generate their own energy, with some assistance from the State in terms of land and local community support, potentially developing local employment and resulting in much greater economic benefits. Could the Minister comment on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely welcome that response. I agree that we need a little time, although we should not take too much time. There is urgency but we need real consultation and buy-in. We need to tap into the expertise, knowledge, ideas and enthusiasm of communities and people who know about this matter. I must press my proposal, which has been given to me by others who know more about it than I do but which is a very good idea. I refer to the idea of district energy heating and local energy co-operatives. It requires joined-up thinking with Coillte, which, as I said to the Taoiseach some days ago, has 500,000 acres of land, as identified in the McCarthy report. The company believes the very narrow commercial wood-growing approach is just not viable for it, but it might be very viable for local communities to take some of that land at a peppercorn rent and develop projects thereon growing trees and creating other energy systems, such as small-scale hydroelectric and wind systems, thereby generating real employment. The Minister should seriously think about that and engage with the people proposing this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely welcome the Minister's engagement. This is my last shot on the same theme. There are some serious questions to be answered and I would like a little more detail. The Taoiseach was pleading to the European Union for concessions on our targets yesterday because of the difficulties we are having. He states we have a big agriculture sector and refers to other factors. The Minister said that we are not meeting the targets in some areas. Therefore, we must address this. Dr. Anthony White states in his article that our focus on wind energy could be part of the problem. I would like the Minister to revert to me on this. Dr. White points out that carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt from power generation have actually increased since 2009. Therefore, the expansion of wind energy has not contributed significantly to the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. This may explain why we are not doing well in meeting our targets; we are looking in the wrong area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the consideration of bioenergy and the willingness of the Minister to scrutinise these issues seriously. I have indicated my disposition towards focusing more on district energy and local energy co-operatives using a sustainable mix of energy-production technologies that will be more in tune with community interests and potentially generate local employment. Much of the emphasis has been on industrial wind turbines. How is it that although wind generation has expanded by 40%, it is being claimed that carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt of power generated have increased? Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether this is true. Might it be because there are hidden environmental costs contributing to carbon dioxide emissions? This is the contention of many of the critics of industrial wind turbines. Are we taking into account the big emission cost of the expansion or beefing up of the transmission network?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the contention.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Minister. That is exactly what we need to do. Unfortunately, I am not on that committee. I wish I was, but I am on two committees already. However, I will sit in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have an interest in this area. What the Minister suggests is fair enough. Let us look at it honestly and let us get all the different opinions in and give them a chance to put forward their views. Many of them feel they are not being fully listened to and that a particular lobby that has had all the hearing is getting all the support and resources, which is not necessarily the most useful cost-effective and environmentally sustainable way to develop renewable energy, and that must be addressed if we are to move this matter forward.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fact, there are only four of us so we will have two and a half minutes each. The people of this country gave their verdict on water charges last Saturday week when 100,000 people took to the streets and said they could not and would not pay the charges, and the Government had no right to impose yet another crippling tax on low and middle income households and to make them pay for what is a basic human right. That was the overwhelming sentiment; water is a human right. One's access to a right cannot be dictated by one's ability to pay. The Minister will be sure on 1 November that the demonstration was not a flash in the pan, because on the next occasion, instead of having 100,000 people on the streets of Dublin there will be thousands of people in hundreds of locations across the country as the movement against the hated water charges moves into every town and county in the country. The resistance will only escalate from there.It is about time this Government realised that the people will not accept water charges and will resist them every step of the way. The Government should listen to the people when they say water is a human right. This is our resource and the Government has no right to hand it to a private company, to the consultants who are milking Irish Water, to charge us for a natural resource that belongs to the people.  Finally, I wish to highlight a shocking fact that has not been aired in this debate. I refer to the general conditions for a water and wastewater connection agreement, which, incredibly, states that under the terms and conditions for customers signing up to the agreement, Irish Water demands that a customer must receive written permission from it to put water flowing off a roof or even off paving stones into Irish Water's sewers. This is water from the sky - not treated water coming in through the pipes - but the water from the sky. Given that the charge is made up of 50% of water coming in and 50% water going out, this is setting the legal basis to charge people for water from the sky. This is what was done in Detroit and in Bolivia and it is shameful. This is being legally established in the conditions which people will sign up to. We are not going to pay for that; we will pay when God sends us the bill and God does not exist.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or you could just abolish the charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the corporations to pay for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to share time with Deputy Paul Murphy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the face of it, the introduction of this Bill seems to be a reasonably positive move. As I understand it, we are making it easier for companies to develop generic medicines without running foul of patent laws or infringing intellectual property rights. I can certainly see the value of that. The bigger context for much of this debate is the scandalous manner in which big pharmaceutical companies have used patent restrictions on life-saving drugs, such as AIDS anti-viral drugs, to prevent countries in the developing world from producing cheap generic versions of those drugs. Huge struggles and campaigns have been organised by people who are justifiably furious and angry because pharmaceutical companies are prioritising their profits, and their perceived right to control the intellectual property rights to particular drugs, rather than the lives of humans who desperately need live-saving drugs. In so far as this Bill seems to be part of a move to hasten and facilitate the development of generic and cheaper versions of drugs, it is a good thing. I can also see the advantages of this legislation from a domestic economic point of view. Many patented branded drugs can be produced more cheaply, and consequently delivered more cheaply to the people who need them, as generic products with the same biological ingredients but without the branding and the patent costs, etc. Such positive aspects of the Bill should be broadly welcomed. A few questions that arise with regard to the whole area of intellectual property are worth discussing in this context. Why do the cost savings to the public health service that were supposed to derive from the expansion of the development of generic drugs not seem to have delivered the big dividend that this Government was talking about a few years ago? The reduction in the cost to the health service does not seem to have transpired in real terms. I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State and the Government have to say in that regard. I wonder whether some of the big pharmaceutical companies lobbied the Government to try to prevent it from accessing cheaper versions of drugs that would reduce the cost to the public health service. This, in turn, might have prevented the delivery of the big savings that were talked about at length a couple of years ago.All discussion of them has disappeared, however, given the major crises of funding, safety and so on in the health service. What has happened to the large savings we were hoping to deliver? Broadly speaking, this Bill is moving in a progressive direction by loosening the patent restrictions and allowing the production of certain drugs. However, it raises a wider question about intellectual property. We must start considering this important issue because the assigning of value to intellectual property is one of the key mechanisms through which large multinational corporations avoid tax. In this context, we must consider definitions and the question of how we assign value to intellectual property and allocate profits from same. The idea is seemingly being abused by large corporations to avoid paying a fair share of tax on their profits, which was the issue at the centre of the famous double Irish tax scam that the Government claims it is moving to close by demanding that the companies incorporated in Ireland now be tax liable here. I am sure the Minister of State knows that, under the double Irish, companies making large profits in Ireland would transfer those under the guise of intellectual properties to which they assigned a significant value to companies that were tax resident in Bermuda or another tax haven, thereby avoid paying tax on them. According to the Government, we are phasing out the double Irish, but we will move towards a patent box. Many commentators other than me have asked whether we are just replacing one tax scam with another in order to facilitate large multinationals' aggressive tax avoidance by ascribing significant values to intellectual properties, thereby hiding profits. I believe much of the commentary that suggests this is the case. In response to the closing off of the double Irish, for example, the Debt and Development Coalition Ireland stated: "The Government is playing musical chairs on corporate tax. While it is welcome that the 'Double Irish' scheme will be closed, the phased approach to its closure provides corporations with 6 years to avail of new tax dodging mechanisms". We will have the patent box at the end of those six years, the practice of which in Britain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and so on has been criticised as another mechanism to allow companies to hide profits. As such, it seems that a Bill like this one is a missed opportunity to have a serious discussion about definitions of "intellectual property" and what value can fairly be assigned to it. It is tempting to become somewhat philosophical about what constitutes intellectual property. Despite being a student of English literature, I was unaware that one of the first people to come up with the idea of copyright, which later developed into patents and so on, was the poet William Wordsworth. It was a revolution or, rather, a counter-revolution in how ideas and intellectual property were handled. Sometimes we assume that we have always had laws that allow us to privatise and commodify intellectual property, ideas and so forth. Prior to Wordsworth and the beginning of the 19th century, though, there was no such notion. In fact, there was the opposite, a recognition that ideas were no one's property. Shakespeare would have laughed at the idea of intellectual property. His plays were a patchwork of patent infringements, as it were. He would have been sued to high heaven under the current patent laws for cogging material from the ancient Greeks and Romans, earlier writers in medieval-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. There was an understanding at the time that ideas were no one's property. Rather, they were an accumulation of generations of developments and advancements in knowledge. Everyone was standing on the shoulders of everyone else in the development of ideas, literature, innovation, etc. That is the truth. I do not know whether my next point is absolutely true, but I remember reading an article that claimed that the Windows system, a revolution in computer technology, was not developed by Bill Gates and Microsoft, but by a person in Xerox who did not take out a patent. Someone else patented it instead. Whoever developed Windows was standing on the shoulders of those who had come before him and had advanced our knowledge, understanding, experience, ideas, science and technology. The idea that one can parcel intellectual property as a commodity that is owned by someone is a major problem. The serious implications of this are evident in terms of generic medicines, where companies told people dying of AIDS that, unless they paid a price assigned by the companies to their life-saving "intellectual property", then it was a case of tough luck. While I accept that the Bill is moving a little in the direction of challenging this stance, it does not go far enough, given the stranglehold that large corporations seem to have on ideas that they claim are their private property when it is highly debatable that those ideas are instead the accumulation and advancement of human knowledge, science and technology. This might seem philosophical, but it translates on a day-to-day economic level into the restrictions placed on people when innovating and pushing the boundaries of knowledge by the claim by the companies concerned that the ideas are their property and cannot be touched or researched, otherwise they will sue. The trend of corporatisation and commodification of intellectual property and ideas to the benefit of large corporations at the expense of society and pushing the boundaries of science, technology and knowledge is a matter of concern. Worryingly, another sector relevant to this discussion is that of food, where genetic modification poses potential dangers.Essentially, companies are trying to force countries and regions to become dependent on particular genetically-modified food and then gain a monopoly in the production of that food at the expense of people being able to do those things themselves or to produce their own sustainable food supply. These are important issues that in some ways I am surprised have not been considered in a Bill that deals with intellectual property. In particular, I refer to the area of the patent box and how Members will define intellectual property for the purposes of assigning value and profits and so on to make sure it is not simply another tax avoidance scheme by major multinationals.
