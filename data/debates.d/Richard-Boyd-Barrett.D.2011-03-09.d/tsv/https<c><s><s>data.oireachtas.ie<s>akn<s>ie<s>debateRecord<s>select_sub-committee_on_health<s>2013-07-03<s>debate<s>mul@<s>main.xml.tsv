RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we dealing with amendment No. 18?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Ó Cuív made a reasonable point.  
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not hear Deputy Creed's points.  In the case of Savita Halappanavar the issue of time and urgency was a factor.  Where disputes or uncertainty arise, time becomes a factor.  There is great value in underlining in the legislation the need for urgency to ensure any life-saving procedure or consultation required is expedited.  That is important in light of events that have occurred previously and the possibility for delay in the grey areas that will be encountered.I support these amendments and urge the Government to accept them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What we know is that up until now the criminalisation of certain medical practices meant there was a chill factor. Frankly, the very draconian 14-year prison sentence could still act as a chill factor which could compromise medical objectivity when making decisions in these difficult circumstances. I do not accept the Minister’s assurances on this. He does not acknowledge that time delay can be a factor. It was a factor in the Savita Halappanavar case. I do not know why the Minister finds it amusing but it was. Against that background, it is entirely right and appropriate to give assurance to women. After Savita’s case, women would be justified in being fearful as to whether they would get appropriate treatment if their life were at risk. These amendments will provide assurance to women and legal underpinning to the necessity to move quickly in such situations. I accept the majority of doctors would respond quickly but delays could occur. I cannot see what basis the Minister has for refusing these provisions. It cannot do any harm and it might do some good.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is politicising this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is unfortunate people are choosing to score political points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I made a point which I stand over. The context is the Savita Halappanavar case where time and delays were an issue. It is reasonable to point to that and say women would have concerns and fears. I said the Minister was not acknowledging the fact that this fear of delay was a legitimate concern.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Healy has made an important point. There is a disagreement about this but the Minister and Minister of State have made a reasonable point about not interfering with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----best medical practice and being too prescriptive. We have made a reasonable point about the need to underline urgency. If the Minister accepts the sentiment he might consider some way of addressing both those concerns, for example one could insert after if practical, "and with due regard to the urgency of the situation".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do that.A point that has not been raised because of the way the amendments have been debated is that there should be an insertion, after line 3 on page 9, in connection with a risk to the woman's life, as per the X case judgment, which risk may be neither immediate nor inevitable. That is important because it would be in line with the X case judgment and because we have a concern that there is considerable dispute over when there may be a risk to the life of the mother and, consequently, she might have a right to a termination. It is important to underline that as far as the Supreme Court was concerned, the risk to the life of the mother did not have to be immediate or inevitable, it simply had to be real and substantial. That is an important caveat which should be included if we are to honour the spirit of the X case judgment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to prolong the discussion, except to say that the Minister's response to the point that I and Deputy Seamus Healy have raised is inadequate. The Supreme Court felt it important enough to put in this important qualification in terms of what represents a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman. They felt it was necessary to clarify that such risk must not be inevitable or immediate. That, as the Minister will be aware, is a very important qualification and really speaks to the uncertainty about what point one decides that a woman's life is really under threat. This qualification, put in by the Supreme Court, is erring on the side of caution in relation to a woman's life and it is right and proper that it should do so. In this section and throughout the Bill, this is a significant inadequacy in the safeguards for a woman's life. The Minister might not accept the amendments now but I would urge him to consider what we have said. We will be returning to this in the other sections and on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, this is part of a group of amendments. The amendments put forward by Deputy Seamus Healy and supported by a number of us fall if the Minister's is accepted. This really gets to a very important aspect of the Bill. This is far to onerous a bar to jump over for women whose lives may be threatened because of suicidal ideation, and we do not see the justification for having three doctors. If in other cases in which one is being certified for a mental health condition one psychiatrist would be all that was required, why in the particular case in which suicidal ideation, a mental health condition, happens to be linked to the question of a termination of pregnancy should there be an extra hoop to jump through in order to prove that there is a serious risk to someone's life? It seems there are no medical grounds for this.That is a view that I believe is supported by the expert group. It is certainly a view that has been supported by a number of people who gave evidence to the committee and who have spoken on the issue. Furthermore, I see no reason an obstetrician is required to testify as to whether there is a risk of suicide, because an obstetrician is not qualified in the area. Why is an obstetrician necessary to certify whether there is a risk of suicide? It is simply not necessary. The provision is too onerous, unworkable and unjustified. We propose to reduce the number to two relevantly qualified medical practitioners, which is in the best interest of safeguarding the lives of women in these situations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has stated that the suggestion or proposal that this legislation should include the qualification that the threat to a woman's life should neither be immediate or inevitable would be superfluous. I put it to the Minister in the strongest terms that this is wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The Minister responded to members' points and I am responding to his point. He is completely wrong. If the Supreme Court thought it sufficiently important to put in that qualification to explain what was meant by a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, namely, that it did not have to be inevitable or immediate, why in this legislation is the Minister second-guessing what the Supreme Court stated? How can the Minister sustain an argument that it is superfluous? Is he suggesting that the Supreme Court's inclusion of that important qualification was superfluous because clearly, it was not? It was extremely pertinent to its decision in the X case that the threat need not be inevitable or immediate. Consequently, it appears to me as though the Minister is tightening the definition in this legislation in an unacceptable way, which ultimately could put at risk the lives of women where there is a real and substantial threat but where that threat is not deemed to be inevitable or immediate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is clarifying the meaning of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are narrowing the scope.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman for his indulgence because I have to attend a finance committee meeting shortly but I want to make a number of points to the Minister of State. I will begin where he concluded. I agree with the Minister when he says that delay is tantamount to not vindicating people's rights in this case and for that reason I agree wholeheartedly with what he said about Deputy Mulherin's suggestions. It would be a threat to women's lives if we were to take on board those suggestions but I ask the Minister to follow through on that logic when it comes to the issue of the number of doctors. The Minister has admitted that because there is an unborn life in this equation, he is establishing a higher bar for certification as to the threat to a woman's life when it comes to suicidal feelings than would normally be the case were there not an unborn child in the equation. That is diluting a woman's right to life because-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly, but if what we are trying to do is vindicate the woman's right to life and ensure there is no threat to her life, if we were certifying or assessing suicidal ideation in this case than would be the case normally where there was not a pregnancy means that woman's rights are being diluted. She is getting second class rights because there is a pregnancy. I am not a doctor but psychiatrists are saying that under normal circumstances, if somebody were to be certified, all that is required is one psychiatrist and one general practitioner yet in this case the Minister is requiring two psychiatrists and an obstetrician. It is a much higher bar to go through, and then there is the possibility of a review panel, all of which could mean delay, which the Minister says is unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I could be allowed finish-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Finally, I want to underline the point about the obstetrician because there is no medical reason for an obstetrician to be involved in certifying whether somebody is suicidal or not and whether the threat to a woman's life in that instance is real or substantial.The Minister has again accepted and admitted that the only reason obstetricians are being included in this very prescriptive list relates to the requirement to respect the rights of the unborn. Again, this means that the bar is being set higher in respect of women whose lives may be under threat. That is absolutely unacceptable. In the context of what is being proposed, there could be a situation where two psychiatrists certify that a woman is suicidal and that there is a real and substantial threat to her life but where an obstetrician who is not qualified in the relevant area could block this. That is completely unacceptable because it will place women's lives under threat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are other interpretations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of those who have opposed this element of the Bill have used something of a red herring argument, namely, that termination can never be a cure for suicidal ideation. Nobody has ever claimed that. It is off the pitch in terms of being a relevant argument to what we are talking about. The Supreme Court made the correct decision; in the case of X, a 14-year-old girl who was raped and became suicidal, to force her to continue with her pregnancy could have represented a threat to her life. This was a real situation. The Supreme Court made a decision and we should not second-guess that. As I have indicated, this section should go further. I mentioned that the conditions are too onerous in terms of the number of doctors and too prescriptive in that an obstetrician is required. It is too onerous to talk about a perinatal psychiatrist is because that is an extra prescription. Section 9 refers to "a psychiatrist who provides, or who has provided, mental health services to women in respect of pregnancy, childbirth or post-partum care." That is too prescriptive and onerous, and I believe that the presence of an obstetrician is unnecessary. We should apply the same standards that we apply to any other mental health situation, namely, by requiring the presence of one psychiatrist and a GP. There is no medical basis for distinguishing between a medical emergency and a psychiatric emergency. That advice comes from psychiatrists whom I have consulted. Psychiatrists have said there is no medical basis for making the distinction.  When we have debated issues with regard to mental health and suicide in the Dáil in other contexts Deputies across the political spectrum have made the point that we have to take mental health seriously, that there is a stigma, that there is different treatment for different people, and that an unfair distinction is made between mental health issues and other supposedly real medical issues. People in other contexts across the spectrum have said we should not make that distinction. Yet in this Bill we make that distinction. I do not think the Minister should be dismissive when I make that point because it is one being put forward not just by me but by many other people. Such a distinction does not exist in medicine and should not exist in this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment. It is a very reasonable one that underlines the need for the State to make a commitment to the care and protection of women. The Minister has pointed out that maternity services in the State have a good record but there have been significant concerns expressed by individuals in the aftermath of cases such as that of Ms Savita Halappanavar. Owing to traditional views on what medical services should be available to women, and because of persistence and the exclusion of certain services for women, it is important that we underline the duty of care and the requirement for women to be given all the support, information and treatment necessary to ensure their well-being. I endorse Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin's amendment No. 76, because I believe in the importance of aftercare and counselling services. While we cannot table an amendment in this regard that will not be not ruled out of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was mentioned in the context of amendment No. 47. The Minister should consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage with the same effect as amendment No. 76.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment provides that a person who has indicated publicly his or her opposition to abortion or terminations in the circumstances outlined in the Bill should be excluded from any panel charged with making decisions in that regard. There is at least a danger that such a person might bring his or her personal views or biases to bear in making a judgment as to whether a woman has an entitlement to an abortion as set out in the legislation, namely, where there is a threat to her life. The concern is that the process of adjudication in such circumstances might be clouded by a practitioner's personal opinions. It is a very straightforward proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I anticipated that the Minister might present that argument. I would argue strongly, however, that there is a fundamental distinction at issue here. In one case, we are talking about somebody who has expressed the belief that there are no circumstances in which it is justified to carry out a termination to save a woman's life. Quite a number of medical practitioners have expressed that genuinely held conviction. The reality, however, is that we are legislating to the effect that there are, in fact, situations where terminations are required or justified in order to save a woman's life. That position is being enshrined in our law and it runs counter to the views expressed by certain medical professionals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the arguments on this section have been gone through in great detail consequent to Deputy Healy's and Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendments but I would like to signal the possibility of further amendments on Report Stage. Section 22 is ill-thought out and problematic. There is a possibility people could challenge whether doctors had made the right decision and whether they were working within the law. All sorts of things are problematic. It could still mean this section could result in the chill factor remaining and in the whole issue of termination of pregnancies being seen as some sort of criminal activity in the same way as other crimes. For all sorts of reasons, although I would have think a lot about precisely how one would formulate it differently, there is a case for deleting section 22 and for dealing with this matter in a totally different way. I want to signal the possibility of an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope people have read the amendment.People are well aware that there have been physical attacks, assaults, harassment and so on of doctors, women and those working in hospitals or clinics where terminations are carried out. That is unacceptable in itself and represents a fear factor for women trying to access services to which they are entitled. It is adding to the stigma which often surrounds the issue and which can have a very detrimental effect on the mental health and sense of well-being of women who may require these services. This is an attempt to set out in very clear terms that having passed this Bill, we will support women and those working in the medical profession or in any way to provide the services to women which this Bill provides for. It is reasonable and quite an important signal for the Dáil to send out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will consider bringing forward amendments on Report Stage to change the Title to refer to a Bill to protect maternal life which I think is its real purpose. There has been no dispute about the fact that there have been legal protections for unborn life, but what the Bill seeks to address is the issue of protections for maternal life. I am concerned about the tenor of the Title in this regard and may bring forward amendments on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the Chairman and staff on their good work in facilitating and assisting in this debate. While there are strongly held views on this important issue across the spectrum, people have conducted themselves in this debate with honesty and in the manner appropriate to the seriousness of the matter. This is welcome. For those of us who were around in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is worth making a contrast with the fraught atmosphere of the time. The debate was not always conducted in the best manner possible. Much of the reason for reaching this point is down to the sea change in society and public opinion. The situation has moved on in terms of how people view the issue and how they conduct the debate on same. These are positive developments. While the Bill represents a step forward, we have a considerable way to go just to catch up with public opinion. The law and politics have lagged behind. More could be done in the Bill, particularly regarding the issues mentioned by Deputy Healy, those being, fatal foetal abnormalities, criminalisation and how to deal with suicidal ideation. Before the Bill passes, I hope that the Minister will reconsider some of these issues. Deputy Kelleher stated that now was not the time to discuss certain matters that were not covered by the Bill. He was right on one level but, on another level, now is the time, as they remain live issues. The people watching this debate want them addressed. In this sense, it is legitimate to raise a number of the points in question. Among a significant number of people, there is an expectation that this debate will not conclude when the Bill passes, given that other issues need to be addressed. I hope that the Bill's passage will prompt movement on the issues that cannot be dealt with now but must be dealt with urgently.
