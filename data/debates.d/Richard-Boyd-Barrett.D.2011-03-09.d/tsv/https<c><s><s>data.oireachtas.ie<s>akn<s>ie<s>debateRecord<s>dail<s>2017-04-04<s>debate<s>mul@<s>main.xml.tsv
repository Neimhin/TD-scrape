RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is attacking bus services in Dublin as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the Order that was read out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is to do with the entire Order, including Tuesday, and on foot of the discussion had at the Business Committee. I proposed to the Business Committee that if the dispute at Bus Éireann was not moving towards resolution there would be a full debate this week on Bus Éireann. At the time it was agreed by all, after a lengthy discussion that dominated the Business Committee, that it would be looked at again today. Topical issues were set aside for the debate but if the strike was not looking as if it was moving towards a resolution a substantial debate would be allowed for this week. This agreement should be followed through. I have just come from the picket line and the workers there are very determined in their view that the Houses of the Oireachtas, public representatives, the Government and the Minister, Deputy Ross, have to address this issue, which is affecting the whole country and, most clearly, those workers on the picket line.I ask that the Government and the others who were at the Business Committee follow through with that agreement and allow for a minimum two hour debate to address this issue of such national importance this week. I do not care whether it is today, Wednesday or Thursday, but this House has to debate that issue as agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue I raised was discussed at the Business Committee at length-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am all for process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just so we are clear, this was discussed at length. It was the issue that dominated the Business Committee, and the agreement was that we would definitely have Topical Issues allocated today, three of them completely. However, it was argued strongly that if the strike continued that would not be adequate. It was suggested last Thursday that we could not be certain whether the strike was moving towards resolution and if by Tuesday it was clear that it was not moving towards resolution, then there would be a full debate in the Dáil. That is what was agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a commitment that is going to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what was agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sort of.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On page 144 of the programme for Government, under the heading "Promoting Fundamental Rights", it states:We will promote fundamental rights, the rule of law... We will continue to protect and promote human rights... and to support the work of Human Rights Defenders.This evening, the Halawa sisters, along with human rights organisations, will gather outside the Dáil because of the critical situation of Ibrahim, who went unconscious over the weekend because he is not accepting glucose injections. His life is literally on the line and human rights organisations such as Amnesty have pointed out that his continued imprisonment represents an inexcusable violation of international and Egyptian law. Given the commitment in the programme for Government, and the critical life-threatening situation of a young man who is the victim of a violation of basic human rights, what is the Government going to do to address this? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	His life is on the line now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pay tribute to the determination and resolve of the 2,400 bus workers who have spent 12 days on the picket line defending themselves against unilateral and savage cuts to their pay and the public transport system. In the Minister's attempt to justify his absence from the pitch and failure to intervene in this matter, he has repeated endlessly the mantra that he does not have a chequebook to solve this dispute. I will make a simple proposal. It was revealed over the weekend that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, had €100 million that it did not expect thanks to a refund from Revenue. It would cost €7 million to €9 million to solve this dispute. That money is going a begging, it is not earmarked for anything and it is under the Minister's remit. Nothing would be more appropriate than money from TII being used to resolve the Bus Éireann dispute and ensure that these workers and public services do not have to accept savage cuts. Will the Minister use that money to resolve the dispute so that these workers can return to work on fair pay and conditions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest that after this discussion, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should meet the transport workers who provide the transport service. They will explain to him that this crisis has been manufactured, the game is rigged and the playing field is not level. Everything has conspired to force this dispute. The workers who have been suffering on the picket line for 12 days are determined that they will not be done down to the extent of 30% pay cuts and an assault on our public transport system. The Minister did not respond to what I said about TII's revelation that it has an extra €100 million it did not expect to have. I reiterate that €100 million is going a-begging. What would be more appropriate than spending some of this additional €100 million, which is not earmarked for anything, on the resolution of a national transport strike that is about protecting our bus transport infrastructure and ensuring towns and villages up and down this country have a public service transport infrastructure? The Minister should meet the workers and he should take some money from TII.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister answer the question on Transport Infrastructure Ireland-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry. Deputy Adams said that Theresa May does not care about the people of this island, North or South, and he is absolutely right. Frankly, she does not care about the vast majority of people in Britain, but she certainly does not care about the people here, North or South. She has allowed, and I suspect she will continue to allow, her cynical leaning on British jingoism, little England outlook, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment to trump any concerns about the potential adverse impacts of hard borders between the North and the South. If that is true, and it most certainly is, Deputy Adams and all the others who rightly say we must have no hard border between North and South and that it must be resisted for all the obvious reasons are much more muted in their criticism of the European Union's role in all of this. The European treaties were mentioned. Why do we have no control over whether there will be a hard border between North and South? The answer is that we signed the Lisbon treaty which ceded our rights on those matters to qualified majority voting, such that Germany and France will decide whether we have a hard border. While we know we have a problem with a British Government that has racist, anti-immigrant, little Englander policies, we also have a major problem with a European Union that has a fortress Europe policy and will insist on borders. The idea that the enemy of our enemy is our friend, which has been peddled by many people in this debate, is simply not the case. The British Government is parochial, nationalistic, racist in its immigration policy and does not care about what happens to people on this island, but so is the European Union. Some 30,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean because they insist on borders, and we will have to fight them and demand that there is no border, North or South. It is their rules around state aid that will prevent us doing the sort of things that would be necessary to insulate our economy against possible adverse effects from Brexit. We know we have to stand up to Theresa May. Will we stand up to the European Union and tell it that we are just not accepting a border, and that there will be instructions from the Executive in the North, if it exists, and from the Government in the South that we are not co-operating with any border posts and our officials will not man such posts? We should just tell them both to hell with their rules, which are depriving us of our democratic right to set our own borders and to decide our relationships with others. Similarly, we should make our own decisions about what industries and enterprises we can provide support to and aid in order to secure jobs, industry and so on. That is the message that must go out to them if we are to deal with these issues.  From Brexit, Trump and the economic instability across Europe which pre-dates those things, we need to take the big lesson that we must diversify our economy urgently. We do not need to have a strategy which equates to beggar-my-neighbour and see if we can get in some more financial services. To exploit the instability, we need to diversify our economy and to have our own industrial enterprise base, which is indigenous and sustainable in the long term. That is what we need, but that is not what the Government is doing. We require a radical shift in our economic and industrial policy.
