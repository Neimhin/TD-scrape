RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For a number of weeks, I have signalled at the Business Committee that we need to have a debate on the renewal of the FEMPI emergency legislation. The latter is very draconian legislation which was brought in on an emergency basis to cut people's pensions and pay, make them work hours for nothing and so on. It was all justified on the basis of an emergency. That legislation is renewed each year. The emergency is over. It is a hallmark of a tin-pot dictatorship to maintain emergency legislation after emergencies end. Mubarak did it, for example. Many other regimes do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. At the very minimum, we should have a vote on the legislation. As part of the debate, we should be allowed put forward motions in order that there be a vote as to whether we renew this extremely draconian legislation which impacts on hundreds of thousands of workers in this country. I would also like to point out that, having raised the matter over a number of weeks at the Business Committee, we finally secured broad agreement last week that this debate would take place on Thursday morning. It was then relegated to the graveyard slot on Thursday. Frankly, I think that is deliberate. It is because the Government does not want this issue discussed and it does not want it voted upon. It wants to have a minimum of discussion. The debate should happen on Thursday morning and there should be provision for Deputies, groups and parties to put forward motions so that we can vote on whether to renew this draconian legislation. Legislation on offences against the State has to be renewed every year. We have to vote on it because we understand how serious an infringement it is on people's rights.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This draconian legislation must be voted on and be discussed in prime Dáil time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the votes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked should there be a vote. The Taoiseach can answer that, can he not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I seek clarification.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not oppose the order on the time basis, particularly if the Government facilitates motions and if we are allowed to vote. If we table motions opposing the renewal of the legislation and those can be voted upon, I will not oppose the order. If that is not the case, however, I will be opposing the order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A major issue has emerged particularly strongly in recent months, namely, the disposal of school land by religious orders. In my area, Clonkeen College is to lose its playing fields but a number of schools across the country have lost huge amounts of playing pitches belonging to them. They are zoned residential and potentially can be sold.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I want to know whether the Taoiseach is considering or will consider addressing the legislative prohibition on compulsory purchase orders being imposed on school lands where those lands may be sold, consequently degrading the facilities of schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under the Tsar?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The US Supreme Court has today lifted the block on the racist travel ban imposed by Donald Trump, which means that his plan to impose a ban on people travelling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen to the United States will now be enforced.Donald Trump is pursuing pure, unadulterated racism. There is no other word for it. Does the Taoiseach think that it is acceptable that we would invite to Ireland someone who would impose a purely racist ban against six nations, encompassing tens of millions of people, or is he going to speak to Donald Trump about that, say it is not acceptable, and add that we are not going to allow US immigration officers at Shannon or Dublin to implement that policy on Irish territory? It is racism. Do we stand against racism or do we not? Are we going to speak up against it and take the first opportunity to do so, which the Taoiseach has this afternoon, or not? Is the Taoiseach going to express concern about Donald Trump boasting of a €110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, a vicious, brutal, undemocratic dictatorship which kills and executes its political opponents and which denies the most basic civil rights to women, ethnic minorities and workers? Is the Taoiseach going to express any concern about the dangerous escalation of tensions by that country against Qatar and Iran, all being stirred up by Donald Trump? Is the Taoiseach concerned about these things? Will he say anything to Donald Trump today, and is he seriously suggesting inviting someone pursuing those kinds of dangerous and racist policies to this country and fete him here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Libyan, Somalian and Yemeni families?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach does it all the time. He does it all the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We condemn Cuba's human rights violations across the board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not let the truth get in the way of a good soundbite.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the truth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question is for the Ceann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A point of order is made to the Ceann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not legitimate for us to raise a protest about the Taoiseach ascribing views to us that we have never enunciated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have never enunciated those views.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is ascribing views to us that we do not hold.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not the truth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has just done exactly that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What views do I ascribe to the Taoiseach?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What views do I ascribe to the Taoiseach?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach was barking on about irrelevant topics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Trump loves the Russians so they will have that in common.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the public domain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is slightly unconstitutional.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will share 20 minutes with Deputy Mick Barry. Deputy Howlin offered me a good lead-in to my opening comments by, once again, raising the spectre of populism, the evil it represents and the need to resist it at all costs. Populism is the danger we are facing, whatever it might be. "Populism" is an amorphous term if ever there was one. We are dealing with a problem of a judicial system dominated by a very small, self-perpetuating elite. The judicial system and the barristers are drawn from a very small pool, largely controlled by the Honorable Society of King's Inns, about which I learned a bit while chatting to somebody on the phone today. It was set up by King Henry VIII to ensure we controlled access to the Bar but also, initially, to keep Catholics out. This is the only place one can become a barrister. Judges are not exclusively barristers but they are overwhelmingly so. The honourable society is the only place that trains barristers but there is no statutory basis for it in any law made democratically by us. It literally owes its origins to Henry VIII and was set up on an exclusivist basis to ensure that a small, well-vetted elite controlled who got to be a barrister and who was kept out. They still do it and inside the Honorable Society of King's Inns there is another secret society whose members are known as "benchers". There is an inner bench and an outer bench and anyone who is made a judge automatically becomes a member of the benchers. They have secret dinners but nobody ever finds out about them, even though they are held regularly. Cherie and Tony Blair are members, incredibly, and there are other interesting people involved. In order for a person to be called to the Bar, a bencher has to sign off on it and in both the old and new systems, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the appointments commission, I have counted five who are members of the benchers. These include the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General, who automatically becomes a member. One can be mandatorily made a member of this group, even if one does not want to be, which is quite extraordinary. It begs a serious question about the independence of the Judiciary because some judges may be junior to barristers in the benchers. They might socialise together and chat before cases but when a barrister is not a member of the benchers, there is serious potential in this secret society to corrupt the balance in the hearing of cases. The group can disbar barristers and there is no statutory basis for it. This is how the upper echelons of the legal system in this country work. I welcome the thrust of the Bill and the Minister has identified a completely unacceptable situation, namely, that one third of judges are directly connected to, and are cronies of, the political parties. Even in the past few weeks, close connections of Fine Gael have been appointed as judges. The Constitution requires that the Government appoints judges but there is a big problem with this. I find it hard to understand how people can talk about the separation of powers and the independence of the Judiciary with a straight face. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan asked how we could possibly impugn the Judiciary and the way it behaves but I think we can impugn it. We can hold its members to account and criticise decisions they make and we bloody well should.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy implied that there is nothing wrong with political connections and that it is nonsense to suggest judges are recruited on the basis of political connections.I put it to him that it is complete nonsense to suggest that people who were appointed because of their connections to political parties or who, for that matter, were appointed by Governments are not in some way influenced by those who appointed or selected them. That has to have some impact and it is a worrying one. The whole thing needs to be shaken up. For that reason, I will support the Bill moving to Committee Stage. In principle, I like the idea of having a majority of lay representatives on the commission but a hell of a lot more than that needs to be done. We need to broaden and democratise the base of the entire legal and judicial system and stop it being an elitist club dominated by secret societies such as the benchers. We also need to bring an end to the monopoly of the King's Inns over who can become a barrister because that leads to its members having a consequently disproportionate influence. Even the new commission proposed in the Bill will have five members who are also benchers. A secret society will have influence on the new commission with regard to who will be recommended and considered to be acceptable and the right kind of person to be a judge. That is completely unacceptable and it brings to mind the expression which says there is one law for the rich and one for the poor, not just in the dispensation of the law but in how it is structured. That is how it works at every level all the way up the line. The experience of court for working class people, who make up the vast majority of our population, is in the District Court, where one goes in and industrial, production-line justice is dispensed. There are no juries. The judges of the District Court, who are all mandatory members of the society of the benchers - with its secret lunches and so on - dispense justice on the poor. However, if one is rich, one can afford to go to the higher courts. I do not know why the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is laughing. Poor people cannot access the same level of justice as rich people. That is a fact. The higher echelons of the Judiciary and barristers overwhelmingly come from private schools and better-off backgrounds and inner circle groups vet and select who gets into the higher echelons. That is the reality of what is going on. In terms of the simple things that need to be done, the monopoly of King's Inns should be ended. UCD, NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin and other universities should be allowed to train judges and barristers rather than it being the remit of King's Inns and controlled by the benchers or whatever the hell they are called. That needs to end. There needs to be an end to the idea that Members cannot criticise judges or their decisions. Members should have the right to criticise judges, who should likewise have the right to criticise Members. I have no problem with that. The PAS also poses a problem, as has been mentioned by Members opposing the Bill. Who selects the civil servants in the PAS? Who are the members of the PAS or the top level appointments committee and who selects them? They are also a self-perpetuating elite. That is not a good enough way to select judges or Secretaries General.
