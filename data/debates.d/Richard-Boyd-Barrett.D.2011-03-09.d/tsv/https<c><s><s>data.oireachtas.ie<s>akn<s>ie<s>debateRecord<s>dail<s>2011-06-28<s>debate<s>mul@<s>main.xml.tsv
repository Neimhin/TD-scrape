RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I tabled six of the questions in this group.  Two are quite general in nature, while the other four are specific.  I hope to have the opportunity to obtain clarification in respect of the latter four and also to make a couple of points regarding the Taoiseach's general response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his weekly newsletter, the Taoiseach, in the context of his experience at the European Council, stated he was very pleased in respect of the meeting at which the ESM was discussed and indicated that the latest provisions relating thereto will create a new playing field that will provide bondholders with a sense of confidence.  In discussing the debt crisis with his European counterparts, was it the Taoiseach's priority to provide bondholders with confidence?  That seems to be an extraordinary priority.  Did he discuss with his European counterparts that his and their emphasis on protecting bondholders and giving them confidence, is having disastrous consequences socially for people in this country, in Greece and other countries deeply affected by this debt crisis?  Is there any sense among our European counterparts that the programme they have put in place to deal with this crisis, in which all the emphasis relates to protecting bondholders, is resulting in terrible suffering for ordinary people?  This country faces the closure of hospital accident and emergency departments, the lack of special needs assistants for pupils in schools, the sale of State assets ——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Were any of these issues, the social cost of prioritising bankers and bondholders, discussed or was the discussion all about providing confidence for bondholders?On the question of Greece, was there any acknowledgment that the people of Greece, who are resisting the austerity measures to pay back these bankers, may have good cause or that their resistance is now forcing a discussion about burning the bondholders to some extent?  With regard to any discussions with the Greek Prime Minister, did the Taoiseach continue with the line that Ireland is not Greece, when it is absolutely clear that any restructuring of the Greek debt will have beneficial consequences for us.  We should support the Greek people in opposing austerity.  However, I understand from the Taoiseach's response that he was insisting that the Greek people pass a further austerity budget to protect the bondholders.With regard to the Taoiseach's comments on the Gaza flotilla, was there any discussion of what was being discussed openly in the Greek papers in the past week, with regard to the IMF intervening with the Greek authorities to try and prevent some of the ships from the Gaza flotilla from leaving Greek ports?  It was suggested that the IMF was threatening to withhold moneys from the IMF deal if the Greek Government allowed ships from the Gaza flotilla to leave Greece.  Is that what the situation has come to and is that the level of what is going on at Council meetings?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not only is the IMF dictating that we sacrifice society to pay bondholders, but we must also sacrifice the health and safety of brave people trying to bring aid and solidarity to the people of Gaza.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are all questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the social consequences?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In recent weeks and again this week much legislation is being rushed through the Dáil in order to meet the target set by the EU-IMF.  Given the proximity of the EU-IMFs delegation's visit between 6 July and 16 July, will we have a chance to give our views about the quarterly review in the House, and in particular to discuss the issue——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Precisely on that point——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When I asked the question of the Taoiseach previously he referred it to the Whips but we have had no positive response from the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could you just let me finish this point, a Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have asked several times and the Taoiseach has indicated a willingness to provide time for a discussion on the question of the sale of State assets, but this has not yet been granted.  Will this decision be made in a few weeks?  Will we——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we get a chance to discuss it in the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a massive queue for those, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We raised it at every meeting, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach wants to respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You allowed it with others, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I spoke on the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Taoiseach said is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not get a chance to finish my last question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want an answer to the question I asked about the energy miscellaneous provisions Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will this be before the EU-IMF deal?
