Once again, nurses, doctors and medical experts said we need more beds and to have those we need more nurses. We also need more teachers. The Government cannot recruit them because it is not paying them properly and one of the problems is that new entrants are paid less.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that in many cases, and certainly in nursing, as many nurses are leaving as are being recruited. I had a long conversation with Phil Ní Sheaghdha of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, last week who pointed out that in 2016 the State recruited 2,573 nurses but 2,271 left in the same period. The net recruitment for the health service where there is a dire capacity problem and we need thousands more nurses, is a tiny few more. She pointed out that in 2008 someone at point 1 on the staff nurse scale got €31,875 a year. Today, almost ten years later, that person gets €28,768, almost €3,000 less when accommodation costs have gone through the roof. Someone at point 5 earned €38,000 in 2008 but today earns €34,000. Is it any wonder we cannot recruit the nurses - I have not even begun to discuss the teachers – if their wages are less than they were ten years ago and the cost of living has gone through the roof?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some unions signed up to those agreements because they thought they were the best they could get but they are not happy about it. Many unions did not sign up to those agreements because they consider it completely unacceptable to have a pay apartheid whereby people who happen to be recruited after 2011 and 2012, and who over the course of their lifetime will earn maybe €100,000 less than somebody doing exactly the same job just because they happen to be recruited afterwards. That is the difference between being able to buy a house and not. Nurses, teachers and others working in the public service are part of the housing crisis, whereas decades ago, in the 1970s, a teacher or a nurse could at least hope to get a mortgage and buy a house. Is it any wonder that there is a capacity problem in the health service and we are having difficulty getting teachers? The Minister can quote all the figures he likes but there are shortages. That is why the Government cannot open the beds. The Minister for Health has acknowledged this.
