RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Tánaiste's announcement which followed the comments of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on putting the Children First guidelines on an legislative footing.  Will this legislation provide for full implementation of the Children First guidelines?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to clarify whether the legislation will deal with the issue set out in the guidelines on neglect by omission when it comes to the failure of State agencies to provide the necessary educational and intellectual stimulation to all children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will this legislation be tallied——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——with cuts and quotas in the area of special needs which could cut across legislation in that regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about full implementation of a Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked about legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the legislation be taken?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The abuse of many thousands of young people in institutions run by the Catholic Church and essentially allowed by State authorities over such a long period is a great cause of shame for this State.  We owe a major debt of compensation to people whose lives were utterly ruined.  Listening to the tales of the suffering people endured in the industrial schools and Magdalene laundries, it is truly horrifying to think of the abuse suffered by vulnerable young people and their helplessness in the face of the institutions of our society, whether the church or State.  Both the church and State professed to protect young people but were involved in horrendous abuse, either through the direct perpetration of abuse or by turning a blind eye to it for a long time.Many of the victims of abuse are still with us and their lives have been utterly blighted.  I meet people every day who endured this horror, including one man who I met randomly on Grafton Street today.  Of 14 children in his family, eight had been in industrial schools where their lives were ruined.  In that context, for the Oireachtas to impose a guillotine on their right to claim redress from the State and church authorities is a scandal.  There should be no question of imposing such a guillotine for as long as there are people who have not had full redress for the crimes that were committed against them.  We owe it to them to give them every encouragement and opportunity to seek redress at a time of their choosing and not on the basis of some arbitrary date which we impose to bring to an end our responsibility for this issue.  The Government must rethink its position in this matter.It is an absolute scandal that the redress scheme does not extend to the victims of the Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home.  This amending legislation should provide for their inclusion in the scheme.  I appeal to the Government to reconsider its position in this regard.In the context of the publication of the Cloyne report and the terrible history of powerful institutions in this State being responsible for the most terrible abuse, the Government must exert extreme pressure on the church to open up and be held fully accountable to the victims of abuse in church institutions.  The State bears some responsibility for allowing the church to act as it did.  The man I met on Grafton Street earlier told me he wants the church authorities, the papal nuncio and representatives of the State to be brought before a public forum where it would be open to any victim of abuse in church institutions to come forward and interrogate the representatives of the institutions that were responsible for the abuse and have their stories and histories fully heard.  The victims need this type of public forum to put forward their proposals for securing full redress and compensation for the terrible suffering they endured.  If the Government is serious about caring for the victims of this terrible abuse, it must take action along the lines I have suggested.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister agree that the cut of 7% in the incomes of public sector workers as a result of the pension levy together with the universal social charge were a gross injustice, given that whatever flaws there may be in the public service, it was not public sector workers who created the economic crisis?  In the context of pay, public sector workers have taken a massive hit with the result that many cannot meet their mortgage repayments and are struggling and it would be of great comfort to them to know they will not be faced with a further hit?  As Deputy Mary Lou McDonald stated, the Minister outlined that there would be no tax increases or social welfare cuts, one would say there would be a fear that public sector workers might yet again be a target for possible cuts or diminutions in their conditions.  I wish to ask a straight question, as it is not clear from the answer to the question, given that public sector workers have already paid the pension levies to give them their entitlements to a pension, will the age that public sector workers retire be retained or raised in line with that proposed for other workers?  Does the Minister intend to raise the age of retirement for public sector workers and must they work for a longer period, having already paid the levies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it fair or even prudent, when there is significant unemployment and graduates coming out of university not being able to find jobs, to make the working life longer for people employed in the public sector or elsewhere, instead of maintaining the existing retirement age as a consequence of which there would be more jobs for the young qualifying graduates?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is right to treat with contempt the interrogation of Fianna Fáil on the reasons we are in this disastrous situation.  Is it not the case that the Government's decision to adhere to the EU-IMF austerity programme, continuing with the public sector recruitment embargo, is not leading to reform but towards a slaughtering of public services?  The figures in education indicate 1,400 jobs garnered gone out of the education sector when 10,000 extra children come into the primary schools every year.  This amounts to a savage assault on our education system where services are giving way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not the case that, with nearly 5,500 health service workers down as a result of the embargo, this is the reason hospitals and accident and emergency services are closing down?  Is it not unbelievable that 13%——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a question.  I said "Is it not the case".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Acting Chairman is cutting into my time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that continuing with the embargo on the slaughtering of our public services that, for example, a 13% cut in staffing in local authorities means local services are slaughtered?  Is it not time for the Minister to reconsider the sanity of this embargo if we are to have any public services for the people of this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A brief supplementary——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just one line.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In so far as the Minister is considering the use of outsourced agency workers, will he confirm that agency workers are being used in peak hours for processing medical cards at the centre in Finglas?  In those circumstances, is the Minister quantifying the cost of using agency workers as against direct employment by public servants?  Also, in his comprehensive spending review are such costs and the extra burden on the social welfare system as a result of greater levels of unemployment and the public sector recruitment embargo factored in?  Can the Minister tell us the savings that will result from this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are consultants from the private sector regarded as having special qualifications in public sector reform?  The EU and IMF seem to be dictating what is happening in terms of so-called public sector reform, although I believe they are simply savaging our public services.  What is the precise point of bringing in consultants given that the EU-IMF deal dictates our actions?While there is a slaughter of jobs in the public sector as a result of the recruitment embargo and cutbacks are imposed, are opportunities not opened up for private for-profit companies to move into the public sector space?  Is this not symptomatic of what is occurring?  Is this not what the reform is really about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree that people want public sector reform and social reform generally.  However, is the real source of their anger not the massively overpaid top civil servants, politicians, bankers, who are now effectively public servants because they are paid pretty much with public money, and executives in the private sector, including those in private consultancy firms, etc.?  People want reform to reduce the massively excessive salaries of those at the top of both the public and private sectors.  Some are earning five to ten times what is earned by the ordinary worker, be he or she in the private or public sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The case the Minister makes for having to impose the "adjustment" as he calls it of €3.6 billion, which means, as he acknowledges, such severe austerity for ordinary people in the country is that we must deal with the deficit problem and that we have no choice but to borrow the money.As an aside, although I do not think the Minister will agree with me——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the case that if we repudiate the private banking debts the markets might consider lending to a State that would be in a much better financial position?  Setting aside this question, which the Minister might answer briefly, is it the case that much of the deficit results from the fact that 350,000 extra people are unemployed?  As a result, the burden on the State's finances adds up to approximately €7 billion.  The reason we have such a big deficit is because so many people are unemployed.  If we put those people back to work——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——which would mean resisting the EU and IMF austerity programme, then our public finances would be in a much better state by approximately €7 billion.  Add to that the €5 billion we must pay in interest repayments this year and a little tax on the wealthy in the country and one could make up the deficit without imposing austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a genuine question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are paying through cuts in social welfare.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise because I must leave in a minute to go to a housing meeting, which relates to my question about——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will mention you, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is in The Graduate.The meeting is about the fact that no social housing will be built directly and we are going to start leasing in Dún Laoghaire from private landlords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does connect.  I am not playing fast and loose.  Is this how to get good value for public expenditure?  As we are losing 13% of local authority staff as a result of the recruitment embargo and, therefore, no longer have people to do the direct build of social housing, social housing must be provided by the private sector.  Is that not more costly in the end?  We get nothing at the end of it.We are paying money to NAMA or private landlords——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a genuine question about expenditure.
