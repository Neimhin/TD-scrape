RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank witnesses for the submission.  I would take a slightly different view on many of the issues raised but they have helped to illuminate the discussion about legislation, which needs to be tackled quite a bit.  I accept that there are many aspects where phrases, definitions and so on are grey or open to interpretation.  The delegation has at least helped to illuminate the issues.There is one area - and perhaps others - where I have sympathy with the witnesses.  I do not know much about the other sectoral agreements mentioned by Mr. Butler and perhaps he will say what they are.  The idea that we should not have a piecemeal approach is a reasonable point, not just from the perspective of employers but from the perspective of employees.  There should be a streamlined system.  Does Mr. Butler agree that we should not let the need for consolidation of whistleblowing agreements slow us down as it is important to bring forward whistleblowing legislation to encourage or create an atmosphere for legitimate whistleblowing?  Confidence should be instilled in people who want to make legitimate disclosures, and in addition the Government should consider how other matters could be consolidated.  It would not be right to slow the process down and perhaps the delegation could be a bit more specific about the other sectoral agreements.  Are there particular reasons for sectoral whistleblowing agreements that are specific and how would that relate to the general effort to establish a whistleblowing process?  I can see there is a logic to what Mr. Butler said.There was another issue I agreed with but I cannot remember what it is now.  I will try to get back to it.  Much of the thrust of the submission regarded protecting the interests of the employers against what may be seen by them as potentially damaging or vexatious disclosures or complaints from employers.  IBEC exists to protect the interests of business.  Does the delegation agree that the biggest problem we have - even in the context of the central issue highlighted at the beginning of the submission - is that our international reputation is in shreds?  Why is that?  It is not because there is an army of cranks and vexatious complainants who are trying to do companies down that are otherwise engaged in best practice.  Our international reputation is in shreds because of the reckless behaviour of senior management and executives, particularly in the financial sector, who were engaged in the most appalling practices and reckless lending.  The culture was such that nobody blew the whistle on this.  That is the problem we must remedy.Another area where people are grappling consequences is the appalling behaviour of many, although not all, developers and builders engaged in reckless breaches of building regulations and health and safety issues.  These have led to the terrible consequences we have seen in places such as Priory Hall and other developments.  They might be the tip of the iceberg if we consider some of the stuff built out there.  I know from speaking to those who worked in the building industry at the height of the boom that they thought some developments would be the tenements of the future or would fall down in ten years because of reckless practices and a lack of regulation.  Building workers knew that was being done was wrong and in breach of fire and safety regulations but they did not feel confident enough to speak out about what was going on or blow the whistle.  They were in fear that they would lose their job.We also know about the appalling cases we have witnessed in private nursing homes and the questions raised about State-run residential care and so on.  In those difficult cases, people found it very difficult to speak up about what was ongoing, and when they did, they have even recently found retaliation from employers and a lack of protection in legislation.  It seems that is the context in which we are working.  IBEC seems to be summoning something of a straw man in the argument or implication that there is an army of cranks out there waiting to make vexatious complaints about companies generally engaged in best practice.  That does not add up.  If companies are engaged in good practice, it is not likely there will be a host of people making unnecessary or vexatious complaints.  We must deal with a position where most people do not feel confident enough to speak up and where our international reputation has been damaged precisely because of the reckless behaviour of employers in the public and private sector.  Employees who probably knew about certain issues were afraid to speak out about them.Against that background as I and many others see it - perhaps the delegation would disagree - IBEC has emphasised that there must be accuracy in the complaints, which seems unreasonable and an obstacle to people raising concerns.  In all the instances I mentioned, and particularly what went on in the banking and building sector, it may well be the case that people do not know absolutely whether their concerns or suspicions are accurate, but they would have grave concerns.  It is not just that we should not go where IBEC wants us to go but that we should go in the opposite direction where people have concerns.It is almost certain that people at all kinds of levels within the banking sector must have had grave concerns - and did not know if they were unfounded - about the reckless lending practices with regard to developers.  Such people may not have been sure if their concerns or suspicions were justified.  It would have been good for the entire country if the people with those concerns, whether right or wrong, would have felt confident enough to make complaints or disclosures and raise concerns.  It seems that the approach is not allowing for that necessity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, or the Central Bank.  The other point which I agreed with related to adjudication and what is done with the information.  I agree with the witness that it is not just about the protection of those who make disclosures but also what will happen with the information they disclose and how that will be adjudicated on.  That is another question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  My last point is more or less the same.  The proposal of excluding things that are likely to happen follows on from the previous point I made.  What we should be encouraging is preventative disclosures, where people think something may be done by an employer or company which could be criminal or that the perpetration of such an act would be damaging to the public interest or is something the public needs to know or be warned about in advance.  I do not see what the problem is.  Would the witness not accept that point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief as I agree with virtually everything Mr. Devitt said.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation which provides an excellent summary of the relevant issues.  Mr. Devitt indicated that fraud and corruption cost Ireland â‚¬3 billion per annum.  I ask him to elaborate on how Transparency International Ireland arrived at that figure.  Which aspects of fraud and corruption cost most?On the issue of extending the scope of the Bill to people outside the employer-employee relationship, as is the case in Norway and elsewhere, will the witnesses explain what difficulties are anticipated in this regard?  Is the problem primarily related to defamation?  Would extending the scope of the legislation to protect those who make reports about another person's behaviour create a problem?  Is the problem that it would be trickier to legislate in the case of persons who are not employees because making a disclosure could cause reputational damage to an individual?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Transparency International Ireland argues that it is relatively easy to extend the scope of the Bill to include members of organisations as well as employees or employers.  Those who oppose such a move will argue that the issue is more complicated.  Is the problem one of defamation in that by moving beyond the employer-employee relationship, one enters a slightly trickier legal area where there is a danger of defamation?  An example would be a student making a disclosure or report about another student.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I see what Ms Kieran means.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be easy to do this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Mr. Devitt repeat the name?
