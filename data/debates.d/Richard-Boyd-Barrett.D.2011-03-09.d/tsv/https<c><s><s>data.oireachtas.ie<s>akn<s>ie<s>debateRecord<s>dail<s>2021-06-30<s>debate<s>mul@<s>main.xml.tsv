RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government would do well to heed the warnings that were given by retired workers and pensioners outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday. It will press its amendment at its peril. I ask the Government, even at this point, not to move the amendment, which will delay the passing of the Bill. It was most eloquently put by one retired worker who said, "We may no longer be worker bees, but we are still bees with a sting." If the Government is in any doubt about that, it should cast its mind back to the grey army that took to the streets on the issue of medical card entitlement and the rebellion the then Government faced. We are talking about almost 500,000 retired workers who are very angry that they have no say over cuts to their pension entitlements. As Deputy Paul Murphy stated, we have seen a relentless attack on pension rights generally and these workers have seen very considerable attacks on their pensions. Defined benefit pension schemes are being closed down or moved to defined contribution schemes. Aviation workers, for example, have lost 22.5% of their monthly incomes without any serious consultation. Retired workers in RTÉ, Coillte and Bord na Móna have not seen any increase in their pensions for ten to 14 years. Many of the workers on these schemes do not qualify for the State contribution pension scheme and therefore rely on a very modest occupational pension. Many have seen the link that previously existed between their wages when they were working and their pension entitlements severed. People may think that this is not an issue for them because they are not pensioners, but all of those who are working now have an interest in it because they will be pensioners at some stage and they will realise at that point how important it is to have a real say in respect of their pensions. Of course, these workers paid for their pensions through their PRSI contributions. They paid very considerably more than their employers did relative to what happens in most countries in Europe. Workers here pay pretty much the same level of PRSI contributions as the average worker in Europe, but employers in this country pay about half the amount that their counterparts abroad pay. It is often cited that people are living longer and that the pensions we have to pay people are somehow a problem, which is quite insulting to pensioners and illogical. We should be celebrating that people live longer. We should also remember that if employers paid the same level of PRSI contributions as their European counterparts, we would have billions of euro extra to ensure decent pensions for all pensioners in this country. Another important point pensioners and retired workers asked us to stress is how they believe the failure of the Government to allow them have a say over what happens to their pensions is that they believe it breaches multiple parts of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It breaches the sections on the right to property, the right to equality before the law for everybody, the rights of the elderly and the right to good administration. I will not go into all the details, but that is undoubtedly true. If for no other reason than this country is supposed to be signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Government should not move its amendment and should allow the Bill to pass and give pensioners the right to simply have a say and be consulted, and have the avenue of the WRC available to them if any changes to their pensions are proposed. The pensioners also expressed considerable disappointment that the official trade union movement, which they built, has been so quiet on this issue. I must admit that is disappointing. In France, when there is any attack on pensions, there are extraordinary revolts by workers and pensioners, who understand instinctively that an attack on pensions and pensioners is an attack on all workers and their rights. Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the Government's amendment and not defer the Bill. If the amendment is not withdrawn, the Government will incur the wrath of the pensioners to whom I refer. It should be under no illusion but that wrath will be very considerable for the three Government parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. These retired workers literally built this country. The people who protested yesterday included public servants, nurses, Coillte workers, Bord na Móna workers, aviation workers, ESB workers and many more I do not have time to name. These are literally the people who physically built this country. The Government should not continue to ignore them and treat them with the disrespect with which they are being treated. It should give them the right to have a say over their pensions or it will feel the sting of these retired workers in the near future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is on another matter, but I have to say that the entire country is flying blind and the Taoiseach should restore those briefings as a matter of urgency if he wants to take people with him in what is a difficult situation. If the recent opinion poll taken in respect of the by-election in Dublin Bay South is anything to judge by, there is a very real possibility, maybe even a likelihood, that the Government parties are going to lose a seat. There are many reasons that this might happen.From my experience at the doors the issue is very much to do with an entire generation of young people, which we talked about earlier, and their parents, who are absolutely furious about the failure of successive Governments to provide for that entire generation of young people the prospect of actually being able to have an affordable roof over their heads in the coming years. That problem of the housing crisis caused by the successive failures of Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-led Governments is not just for a whole generation of young working people. It also affects older people who might find themselves separated, evicted by landlords because of loopholes in residential tenancies legislation and so on. The Government and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have said they are going to try to do something about it. I have very serious doubts about that and about the Government's actual commitment to provide public and genuinely affordable housing for the people who need it. Tonight the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 will be completing its journey through the Dáil. In our view, the Government is going to open up the entire public landbank to private financiers, private investment funds and so on, when that land should be used exclusively for the delivery of public and genuinely affordable housing. By "genuinely affordable" we do not mean €450,000 in parts of Dublin or €400,000, which is completely unaffordable for the vast majority or working people. We mean affordable based on the people's income, where they should not have to pay 50%, 60% or 70% of income on mortgage repayments or on rents. They should have to pay no more than 25%. When we debated these issues on Committee Stage of the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 recently, on foot of our objections about this the Minister said he would bring in amendments that would mean, at least in the major urban centres, there would be a change of heart by the Government and that public land would be used to provide 100% public and genuinely affordable housing. The Minister has not brought forward those amendments. The Affordable Housing Bill is still not clear that affordable housing will actually be affordable for ordinary working people. Why has the Minister reneged on his commitments to bringing those amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why will the Minister and the Government not commit to actually making affordable housing genuinely affordable on public land and on developments where we are getting affordable housing from private developers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Consider areas of Dublin such as the Glass Bottle site at Poolbeg where developers like Johnny Ronan and so on are involved. These developers are not building anything for less than €500,000 and often more. That is not affordable. The concern is that the Government will not strictly define "affordable" to ensure that it is actually affordable based on people's income. To pay for a house that costs €400,000, €450,000 or €500,000 a person would need an income in excess of €90,000 or €100,000. That is not affordable. It is completely unacceptable that house prices would be at that level on public land such as 20% of the strategic development zone land, SDZ, in Poolbeg, which is still in the hands of NAMA. This is unacceptable. Why has the Minister reneged on the commitment he gave to the committee to ensure that publicly-owned land would be 100% genuinely social and affordable housing? Will the Government define "affordable" and not base it on what Johnny Ronan is charging in Cherrywood or the SDZ-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but base it on people's income, so that ordinary working people-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An amendment we put to the Sinn Féin motion last night said that it should be no more than 25% of a person's income-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and the Government did not oppose it. Will they hardwire that into the legislation to give a clear, legal commitment for genuine affordability?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, met with representatives of the Saudi Arabian regime recently. Can the Taoiseach tell us if the Cabinet subcommittee on Europe has discussed the issue of the absolutely terrible war in Yemen, which has lasted for almost seven years? Approximately 16 million people, half the population, are suffering from hunger, 3 million have been displaced and an estimated 220,000 have lost their lives, either directly or indirectly as a result of the war. The Saudi Arabian regime is deeply implicated in the horrific military campaign which has caused this humanitarian disaster, and, of course, the United States has also provided military and logistical assistance to the Saudi Arabian regime. That regime in Saudi Arabia is involved in crushing any dissent. It is not possible to oppose the war, although many Saudis Arabians do. I was at a protest with Saudi Arabians and Yemenis outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the past two weeks. Has the Government anything to say about this situation? Will it call publicly on the Saudi Arabian regime to end its horrific siege and the military attacks on the people of Yemen? Many of our European counterparts are selling weapons to the Saudi Arabian regime, and those arms then go on to be used against the people of Yemen. Is the Government going to speak out in Europe about this humanitarian disaster that the people of Yemen are facing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are allocated a certain amount of time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As there was not enough time for the Taoiseach to answer my previous question, perhaps he will do so now because Britain is one of several European countries that regularly sells large amounts of arms to Saudi Arabia, which that country then uses to devastating and murderous effect in Yemen. We have a responsibility to say to all of our neighbours in Europe, whether inside or outside the EU, that their continued turning of a blind eye or, even worse, their active military facilitation, with arms and other supports, of the brutal regime in Saudi Arabia that crushes internal dissent and movements for democracy and inflicts humanitarian disasters on places like Yemen, is absolutely unacceptable. I ask the Taoiseach to respond. Has the Taoiseach talked to his colleagues in Britain about the huge problems they faced in getting trained healthcare staff, including in nursing and other areas like psychology? There is an imperative to increase the capacity of our health systems at every level post Covid. In that context, the British learned that they had to make it easier for people to study nursing and midwifery, as well as other allied healthcare professions, by lifting the financial burden off them. In that way, they could increase the numbers in training and boost the capacity of the British healthcare system. Although there are many problems in Britain, should we not learn some lessons from them and do the same here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 7, lines 5 to 19, to delete line 5 down to and including "price" in line 19 and substitute the following:"An Act to regulate relevant public and relevant private land in order to increase the amount of land available for the provision of public and genuinely affordable housing; for that housing to address deficiencies in the stock of public and affordable housing; for the land to be developed in consultation with communities; for public services and amenities to be developed at the same time as the public and affordable housing; for that public and affordable housing to be made available to people on a broad range of incomes".I will speak to amendments Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will let the Minister make the case for that one. I will speak to the amendments tabled by People Before Profit. They relate to the Title of the Bill and, essentially, the setting out of its purposes and the purpose of the Land Development Agency, LDA. In some ways, the amendments in this group are a summary of many of the problems we have with the Government's plan for the LDA and what it should do. I will try to summarise them briefly. The LDA should be an agency that assembles land and, in particular, land that might be hoarded or speculated upon by private owners and developers or property that is being sat on that could be used, if suitable, for the housing we need to address the dire housing crisis. That is what the LDA should be. Its sole purpose should be to try to assemble land that may be in the ownership of other State agencies for the purposes of delivering public and affordable housing. A failure to do this is the reason for the dire housing and homelessness crisis. The LDA's purpose, as set out in this Bill, amounts to a means through which private finance, developers and property investment entities, and so on, will gain access to the entire public land bank. The latter should be used to deliver public and affordable housing but will instead be used to make profit for some of those interests. This, in turn, will affect the ability of the Government to use the public land bank to deliver public housing of the scale we need and to ensure that it is genuinely affordable instead of the price being set by private developers or financial interests which now might gain access to that land bank. In the Title to the Bill, there are references to designated activity companies, DACs, and the Bill will allow the public land bank to be parcelled into companies that will be taken from local authority control and these will, in effect, control the land bank and dictate what is done with it. There are also references in the Title to market price with respect to the delivery of affordable housing. I see the Minister shaking his head because the term has been changed with a reference to the affordable housing legislation. When we cross-check the new wording inserted via the Minister's amendment and the affordable housing legislation, we can see it does not set out in any clear terms how it can be guaranteed that the public land bank will be used to deliver genuinely affordable housing. It will all be prescribed by the Minister and there are also references to the market. This is the fundamental problem. In the amendments we have tabled, we are seeking to ensure that the LDA will only be about the provision of public and affordable housing. We also want to ensure that affordable housing will always remain affordable. We will explain later how that should be done but, essentially, we suggest that a property cannot be sold to the market but rather that it must be sold to local authorities. The proportion of affordable and public housing should be decided by local authorities and there should be public consultation on that. The land should not be parcelled up for use by DACs, it should remain in the hands of the local authorities. Our amendments rule out the use of public private partnerships, thus protecting the public land bank from the invasion of private investment funds, speculators and so on that would drive up the price of the affordable housing. Such partnerships might privatise potentially significant parts of the public land bank and make it almost certain that much of the supposedly affordable housing would be unaffordable. The Minister has infamously spoken about affordable housing in certain parts of the country, notably in Dublin, reaching a ceiling of €450,000 and €400,000 and €350,000 in other areas.That is not affordable at all for the vast majority of people. We do not want private finance or private investors to have anything whatsoever to do with setting the amount of public and affordable housing, the price of the affordable housing, or the rents in the cost-rental housing. We want stripped out of both Bills any references to the benchmarking of affordability against market conditions or the diktats of private finance. That is the summary of the first 12 of 63 amendments we have tabled to the Bill. The broad thrust is very simple. Keep the public land bank public, use the public land bank to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing and have no privatisation whatsoever of the public land bank, which we believe the Government's Bill in its current form will facilitate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the mover of most of the amendments in this group, I will respond to the Minister. Many of the contributions probably were not directly to do with the amendments but that shows the frustration Members feel about housing in every area. Members are just looking for every opportunity to raise this issue because it is such a pressing crisis. I agree with the Minister that there is a fundamental difference between many in the Opposition and the Government.I have only a short time available to speak so I will focus on the real questions. What is the problem we have to fix? Is it that local authorities just did not bother to build council housing for the past 20 years or is it that central government did not give them the money and support to do it? The answer is the latter. The councils and elected councillors knew and were pushing all the time. I did nothing else before I was a councillor, when I was a councillor and now as a Deputy other than constantly campaign for council housing. Central government would not provide the money to do it. The Minister said the LDA is not going to usurp the role of local authorities. The first development likely to be produced by the LDA, Shanganagh Castle, is in my constituency and should have been developed by the council a decade ago but central government did not give the council the money and the development has now been handed over to the LDA. It has already usurped Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and, as a consequence, we do not know if the affordable housing built on the site will be genuinely affordable. I have only a few seconds left to speak to this group of amendments so I cannot elaborate the points. The debate is going to be guillotined despite the fact that we have proposed 60 or 70 amendments. If that guillotine falls, most of our amendments will not be discussed but the Minister's amendments will be passed automatically.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get in again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get the last word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister not want to respond?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want the Minister to respond and then I get the last word because I tabled all the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is caught by his own guillotine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a problem with amendment No. 13. We welcome the fact that the reference to market price, which was one of our amendments, has been removed. Then, however, it refers it on to the Affordable Housing Bill, in which there is no clear definition that ensures "affordable" will genuinely be affordable in terms of rent or affordable purchase based on people's income. Instead, it will be specified by the Minister and references to market price, market conditions, and indeed, local market conditions still continue to litter the Bill. In the one minute and 40 seconds I have left to speak to eight or nine amendments, I must correct a factually terribly important point made by Deputy Duffy about the Minister's commitment. Deputy Duffy is correct. The Minister made a commitment on Committee Stage that LDA sites in Dublin and Cork would develop exclusively 100% public and affordable housing as we, Deputy Duffy and others, asked for in amendments. The Minister did not follow through on that commitment and it is not in this Bill. I will quote the section if the Minister wants. Amendment No. 120 is the Minister's and amendment No. 122 also relates to it. He said that in areas with a population of more than 150,000 people, he may prescribe up to 80%, which, when one takes in the Part 5 and Part 10, means it is possible that it could be 100% public and affordable but he can equally do far less than that. There is absolutely no hardwired obligation to deliver exclusively public and affordable housing on public land and that is our fundamental problem. By the way, the issue of a land assembly or land development is in the next grouping, not in this one. In this grouping, we are saying that the exclusive objective of the Land Development Agency should be to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing.In this amendment, we are saying that the exclusive objective of the Land Development Agency should be to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing. That should be its objective, as well as facilitating local authorities in achieving it.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the amendments in the group are from Solidarity-People Before Profit. We discussed much of this subject matter in the previous, more general, discussion, which concerned the Title, but this is the group of amendments dealing with us setting out the alternative approach that we feel should have been pursued with the Land Development Agency. This is to make it a land assembly agency that could create a pipeline of land necessary in order to ensure the supply of public and affordable housing by local authorities primarily, approved housing bodies and not-for-profit bodies. It would leave the development of those lands to local authorities and, in an important point, prevent the Land Development Agency from essentially operating as a commercial entity. This speaks to a major concern that we have about the conception that the Government has about the Land Development Agency. I remember the debates about the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, what the agency would achieve and why it was such a good idea. As time went on, it became increasingly apparent that NAMA had a problem with delivery. Some of us did not like the idea of NAMA in the first place but we thought it could and should have helped to deliver public and affordable housing in its large property portfolio. When representatives of NAMA came before the finance committee, they used to say, basically, that was not their mandate. It may have been a subsidiary objective way down its list of priorities to identify some houses for public housing and, in the end, only approximately 2,000 properties were transferred to local authorities. By and large, NAMA's mandate was set from the outset and it was to recover the money put into it. Therefore, it had an interest in reinflating the property market. The consequence of that has turned out to be quite disastrous. NAMA can now turn around and say it has generated so many billions of euro, with a surplus over and above what was projected. Taking this in the round, however, what has the consequence been? Much of the land it disposed of has been handed over to private agents with no interest whatever in developing the public and affordable housing we need but they have played a very significant part in driving up the cost of housing to the current unaffordable levels. That was hardwired into the mandate set down in the first place and to my mind there is a similar problem with the Land Development Agency. What goes into or does not go into the legislation will, essentially, determine the outcome of the Land Development Agency. This relates to the debate we had earlier about the guillotine and so on. Deputy McAuliffe has said we discussed these matters on Committee Stage and it therefore does not matter that there is a guillotine on Report Stage. I am sorry but there is a legislative process. The entire point of the discussion on Committee Stage is to take on board each other's points about amendments and different sections in the Bill before formulating further amendments on Report Stage based on that discussion. Most of our amendments will not be reached, although all the Minister's amendments will be accepted once the guillotine comes down. That is truth. Some of the key matters that should be scrutinised will not be examined. Many of us want to ring the alarm bells about this. There has not been enough digging into the detail in public discourse and debate on this. We did this on Committee Stage to some degree but to be honest there is still much confusion about what the Land Development Agency is going to do. One of our key concerns, which some of the amendments are trying to nullify, is the possibility that the Land Development Agency will engage in commercial activities. That is not its job but the legislation allows it to do it. It is just like NAMA ended up essentially operating as a sort of business that was trying to recover its investment and generate a surplus, despite that having quite dire consequences in the wider housing market. It essentially handed back control of the land bank suitable for development of houses to the big investment funds that bought up all those portfolios from NAMA. This group of amendments also requires that the purpose of the Bill is to deliver solely public and affordable housing, limiting the role of the agency to making land available to local authorities in order that they can provide public and affordable housing. The amendments would ensure the LDA will be fully publicly owned and controlled. Currently it would be publicly owned but not publicly controlled. The problem with many quangos is they are publicly owned but not publicly controlled. There are questions of commercial sensitivity because of deals with private finance and so on and we cannot find out what is being done when such bodies operate to a different set of objectives and priorities to what might be set by local authorities or communities according to their needs. They are always looking to the deals being done with private finance, which completely distort what the objectives of such an agency should be. This moves the purpose of a body like this away from what it could and should be doing, which is to aggressively assemble the land we need and servicing local authorities in delivering public housing, as they have always done in the past.
