RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 25:In page 27, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:"14. The Minister for Finance is to order a study to be carried out on the operation of Relevant Contracts Tax, particularly in relation to rise in self-employment in the construction industry, and is to report to the Dáil within six months of the enactment of this Act on the findings of the study.".I have raised this issue with the Minister on many occasions. It concerns what I and, more importantly, many working in the construction sector believe to be rampant abuse of the category of self-employment, particularly in the construction sector, to wrongly categorise workers as self-employed when they are in fact being employed by the main building contractors. These contractors are wrongly categorising workers they take on as self-employed in order to avoid paying tax, proper wages, sick pay and holiday pay and to get employees on the cheap. That allegation would be backed up by the sort of advertising made by recruitment agencies. I may have quoted from one I have with me previously but it gives a flavour of the sort of thing that is going on where recruitment agencies recruiting people in construction are setting out in clear and black-and-white terms how people who work through them can avoid paying proper tax for their employees. An advertisement from one recruitment agency advertises the fact that if a company works through the agency, the company will not have to pay PRSI, holiday pay, pensions, sick leave, redundancy payments or administration costs of payroll, PAYE or PRSI. In addition, the advertisement states that the company will not have to pay recruitment or advertising costs, there will be no dispute with employees or unfair dismissal actions and the company will have the ability to hire and fire staff at one hour's notice throughout the country. The agency says that it can provide labour and staff during busy periods of the year when companies have shortfalls and the company can then get rid of them at an hour's notice. The advertisement goes on to explain how the biggest advantage is cash flow and that paying staff on a weekly basis and PAYE and PRSI on a monthly basis can put a strain on a company's cash flow. With this agency, companies do not have to worry about any of these aspects.  This happening on a huge scale. There is flagrant abuse of the tax system in order to avoid paying tax for the benefit of employers, particularly big employers in the construction industry. We had to do a bit of work to get the figures out of the Department because we got different figures on how many people are categorised in the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system. When I asked about how many there were, I was told the number was 35,000. We subsequently discovered that it was 75,000. When it is considered that there are approximately 130,000 or 135,000 people working in construction - the number is increasing - that means more than half of the people working in construction are apparently self-employed. That is nonsense. It is clear evidence of abuse.  If the amount of revenue that is not coming in from this tax head is considered, the figures are extraordinary. In 2008, the revenue coming in from RCT was minus €67 million. I do not know how many people were employed in construction at that stage.I think it was about 90,000 or 100,000 and we got minus €67 million. In 2009 we got minus €53 million. It was a bit better in 2010 and 2011, but it was still minus €9 million and minus €6 million. The latest figures available to me are for 2014 where there is a positive figure, but it is derisory at €27 million even though at that point there were up to 110,000 or 120,000 working in construction - the figure is even higher now - with 60,000 or 70,000 people categorised as self-employed and we only get €27 million back in tax. The tax for the Exchequer from 75,000 PAYE workers would be multiples of that, but we are getting derisory figures and even, incredibly, minus figures for Revenue because whatever tax they pay they get back in offsets and repayments. We know from the dispute involving JJ Rhatigan which caught the headlines - it was one of many disputes - that this sort of abuse was going on with one of the biggest contractors in the country, which was building a school for the State. That company was wrongly classifying bricklayers as being self-employed when they were nothing of the sort. They were not self-employed entrepreneurs, but people who had been taken on by the contractor as bricklayers only to discover five or six weeks into their employment that they were not getting paid anything. Then one of them got paid and when the money was divided up among the five employees, it worked out at about €5 an hour. They were forced to engage in a very long and bitter dispute to highlight the injustice being perpetrated against them. This was fraudulent behaviour by a major contractor, which is still getting contracts to build schools and other things for the State, in wrongly classifying these workers as self-employed when they were not, in order to avoid paying tax and proper wages. This stuff is rampant. Anytime I raise this all I get back from the Minister is a request to report to the Department any individual instances of this of which I am aware. I actually did so on a few occasions. About a year ago I mentioned a particular construction site where, I had been informed, this was going on. When it was raided nine months later, I am informed they found precisely what we said they would find, which was people being wrongly classified as self-employed. That is just one workplace. The evidence from the lack of tax revenue coming back and the fantastic and unbelievable numbers of people who are supposedly self-employed in the construction sector would suggest this is rampant. Yet the Government is unwilling to close down this abuse and ensure that workers who should be employed as PAYE workers are employed as PAYE workers, thus requiring their employers to pay all the proper pay and entitlements that an employer should pay for an employee. Is the unwillingness by this and previous Governments to go after this because it means being able to get State contracts done on the cheap? Of course, if contractors can abuse workers and abuse the tax system in this way, they can put in bids that undercut contractors who actually pay their employees properly and employ them on proper terms and conditions. I think the State is deliberately turning a blind eye to this because it is a way of getting contracts done cheaply. Therefore the authorities do not really want to go after it; they might do the odd raid if prodded by a Member of this House. If ICTU or construction workers cry foul about it as they do on a regular basis, we might get some tokenistic action from Revenue, but then we just go back to ignoring it again and we let it happen. The number of people working in construction is shooting up again. An article in The Sunday Business Post a few weeks ago noted that almost in direct proportion to the very significant increase in the numbers in construction, the number of people being classified as self-employed has shot up as well. As the construction sector expands, this abuse expands again, just as it had done during the Celtic tiger period when the construction sector was at its height and abuse was rampant. That is my contention and more importantly it is the contention of building workers who have been campaigning, protesting and forced to take industrial action about this for many years. While Government Members often say, "You guys and people out there don't want to pay any tax", incredibly, we have a cohort of construction workers who go on strike and protest for the right to pay tax, but the State is not interested in vindicating their right to pay proper taxes. The workers want it because they know it means they are employed on proper pay and conditions and have the entitlements that employees should have. The amendment seeks to insert into the Finance Bill a requirement to look at this area seriously and address the problem. It is in the interests of the State, the Exchequer and the wider public, not to mention in the interests of tens of thousands of construction workers who want the Minister to address this. It is a very reasonable amendment and if the Government cares about getting tax revenue in, cares about tax compliance and cares about the conditions of workers in the construction sector, it should agree to the amendment and go after the issue in a serious way to close down this wholesale abuse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will still press this. Primarily because of the actions of workers themselves protesting, backed up by some of the trade union movement, there have been some moves in this direction. What the Minister seems to have said, if I heard him correctly, is that when audits are done and when there is a bit of an increased focus on this we end up getting more money in, and the Minister mentioned the figure of €51 million as a result of a bit of serious focus being put on this. This suggests if we really closed down this abuse there would be a hell of a lot more revenue coming in. It is quite extraordinary that between 2008 and 2014, €2.3 billion was collected under RCT but €2.4 billion was paid back in refunds and offsets. Over a six- or seven-year period we had a minus figure for this tax head in which 70,000 or 80,000 people are employed. There is something seriously amiss. To respond to Deputy Burton, I did not for one moment suggest there is not legitimate self-employment in the sector. What I did suggest is that it is not credible in the construction sector where 135,000 people are employed that 70,000 or 75,000 of them are self-employed. This is not credible. This suggests wholesale abuse of the classification of self-employment. We have lots of evidence this abuse is happening. We need to take this much more seriously and we need to move to close it down. Any contractor found guilty of this should be banned from ever getting State contracts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government, under the heading of "Health", states, "Efforts to increase access to safe, timely care, as close to patients’ homes as possible will be a priority". Among other things, I assume this refers to the importance of home care and the need to address its provision because the service has been savaged since 2008. There was an increase in funding in the recent budget, but I put it to the Taoiseach that it is not even close to what is required to deliver on what is claimed in the programme for Government to be a priority. I will give the House an example. Mark O'Brien is 48 years of age and has a rare disease, CADASIL, which causes him to have multiple strokes. He is almost totally non-verbal, has severe problems walking and cannot do basic manual tasks. He is categorised as disabled, in receipt of disability allowance and lives in an adapted home. He cannot cook, clean or wash himself because of his condition. His father who is 72 years of age has the same disease. He lives in Shankill and has to travel to Dún Laoghaire on the DART every day, for which he is not really able, to look after his son because Mark has no one to look after him. I have inquired on three occasions since the summer about a home care package for Mark. The HSE has acknowledged that he needs such a package but states the budget for home care hours is "at capacity" and that Mark's home care hours will be reviewed on receipt of additional funding. This is the Taoiseach's health policy. Our most recent response to our inquiry was received on 11 October. Mark is not being given by the Government the home care pacakge that he so desperately needs. How many Mark O'Briens are there? Even with the additional funding for home care packages, there are still approximately 1.5 million fewer hours than in 2008, while the elderly population has increased by 17%. We are, therefore, well short of delivering what was called "safe, timely care, as close to patients' homes as possible". That is the priority that has been given to the issue. When will Mark be given the home care package he needs? When will others like him get the packages they need?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much time is left in the total allocation for Question Time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we limit it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is about the talks with foreign leaders. I was very surprised to read the Taoiseach's tweet at the weekend in which he said he had a really great conversation on the night in question with US Vice President-elect Mike Pence. He stated Mr. Pence certainly knows Ireland and the issues that matter to our people. To be honest, that is a pretty shocking statement. Does the Taoiseach know what Mr. Mike Pence thinks of LGBT people? Has he any idea? He knows what the Irish people think about LGBT rights. They believe in those rights and in equality. Let me give the Taoiseach a flavour of what Mr. Mike Pence said:Homosexuals are not as a group able bodied. They are known to carry extremely high rates of disease brought on because of the nature of their sexual practices and the promiscuity which is a hallmark of their lifestyle.That is disgusting bigotry. He said gay journalists cannot remain unbiased because of the pathological nature of their "gaydom". This is unbelievable stuff. In 2006, he supported a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex weddings and suggested that if same-sex weddings were allowed, societal collapse would occur. In 2013, as Governor of Indiana, he signed a Bill that would jail same-sex couples who applied for a marriage license. The Bill also suggested that clerks or clergy who supplied a licence or performed a wedding for LGBT couples should be jailed. I have not got time to list the remaining instances of disgusting bigotry on the part of this man. I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks we have in common with an outright bigot and anti-gay, anti-lesbian and anti-trans person such as Mr. Mike Pence. It seems we have nothing in common with him and that he knows nothing about the values of people in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has to speak out against the use of that kind of language.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I intend to press this to a vote. I want to respond to some of the responses the Minister gave me this afternoon on the issue of bogus self-employment. His answers on the number of people categorised as self-employed in the construction industry were disingenuous and bordering on misleading the Dáil. I have been trying to establish the precise facts on how many are in the RCT system. The Minister effectively misled the Dáil on the related question on the amount of revenue coming back in under the self-employment tax heading of RCT. Let me correct the record on the assertions the Minister made, starting with the numbers and letters. I checked the letters the Minister sent me and I have also checked others that were sent to him from Ms Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I cross-checked the information with answers the Department has given to Deputies who have asked similar questions. On 19 July 2016, in response to parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Ruth Coppinger, Nos. 168 and 169, on the numbers registered on the RCT, e-RCT and C45 tax systems working in construction from 2002 to 2015, the Minister indicated in a table that there were 74,795 under the heading "RTC registrations/active contractors (principals & sub-contractors)". In the Minister's response to me earlier, he suggested he had been accurate in giving an answer that suggested there were 35,000. He said the higher figure, of 74,795, or nearly 75,000, relates to people whom those subcontractors had employed. That is misleading. The question asked by Deputy Coppinger, which the Minister answered, was very simple and straightforward. The answer he gave for 2015 was 74,795. To further confuse the pitch, Deputy Michael McGrath's office, which has been also asking questions, was informed at one point that the number was in excess of 90,000. I am not quite sure where that figure came from but I take it in good faith that Deputy McGrath's office got it from the Minister in some shape or form. Therefore, there is a serious mystery here. In the letter to which the Minister referred, from July 2016, he referred to the 35,000 as subcontractors. However, in the answer to Deputy Coppinger, given a few weeks later, he said there were 74,000 principal contractors and subcontractors. The point is that there are 74,000, not 34,000, working in the RCT system. They are not principal contractors. In so far as they could be defined as such, the term "principal contractor" loses all meaning. In reality, we are talking about relatively small subcontractors who, in turn, have ten, 15 or 20 tradesmen, bricklayers or others working for them, all of whom are in the RTC system and defined as self-employed for revenue purposes. They number 74,000 and whether they call themselves "subcontractors" or "principal contractors" is totally irrelevant. The point is that 74,000 are classified as self-employed out of a total construction workforce of 130,000. More than half of the construction workforce comprises supposedly self-employed entrepreneurs. That is nonsense and it is misleading for the Minister to suggest I somehow did not understand the figures or misquoted them. It is the Minister who is misleading us as to the reality of this. We keep getting different answers and definitions in letters. Ms Patricia King also suggested the Minister is misrepresenting the figures on the issue. Following my engagement with him in the Dáil on this issue, which prompted him to ask the Revenue Commissioners to write to me, on 29 July 2016, Patricia King wrote to the Minister and said, among other things, that he misrepresented the position of Congress. She said it was misleading of the Minister to convey any impression that Congress is in any way satisfied with the performance of Revenue relating to the bogus self-employment system in this sector. It was stated the Minister is misleading the House, not us. We cannot get to the bottom of this and we keep getting different figures and definitions and so on. Essentially, this is to cover up what I and, more important, people working in the industry believe to be a massive scandal. Next is the issue of the revenue. The Minister quoted figures today suggesting €132 million came in under the RCT heading in 2013, that the figure for 2014 was €172 million and that the figure for 2015 was €174 million. He did not acknowledge these are the gross figures, not the net figures. Even the gross figures do not tally with figures the Minister's Department has given to other Deputies in this House on that issue. In response to a parliamentary question asked by Deputies Tommy Broughan and Ruth Coppinger, if I remember correctly, the Department stated the gross figure for 2013 was €157 million. The Minister said today it was €132 million although he told Members in response to a parliamentary question that it was €157 million. There is a huge discrepancy in that regard, amounting to approximately €30 million, a significant amount. It is taxpayers' money so we need to know the truth. Which figure is correct? Is it €132 million or €157 million? The difference, approximately €30 million, is a lot of money. The Minister also misleads us regarding the net figure. The net figure, after repayments, deductions, etc., is only €12.3 million. This is a very far cry from €132 million or €157 million, whichever it happens to be. Similarly, the Minister said the figure for 2014 was €172 million. Figures I have garnered from other data I got from the Minister suggest the gross figure was €201 million, not the €172 million he mentioned today, and that the net figure is €31 million, which is much less. Different figures come from the Minister on different days. It seems to depend on the day.The Minister mentioned a figure of €174 million for 2015, but what was the net figure? That is the one that counts. How much does the Exchequer end up with after repayments? It is much less every other year than the unreliable figures the Minister mentioned. A further piece of evidence is worth mentioning. I do not understand it fully, but it seems to be related to the major problems encountered in this regard. Recently I asked the Minister's Department "what exactly the Revenue Commissioners mean when they refer to the estimated value of contract and to the degree this should be accurate as to the actual amount earned by the person to whom that contract refers." Today the Minister and Deputy Peter Burke called RCT a good system that gave information on the locations and values of contracts. However, my contacts in the industry tell me that these contract confirmations, as they are called, are not worth the paper on which they are written and that the value of the contract given by the contractor never tallies with the actual amount paid. It is virtually a fictional figure. There is a significant discrepancy between the value of the contract and the actual payments made. This seems to have been borne out by the Minister's answer to me, in that there were 319,114 contracts in the construction sector in 2014 with a value of €28.7 billion, yet the 804,165 payments made only amounted to €10.1 billion. This seems to confirm what my source told me. He has and is willing to provide for the Department contracts the value of each of which is a multiple of what has actually been paid to the supposedly self-employed person whose name is attached to the contract. He cited as an example a contract confirmation in which the value was listed as €25,000 but the worker named only earned €4,800. That is a major discrepancy at a micro level. The contract confirmation provided by the principal contractor for Revenue bears no relationship to the reality on the ground in terms of what the contractor is paying. This forms part of an elaborate tax fraud by such contractors to avoid paying people properly. Revenue, the Minister and his Department do not seem to want to chase down this problem. This is a significant scandal and tax fraud that we are failing to take seriously. We cannot even get accurate figures. In and of itself, the fact that there is a discrepancy from month to month in the figures we get from the Minister justifies the holding of a serious investigation. We need to get to the bottom of this matter for the sake of the tax revenue being lost to the public and the State and in the light of the abuse and exploitation of tens of thousands of construction workers who are being forced into being misclassified as self-employed when they are really employees of these dodgy subcontractors or, in many instances, large contractors. That is my case. We may have to argue about it, but we must at the very least get to the bottom of this issue, have it investigated and have the investigation reported on to the Dáil within a minimum of six months, as set down in the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The massive extent of losses being carried forward by banks and other big enterprises to write down their taxable income and consequently reduce their tax liability is an unbelievable scandal.There are many other mechanisms and loopholes through which the corporate sector can write down its tax liability. The scale of it is truly staggering and points again and again to the need to impose, as a minimum, the 12.5% tax rate on gross profits and which we have urged the Minister for Finance to do for the past five years. I note that Deputy Joan Burton and the Labour Party have recently converted to this view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe it is the Deputy's time to speak. Is it? I do not think so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is strange that for the past five years we have been raising this issue and when the Deputy was in government, strangely enough, she did not implement it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. They did not implement an effective rate of 12.5% but now they are apparently the ones who invented the proposal. I am glad that they have had a bit of a conversion on that issue because it is an absolute scandal. From figures just pulled from the Revenue website today, the full figure for losses brought forward in 2014 is extraordinary. It is over €215 billion. It is incredible. This is a big part of it, but not the only part. There is a whole series of other loopholes which allowed in 2014 - it really is extraordinary - gross trade profits, declared at €95 billion plus other income and capital gains of €8 billion, giving a total of €103 billion. After all these deductions are brought in for losses brought forward and other deductions, €103 billion in gross profits becomes only €50 billion in taxable profits, which is more than halved. It is absolutely extraordinary. Consequently, because of the failure to impose a minimum effective rate, the loss is in the order of €4 billion per year. A minimum effective rate has been proposed in our budget submissions for the past five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy should read them. They were not included in any of her Government's budgets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were not addressed in any of your budgets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I just cannot resist it really. When people tell porkies like that it is just too difficult to not respond. It is extraordinary that €103 billion in gross profits results in total tax paid of €4.9 billion. That is not 12.5%. The figure of €4.9 billion tax on €103 billion is 4.75% on gross profits and other earnings. That is the real effective corporate tax rate and a very significant component of this is the losses brought forward by the banks that the people bailed out. This allows them to avoid paying tax for years to come. It is shocking and it is money that is desperately and urgently needed. I hear the Government state it does not have money for this, that and the other and only has a €600 million fiscal space. I just feel like screaming as I look at the allowances and deductions given to the corporate vampires. These are the banks that brought the State to its knees and which we bailed out. We are now giving massive tax breaks to them. It is shocking. The problem with a lot of this stuff is that some of it is so technical I am not sure of the extent to which the public understands the scale. I certainly intend to make it my mission, as we have tried in the past five years, to explain the rip off to people. It is one of many rip offs and we will discuss more of them as we debate further this evening. Through massive bailouts and huge austerity measures we have nursed these banks back to health and profitability and now they are paying virtually no tax and the Government is probably going to sell them off. It has already sold off most of Bank of Ireland and at some point, it intends to sell off the rest of the banks. When the banks finally start to make money, the State will get nothing or very little back from them. It is one of many tax scandals in this State but the very least we could do is what is being asked for in this motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept Deputy Joan Burton's point about minimum effective rates of income tax, but the argument we were making which was not supported by the Government in which she was involved in the previous five years was in favour of having a minimum effective rate of corporation tax. She was in government but did not implement such a measure. I am glad that she is now echoing the point. This mechanism, whereby profitable enterprises such as banks which account for a huge proportion of these activities write down their taxable income, points to the need for us to impose a minimum effective rate of 12.5%. I agree with her amendment and with that of Deputy Pearse Doherty. I also agree with Deputy Donnelly's point that the very least the Minister could do is accept it in order that we could get the facts and the public would have something to enable them to understand what was going on. There are huge amounts of money involved and the public deserves to know and make informed decisions on what they want to do with the rate of corporation tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our amendment proposing that the section 110 tax break be done away with, full stop, was ruled out of order. I would like a simple answer from the Minister as to why that should not be the case. It is very technical and one's head would be fried, frankly, with this stuff, which, I suppose, is half the point. These flipping tax lawyers are so far ahead of us, the Government and Revenue in finding and exploiting these loopholes that one would have to spend one's whole life chasing them round the new corners and loopholes they create. I was just reading something from Matheson, which is one of the crowd of tax advisers. It relates to the Irish aviation sector. I presume the clampdown the Minister is talking about to somewhat address the abuse we saw in section 110 is limited to the area of property. Aviation is an area to which it should be extended or, if not, one has to ask why we have section 110 at all. What is going on with this tax break? Matheson states on aircraft leasing and section 110:It is critical to ensure that aircraft finance can be raised in a tax efficient way [I love these euphemisms]. In structured finance and securitisation transactions, an Irish section 110 company is commonly used to raise that debt financing to acquire assets on a tax neutral basis.In effect, one acquires a load of assets and does not pay any tax. This is the advice. Matheson states an Irish section 110 company is a standard Irish special purpose company that satisfies the conditions of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.An Irish section 110 company is generally entitled to claim a tax deduction on all of its financing expenses, including, subject to some conditions, its profit linked financing expenses. Therefore, it is generally possible to ensure an Irish section 110 company can acquire assets using debt financing on a tax neutral basis by ensuring it pays all of its return on those assets as tax deductible interest payments to lenders and investors. In other words, Matheson is explaining how one can get away with paying no tax in the case of people who want to avoid paying tax and make a lot of money in the area of aircraft leasing. It is telling companies to come into the sector because under section 110 in the area of aircraft leasing one can make a fortune and pay no tax. It is a major sector; I understand Ireland has the largest aircraft leasing sector for commercial airlines in the world. There is tax abuse. To be honest, I do not fully understand it, but I fully understand Matheson is telling investors that section 110 can be used to make enormous profits for people who want to invest in the area and avoid paying tax. To me, that begs the question as to why section 110 is in place. It is not just about withholding tax on property. I do not know if I can return to an issue I raised on Committee Stage. I refer to companies rolling up profits and using the money to acquire more assets. If that is done for a long enough period - I understand for five or seven years - they will not pay any tax on the capital gains. This stinks to high heaven, but perhaps the Minister might enlighten me as to why we should allow this to happen. I ask him to explain why instead of putting a little sticking plaster on a particular area, we do not close this tax loophole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, I do not fully understand it, but I am not satisfied that the Minister has made a case for section 110 in general. His main argument seems to be that there are 38,000 jobs in the IFSC and that, therefore, we should not worry about people such as those in Matheson telling investors to get into the area of aircraft leasing and use section 110 to ensure they will pay no tax. To me, that is a big problem, but the Minister justifies it on the basis of some jobs being created. To help us to judge these matters properly, we need to know exactly how many people were employed, for example, in aircraft leasing companies in each of the years since this provision was introduced, how much profit was generated in the area in each of those years and how much tax was forgone as a result of the use of section 110. Then we will be able to judge whether it is a beneficial tax break in the sector or the others to which section 110 applies or just another way for the super rich to make a lot of money and use the IFSC and the tax code as a tax haven. We need that information to make judgments on these matters. I would like to see that information. I know that the Minister does not have the answers in front of him, but I would like to see the facts in order that we can break this down, understand it and see if there really is any benefit or whether it is just another big tax scam. However, to me, it stinks to high heaven.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the amendment and endorse Deputy Donnelly's comments, but I will go further on a point that is not covered by the amendment but is connected to it. It relates to section 110 generally. I do not fully understand the mechanism through which these companies have avoided significant amounts of tax or even how much they have avoided, but we need to know the details. What else is happening in the wider section 110? I will cite the Matheson document regarding something that I will have to pursue at other times in the Chamber, namely, aircraft leasing and how companies can still benefit from section 110. The attempt to clamp down on a particular area of property is not applied to other areas. The size of it is staggering. I did not know about this stuff; I am reading from Matheson's document. It reads:Over EUR 83 billion of aircraft assets are under management in Ireland.7 out of top 10 aircraft lessors have operations in Ireland.Half of the world's leased fleet of commercial aircraft are leased or managed through Ireland.That is enormous. The front of the document reads:Attractive tax environmentIreland offers a very attractive tax environment in which to carry on aviation leasing and financing business:Access to a wide double tax treaty network (over 69 signed treaties)A standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%No withholding tax on lease rental paymentsStraight-line tax depreciation of 12.5% over eight years0% VAT on international aviation leasingNo stamp duty or transfer taxes on the transfer of aircraft or aircraft partsWide exemptions from withholding tax on interest and dividendsAvailability of flexible securitisation regime for holding aircraft and receivablesThis is like a menu of tax avoidance that is possible in a massive sector based in Ireland. A significant part of it turns on section 110. I want to know more about this issue and the public is entitled to know more, given the fact that we are discussing €83 billion in assets and a large industry, about how much profit is being generated, how much tax is being forgone as a result of the use of section 110 and what actual employment benefit we are getting in that specific sector.We need to have facts on this and on the effectiveness or otherwise of the effort the Minister has made to close down one aspect of this tax loophole. We need proper, easily understandable and digestible, straightforward information in order to be able to assess whether, as I suspect is the case, this is an enormous tax loophole whereby billions are being siphoned out of the tax system by the people investing in these areas and using these mechanisms.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 41:In page 43, to delete lines 13 to 40, to delete pages 44 to 62, and in page 63, to delete line 1.The amendment relates to the Irish real estate funds. We had this discussion on Committee Stage. We tabled a few amendments on the issue, most of which have been ruled out of order, in particular, amendment No. 46. Amendment No. 41 deletes the sections that we were trying to delete in amendment No. 46, and more besides. I do not quite understand how amendment No. 41 is in order, which deletes everything that No. 46 proposed to delete, and more, and No. 46 is out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has tabled an amendment, which slightly amends what was agreed on Committee Stage. What I am trying to get out of the amendment is that, essentially, there should be no such thing as the exclusion of profits from Irish real estate funds. The Government amendment slightly varies what it had earlier but it still allows significant profits to be excluded. I do not see the justification or rationale for any profits from the real estate investment funds being excluded and not taxable. If I understand the very complicated discussion we had on Committee Stage, the funds will be taxed if the profits or dividends are distributed, but if the fund holds on to the property assets beyond five years, they will not be subject to capital gains tax. As I suggested on Committee Stage, that seems to mean that with the rental revenue the funds are accumulating from very high rents from the real estate they have bought, they can roll up the revenue and profits and, if they do not distribute them, they could just use the money to buy more and more property assets and get a massive capital gain. As long as they hold onto it for a certain period, however, they pay no tax whatsoever on it. As we know, the value of property has gone through the roof. We know the funds are making enormous money on rents, which have gone through the roof, in large part thanks to the profiteering of those entities, and as long as they do not distribute the profit but can use it to just buy up more property, they will pay no tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but it is important to get across what I am trying to ask.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see why any of these profits should be excluded. It just seems to me that the Minister is allowing a massive tax loophole to continue for the benefit of property speculators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are important issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Briefly. I will come back in when we come to the Government amendment. I tabled the amendment, but the real target is the target set out in amendment No. 46 which, unfortunately, has been ruled out of order. Deputy Donnelly's point underlines why we are concerned about this section, which is that we are allowing the continuation of a special tax status, or non-tax status, for people speculating in property. They are investing in property and making a hell of a lot of money from rents and then from very significant property capital gains with the appreciation of the property value. The Minister is applying a little sticking plaster, which is better than nothing, while allowing the fundamental tax loophole to remain, which is that those investing in property, by declaring themselves as funds, get exemption from normal taxation, both on the massive rental income generated given that rents have gone through the roof and are generating a housing and homelessness crisis, and massive profit on the inflation we have seen in property prices. They are going to walk away tax-free from all of that. They will even essentially be able to avoid the proposed withholding tax if they roll up the profits and buy even more property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry. Which amendments are we dealing with?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I face a dilemma in dealing with this section because our amendment, which was more targeted, was ruled out of order. I take the point about the withholding tax, and this is something of an improvement on what we had before us on Committee Stage, but we are disallowed from doing what we really want to do, which is what we tried to do in amendment No. 46. The whole thing is unacceptable. I did not get an answer on Committee Stage, and before this goes through it must be said, that I do not understand why the Minister is allowing tax breaks for property speculators to continue. This withholding tax is a sticking plaster that will affect some foreign investors, but the Minister is allowing the continuation, and copperfastening, of a special tax status for property speculators who, as has been very well described, are buying up Dublin. They are making incredible profits from jacking up rents and as long as they do not sell within a five-year period the property assets they buy, and as long as they hold onto them for longer than five years, they will walk away without paying any capital gains tax, and they are making massive capital gains. Property prices are going through the roof. We are allowing this and I do not understand why the Minister is doing this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am allowed to speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked on Committee Stage and I did not get an answer. The only answer I can surmise from this is that back in 2011, 2012 or whenever, the Government decided it wanted to get these big property investors into the Irish property market to inflate the value of property for NAMA to make a profit. The consequence of this for the Government was it would be able to say NAMA had done its job, it had made a profit and the NAMA strategy had been a success. However, the consequence for Irish society has been a massive rental crisis where rents have gone through the roof, property prices are going through the roof and we have an increasing concentration of control over residential property in the hands of a tiny number of these property speculators. It is a deliberate policy, incentivised through this type of measure. I am amazed the Government would want to continue this. Whatever arguments it may feel it had in 2011 or 2012, and I did not agree with it then and I argued against it at the time, why it would consider it acceptable to continue this now is absolutely beyond me. We can see the devastating impact it is having and the totally distorted dysfunctional property sector and rental sector we have in the country. I would love to hear an answer to this. It is an unbelievable scandal when what we should have done is kept these property assets in public ownership, used them for social housing and used the rental revenues to come back to the State to build more social and affordable housing, instead of handing over all of this to flipping property speculators and allowing them massive tax breaks on the rental revenue they get and on the capital gains they will get.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State did not answer my question. I asked it on Committee Stage and I asked it again but he did not answer it. He told me what he thought this was doing and that it is a marginal improvement in that it tries to impose some sort of withholding tax, but it retains the fundamental tax break, or tax status, for these funds that are speculating in property. Can the Minister of State explain how it is legitimate or justified for these property-speculating funds to have this special status where they will not pay any capital gains tax on massive gains on property as long as they hold on to it for five years? I asked another question on Committee Stage, to which I sort of got an answer but one which was not confirmed. Is it true that, as long as they do not distribute the rental income they earn as dividends, they will not pay any tax on it? If they roll up that rental income to buy even more assets and make a capital gain then, as long as they hold onto them from five years, do they pay no capital gains? It is win, win, win for these guys as they speculate in a property bubble while we get nothing back for it. Why is the Government doing this? Please explain to me what the benefit is for this country of retaining this real estate fund special tax status, tax break, loophole or whatever one wants to call it? I do not understand it, and the Minister of State has not given any rationale. All he has done is tell us of the merits of the little change he is making, which is something of an improvement. Nevertheless he is retaining the fundamental tax break.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the benefit in the area of property?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 78:In page 63, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:“23. The Minister for Finance is to order a study to be carried out on introducing a Financial Transactions Tax and is to report to the Dáil within six months of the enactment of this Act on the findings of the study”.I will be brief to save us all the Chinese torture we are now undergoing. It is more for the record.  In every debate on every Finance Bill since we have come into the Dáil we have said that we should consider a financial transaction tax. I understand about €2 trillion worth flows through the Irish Financial Services Centre on an annual basis. There is a very minimal proposal from Europe for a financial transaction tax of 0.01% on financial transactions, net of the stamp duty we already have and to which the Minister always refers. It is estimated that if we imposed a financial transaction tax, we would generate €320 million net a year, but the figure would probably be much higher. It is a negligible tax to impose on the financial services industry. It would barely feel it. I do not buy the argument that companies would all migrate somewhere else if a tax of 0.01% was imposed on them, and €320 million or more would be of significant benefit to the people of this country. It would be preferable to water charges or property taxes which hurt families and would cover the cost of abolishing one or other of those taxes. However, the Minister resisted and Ireland, along with our friends in Britain, is at the forefront of resisting this tiny taxation measure on financial speculators. I do not know why the Minister would not introduce the tax. I have heard him say that he is afraid that things would migrate to the City of London. He has never produced any evidence for that assertion, and frankly I do not buy it. These guys are making an absolute killing. Large amounts of money are moving through the IFSC and businesses could well afford to pay a tiny tax. It is disgraceful that the Irish Government stands out in Europe in resisting this very small measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is incredible that we do not even know how much tax is forgone through these tax breaks the Minister allows for these speculators and investment funds of various kinds. I thought I knew a thing or two until I started to delve into the world of finance as a Member of the Dáil. I am consistently amazed by the elaborate variety of mechanisms that somebody - I presume the tax lawyers representing these speculators and investors - has dreamt up. These tax lawyers then lobby the Government through the Clearing House Group to come up with these vehicles. They make a fortune out of them, and we get a dysfunctional property sector, a massive property bubble, an out-of-control rental crisis and an out-of-control housing and homelessness crisis. The Government allows it, and we do not even know how much tax is foregone through all these vehicles: ICAVs, REITs, QIFs and super-QIFs. You could not make this stuff up. The Minister cannot even tell us, under these different headings, how much tax on a year-to-year basis we do not get because we allow these tax breaks. That should be the absolute minimum of information furnished to us in this House to make any judgment whatsoever as to the merits or otherwise of these tax breaks and tax loopholes. The Minister cannot tell us, but it is big money - billions - and deals with the massive accumulation of property assets in the hands of these speculators, with all the effects it has on the country. The Minister cannot even tell us how much tax we are not getting. That is extraordinary. It is worth thinking about the extent to which the Government will go to try to get water charges from people or go after them for property tax and how they can be hauled through the coals by the Department of Social Protection if it thinks they might be doing nixers or something. However, when it comes to these speculators, when we are talking about hundreds of millions - probably billions - of tax forgone, the Minister cannot even tell us how much. It is unbelievable. Of course, this is so flipping complicated that anyone watching this debate or reading these documents will ask, "What the hell is all that gobbledygook about?" It is in that labyrinth of complexity that all this stuff is obscured so that nobody really understands what is going on while they are being ripped off on a massive scale. The term "there is one law for the rich and another for the rest of us" gains a new meaning and significance with this stuff. All we would like is a little information at the minimum. We do not think these vehicles should exist, but the Minister should at least give us a little information on the amount of money involved so we can make a judgment as to whether he is making a good call. We have already made our judgment: it is not a good call. However, the information and the facts surrounding this should at least be put before us and the wider public so we can understand what is going on and how people are being ripped off. I had another point. It might come back to me in a minute if I get another chance to contribute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to make another point. Most of the points have been made. One of the amazing things about all of this is that it will not deliver a single extra house.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The housing and homelessness crisis is the biggest crisis facing this country. The Government never tires of telling us that it is caused by a lack of supply and that we need to consider where that supply should come from. We think the State should provide that supply, but any bloody supply would be pretty helpful at the moment. It is an absolutely disastrous situation. All of these ICAVs, QIFs and REITs, etc., will not deliver a single extra house. The position might get even worse, as Deputy Donnelly has suggested. Money is being forgone in tax to benefit people who are just speculating. That is all they are doing. They are just speculating. When the Minister of State responded to me earlier, he said we have fundamentally different views about the role of the private sector. I get that, but what exactly is the benefit of this particular private sector involvement? It is not delivering anything. It is not bringing us anything. It is not helping to deal with the housing and rental crisis. It is making it worse. I remember opposing the REITs and ICAVs when they first appeared in 2013. I told the Minister for Finance I could not believe he was introducing these tax incentives. I did not fully understand what they were. I saw them and I asked what they were. It was at a similar late-night session to this one, when we had been debating for hours. I could easily have let it pass because we were all so tired. I asked what the REITs were. I asked whether they would incentivise the kind of speculation that led to the last property bubble. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, said that there would not be a property bubble, but we have a property bubble now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, it is crazy for us to continue with this Bill dealing with detailed and complicated matters, including tax matters, at this-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For us to continue, as is necessary for us to do our job of proper legislative scrutiny, at these hours, which are anti-social and keep the staff here late-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Government to conclude the debate now and defer the rest of it until tomorrow morning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This was not brought up at the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We discussed this issue at length. Deputy Doherty's amendment covers similar territory to that covered in the previous discussion and some of the discussions we had earlier, so there is not a lot to add other than to ask if there is any recognition on the part of the Government that we have a property bubble. Is there any concern about that, and that these property-based tax incentives, the very thing that led to the last bubble and crash, are producing similar effects again and that we should be doing something to prevent that from happening? It will be on the Minister's head when this property bubble comes crashing down again. It is already having a devastating social impact in terms of housing and homelessness and the rental crisis, which is reaching across society.It does not affect just the people on the very lowest incomes, but also working people in relatively well-paid jobs who are unable to afford a roof over their heads because there is a property bubble as a result of a group of super-rich speculators who think it is okay to profit from the crisis and the shortage of housing. They are having an absolute bonanza at the expense of the misery of huge numbers of our citizens. This bubble is staring us in the face, yet the Minister insists on retaining this elaborate architecture of property-based tax incentives. The Minister is completely refusing to acknowledge in any shape or form that there is a very serious problem that his policies have contributed to creating. If he is not willing to close down these crazy tax loopholes for speculators, the very least the Minister could do is carry out a proper study in which we can look in detail at how it is all working, what impacts it is having, how much tax is forgone, who is benefiting from it and what is the impact of it on wider society, housing, rents and all the rest of it. I am frankly flabbergasted as to the Minister's motives in all of this. I was even asking Deputies during the break what the thinking behind this could be. The only conclusion I can come to is that the Government is completely hostage to these speculators via the Clearing House Group. That group seems to exercise influence on the Government in order that it puts these measures in place. It then advertises on its websites to invite investors and speculators to come to Ireland, the best little country in the world in which to pay no tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not go over the ground already covered but I asked a question on Committee Stage, the answer to which I would like confirmed. If there is no distribution in dividends from the income that is generated by these vehicles but instead the profits are rolled up and used to buy even more property by these vehicles, so that all of the profit gets rolled up into capital gain, the withholding tax does not apply as long as they hold on to it for five years. Is that right? Potentially, all of the profits that they make, and are making, from the extortionately high level of rents, as long as they do not distribute them as dividends, but instead reinvest them to buy even more property, so the capital gain element of the investment goes up and up and up, and they hold on to it for five years, then they can walk away and all of it is tax free. Therefore, the withholding tax becomes meaningless. Is that not a fact?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anybody who understood that reply deserves a double A+.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 82:In page 63, line 15, after “subsection (4)” to insert “and that is published and made available for public viewing by the Revenue Commissioners”.This series of amendments seeks to make country by country reporting requirements for multinationals or corporations operating in multiple jurisdictions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. It is very difficult at this stage to string two or three coherent sentences together, but I will do my best.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Durkan. I appreciate the vote of confidence. It might lead him to support the amendment. I am glad the Government has agreed to introduce country by country reporting. Those who are fighting for tax reform in the area of corporate tax to try to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance strategies of multinationals have long argued that country by country reporting is key to beginning to close these aggressive tax avoidance practices. However, they have always said that that reporting, which the Government has accepted has to happen, should be public, and it seems the Government is not willing to accept this and it is what our amendment is trying to press. We have spent the last few hours discussing just how complicated the tax avoidance strategies in a number of areas are, in property in terms of speculators and people investing in property, and that is equally true of the tax avoidance strategies of these multinationals. They have very well paid tax specialists who are working all the time to figure out ways to minimise their tax bill. Therefore, simply having reports given to Revenue but which cannot be viewed by the public and by Members is not good enough. These things need to be available for the public to see and for Deputies to see, analyse and judge as to whether these corporations are properly tax compliant and paying the taxes they should on their enormous profits. I see no reason why the Minister would not accept the amendment. People like Richard Murphy who has spearheaded the campaign for country by country reporting, which has finally been taken on board by governments, has always said it has to be public and that is true. The Minister should accept this. It would make the transparency we need to have tax justice and tax reform a reality. I commend the amendment and hope the Minister will consider accepting it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want it to be a legal requirement that Revenue will provide the information and not that it may do so. We do not want it to be just at the discretion of Revenue. I do not see why Revenue needs discretion or flexibility in respect of this matter and I do not understand why there is a need for confidentiality. Our inability to ascertain where these multinationals are making their profits, and their ability to hide the fact, is at the heart of their ability to avoid vast amounts of tax, robbing the taxpayers of Ireland and their counterparts across Europe and the world of enormous amounts of money. Some estimates put the untaxed profits held by multinational corporations at approximately €2 trillion per year. Much of their ability to engage in this tax avoidance is based on their ability to mask where the profits are being made. We want it to be an absolute legal requirement that companies provide this information and that it be made available to the public. I do not buy the confidentiality argument. I do not see the justification for it. Transparency and the imperative for tax justice make it a necessity that we should get the information, that companies should be forced to provide it and that it should be made available for the public to scrutinise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the interests of not keeping us here all night I will take the Minister's response and consider it so I will not press this for now. Some mechanism must be found to force these companies to cough up the information. If there is a real problem in us not getting the information as the Minister suggests - I will think about what he has said - it is a reasonable point. We need to take a lead and not just be dragged, as we have to date, on these matters. We must insist that it does happen and the European Union proposal that is being discussed has power so these companies are forced to provide the information. I do not see why we cannot do it unilaterally, albeit not via the Revenue Commissioners as suggested in the amendment. We could put a compulsion on those companies to provide those country-by-country reports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 83:In page 64, line 16, to delete "may" and substitute "will"
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 83 is different from the previous amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 84:In page 65, to delete lines 8 to 10. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want to take this sacred cow out of Irish politics. The suffocating consensus on the question of this country's 12.5% rate of corporation tax has dominated the Irish political landscape to the extent that we cannot talk about touching it. It seems that we cannot possibly dream of increasing corporate taxes. I suggest that this terrible consensus has played a key role in spearheading the race to the bottom throughout Europe and across the globe regarding the amount of tax paid by super-wealthy corporations. I would add to the points made by Deputy Paul Murphy by arguing that the focus on low corporation tax rates is the single greatest contributory factor to global financial instability. The less tax these corporations pay, the more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a tiny number of entities that move their profits at a whim to places where they think they will pay the least amount of tax or make the biggest return on investing their money. The fact that corporations control so much money is making for a chronically unstable global economy. They literally hold governments hostage. They really hold us hostage. We have encouraged and facilitated that. In fact, we spearheaded the drive towards lower corporation tax rates and our lead has been followed by other countries. I would like to add to the figures mentioned by Deputy Paul Murphy regarding our role in the race to the bottom. The average rate of corporation tax applied across Europe in 2004 was 27.2%. That figure has fallen to 18.3%. We have played a key role in encouraging other jurisdictions to adopt low-tax policies. Ireland has been the reference point for other countries when they have been deciding to cut their corporation tax rates. The cumulative effect of all of this has been to rob citizens across Europe and the world. It has even been a reference point for Mr. Trump in his race to reduce corporation tax in the United States. We have inspired him to do this. Any benefit we may think we have got from having a low corporation tax rate over a period of time is going to come to an end, even in its own terms, as others try to overtake us in the race to the bottom. Regardless of what one might have thought about this country's strategy previously, it is coming to an end. We are saying it is time to bring it to a halt. We should impose a proper tax rate on these corporations while we can and get some money back while it is possible to do so. We should then use that money to invest in reconfiguring our entire economy and developing a proper and sustainable industrial base that will not be hostage to the whims and fluctuations of the global market and the giant multinationals. I would like to make a point about the effective rate, to which I referred earlier. The Government keeps trying to maintain that our nominal rate of 12.5% or something close to it is the actual rate that is applied to corporate profits, but that is simply not true. The Government is telling fibs to the Irish public and this House when it restates that case. As I said earlier, in 2014 total gross pre-tax profits were €95 billion and other income was an additional €8 billion. This gave us a grand total of €103 billion in pre-tax profits, but just €4.9 billion was paid in tax. This equates to an effective rate of 4.75%.Even if we imposed the 12.5% rate on pre-tax gross profits, we would get €9.2 billion or an additional €4 billion per year. Imagine the difference that would make and how much extra money we would have for the housing programme we need, the chronically underfunded health service, our education system and all the public services and infrastructure deficits that we have. That €4 billion would make a world of difference to the lives of our citizens and the health and sustainability of our economy. It is a matter of urgency, if the economy is to be sustained for the citizens in years ahead, for us to move in a radically new and different direction in terms of corporate tax. That is the thinking and logic behind the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a notion of legitimate tax competition underpinning the Government's view. I ask the Minister and anybody who is open-minded on this to consider the following question. How is it that in the 1950s, 1960s and right up to the 1970s, we could afford the likes of social housing while in Britain they could afford the National Health Service? We had expansion of a public health system and we were able to invest in all sorts of areas of infrastructure to expand public services but now we cannot afford such things, apparently, as there is no money even to build the amount of social housing we could at that time. We do not have the money for infrastructure now but we had it then, when we were poorer. The level of corporate taxation has dropped from approximately 50% then to negligible levels now and something gives when there is such competition and a race to the bottom. We go from where corporations pay 50% tax on profits to 4.7% on those profits now. As a result, we do not have the money for social housing, infrastructure, education and everything we need to sustain a decent society and a proper infrastructure for that society. That is the consequence of the race to the bottom that the Government has spearheaded and we want to move in the opposite direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had houses.
