RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are vehicles with which one can negotiate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to speak on one of the issues raised by Deputy Martin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	During the past week the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, made a number of comments on housing matters, which, as we are all aware, are in a dire situation. Following the comments of the Minister, is legislation or Government action on these issues imminent? The first issue is the scandal of an estimated 250,000 empty houses in the State. To use the Minister's words, is urgent, radical action going to follow to ensure these houses are made available for people who are homeless or rotting on a housing list? On the same subject, I heard a worrying comment by the Minister in respect of the Irish Glass Bottle site to the effect that he hoped we might get 10% of it for social and affordable housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what he was quoted as saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that it is NAMA property - publicly owned property. Is the Minister going to clarify his comments? We should be getting 100% council and affordable housing on what is public land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need clarification from the Government of the intentions for the Irish Glass Bottle site.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That means 90% is being sold off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the truth.
