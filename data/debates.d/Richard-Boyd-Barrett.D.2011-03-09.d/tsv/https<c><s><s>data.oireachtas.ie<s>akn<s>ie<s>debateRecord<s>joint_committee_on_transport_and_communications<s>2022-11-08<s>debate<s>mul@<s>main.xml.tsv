RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it so unattractive to be a bus driver? This is the question I have. From everything I hear from bus drivers the root of this is that they have to work, and are increasingly pushed to work, very long unsociable shifts.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I just asked one. My very first question was why it is so unattractive to be a bus driver. I am elaborating that question by pointing out that what bus drivers tell me is that it is very unattractive. Those starting out as bus drivers with Dublin Bus receive approximately â‚¬6,000 less than other people working there longer.
