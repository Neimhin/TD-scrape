RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is acting like one though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is to keep the Taoiseach on his toes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach intend via the council to take action against EBS, which is a State owned bank, to deal with the appalling situation where 300 of its workforce have had a month's pay, worth €2,500, taken off them while managers and executives of that bank are, scandalously, not having a penny taken off their high salaries or incomes?  This is an absolute scandal.  This was effectively——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——part of their annual salary and these workers have lost, at two days notice and just before Christmas, €2,500 each on average.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach, via the economic management council, tell the EBS to give those workers their money back and take the money off the top earners in the EBS instead?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach rightly condemned Fianna Fáil for crashing our economy and forcing us into the hands of the EU-IMF troika but does he not agree that the proposed deal will institutionalise what he rightly describes as the loss of our economic sovereignty?  We will lose democratic control over our economic affairs for perpetuity.  There will be centralised, Stalinist control by the European Commission and the ECB over national economies and ordinary people will be disenfranchised.Was there any discussion about the summit being the umpteenth attempt to come up with some sort of crisis resolution mechanism?  Days, if not hours, after the conclusion of every previous summit the solutions began to unravel because the beloved markets decided they would not work.  The bottom line problem underlying this pattern is that the austerity programme is crippling growth and even the markets realise a solution will not be found while the European economy is contracting.  This proposal will set in stone an economic austerity agenda which will have the same effect.Was any mention made of the contrasting fate of Iceland?  I do not suggest that Iceland is perfect but it took a different response to the crisis and even the IMF praised its decision to allow its banks to fail.  It did not reduce expenditure on the welfare state——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——and it imposed capital controls to prevent money from fleeing the country.  As a result, its economy is now recovering.  It is on the path to recovery after doing the exact opposite of what Europe is demanding from Ireland.  Was there any discussion on the need to find a radically different way of dealing with this crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Neither are the 26 now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not according to Nicolas Sarkozy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are getting worse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Talk down the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the fiscal Bill to which the Taoiseach referred deal with——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——the rogue behaviour of the banks, particularly what are effectively State-owned banks shafting their workers before Christmas——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to the tune of €2,500 each?  Meanwhile the CEOs and executives of the bank concerned——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the result of a directive from the Minister for Finance.  The CEOs and executives who are on massive salaries have walked away without any cut.
