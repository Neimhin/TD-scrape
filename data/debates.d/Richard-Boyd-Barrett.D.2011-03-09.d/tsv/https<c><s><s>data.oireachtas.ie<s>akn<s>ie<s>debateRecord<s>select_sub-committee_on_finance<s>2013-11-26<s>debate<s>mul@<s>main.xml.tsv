RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I broadly welcome the incentive. It is a positive measure which I hope will encourage people to carry out refurbishment and so forth. It may complement the pay-as-you-save installation programme about which there has been much discussion. It could link in very well with that scheme and is a much better-conceived incentive than others that will be discussed later. Sadly, I missed the discussion of a scheme provided for in section 2, which is misconceived as its beneficiaries could include people and large companies who are doing very well for themselves, rather than small builders, householders and so forth. The JobsPlus scheme and similar schemes are highly problematic. This, however, is a good thing. The job of the sub-committee is to scrutinise and consider legislation. Deputy Doherty raised a valid point. He described cases in which adaptations are required to houses that have not been occupied previously with a view to assisting a disabled person. Another category of works also arises. As the Minister is aware, the census found that there are 320,000 empty houses in the State. Many of these will have lain empty for a long period before being purchased, whether from the National Asset Management Agency or someone else. It is possible, therefore, that they will have deteriorated in various ways.The time lag could mean that somebody who seeks to purchase a house that was not previously occupied would be required to make adaptations to the house in order to make it habitable and, indeed, attractive. Might the requirement that the house have been previously occupied be a problem in this context? I take the Minister's point that we do not want to let the builder off the hook in terms of doing proper work but I can also think of circumstances in which an individual thinking of buying one of the many empty houses around the country may want to have work done on it to bring it up to standard given that it may have been sitting empty for a number of years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I question the somewhat arbitrary distinction the Minister is making in setting the threshold at €5,000 if the major purpose of the scheme for refurbishment and redevelopment is to generate employment. The Minister has stated this is the purpose. In so many instances people under pressure are not carrying out routine work because they are not sure whether they should spend the money. If the scheme can tip them in favour of adopting the view that it is worthwhile employing somebody to do certain work, it is beneficial. In my area builders, tradespeople and, in many cases, self-employed tradespeople are at their wit’s end because there is no work forthcoming. Hundreds of people are looking for the same work. Any proposal that would increase the amount of work available for this large cohort of building workers and tradespeople would be very welcome; therefore, I do not see why the Minister makes a distinction in respect of what I accept is a good idea. What is the problem with lowering the threshold so as to encompass smaller refurbishment projects and redevelopments? I do not quite understand the Minister's comments on the black economy. Surely, if he were to lower the threshold to include smaller refurbishment jobs and redevelopments, he would help to eliminate the black economy and encourage people to enter the legitimate economy. It seems self-evident that this would be the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is none at the minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is provided someone can have three jobs carried out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a pity the Minister has sought to cheapen a serious discussion by taking political potshots, particularly as it is clear that those of us on this side are trying to engage and refine the measure he is trying to implement. We have stated in a non-partisan, non-political way that this is a positive measure. There will be plenty of opportunities, in the context of the Bill before us, to criticise the Minister for things he has either done or not done. We will certainly be voicing such criticism. There will also be plenty of opportunities for him to engage in the cut-and-thrust of debate with members. When an attempt is being made to be constructive and to engage with what we believe to be a positive measure, however, the Minister should respond in kind rather than making cheap political points or misrepresenting people in the context of what they have to say. There is a serious issue regarding where the threshold lies in the context of maximising the impact and benefit with regard to employment creation. We must also consider the extra revenue which might accrue to the State if the threshold is pitched at the correct level. I accept that if it is pitched too low, problems might arise. I accept the Minister's argument in that regard. However, there is another argument, namely, that a threshold of €5,000 is too low. I can think of quite a number of different jobs which could be done and which might lead to tradespeople gaining employment in the legitimate economy. Such individuals might sometimes not take on such jobs because they do not believe them to be worthwhile or because the person getting the work done thinks that he or she can get it done a bit cheaper. We all know this happens. I do not believe that most people doing that want to do it. In fact, I do not believe they want to do it at all but many of them - both tradespeople and those who might get works done to their homes - find themselves in a difficult position.A lot is happening on the margin where people are deciding whether to have certain works done to their houses. These are reasonably substantial works. We are not talking about having the washing machine fixed or landscaping palatial gardens. I know a family who have just refurbished their home in the past two years, put a lot of money in and employed people, but more works need to be done and they are at the limit and deciding whether to do them. We are probably talking about a sum of €2,000 to €4,000. If they decide to do them, tradespeople will be employed and there will be a benefit to the economy. If not, that will be a pity for them, the Exchequer and the tradespeople concerned, many of whom are desperate for work. The family may decide to go through the black economy, not because they want to or because the tradespeople want them to do so but because they will work out whether it is worth their while. We do not expect the Minister to say he agrees with our point, but he should take it seriously and consider it. There is a case for reconsidering the threshold and reducing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have some points I want to make on section 6.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would never criticise the Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I intend to move amendment No. 33 on behalf of Deputy Donnelly but I also wish to speak on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In regard to section 2 and JobsPlus, I give notice of my intention to bring an amendment on Report Stage. In regard to the amendment, I respect the Minister's desire to take special measures to deal with long-term unemployment but there is a problem with doing it this way. Whether the period is 15, 12 or nine months, people who have just lost their jobs or have come out of education and do not want to be unemployed for any period of time are being told they will have to remain unemployed in order to benefit from this and similar schemes. People think that is crazy. It will end up pitting the long-term unemployed against those who have recently lost their jobs. I understand what the Minister is trying to do but I think there is a problem with it and I reserve the right to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this measure which is ill-thought out and will really hit a big cohort of families. I am afraid the modern family is different from what families used to be. That is just the way it is. This is a discriminatory move against families that do not accord with what some people consider the so-called normal family set up. Relationships break up but that does not mean the father or the mother who is not the primary carer of the children is somehow unlikely to play a full part in the rearing, maintenance and nurturing of their children. I say that from a personal point of view because I am in that situation. I am not the primary carer of my children but I can tell the Minister that I play a full part in their lives. As it happens, I do not claim the credit because I was not aware of it until recently but other people who have spoken to me have told me what a huge hit this will be. Even some of the amendments trying to improve this measure or minimise the damage the initial proposal would do are also failing to get the point. It is not about the number of days. There are all sorts of circumstances. For example, many people have had to leave this country for work but their kids may have had to stay here with their former partner. They may not have wanted to do that but have to do so. They may be contributing very substantially financially and use every opportunity they can to see their kids and may speak to them on the telephone every night. They may not want to be in this position but they will potentially be hit by a measure like this. There are all sorts of other scenarios where it is not the number of days that indicate the role the non-primary carer parent might play in a child's upbringing, so it is simply unfair to hit them.As somebody put it to me, it is giving the State a financial incentive to see relationships break up because the State benefits. If two people are working and together, they both receive the tax credit but if they break up, only one will receive it. That is wrong. The impact of that will come back on the children, as has been said because people will be able to afford less in maintenance payments and that will be picked up at the other end by one-parent family payments and so forth. Ultimately, it will fall back on the children. It is an attack on families and on children in particular. It also represents a failure to recognise that families are different now, that relationships sometimes break down and that is nobody's fault. People should not be punished because their relationship has broken down and their children should definitely not be punished. I ask the Minister to reconsider this and to remove this provision from the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I oppose the whole section. I am against a two-tier health system. I do not think people should have to take out private health insurance so I am not particularly in favour of the principle of giving tax breaks to copper-fasten a two-tier system. Most people who take out private health insurance do so out of fear and anxiety that if they get sick they will not get the sort of care that they need in the public system.I think most people would prefer to have a public system on which they could rely and in which they felt safe, and which would look after them and their health from the cradle to the grave. If that option was given to people, they would jump at it. However, because that is not what we have, people are forced to take out private health insurance which is not, for the most part, gold-plated with gold-plated premiums. These are ordinary working people trying to create a health safety net for themselves against the likelihood that at some stage they will be sick or they are people who know they are sick and will have a need for health services and do not believe the public system is up to scratch. If this measure was in a different context, such as in a context of at least maintaining or, better still, increasing the level of resourcing, funding and staffing in the public health service, then I could understand the proposal, as I would if it was a proposal to phase out the two-tier system in order to bring in a top quality public health system available to everyone at the point of need, which is what we should have, but that is not what it is. This is an attack on people who make great sacrifices to take out health insurance because they do not feel confident that the public system can cope with their needs or give them the service they need when they will most need it. The public system is being butchered and its budgets and staffing levels are being slashed. The Minister's budget proposes to take away significant funding. The anecdotal evidence is that people are deciding not to take out health insurance because they can no longer afford it. They will get sicker because they do not believe they can afford to pay the cash to the hospital or to the GP and they will fall back on the public system which is being slashed to pieces and is unable to cope as it stands. That will be the consequence. There is no way of presenting this proposal as anything other than another cruel, unfair cut which hits people where they are vulnerable. Therefore, I utterly oppose it and I suggest the Minister should withdraw it. He should withdraw it, not just as a single measure, but in the context of understanding that what people want is a public health service that is available to everybody and in which they have confidence. That is what the Minister promised. He did not quite put it in those terms during the election campaign. In the mind of the public, universal health insurance sounds very like a universal health service for everybody when they need it. That is what I suspect most people thought the Minister was talking about but that is not what they are getting. However, that is what people want and that is what the Minister should give them. This is just another attack and I oppose it completely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have discussed matters ideological and non-ideological. I am of the view that this is an ideological matter. That was highlighted by the Minister's statement to the effect that this is an expensive commodity. That is the problem. It is not a commodity nor should it be perceived as such. Decent health services are very important and should be a right for people. Such services involve providing for people when they are at their most vulnerable. That is what we should aim towards. I agree with the Minister's point about everybody being a taxpayer, although I hate that word. People are human beings and citizens and they all pay taxes. To a certain extent, they are paying towards the provision of private health insurance. I accept that point. The key aspect is that most people who take out private health insurance do so because they are of the view they must so as a result of the public system not functioning. If the Government genuinely wants to address this problem, the way to proceed is to strengthen the public system. It is not doing so. The Minister stated that what is being done involves trying to make it somewhat fairer. If the other side of the equation involved building up the public system and making it something in which people could have confidence, there would be something to his argument. The exact opposite is happening and the public system is being slaughtered. If anything, people probably feel that if they could afford private health insurance, they would take it out. At precisely the moment at which they may be contemplating going down that route, higher insurance premiums and the Minister's removal of the tax break have made it more difficult for them to do so. We do not have hard evidence - neither, I suspect, does the Minister - about what will be the effect on the margins. Working families are being hit for €80 here, €100 there and €500 for the property tax, and all of these costs accumulate. While the Minister, as he sits in the Department of Finance, might think that a certain measure might involve a small hit, in cumulative terms it might be the thing which tips someone over the edge. In that context, the measure in this regard is unfair and wrong if it is not going to be accompanied by additional resources being invested in the public system. I wish to comment on the Government's commitment to move towards a system of universal health insurance. Most people think that such a system would be available to everybody and would involve individuals paying for health services according to their means. In terms of that longer-term project, it is incumbent on the Minister to put to the people the options with regard to whether - from a financial and every other point of view - this is the best way to deliver a health service for everybody. It is also incumbent on him to put forward and cost the alternatives and indicate how well they would deliver health services. Some of us believe the way to proceed fairly and deliver a universal health system would involve proceeding on the basis of the National Health Service model in Britain. Such a system would be funded through progressive income taxation and not by means of a health insurance system that would allow private companies to cream money off the top. The latter is the case in America, which spends more on health than any other country. There are massive problems in the context of the lack of universality of health services for US citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want the public health system to work and then we can do away with private health insurance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It may have happened to the Minister but I can assure him that it will not happen to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am catching up with where we are at.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to get an explanation from the Minister. The section relates to relief for employees engaged in research and development activities. Could he read the note on the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a tax credit that is currently available but the Minister is now making a provision that it could be given to the specific employee. Is that the reason there is no cost to the Exchequer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for the explanation. I have questions about the research and development tax credit but setting those aside, this appears to be a reasonable measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I am totally opposed to this measure, the least the Minister could do is to carry out a review of it. However, I am against it, which puts to bed the Minister's idea that I have been corrupted and do not wish to say things that are unpopular in Dún Laoghaire, because lots of high earners live there. However, they should not get exemptions from this high earners' restriction. Regardless of whether they live in Dún Laoghaire or anywhere else, high earners do not pay enough taxes as matters stand and should not be given more tax breaks. I do not accept there is a need to give such people more tax breaks to get investment going. There are other ways in which to do this and one should not be obliged to give more tax breaks to those who already have a lot to convince them to do some good for society and the economy. I do not accept the rationale behind it. While the Minister might not agree with me in this regard, the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty proposes there at least should be a proper analysis of the measure. It could easily be the case - I suspect it probably will - that some higher earners will benefit from it but that it will not have any great benefit for the economy. Consequently, while I disagree with the entire principle, if the Minister is putting forward this proposal as a measure to encourage investment, he at least should be able to put forward some evidence that it will produce a positive economic effect. Otherwise, it is simply another tax break for the rich and we have had enough of those. We need some relief for the ordinary people who are being hammered and not more tax breaks for the rich.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not only about this measure, but this measure is symptomatic. It harks back to the sort of practices that got us into the mess that we are in. It is a worrying trend that in the past few budgets new versions of so-called tax incentive measures, which led us into the mess that we are in, are starting to reappear in the form of tax breaks in the areas property and share-trading, derivatives, etc., for wealthy investors and individuals because we need to provide them with a so-called incentive. I do not buy it. It smacks of not learning lessons. In so far as the people get to know about these matters, it infuriates them that when they are getting hammered we are talking about having to give tax breaks - so-called incentives - to the wealthy. There is no evidence that it works. It only adds to the suite of measures from which high-powered accountants, who are employed by wealthy investors, can pick to minimise the amount of tax their clients have to pay. I accept that small businesses needs credit, although mostly they need demand. The best place to look to provide credit is not by giving further tax breaks to wealth investors. Overall, we lose. We simply redistribute wealth or say that the cost of economic growth and development is that the rich must get richer and that the gap between the haves and the have nots must grow. That is dangerous for the economy. It is not only that it is unjust, although we can put it those moral terms. If one were to ask what is the fundamental problem with this economy, the European economy and the global economy, it is that there is too much money sloshing around in private hands and the rest of us are held hostage by those wealthy individuals and wealthy corporations. We must do something about it, that is, implement an old-fashioned idea called redistribution of wealth. This is going in the wrong direction. It is a small measure but I do not accept it. It is not the way to help small and medium-sized businesses. We could do that by starting to stimulate demand in the economy.
