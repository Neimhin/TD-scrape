RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Frankie is two. His parents, very worried, came into my office this week because a paediatrician and their own observation established that Frankie has very serious developmental delays, is non-verbal and is showing all the signs of severe autism. They got a letter stating he would be assessed within the legally required time, and then they got a phone call shortly afterwards from the disability network team stating it would be two years before Frankie would be assessed. That is a disgrace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will refer it to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. I have also been talking to one of the barristers who is taking many of these cases and the situation is very bad. This story suggests the establishment of the disability network teams is not making any difference; it is just another layer. We have assessments of need, disability network teams, CAMHS and NEPS. It is all fragmented. In reality, while they might tick certain boxes, they are not actually doing the assessments or getting the services. The point is Frankie's future and the future of many thousands of other kids are at stake. If Frankie gets the early intervention and the supports now, he will be fine. Despite developmental delays and so on, he can flourish. If he does not get that, his future will be seriously jeopardised, as will the future of many other children. There are new layers of bureaucracy. Disability network teams, by the way, are 28% understaffed. That is the problem. I will talk in a minute about the psychologists and the lack thereof. We need the law to be upheld and the rights of Frankie and other children to be upheld.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A preliminary assessment is not an assessment of need. That is the point and that is what the judge ruled on. It was a way of appearing to tick the box of assessment without actually giving the assessment necessary or the diagnosis. I see the Minister shaking his head. Why do Frankie's parents get a letter stating they will get their assessment by May? This is a tick box the law requires of them. This was earlier this year. The box is ticked, but then they get a call from a human being in the disability network team who says it will be two years before Frankie gets assessed. This is the difference between ticking boxes and actually doing assessments and then providing the services that are needed. I am not a psychologist. I have raised this so many times. If the Department wants to staff the teams, it should remove the barriers to psychologists being qualified and getting their doctorates such as extortionate fees. I know that is not a matter for the Department of Health, but we need joined-up thinking. There is no funding for educational or counselling psychologists. It is impossible for people who want to do psychology and who want to help children like Frankie, vulnerable children, to get qualified. Barriers are put in their way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ESRI report published today shows the utterly disastrous situation facing low-income households looking for and needing support to get affordable housing. It demonstrates that the Government's failure to provide the social housing necessary for low-income families and to have housing assistance payment, HAP, limits that are even close to the extortionate rents being charged out there, as well as its refusal to raise the income thresholds for more than a decade, mean that low-income families are either not getting the housing support necessary to find rental accommodation or, worse, not getting any housing support at all because their incomes are marginally over the income thresholds. The human reality of this is that today yet another person facing eviction through no fault of their own walked into my clinic. Nothing is available in the area. This person is facing homelessness and is not entitled to housing support. What is the Government going to do to respond to the findings of this report?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We desperately need more apprentices and we need to make apprenticeships and trades attractive to people in order to address the problems that our society is facing at the moment. Across the board, the lack of skills necessary to solve big social problems is enormous. Most obviously, there is a desperate need for qualified tradespeople, and that means apprentices, to build the houses we need and to refurbish vacant and derelict properties in order to solve the housing crisis. We also need them in the context of climate change to retrofit homes. Hundreds of thousands of homes need to be retrofitted but we do not have enough skilled people to do this work. We also need them to build new schools. There are so many other areas where we are desperately in need of talent but we have shortages. Hundreds of thousands of people were working in construction during the Celtic tiger period. However, because of the disastrous approach taken to housing in this country, whereby we let developers, speculators and banks dictate housing development, the housing sector collapsed, along with the rest of the economy and people fled out of construction sector and did not ever want to go back to it. A lot of them are now working as taxi drivers and so on because they did not want to go back into construction. The precariousness and lack of security in many of these areas are critical. In that context, we need a State construction company and our local authorities should be taking on apprentices to train in the areas we need. In this way, the local authorities will have the capacity to build, refurbish and do all of the other things local authorities do in terms of infrastructure. Lip service is now being paid to the need for apprentices and while some improvements have been made in terms of expanding the number of apprenticeship places, huge problems remain. Many apprentices are suffering extreme economic hardship. Many of them are older, with families, mortgages and other financial obligations. They have transport costs and have to pay â‚¬1,000 in fees. Those fees should be scrapped immediately. When they are going to college they do not have access to SUSI grants. They should have the same supports when they are in college as everybody else. Apprentices must also be given college places near where they live. If they are working and paying rent in Dublin but given a college place in Donegal, or vice versa, they may have to get digs and pay for transport to get there. Some apprentices may be getting the benefit of sectoral agreements so their pay is not too bad, but others are not. Mechanics, for example, are particularly poorly paid as apprentices because the sectoral agreements do not really work for them. In many parts of the country apprentices are on poverty wages. They are working for less than the minimum wage and do not have the supports necessary to carry them through. We need to provide those supports. We need to ensure that their college places are near where they live, get rid of fees and give SUSI supports to apprentices.
