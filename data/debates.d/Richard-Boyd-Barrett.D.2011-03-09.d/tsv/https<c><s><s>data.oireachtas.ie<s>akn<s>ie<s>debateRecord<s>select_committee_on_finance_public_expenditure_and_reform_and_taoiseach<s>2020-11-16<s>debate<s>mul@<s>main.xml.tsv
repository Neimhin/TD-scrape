RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am aware that over the four-year period and for the reasons set out by the Minister present, the tax liability of the people who availed of the PUP is probably not huge, as he has described it but I still think it is unfair. Frankly, it is meanspirited because the Minister has not taken into account that the people who were on PUP are the people largely who have economically suffered the most as a result of the pandemic. They are people who would otherwise have been earning. They are people who may have got into arrears in their rent or mortgages, or accumulated debts because they lost work. The Minister has stressed, in fact three times, that this was a very significant income support. Yes, but it was still an income drop for huge numbers. He said some people got more than they would have previously. For the very significant number of people who got it, this was a drop in their income and they were the people who were particularly hit by the pandemic. Think about taxi drivers, arts workers and bar workers. These are people who, even now, are suffering more than those who can work from home, who have not been significantly impacted and whose financial situation has not changed. Let us look at the stuff that came out from the Central Bank at the weekend about the fact that household net wealth has increased during the last period so some people are doing quite well in the pandemic because their income has remained the same and they have been able to save but there is a very significant group of people who, to a greater or lesser extent, have lost out significantly because of the pandemic. To just load this on top even though it is relatively small in the great scheme of things, and I accept that there is not going to be a water charge-style revolt over it, but is it not just a bit meanspirited for the people who have been impacted most, and will continue to be impacted most as long as the pandemic is with us? The Minister has said that this issue does not come under the same category as the exceptional needs payment even though it is under that category. One could not get a more strong example of exceptional than the current pandemic and the way it has impacted on very particular cohorts of people, and their ability to work at all or to earn an income. Frankly, it is meanspirited to do this. The Minister has been unable to give the figure here but I doubt if the revenue generated is a huge amount of money in the great scheme of things that have happened. Why be meanspirited when we are supposed to be all in this together? The people in here have not had their incomes impacted one jot but the people who have had to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment must now face a small additional tax liability even though they have been impacted. On that basis, the Minister should reconsider, in the spirit of "we are all in it together" and recognising that there are particular cohorts of people who have suffered dispropionately through this.Why add any additional financial liability to their situation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will comment first on the point about not looking back. The comparison Deputy Doherty makes is right. Let us consider Seamus Coffey's proposal relating to 80% or 100% tax relief on intangible assets. He said the companies should not have got 100% tax relief. He was referring to those big multinationals which benefited greatly from the reduction of 100% rather than 80%. The Minister refused to apply Seamus Coffey's proposal. If I remember correctly, it would have brought in €800 million in additional tax. That would have been a small drop in the ocean compared with the profits these companies are making. Essentially, the Minister refused to do what Seamus Coffey was proposing on the basis that it would be unfair and create uncertainty and so on. However, in this instance, the Minister believes it is fair to do this to people who have already been significantly and adversely hit as a result of the pandemic. The Minister did not really address this point. That is my central contention for why the Minister should not do what he is proposing to do. The vast majority of people who got the pandemic unemployment payment have lost out as a result of the pandemic. Even with the PUP, they have lost out. Otherwise, they would have been working and most of them would have been earning more.They would not have built up debts and so on to do with rent, mortgage arrears or other charges that will have accumulated while their income has been significantly reduced in many, and probably most, cases. Is it, therefore, not unfair and mean-spirited when huge swathes of the population and significant swathes of big businesses and so on have not been impacted at all and, in some cases, have done well? We will get onto our proposal for a Covid-19 solidarity tax shortly. It has been discussed actively across Europe for those who have actually done well out of the pandemic. In that context, is it not just mean-spirited, unfair and miserable to do this to the people who have been hit adversely and have lost out? The Minister proposes they will lose out a bit more, perhaps a significant amount more in some cases, according to Deputy Doherty's figures. Even if it is small, however, it is unfair because others have not lost out at all or have even done reasonably okay or very well during the pandemic. That is the unfairness and that is how it will be seen. I do not really see how the Minister can justify it in that context.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Between 70% and 80% of working people cannot afford the average house price on their incomes. That is a damning indictment of the Government's failure to solve society's most basic need, namely, to provide an affordable roof over someone's head, particularly for those who would expect that the fact they work hard and earn a living would give them an income sufficient to buy a home. The vast majority are not in a position to do so because successive Governments have messed up the housing sector badly. Since 2011, Governments have compounded that problem significantly. There are many elements to the outrageous scandal, which will go down in the history books as the greatest mistake any Irish Government ever made, of selling off all of NAMA's properties to developers who are now building shockingly overpriced housing, including at excessive rents, speculating and hoarding land to drive up prices. Given the abysmal failure to do the most basic thing, there are two ways to address this historic mistake and the crisis it has produced. The Government can try to find ways to give more public money to people to pay unaffordable and extortionate house prices, which is what this scheme does, benefiting only the people who are profiting from the dysfunctional housing sector. Alternatively, it can try to drive down the price of housing to affordable levels. The measure in the Bill is moving in the opposite direction from what is self-evidently what we must do, namely, driving down the cost of housing. I am convinced that this and the previous Governments have failed to deliver a clear definition of "affordable housing" and messed around with land development agencies and so on because of a fear that the State delivering affordable housing - in other words, housing that is not based on market prices but simply on making it affordable - would mess up the private developers. That is essentially why we have not developed affordable housing in places like Shanganagh and why there is a reluctance to define affordability or roll out affordable housing on scale. If the State built housing at cost and set prices at levels that were affordable for the average worker, it would effectively mean that private developers could not make a profit out of housing anymore because there would be housing at below the market price at which they could make a profit. In this sense, the Government continues to dance to the tune of the private developers, who are telling us straight that they cannot deliver housing at a price that is affordable. In order for them to be able to deliver housing at all, they have to charge high prices to give themselves their profit margins and cover site costs, marketing and so on. All of this has been well broken down by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and so on. Developers cannot deliver housing at anything like affordable levels. The State can and should, given that it can build on its own land on a not-for-profit basis. However, the State is reluctant to do so because it would mess up the private developers.Given that situation, we end up coming up with hare-brained schemes like this which do nothing to deal with the fundamental problem that we face. I refer to a massive shortage of affordable housing and a market which is dysfunctional and incapable of delivering to the vast majority of working people in this country. It is a retrograde scheme, it has done nothing to address the fundamentals of the housing crisis and it should be abandoned in favour of measures that are about actually delivering affordable housing. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The central point is that the problem we have is house prices are, in general, way beyond the affordability of the vast majority of working people. The fact that some people load themselves up with debt and take on mortgages that need an excessive proportion of their income to pay for accommodation does not mean that the system is good or working; it just means that people are desperate and overextend themselves. The truth is that people should not pay more than 25% to 30% of their incomes on accommodation costs. House prices, particularly in Dublin and some other large urban centres, are way in excess of that cost. People on average incomes are paying a much higher proportion of their incomes to try to pay for a home. All resources and initiatives of the Government should be put into making houses affordable. The Minister said that the initiative is not causing major inflation in the market, which is debatable, but even he is correct, it is doing nothing to bring house prices down to genuinely affordable levels. All the resources available to him and the Government should be used to do that. What we are actually doing is underpinning a massively inflated, unaffordable market. The Minister might argue that the Government policies are not driving up prices, but they are certainly doing nothing to drive them down. That is the problem. I will not get into the argument about the Oscar Traynor Road development in a major way but suffice it to say it is an absolute scandal that public land would be used in any shape or form to provide housing at current market levels rather than provide it on a not-for-profit level that is actually affordable or for social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I broadly echo the points made by Deputy O'Doherty. One further thing is that it is not just about supply. That is a point I have made repeatedly over recent years. I remind the committee, because this is a very important point, that even when we had record levels of supply in this country, when we were delivering 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year, they were unaffordable. They landed the country and the people in it in absolutely enormous debt. Even if one were to expand supply on a massive scale, therefore, our recent experience tells us that does not deliver affordability and in fact it can deliver the opposite. That is how distorted the market is, and that is because the market is operating on the principle of profit. We know, because the builders tell us, that they cannot deliver housing at anything remotely approximating affordability. They just cannot do it. That is the problem we have, and we intend to compound it by giving them public land on which to build more unaffordable housing. That really beggars belief and the Government will say, "We are getting 50% and, by the way, the Land Development Agency says 10% is the minimum". We may get more sometimes and we will get an undefined affordable proportion but then we will also have market-priced housing on public land that will contribute to an already unaffordable housing sector by any meaningful definition. I pose the same question to the Minister as Deputy Doherty did, but slightly more sharply. Is it not fair to say that 25 to 30% of average income is as much as anyone should spend on mortgage or rent?Is that a reasonable definition of affordability? If so, then we need to deliver housing at scale at that level, that is, housing that will only cost about 25% to 30% of average incomes in mortgage repayments or rent. Anything more than that is excessive, will overstretch people and is of no use in solving the current crisis. It simply serves to sustain private developers in business. They are not capable of delivering affordable housing, even if they wanted to, because of their costs and their need to make a profit. They just cannot do it so why on earth would the Government do anything to underpin or sustain what is a completely unaffordable and out-of-kilter housing sector? All resources, all land available to the State and all policy measures should be directed at delivering housing that is affordable, that is, social housing for those who could never hope to buy and affordable housing at prices that are affordable for ordinary working people. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 10, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:8. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the Help to Buy scheme which shall cover the following areas:(a) the impact on overall house prices of the scheme;(b) the impact on the profits in construction, banking, and other related property sectors;(c) other measures and interventions that may deliver affordable housing at a lower cost to householders and public funds.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I press the amendment, may I resubmit it on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do that to save time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is that changed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just to be strictly accurate, we had not concluded the discussion on the amendments to section 10.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just so it is clear-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that discussion is not concluded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like clarity.I am getting a little bit confused now. Section 11 is the section dealing with the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand then. I have tabled amendments, as has Deputy Doherty, on the Covid restrictions support scheme, which are not in this group of amendments. I do not understand this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am referring to amendment No.102 in the name of Deputy Doherty, and amendments Nos. 103 and 104, which are mine. They all deal with the Covid restrictions support scheme but they have not been referred to with regard to dealing with this section. I do not understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister will know, I have campaigned very strongly for people who work in the arts, music and live entertainment and for taxi drivers. These people had their incomes and employment possibilities virtually extinguished or dramatically reduced as a result of the Covid measures. This will continue as long as we have any form of restrictions at all. It is not only an issue under levels 3, 4 and 5, it also arises in the context of levels 1 and 2. Am I to understand that those without a premises cannot make claims, even if they are lone traders or self-employed in those, or similar, categories? Such people may have ongoing fixed costs but they do not have rateable premises and so, therefore, will not get this support. If that is the case, why? I would like clarity on that point. I echo the question asked as to why the Minister has chosen to provide this support as an advance tax credit rather than as a direct grant to cover costs. I am not sure why he would do this. In fact, it seems more complicated than a direct grant system. It is, arguably, more open to abuse. I am not sure why the Minister would do it this way. With regard to the amendments we have tabled, we obviously want to do everything possible and we support schemes that are about keeping employment going and ensuring that people have employment to go back to when restrictions are eased or are completely removed. We support the thrust of the scheme insofar as it benefits some businesses that have been carrying those costs. That was unsustainable and, as a consequence, they may have closed and jobs might have been lost. The objective behind the scheme is worthy.However, it is also the case that there needs to be oversight for companies that do not need the help or that are not, as a quid pro quo, treating and paying their employees properly or giving them proper conditions of employment. There must be some oversight to make sure that companies that refuse to recognise trade unions, for example, or that have substantial cash reserves and can well afford to cover some of their ongoing costs in these scenarios, are not benefiting from something they do not need. That is the logic of our other amendments in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am listening carefully to the debate and the answers given by the Minister. I want to give a special shout-out for the taxi drivers.I do not see why the scheme would not be made available to them. Estimates were done a couple of years ago that suggested a taxi driver, on average, carries fixed costs of approximately €11,000 a year. That varies and can be range anywhere between €4,000 and €11,000 or more for insurance, car maintenance, repayments, and fuel costs if taxis are on the road, although business is much diminished at the moment, but taxi drivers must carry these costs. Depending on the level of restriction, business is down between 70% and 80%. Taxi drivers do not have premises in a fixed location, although they are fixed in a county. A taxi driver is licensed to drive in Dublin or in a particular place so the business is geographically located but the car is the business premises. Taxi drivers tick all of the other boxes except the one for a premises and they are not getting the assistance that they need to cover their ongoing costs anywhere else. The only other grant that has been made available is a €1,000 restart grant when they return to work. That does not go anywhere near covering ongoing costs for the recent period and the debts they accumulated when they were either not working or there was no work, or covering on an ongoing basis the costs that they incur when they returned to work. Having talked to taxi drivers, such costs are in excess of what they are likely to earn on the road. They are probably losing money by being on the road at the moment. That is how badly hit the business is if taxi drivers have car repayments, fuel costs, maintenance costs and so on. I want to make a special plea to the Minister to include taxi drivers in this scheme because it would help some of them survive. In every other way taxi drivers tick the boxes that he is trying to tick and it would be unfair to exclude them. There are other areas that I am probably not as familiar with. Some people in the music, entertainment and arts industry will benefit from the scheme insofar as they have premises but many self-employed people and small business people in the sector do not have premises but they have significant ongoing costs, particularly repayments for equipment or the storage of equipment. These people are unable to earn an income because big events and the venues or premises that are supported by the scheme,are closed and, therefore, these people are not working in those premises or at the big events that might otherwise take place. The Minister should support and include these people in the scheme as well. On conditionality and so on, we do not want to in any way stand in the way of introducing measures that will keep people in a relationship with employment and maintain jobs during the pandemic so that those jobs are still there afterwards but there must be more oversight to make sure that the people who do not need this support, as they are making profits or have significant cash reserves and so on, are not benefiting from this scheme. The Minister is going to publish the names of the recipients on his Department's website. It might be useful, on an ongoing basis as a minimum, if he gave us some of the categories on a monthly or regular basis. Perhaps he might be able to outline some details of the 9,000 who have applied. What type of businesses are they? What do we know about those who are applying? What sectors are they from?There needs to be oversight to check that these are not companies which do not really need this support. Even if the Minister does not agree with all the conditions that we are trying to introduce in our amendment, there should be some mechanism to deal with companies which are treating workers badly, are actively anti-union, are based offshore, are playing fast and loose with the tax system or are very profitable and which should not be benefiting from the payment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter relating to the taxi drivers and a few other categories that have been mentioned. Deputy Doherty has pointed out that the flexibility available to businesses, the service industry and so on, may not be as available as one might think. They are closely linked to a premises that is closed. It is absolutely certain that there is no flexibility for the taxi drivers.The Minister only has to walk around the corner from the building he is in and along St. Stephen's Green to see the long line of taxis and how long they have been waiting there. That is in circumstances where only 20% or 30% of taxi drivers are even on the road. The rest are at home because there is not enough work. If they came out on the road, there would be a queue down to the Aviva Stadium because there is not the work. The lack of work available for drivers is directly related to the businesses the Government is supporting, and which I commend it on supporting, namely, hairdressers, arts venues and so on. While they remain closed or their ability to have custom is on the floor, as it will remain as a result of restrictions, the taxi drivers sitting at taxi ranks will have virtually no work.  On the allowance, I pay tribute to the taxi drivers for their campaigning but I acknowledge that the Government in the budget brought in some means for taxi drivers to earn without losing the PUP. The problem is there is no chance of them even earning €480 on the road at the moment because the work is not there. This is directly related to the closure of all the premises and businesses they are talking about because, to a substantial extent, their livelihood and incomes were dependent on taking people to and from those premises that are closed. They are organically linked to the sorts of businesses the Government wants to support. I urge the Government to include them in that remit. The Minister should accept that for taxi drivers, their car is their premises. It is linked to the counties the Minister is talking about. As the restrictions lift in particular counties, it would be easy to say certain taxis are associated with certain counties so there is no difficulty there. The cost of the premises is not as significant as the cost of a physical premises but these costs are every bit as real for taxi drivers. When there is virtually no income available to them on the road, they still have to make repayments on their car, pay their insurance and, while driving around desperately looking for passengers who are not there, they still have to pay for fuel. It would be a reasonable measure to prevent some of these men and women from going under by including them in the support scheme. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my case. I will not drag the matter out, but I want the Minister to think seriously about what I said. Many of the arguments I made on behalf of taxi drivers were against a background where it looked as if things were reopening, restrictions were lifting and, while work would be reduced significantly as long as there were any restrictions, there was some prospect of the industry beginning to operate at some level, albeit probably on a massively reduced basis. Now, however, business has decreased to nothing but those costs are still there. I really do not see why taxi drivers should be put in a different category from the businesses the Minister is trying to support. It seems that they tick all the boxes of those he is seeking to support, with the only difference being that their premises is a car, but it is their business premises. I do not think it would cost very much to support them. If a taxi driver's weekly turnover was €500 or €600 in 2019 and has been reduced to €150 or less, to give him or her 10% of last year's weekly turnover, at €50 or €60, it would make a big difference to the taxi driver and I do not think it would make a significant difference to the cost of the scheme. I ask the Minister to consider it because the welcome changes in the PUP will just not make a difference with the current level of restrictions and the other grand schemes that have been made available to small and medium business are not benefiting them. The only one they can apply for is the restart grant, and even then, there are limitations to being able to apply for it and, when someone goes from being unemployed to being back to work, €1,000 is nothing compared with the costs they are carrying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Chair provide clarity on the point the Deputy made about time? What time are we finishing the debate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 104 seeks to have a report produced within four weeks to see whether the Covid restrictions support scheme, whose objectives I broadly support, will provide support to the self-employed and lone traders in sectors such as the taxi industry, music, arts and live entertainment. I have made the argument and genuinely hope that the Minister will consider what I have said. I do not expect him to say anything now but it is simply unfair to leave the taxi drivers out of this scheme. There are people in arts, music and live entertainment who do not have a premises, per se, but whose entire livelihood has been significantly impacted and ability to work has ceased entirely. Many of them are still carrying costs during the pandemic. I do not see the rationale and I do not see too much at stake to justify the Minister not including those groups. I hope the Minister will reconsider these matters before Report Stage. At the very least, within a few weeks of this scheme passing into legislation, there should be a report to see how much trouble the groups who have effectively been left out of the scheme may be in and whether at that point the Minister will reconsider their exclusion. As I said, I hope he will reconsider before then but, in the absence of that, this amendment is to require a report on those sectors and groups within four weeks of the passing of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 104:In page 26, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:
"Report on accessibility of Covid Restriction Support Scheme
12. The Minister shall, within four weeks of the passing of this Act, produce a report on whether the Covid Restriction Support Scheme is accessible to, and has provided meaningful financial support for, self-employed/lone traders in sectors such as the taxi industry, music, arts, live entertainment and other similarly affected sectors.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 8 is our amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want clarity on that. Will our amendment No. 8 be taken tomorrow?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have discussed at length over the past number of years the section 481 tax relief. I want to thank the Minister for his genuine engagement on the issues I have raised over the past few years on behalf of film crew in particular working in the film industry but in terms of the issues I have highlighted there is still a long way to go to resolve them. I want to qualify my comments by saying that over recent years it has been a central part of our campaign in People Before Profit to increase overall funding to the arts. We would not want to see a penny less - in fact, we would like to see much more - put into the arts, music, live entertainment, film and so on to support those issues and because we have an immense pool of talent in this country.There is, however, a problem with section 481. On foot of the discussions we had, the Minister introduced a declaration that producer companies had to sign in which they committed to adhere to all of the relevant employment legislation and took direct responsibility for employment and training, as is required under the Taxes Consolidation Act to obtain section 481 relief for providing quality employment and training. Even as we speak, however, and despite the welcome reforms introduced by the Minister, these film producer companies are still claiming in cases before the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court that they are not the employer when people who worked on productions try to claim their employment rights.  I am amazed at how brazen they are that they continue to do this despite the undertaking the Minister requires them to sign which explicitly states that producer companies must take responsibility for employment and training to comply with EU directives and employment law. The Minister's declaration is detailed. It refers to the need for producer companies to comply with the terms of the Employment Acts, the Health and Safety Acts, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Employment Equality Acts, the Payment of Wages Act and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, as is right and proper, and EU law relating to collective agreements and all of these types of protections for workers. The declaration is very comprehensive and these producer companies that are getting in the region of €80 million per year in section 481 relief are signing these declarations and then going into the Labour Court and saying they are not the employer of the people who work on those film productions but that the designated activity company, DAC, is the employer. Even though they acknowledge in their submissions that the DAC is associated with them, they still claim they are not the employer and the people working for the DAC are not their employees but are the employees of the DAC. To refresh the Minister's memory on this, it is the producer company that applies for the tax relief, which is an advance payment, as he is aware. It is one of these unusual tax reliefs where the company gets the money up front. The producer company applies for section 481 and gets certified for it based on filling out one of these declarations. However, it then goes into the Labour Court and says it is not the employer and that the people working on the film production named in that declaration are not its employees but are employees of a DAC. Something must be done about this. To back up my argument, I will cite a case. I will not mention the film producer but it is a well known one that receives large amounts of section 481 every year. I have already referred to the Minister's declaration. In a submission to the Labour Court recently, the producer stated that certain claims were raised on behalf of a number of individuals who were previously engaged on productions associated with the respondent.It was claimed that neither the complainant nor any of the claimants were employees of the respondent. The submission went on to state that by way of background construction workers such as the complainant were engaged by designated activity companies set up specifically for each production if, and when, commissioned. It stated there were no employment contracts with the respondent and any employment relationship existed between the employee and the specific designated activity company. As such, each designated activity company was the employer and there was no continuity of service where an individual was employed by different designated activity companies. It is clear from submissions to the Labour Court that a producer company getting section 481 on the specific grounds it is responsible for employment is then going to the State bodies charged with ensuring workers' rights are upheld and stating it is not the employer. It is getting this money from the State on the basis it is the employer and it is solely responsible for the employees, and then it is going to the Labour Court and stating it is not the employer and that it has no responsibility for these employees. I appeal to the Minister to address this. I want to give him credit for attempting to address this, and he has brought in reforms, but these film producer companies are just not doing what he is asking them to do. The consequence is that laws that protect workers and the rights they have, not just under national law but under European law, particularly legislation on fixed-term workers and recognition of service and EU directives in this regard, is that fixed-term workers should not enjoy conditions less favourable than those employed on a permanent basis. These are just being flouted. These rights are not being acknowledged for these workers. As a consequence, the production companies that have employed them, in some cases for decades, can simply deny any connection with them and any employment relationship with them and, consequently, deny them their rights as employees under law. This is the case I really want the Minister to look at. I believe the Minister should proactively go out and have these matters investigated, and if it is found that companies are doing this, they should be told to stop and that they will not get the money unless they start to acknowledge they are the employers. If they continue in this manner of flouting the law on section 481, they should have the section 481 money taken off them or not given to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has referred to the WRC audit on the particular issue of employment contracts and the role of the designated activity company versus the producer company. The concluding section of that audit which was, I think, section 7, states "The WRC would urge that clarity in relation to this matter be provided". In other words, it acknowledged that there is not clarity around it. That is a nice way of responding to the fact that they were heavily lobbied by the producer companies to essentially not upset the apple cart, and to try to make an exceptional case for the film industry around its episodic nature and the role of the DACs. It is that lack of absolute clarity about the relationship between the DAC that is set up for the specific film and the producer company that applies to the Minister and the Government for section 481 relief. It is in that grey area that the producer company can then walk into the Labour Court or the WRC, even after this audit is produced, and say that it is not the employer. This matter cannot be resolved by a collective agreement because it needs to be clarified by the Government which gives out the relief and that is really the nub of the problem. I do not see how the Government does not understand this or frankly, even see how the WRC audit did not understand it.The declaration and undertaking the Minister put in place, on which I commend him, is black and white. It states:In providing those opportunities the companies hereby undertake that in the event that the application for certification of the film is successful, the companies shall as a condition of certification:[ ... ]2. be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall be solely responsible in law for the employment, remuneration, taxes, immigration and work permits of all personnel ... That is in the declaration they are required to sign, yet the Workplace Relations Commission audit states there is some sort of lack of clarity around this. The declaration states it is the responsibility of the producer company as well as the DAC. However, the producer company that applies to the Department for the relief and sets up the DAC then goes into the Labour Court or the WRC and says it is not the employer, the DAC is the employer and the producer company has no responsibility. In that context, it can then evade its specific responsibilities to apply the fixed-term workers legislation. I will read from clause 4 of the European Council directive from 1999 concerning the principle of non-discrimination. This is Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 which refers to period of service qualifications. It basically states the period of service qualifications for people on fixed-term contracts working in this kind of episodic employment should be no less favourable than those enjoyed by people in permanent employment. In other words, there is a recognition of service from project to project. To put it in simple terms, if a person worked for 20, 30 or 40 years for one of these producer companies which applies for tax relief - all this film production is funded largely by public money through section 481 - but did so through a myriad of different DACs set up by the company, that person should, as the EU directive sets out, have accumulated a period of service qualifications. His or her service in the industry for that employer should be recognised. In reality, however, the producer companies refuse to recognise the service of such people. Somebody who has worked for 25 or 30 years is treated as if he or she has been employed for the first time and was never employed by that producer company before. The producer company, therefore, has no obligations whatever to that person as an employee who worked for it for decades in many cases. This practice is occurring and the Government must address it by stating it will no longer tolerate it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unfortunately, it does not. The problem is that there cannot be a collective agreement, under law, if there is not an employer and an employee. It cannot happen. It has no legal basis. Any collective agreement without an employer and employee is meaningless. That solution is not possible. I will not mention a particular company that is involved. Even the workers who are in dispute with these companies want the film industry to work. Many of them are being blackballed, some because they raised these issues when they appeared before the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2018 and have not worked in the film industry since. Those people have had to take cases to the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission and, in some cases, have had their good names taken and so on because they have raised questions about who their employer is.  A discussion between a representative body of screen producers and one trade union is not a collective agreement because it is not between an employer and an employee. That is the only sort of collective agreement that has any standing. There must be an employer and an employee. The people who are getting the relief, the employers, are saying that they do not have any employees. How can a collective agreement exist, in that case? The Labour Court recently found on behalf of a worker in one case in terms of a breach of a collective agreement that had been agreed previously between workers and employers, but again the producer company, all of the time in receipt of section 481 relief, went into the Labour Court and stated it had no relationship with the worker. Even though that person worked on the film production, the producer company claimed to have no relationship with them and not to be their employer. It is absolutely unbelievable. The Minister mentioned Screen Producers Ireland. I understand that representatives of Screen Producers Ireland will give evidence in some cases to say that continuity of service cannot exist in the film industry and that the industry is just not like that. They gave that evidence when they appeared before the Oireachtas committee. They essentially argue that film is different and the sector cannot have practices such as acknowledgement of service. This all sounds technical but I will repeat that the net effect is that people who have worked in the industry for 20 and 30 years have no rights. They are like the dockers in Strumpet City who used to appear down at the docks, ask for a job and be told by the guy at the gate that he does not fancy employing them today.That is the level of rights people have in the film industry. It is totally unacceptable. We cannot have a meaningful agreement of any description until it is clear who is the employer and who is the employee. That should be the condition of receiving section 481 relief because that is what the law says it should be. This is the employer with no ambiguity and these are the employees. Then we can discuss collective agreements and all the rest of it.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Deputy Barry not here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No 126:In page 40, after line 35, to insert the following:22. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the revenue gained from increasing corporation tax to 25 percent for corporations with over €800,000 in profits and in closing loopholes that exist that allow corporations to hugely reduce their rate of tax.”. The basic point I would make to the Minister is that corporate profits have shot through the roof in the past seven or eight years. For example, in 2012 corporate pre-tax profits were €74 billion gross. In 2018 they were €182 billion, an increase in profits of more than 100%. That is an astronomical increase, and it happened during a period when Fine Gael was in various governments. I suspect those profits have continued to rise. We are always a bit behind in the declaration of corporate profits for tax purposes but some sectors have continued to make super profits. Many IT companies, which are among the largest companies responsible for those profits, and the pharmaceutical industry have made significant profits. I am sure when we see the figures for 2019 and 2020 we will see further increases.Those companies managed to reduce their tax liability through a whole series of deductions, reliefs and allowances. Of the €182 billion pre-tax gross profits in 2018, the taxable income was €96 billion. So nearly half of the profits that were made were not taxable because of reliefs and loopholes. If the 12.5% tax rate was applied to €182 billion we would receive in excess of €20 billion but instead we have just €10 billion for that year thus showing an effective tax rate of about 5.7%. The myriad loopholes, reliefs, allowances and so on means that they are not paying 12.5% and paying less than half. If that situation was unfair before now then it is even more unfair in the context of the pandemic when huge numbers of people are really suffering yet some of these companies continue to enjoy absolute super profits. Our contention is very simple. They should, as an absolute minimum, pay 12.5%. Indeed, Deputy Barry's motion goes a bit further by suggesting that the rate should be higher. We should also close the loopholes that allow companies to pay a fraction of the nominal rate of tax.
