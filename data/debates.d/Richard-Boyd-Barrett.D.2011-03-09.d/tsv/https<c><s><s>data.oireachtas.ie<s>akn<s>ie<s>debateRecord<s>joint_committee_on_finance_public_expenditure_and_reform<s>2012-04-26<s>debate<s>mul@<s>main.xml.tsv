RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It sounds like something we heard earlier.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has to do with the macroeconomic outlook.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, it is reasonable for us to ask people who are economists about the treaty, without them necessarily giving us their view, although I do not see why they should not give us their view.  It is also reasonable, based on the figures they are setting out up to 2015, to ask what the likely impact would be of specific measures on the figures they project for the year 2015.  They could reasonably give us an expert opinion on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever I may think of the analysis of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council it certainly helps to clarify some of the issues and I appreciate the work it has done.  Where do I start?  On the question of growth, is it fair to say there is a good cop bad cop routine going on between the witnesses and the Government in that the Government gives the optimistic scenarios and the witnesses give the more pessimistic scenarios and argue for heavier consolidation, that is more austerity, which makes the Government look good as if it is going a bit easier on us?  I want to question all of this.The witnesses' more pessimistic projections for growth are closer to reality.  I would not draw the same conclusions as they do on what comes out of this and I want to ask about growth projections.  I asked the witnesses about this on the previous occasion they came before the committee.  They are saying the growth outlook is uncertain and I certainly agree with this.  What is the basis for their outlook on growth?  I find it mysterious that we are downgrading our growth projections at present; the witnesses say the Government is too optimistic but everyone is downgrading the growth projections.  The witnesses were asked to what extent this has to do with austerity and they answered it is partly to do with austerity but it is also partly to do with external factors.  Are these external factors not to do with austerity also?  There is the austerity being imposed on the domestic economy, which is contracting growth here, and there is the austerity being imposed on the rest of European economy, which is contracting growth in Europe and consequently choking off the one area where we might hope to see growth which is through exports into our main trading partners in the eurozone.Will the witnesses comment specifically on the further dip in the British economy and what this means?  In the past week we have been told the British economy, our major trading partner, is dipping further into recession and that the contraction which started in the periphery of Europe is now spreading to the core.  What meaning is there to the resurgent growth projections we have for further down the line?  Against a background where growth is contracting and looks set to contract further, and growth projections in the short term are being downgraded, how mysterious are the witnesses' projections that growth will begin to pick up as we get a little bit further down the line towards 2013, 2014 and 2015?  If I am correct they have nominal GDP growth at 3.4% for 2013, 4.3% for 2014 and 4.5% for 2015.  How on earth can this happen against a background of a suffocated domestic economy here and a European economy that is contracting?  I just do not understand how they can make these projections.  This has big implications for all of the other debt and deficit issues.On the previous occasion I asked this question the witnesses said they base their projections on historical models.  What historical models?  To me it seems the historical model which applies to our current situation is the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s.  This did not have a textbook cycle; it was a long period of stagnation and contraction with a couple of blips upwards during it.  Effectively it was a crisis of more than 20 years.  Is this not the model that we are looking at and therefore are these projections indicating a significant pick-up in growth from 2013 onwards nothing more than fantasy?  I put this as a serious question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will carry on if I may.  On the question of consolidation, the witnesses are saying, particularly on foot of the fact they believe things are not as optimistic as they might be, that what we must do to get ourselves back to health is to cut the deficit and debt burden more sharply because debt is a drag on growth and we need to get back to balanced books, I presume to be ready to move forward at some stage.  Essentially it seems to me what they are really saying is that the Irish economy is just a little cork bobbing on the ocean of the European and global economy and somehow if we design the cork right we might lift with the tide at some point.  As I stated, I do not see from where the tide is coming.  Given they acknowledge the cuts and austerity have at least partially had an impact on the domestic economy, how can the sharper consolidation they propose have anything other than a seriously detrimental effect on the economy?I found Professor Barrett's comments extremely interesting, particularly that employment - which is a really meaningful index for ordinary people - will not pick up significantly unless there is a pick-up in the domestic economy.  Put another way, if we took the witnesses' advice and went for an even harsher consolidation then unemployment would be set to get worse.  The only thing that might counteract this are the projections about growth which, as I said, seem incredible.  If the witnesses' projections are wrong - and they say they are uncertain while I say they are incredible - then the net effect of taking their advice would be to decimate the sector of the economy which is capable of producing jobs.  This seems to be pretty awful advice.On the question of stimulus as the alternative to all of this, the witnesses state consolidation - that is austerity - and talk of stimulus in the same breath does not really add up except perhaps a little bit of targeted stimulus.  I agree with them and they are being more honest than the Government.  Their more general proposition that the two do not fit together is correct.  If that is true, does that not mean there is really no chance of any type of significant growth?  Growth can only be driven by investment.  Is not the background to the collapse of the Irish economy more meaningfully to do with the collapse of investment rather than deficit problems?  I will ask about the debt shortly.  In fact, are not the deficit and the debt problems to a large extent a result or consequence, not a cause, of the collapse in investment?  Is getting investment back into the economy not the key issue?  We have recapitalised the banks but banks, both here and in Europe, are not investing and there is not much private sector investment.  The only answer to that is to force the banks, who are holding the money, to invest in the economy and for the State to intervene directly and put in the investment that is necessary to move the economy forward.Finally, I take the point that the council cannot directly take a position on the fiscal treaty.  However, the members have presented themselves, if I am correct, as the debt and deficit guys.  Debt and deficits are basically what they analyse, as well as GDP figures and so forth.  They would, therefore, be fairly expert in this area, given that deficits and debt to GDP ratios are the two main issues raised in the treaty.  What is their expert opinion, based on the figures they have for the period up to and including 2015, of what will be the effect on our economy of reaching the targets?  I expect they could give those figures off the top of their heads, if they do not already have them.  If we must move from 3%, which is the Government's projection for 2015, to 0.5% based on a projected GDP of €170 billion at that stage, how many cuts does that mean?  One estimate is that €5 billion to €6 billion will be needed.  After we finish the EU-IMF programme, is it not the case that to meet those targets we will have to make another €5 billion to €6 billion in cuts or, as the witnesses call it, in consolidation?  If that is the case, that information must be put in the public domain.  Whether the witnesses like it or not, can we just get the figures from the experts on whether that is the case?  If the figures are slightly different, the witnesses should enlighten us.Similarly, on the debt to GDP ratio, the treaty requires that we reach a debt to GDP ratio of 60%.  The council's projections are that we will have a debt to GDP ratio of around 120%, possibly higher if growth projections do not pan out, in 2015.  Under the treaty, we will have to cut that by one-twentieth annually until we reach 60%.  If our debt to GDP ratio is the projected 120%, with a GDP of approximately €170 billion, it means we need approximately €100 billion or more of cuts over a 20 year period to meet the targets.  Is that not correct, roughly speaking?  It would amount to approximately €5 billion in adjustments and austerity cuts annually for 20 years so we can meet the targets.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but under the figures that have been set out that appears to be what would be required.  Would that not absolutely crucify the economy?  Perhaps the witnesses will spell out the position.We have just come from a vote in the House on a consolidation measure involving a cutback in lone parents' payments.  We need to know what quantum of adjustments, cuts, austerity or whatever the witnesses wish to call them will be required to meet these targets based on the figures and projections they have.  I would appreciate if they could provide that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not quite follow what Mr. Barnes is saying about the debt to GDP ratio.  The figures, depending on the growth, are that the debt to GDP ratio is around 115% or 124% if growth is weaker and 106% if growth is stronger.  Is that correct?  Let us call it in the region of 120%.  That is double the requirement of the treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is on page 32.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the gap.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the gap between the actual debt-to-GDP ratio and the target.  The reason I refer to page 32 is because three other scenarios are included thereon.  I presume the figure of 115% is the Government estimate, while the figures of 124% and 106% reflect what would be the outcomes were growth to be 1% weaker or stronger, respectively, than projected.  If one takes a figure of approximately 120%, which is roughly in the middle although I tend to think the outcome will be worse, that is double what is required under the treaty.  Is this not correct?  Moreover, is it not correct that we would be obliged to move to the 60% target within 20 years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is the gap.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even on bridging the gap from 120% to 60%, at one-twentieth per year, that comes to 5% of the gap.  Moreover, the gap is approximately €100 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If growth fell-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All that is predicated on the growth the fiscal council has projected.  I reiterate my question on whether this is credible.  Is it not possible, given the current trajectory of growth, which is towards contraction, that between now and 2015, the economies of Ireland and Europe will flat-line?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is putting it mildly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Briefly, on the basis of the projections provided by the fiscal advisory council, an adjustment of approximately €5 billion will be required in 2015 at least which, in addition to the deficit targets, could do such damage to the economy that all other bets would be off.  Conceivably, it could kill off growth altogether.  Is it not conceivable that even the council's most optimistic growth projections are off, given the current trajectory?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the insurance question, what would be the impact - I am asking for an economic rather than political assessment in this regard - on the European economy if we refuse to pay our debts?  If Europe kicked us out, what would happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With the permission of the Chair, may I ask a couple of questions?  These gentlemen come before us only every three or four months, and they are experts
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair and Senator Barrett.  Will someone confirm that what I think I see on page 32 is correct?  In a very helpful table on the impact of growth, it sets out the figures for growth of plus or minus 1% in each of the years to 2015, and what this would mean in terms of budgetary adjustments for each of the years.  Is it correct to say that if growth is 1% less per year than the Government projections, the extra adjustments, that is cuts, that will be required will be €2.3 billion in 2013; €1.1 billion in 2014; and €1 billion in 2015?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is additional cuts of €4 billion on top of the €8 billion in cuts that we are required to make.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that point.  Am I reading this correctly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In order to meet the troika's targets, if growth is 1% less than is currently projected, we would need an additional €8 billion of cuts in the next three years?  That is shocking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a supplementary question?  Is it not a very real possibility, one might even argue it is a likelihood, given the downward trajectory of growth projections that we will be wrong on the growth projections by 1%?  In that case, is the €8 billion of extra cuts over the next three years not a very real prospect?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even 1% lower.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Look at this graph.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is correct, I am sorry.  Yes it is €4.6 billion of additional adjustments.
