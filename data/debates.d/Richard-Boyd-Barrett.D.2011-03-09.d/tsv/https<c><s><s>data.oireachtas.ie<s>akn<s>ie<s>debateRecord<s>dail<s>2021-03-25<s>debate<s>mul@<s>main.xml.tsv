RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Residential Tenancies Bill is, for the most part, a deception and a fraud. It is an attempt to suggest the Government is trying to protect tenants in the midst of the Covid pandemic when, in reality, apart from a tiny cohort of tenants for whom protections will be extended, literally a few hundred tenants, the Government’s real intention is, as of 5 April, to allow vulture funds and landlords to evict people in the midst of a pandemic purely on the grounds that the 5 km rule has changed. That simple fact seems to escape Deputy McAuliffe and it seems to escape the Minister, despite the fact I have repeatedly cited for four years now, including on multiple occasions with the current Minister, the example of St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire. It is just one example of what happens when tenants are persecuted for profit by vulture funds and of the failure of the Government and successive Governments to put in place protections for those tenants, who have not done anything wrong.They have not committed anti-social behaviour and have always paid their rent. They simply have the misfortune to live in an apartment complex, many of them for up to 20 years, which was unloaded by NAMA into the hands of one vulture fund and then another, as happened with many properties across this city and country. These vulture funds have persecuted the tenants for profit and for no other reason. First, they tried to put up the rent by 60% but failed. Then they tried to evict tenants on the grounds of substantial refurbishment when, of course, there was no need to evict them to refurbish the complex. Next they tried to evict tenants en masse. Ten have effectively been driven out over two years, persecuted by anxiety and hardship. The funds then tried to evict the remaining ten tenants but luckily, they fell foul of the Tyrrellstown amendment. Weeks later, they came back and said that they could not evict ten tenants because of the Tyrrellstown amendment but would evict eight. It is not as if anybody believes that the other two evictions will not follow immediately afterwards, given that the fund tried to evict all tenants on two previous occasions. I went to the RTB with those residents on numerous occasions. The barrister representing Mill Street Projects Limited, the vulture fund involved here, said, "This is ugly. This isn't very pleasant but our owner has to maximise the value of the property". The fund has sat on the ten apartments from which it managed to drive tenants out, through sheer anxiety. Those apartments have been sitting empty for two years. As of 5 April, the remaining tenants will have ten days before they are evicted in the midst of a pandemic. The preamble to this Bill says that the Government does not want to worsen the public health situation and that evictions could contribute negatively to the transmission of Covid-19 and of course they could. That is absolutely right. These people will be, and some are already, knocking on the door of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and engaging with its homeless services. We are talking here about families and individuals, some of whom are pensioners but the Government is not protecting them, which is what it should be doing. Neither is it protecting thousands of others like them. The suggestion is that when the 5 km restriction is lifted, it will be easier for them to find alternative accommodation in south Dublin or even in Wicklow or Wexford at the rents they are currently paying, of approximately €1,000 per month. These rents are high but what will they go up to, given that average rents in the area are approximately €2,000 to €2,200 per month? Where are these people going to find somewhere to live? The Government is failing to protect them and many other tenants like them. It is not extending protections to such tenants. We have tabled amendments to the Bill that provide for Covid-related protections to be extended until April 2022 for all tenants who could face eviction through no fault of their own. We have no idea when this pandemic is going to end, particularly given the mess the Government is making of the vaccine roll out. Beyond that, and in the intervening period, our amendments provide that the Government starts protecting tenants, full stop. Why should vulture funds, under any circumstances, be able to evict people just because they want to increase the value of their property? They simply should not be able to do so. Tenants should have security of tenure. Funds can sell or refurbish properties with tenants in situ, which is standard practice across Europe. This Government is not willing to protect tenants because it has courted, facilitated and encouraged vulture funds and others who want to make profit from property, regardless of the human consequences for those who live in the property. It is absolutely disgusting, frankly, the stress and pressure that residents of St. Helen's Court have undergone for four years at the hands of vicious, ruthless, inhumane, profit-driven entities. These entities do not give a damn about human beings. I have asked this and previous Governments, again and again, to protect tenants like these but they simply will not do it. It is absolutely enraging, especially when the Minister has the cheek to come in here and suggest that this Bill is protecting a significant cohort of tenants. It will protect the few hundred who can jump through the hoops and show that they have suffered direct, Covid-related income loss and are on the PUP but the vast majority of people who could face eviction will not get any protection under this Bill and will potentially be thrown to the wolves on 5 April.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like the other Opposition parties, we have a series of amendments, which seek to extend considerably further the protections this Bill proposes to extend only until July. We have gone the furthest in saying they should be extended until April 2021 and I will explain why we think that is right. We also support all the other amendments that go considerably further than the Government. We also have amendments that oppose section 2 for the reasons that have been set out and explained by Threshold, namely, that this Bill in effect strips a cohort of people who enjoyed some protection of the protections they had under Covid. People Before Profit has tabled another amendment, which I believe is unique to us, to extend the protections to other cohorts of tenants whom we do not believe should be evicted in the midst of a pandemic on grounds of sale, refurbishment or any other grounds. That is the key. Others have called the Minister's defences "Orwellian". I have called it a deception and a fraud but we are all trying to get at the same thing. It is a deception and a fraud because the Government is presenting this Bill as if it protects tenants in the midst of Covid.In truth, it only extends protections to a tiny group for a few months. It is the Government's policy decision that as of 5 April, the green light has been given for the rest of those tenants to be evicted in the midst of a pandemic because it has not protected them in this Bill. That is the truth of what the Government is doing. I have tried to give the Minister the benefit of moving beyond politicking, abstract discussions to give real tangible examples. This debate really only means anything when one applies it to real tangible examples and, of course, that is the reason the Minister does not respond. Real people in St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire have notices which say they will be evicted ten days after the 5 km rule is lifted, which is likely to happen on 5 April. All those families and individuals have never engaged in antisocial behaviour, always paid their rent and are working people such as shop workers, carers, restaurant workers, pensioners and taxi drivers. They are people I know personally now because I have been fighting alongside them for four years against four successive attempts by ruthless, vicious vulture funds that are trying to drive them out of their apartment complex in central Dún Laoghaire. The Minister is not protecting them. That is the truth. They are out, and as a result, they are already engaging with homeless services, and because no council houses are available and approximately 4,000 families are on the housing list, they will be sent to emergency homeless accommodation unless they can get housing assistance payment, HAP. Rents in Dún Laoghaire, however, are now running at €2,000 to €2,200 and €2,400 for two and three bedroom apartments. Their current rents are approximately €1,000. How will they pay such rent? They cannot, so they will be homeless. What is the Minister going to do about it? The answer in this Bill is "Nothing". They will be knocking on the doors of homeless services. Some of them will be sent with their children into hostels in town in conditions that will make the transmission of Covid-19 more likely, which is precisely what the Minister said this Bill is designed to prevent. Therefore, even on public health grounds, never mind the need to protect tenants from ruthless operations such as Mill Street Projects Limited and Apollo Global Management, or whatever these wealth asset management speculators - these vicious, inhumane people - are called, the Minister is going to allow the green light for these people to be evicted. That is why it is a deception and fraud. We are asking, therefore, effectively to reimpose the blanket ban on evictions during a pandemic. In the meantime, we can discuss all the nuances for which the Minister is arguing. We can sort them out. He says it is more complicated and I agree; in some areas it is more complicated. Let us reimpose the blanket ban that actually protected people in the midst of a pandemic and then use that intervening period to do the more nuanced stuff, which the Minister said needs to be done. That is our argument. If the Minister wants to protect tenants in the midst of a pandemic - people who have done nothing wrong, are not antisocial, have not generated arrears through any fault of their own or have done nothing wrong as tenants - and that is his genuine intention, he will accept the amendments put forward by the Opposition. If he does not accept those amendments, he is, in fact, deceiving the public and this Bill is a fraud in terms of its claim to protect tenants during the pandemic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is talking down the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 16:In page 4, to delete lines 35 to 39 and substitute the following:"(i) specifies a termination notice that falls at any time during an emergency period, and(ii) cites as reason for the termination any of the grounds listed in section 34 of the Act of 2004.",".I know time is short and we want to vote on this and the issue in section 2. This is a specific amendment. Of course, the Minister did not respond to the point and I doubt he will but we will see. This seeks to extend the protections that the Bill would afford to other cohorts of tenants who have done nothing wrong and who should not be evicted in the midst of a pandemic. I have cited St. Helen's Court as a real human example. The vulture fund that owns St. Helen's Court also owns properties in Inchicore where it has been trying to evict people. It owns properties in Gardiner Street. Of course, vulture funds own many properties throughout the city and country. They are not the mom and pop landlords to which the Minister refers, and in any event whether they were or were not, these are people who have paid their rent and who are being evicted on grounds of sale or refurbishment. Here is an irony for the Minister. The tenants in St. Helen's Court would have been better off if they did not pay the rent over recent months. Many of them are on the pandemic unemployment payment. Many of them are in receipt of the housing assistance payment. As they are good conscientious tenants, they pay their rent to a landlord that is trying to kick them out purely for money and the Minister refuses to protect them. The amendment asks the Minister, if he is serious about protecting tenants from unfair evictions and evictions that are not their fault in the midst of a pandemic, to please protect tenants such as these who, in this case, have a letter that states that as soon as the 5 km restriction is lifted they will be gone in ten days. Then they will be told by emergency services that they do not have council houses for them, that the housing assistance payment limit is too low to allow them to rent the property that is available in the area, which is €2,000 or €2,200, and that there is nothing for them but an address for a hostel in town where they can take themselves and their children. It is straightforward. If the Minister is serious about protecting these tenants will he please accept the amendment?
