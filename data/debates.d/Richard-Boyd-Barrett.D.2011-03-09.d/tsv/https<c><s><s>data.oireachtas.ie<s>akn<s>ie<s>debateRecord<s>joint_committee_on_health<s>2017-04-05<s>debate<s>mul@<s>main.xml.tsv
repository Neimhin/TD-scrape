RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will ask Deputy Kenny, as the politico here, to respond to this question. Does he believe there has been an attempt to throw mud in the eyes of the members of the public on the real import and purpose of this Bill? I believe there has, but I am interested to hear Deputy Kenny's response. I would describe Deputy O'Connell's intervention as nothing short of a hatchet job and a gross misrepresentation, but I will ask the question of Deputy Kenny. I will not ask the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, she made these allegations and then left, which is telling in and of itself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, she was at the committee-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Senator Mullen just made comments about people's political background.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just asking Deputy Kenny whether he believes the Bill has been misrepresented because I believe it has. It is entirely legitimate for me to comment on something that happened at this committee meeting. If the person who made those comments has left, that is her problem. It is entirely legitimate to respond to issues that were discussed as part of this committee meeting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, absolutely, but a suggestion was made that the Bill was immoral in its import, which is an extraordinary statement to make. What is Deputy Kenny's view of comments to the effect that the Bill is immoral and so on? As I understand the Bill, and I have read it, it explicitly states that it will be an offence for people to use cannabis-based products other than on the grounds set out in the Bill. Can Deputy Kenny confirm that? There has been an attempt to suggest that somehow this Bill is a back door for recreational use when, for example, section 14 specifically refers to the prohibition of unlicensed sale of cannabis for medicinal use and the prohibition of unlicensed transportation of cannabis and that all of those things will be offences. Is it not clear that providing for the medicinal use of cannabis, as recommended by a doctor and only when recommended by a doctor, is the purpose of this Bill? That is my first question. Second, much of the muddying of the waters in terms of the Bill centred around the question of possible side effects and unintended consequences, the leakage effect and so on. My question is to the experts. What is their opinion of the potential of all of those to happen with existing drugs, even drugs sold over the counter? For example, Solpadeine, which is sold over the counter, has serious side effects and the potential for addiction, misuse and so on yet that product is authorised. There is also a range of other drugs like anti-depressants and so on which we know are misused on quite a wide scale and potentially have serious side effects. Is there any reason to believe that there should be a different set of criteria and a higher bar set for cannabis based medicinal products than for those drugs that are already sold either over the counter and have not been authorised or that are sold on the basis of people having a prescription? Is there any reason to believe that a higher bar should be set for cannabis-based products? Do the witnesses know of any authorised products that a general practitioner, GP, cannot currently prescribe and that only a consultant can prescribe? They might tell me what those products are because there seems to be a suggestion here that it is somehow legitimate to say that for cannabis-based medicine we have to have a consultant but for all sorts of other medicines a GP's prescription is fine. As we know, in the case of Vera Twomey, a GP has prescribed it for her daughter but the legal position is such that that GP's prescription is not good enough, given the legal set up here. For the benefit of the public and for the committee, will the witnesses tell us whether this bar in terms of a consultant having to prescribe applies to any other medicine? With regard to the HPRA report, does Dr. O'Grady find it surprising that there is direct conflict between what it says about cannabis-based products and what Professor Barnes says? The report says that to date, there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the efficacy of cannabis products. Professor Barnes says the opposite, namely, that they have "found good evidence for one or more of the cannabis products or 'natural' cannabis in the management of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain; spasticity; nausea and vomiting, particularly in the context of chemotherapy; and in the management of anxiety". He goes on to say: "We have found moderate evidence in sleep disorders; appetite stimulation in the context of chemotherapy; fibromyalgia; post-traumatic stress disorder", and some evidence in dementia, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, childhood epilepsy, bladder dysfunction, Tourette's syndrome and so on. He goes on to say that we need more research in those areas. Does Dr. O'Grady have any comment on that contradiction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I stopped my contribution because I knew Dr. O'Grady was in a rush. It has been stated that there is evidence that where medicinal cannabis is made available, it has an impact on the use of other drugs and there is some evidence that use of benzodiazepines, opiates and so on has reduced where that is the case. Do the companies that manufacture those products feel threatened by medicinal cannabis being made available and potentially substituting for their products given there is evidence that such substitution is happening?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the purpose of clarity, I suppose, for anybody looking in on this debate, the herbal product is available in other jurisdictions and approved and authorised and can be made available through prescription in other jurisdictions. Maybe the speakers could confirm that. It is my understanding that it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Bill seeks to allow for that. I am not just referring to the limited number of herbal products - I believe it is one - that are available in Ireland. It has components of cannabis but is not the entire product. I wish to ask Professor Finn about something. As someone who is involved in the pain area via an organisation named-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not Professor Finn's job to be political, but is he surprised that pain has been left out of the recommendation of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, or that it suggested that there was not much evidence of this product's efficacy when Professor Michael Barnes says the opposite? Professor Barnes seems to suggest that the highest level of evidence concerns pain and that there is less evidence of its efficacy for some of the recommended conditions on the HPRA's restrictive list. I find that odd. Does Professor Finn? I have a supplementary question on the comparison between cannabis and other products for pain and conditions for which cannabis may be, or is evidentially, beneficial and how the two are treated in law and in this debate. Has Professor Finn a comment on this matter? Would it be fair to say that almost all, or certainly the vast majority, of approved drugs for pain and almost every other condition have significant, even severe, side effects in some or a large number of cases, yet they are authorised nonetheless? Is there evidence to suggest that any of those side effects is more dangerous in cannabis than drugs that are currently available over the counter or on prescription? Would Professor Finn go so far as to say that the evidence suggests that, while cannabis has some side effects, they are generally not as severe or dangerous?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not want it for its psychoactive properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This relates to research and not to use. The specific sections the Chairman has mentioned state that if there is a research institute, that research institute would look into both the medicinal and recreational use and would look at research being done in both of those areas in other countries. It is important to say that. We could have a debate on Committee Stage as to whether the research institute should look into recreational use at all. Certainly, there will be debate outside. Professor Finn might have an opinion on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very simple. Without a certificate from a doctor giving the right to use medicinal cannabis, a person will be committing an offence. That is what the Bill stipulates. Nothing has changed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is regardless of what form that medicinal cannabis takes. Possession of the vape form, tablet form or herbal form will be an offence without possession of a certificate provided by a doctor recommending the use of that product for that specific person.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I am with Deputy Durkan and I do not have the certificate and I am using his medicinal cannabis for which he has a certificate, I will be guilty of an offence, but he will not because he has a certificate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pharmacies throughout the country dispense methadone, which is a very dangerous drug. It is highly illegal for anybody to have possession of methadone that is not prescribed and given out under controlled conditions by pharmacies. Is it enforced well? How is it enforced? We know there is leakage with methadone that gets sold on in the black market and so on. That could be just as easily applied. It would probably be a more serious proposition to say we need better enforcement of that. Nonetheless that happens now with methadone. I believe we should not create a higher bar for medicinal cannabis, which can help sufferers, than we would provide for methadone, which is being done currently. Why provide a higher bar?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That product may be medicinal cannabis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At some point it will be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish something would.
