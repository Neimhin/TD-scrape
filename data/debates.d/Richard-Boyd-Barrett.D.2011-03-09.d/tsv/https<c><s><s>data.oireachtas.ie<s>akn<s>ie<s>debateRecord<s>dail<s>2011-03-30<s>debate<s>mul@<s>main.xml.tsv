RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach agree that while the idea of social partnership sounds like a good and fair idea, the reality of social partnership during the past 20 or 30 years has favoured employers and the wealthy over workers to a great extent?  For example, the Taoiseach may or may not be aware of the share of national wealth that has gone to wages and salaries as against the share that has gone to profits, shares and bonuses.  There has been a 10% shift in the share to the latter from the former.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the facts suggest that social partnership has been a means to transfer wealth from working people to the wealthy in our society?  There seems to be a suggestion in the Taoiseach's comments that we should move away from the existing model of social partnership to what he terms "social dialogue" and that a key objective in doing this should be to reverse that situation.  In this regard, I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a dispute currently taking place in Dún Laoghaire, now almost entering its first full year of industrial action.  Workers in a shoe shop, Connolly Shoes, some of whom have worked there for 38 years, have been unceremoniously sacked because they refused to accept swingeing cuts in their pay and conditions.  They have simply requested consultation on these issues but have been left out on the street.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has a more general point or question to it.  Does the Taoiseach see it as his objective to change a situation whereby an employer could do this to workers, some of whom have worked for 38 years in a shoe shop, serving the people?  This could happen and other employers could develop the confidence to do this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we not enact legislation which will ensure that workers cannot be treated like this by their employers?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will examine that particular instance.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you, Chairman.One of the Government spokespersons described the USC as an anomaly and said it was not perfect.  That is an unbelievable understatement in view of the reality of the USC.  I hope it is not, but I fear it is, an indication of a lack of intention on the part of the Government to reverse the charge, perhaps watering it down or diluting it instead.  The USC is not an anomaly; it is not simply imperfect.  It is a disgusting attack on low- and middle-income families carried out by a now thankfully discredited Government, on whom ordinary people rightly took their revenge in the recent election.  This attack is now threatening to put tens of thousands of ordinary working people under — people who are unable to pay their bills or meet their mortgage repayments and who are really struggling.  They are in no way responsible for the economic crisis, but they are being asked to pay for it.As well as being an anti-social charge, it is a bankers' tax.  It was the decision of the last Government to cold-bloodedly transfer responsibility for the banking crisis created by it and its banker and speculator friends on to the backs of working people.  That was a choice it made, as a number of other people have said.Some of the facts about the USC are truly shocking.  The UNITE trade union, using the Deloitte tax calculator, unearthed the fact that those who earn more than €1 million per year will be €24,000 better off as a result of this charge, while ordinary working families will lose hundreds.  The ESRI estimates that there will be no wage growth in the economy next year, but non-wage income — rents, dividends, interest and self-employment — will grow by 29%.  The shocking fact revealed in the Sunday Independent  rich list was that the richest few hundred people in this country are €6.7 billion richer this year than they were last year.  We have taken from the poor to protect the rich.  That is what the last Government did and, sadly, this Government is beginning to look very lukewarm about reversing it.I have proposals for the Government, because I do not intend only to be critical.  If it is serious in its sentiments of concern about the injustice of the USC, not to mention its economic counter-productiveness in sucking money from the pockets of people who could spend it, I suggest that it completely scrap the charge and institute a 1% — I would like to see 5%, but I will settle for 1% — wealth tax on the assets of people who have assets of more than €1 million.  That would yield, even based on the most conservative estimates, €1.2 billion, which is nearly three times what the USC has earned for the State.  Could we have a tax of just 1% on the wealthiest people instead of the USC?  If the Government is serious, it will consider that.  I would like to see higher wealth taxes to help reverse all the other cuts, but I ask it to commit just to that simple thing — a 1% tax on the richest people to remove the injustice of the USC.  That is the sort of commitment the Government should give tonight.
