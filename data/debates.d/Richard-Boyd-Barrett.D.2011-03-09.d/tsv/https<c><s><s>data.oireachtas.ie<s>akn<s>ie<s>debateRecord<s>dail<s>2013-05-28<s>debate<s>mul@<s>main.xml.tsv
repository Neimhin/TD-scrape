RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The troika is not an excuse for this kind of thing. The troika documents are littered with talk of structural reform and I simply cannot discern how either the Minister of State or the troika could possibly justify these cuts, which will have an adverse impact on the ability of the State to educate and retrain people, particularly those in the further education sector who are among those least well-served by the mainstream education system. Moreover, alleviation is not enough because it was implied that changing the teacher-pupil ratio from 1:17 to 1:19 simply would mean two additional people in a class. However, as the Minister of State is aware and as those who are involved in the sector have made clear, that is not the impact. Potentially, up to 500 teaching posts will be lost because people work part-time on a rota basis and so on and this could mean whole swathes of courses will be wiped out. As the Minister of State has acknowledged, many schools already are enrolling student numbers well over the caps and were under-resourced even before these cuts came in. Consequently, the impact on the capacity of the sector to provide a service to those who need it most and to sectors of Irish society that need it most in the current economic climate will be extremely significant. This simply cannot be justified and alleviation is not enough. These cuts must be reversed because there is simply no justification or rationale for them.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach not believe it is time to end the cover-up in which he and his spin doctors are engaged over the growing scandal of corporation tax avoidance by multinationals? Is it not a fact that he is trying to throw mud in the eyes of the public, Deputies and his European partners in a way that will do immense damage to the international reputation about which, as he has told us many times, he cares so much? The facts are coming out. As some of us have asserted for some time, as has become apparent to our European partners, as was put to the Taoiseach at the European Council meeting and as has been discussed in the US Senate, Ireland is a tax haven and is facilitating a staggering level of tax dodging by significantly wealthy multinationals. The latest evidence came today. Abbott Laboratories Ireland Limited, a company registered in Ireland, made €1.8 billion in profit but paid 0% in tax. If it had paid 12.5%, we would have received €235 million, almost as much as the Government is planning to take out of the pockets of public sector workers. If Apple had paid 12.5%, we would have received more than €2 billion for the Exchequer. All we get, however, is sleight of hand whereby the Taoiseach claims that our rules are different because a company must be controlled and managed in Ireland. With a nod and a wink, we have agreed this little trick with the multinationals. Our light-touch corporate tax rules allow them to dodge billions or tens of billions of euro in corporate tax obligations at the expense of the taxpayer, who is being savaged by austerity, at the expense of tax fairness and tax justice across the world and at the expense of Ireland's international reputation. After what happened at the European Council meeting and the US Senate and given the emerging facts, does the Taoiseach not believe it is time to end the cover-up and to stop prostituting Ireland's tax system for the benefit of multinational corporations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It fulfils all the criteria to prove that we are a tax haven.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The facts speak for themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Zero tax is paid by Apple.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not according to the EU.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is going to blow up in our face.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed. I do not believe the Bill should be in front of the House. It is a disgrace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No vote was taken and no proposal or question was put to the House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. The Acting Chairman just asked the Minister to move it and asked the House to agree and I am saying I do not agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a disgraceful attempt to intimidate public sector workers and bully them into accepting the Minister's pay cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The manner and context in which this legislation is being introduced is utterly wrong and unacceptable. This Bill is an attempt to pre-empt and subvert the democratic decision of public sector workers to reject the Government's attempt to impose further cuts in their pay and conditions. It shows the Government was not acting in good faith in the negotiations. While it showed a willingness to negotiate, it also put a gun to the heads of public servants by giving itself the power to impose whatever measures it wished on them. If it had negotiated with or dealt with public sector workers in good faith, none of this would have been necessary because the original Croke Park agreement was supposed to run until the middle of 2014. It broke faith with public sector workers in the first instance by seeking a new deal. Subsequently, public sector workers rejected a second deal in a democratic ballot, despite the brow-beating and threats deployed by the Government and certain trade union leaders as they sought to force workers to accept further attacks on their pay and conditions. The Government did not accept that decision and has decided instead to ram through this legislation in an attempt to pre-empt another vote. This appears to be a sinister, pincer movement by the Government, on the one hand, and sections of the trade union movement, on the other. Its aim is to demoralise ordinary workers and force through a further attack on them as quickly as possible before people's feet have even touched the ground. That is utterly reprehensible. Despite what the Minister, Deputy Howlin, stated with regard to the arrangements with the troika, it is simply not true that there are no alternatives to doing what is proposed. Some of us on this side of the House have pointed out on numerous occasions that there are fairer alternatives to attacking public sector employees, low and middle income workers in general, the unemployed and the vulnerable. In the past week or two the evidence relating to those alternatives has been presented to us. For example, one of today's newspapers outlines how if one firm, Abbott Laboratories, had paid the 12.5% tax the Government claims to impose on the profits of corporations, it would have been obliged to hand over in excess of €200 million in tax. However, that firm actually paid 0% tax. We have discovered that Apple, with €22 billion in profits, only paid 0.5% tax. Other companies on the relevant list, such as Google and Facebook, pay pitiful amounts in tax. Instead of taking a little more in tax from these staggeringly wealthy corporations, the Government is intent on inflicting further suffering on ordinary workers, imposing more cuts on their incomes and reducing their quality of life to an even greater degree. These people have been hammered during the past five years and, as a result of this legislation, they will not receive a pay increase for the next eight years. What is proposed is despicable and undemocratic and it should be resisted.
