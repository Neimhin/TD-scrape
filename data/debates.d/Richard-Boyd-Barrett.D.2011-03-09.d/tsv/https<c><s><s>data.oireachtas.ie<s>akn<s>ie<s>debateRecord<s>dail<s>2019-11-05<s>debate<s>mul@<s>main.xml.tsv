RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The credibility of this House, and of politics generally, has been seriously called into question by the "votegate" and "fobgate" scandals. Something that gives rise to even more serious questions about the goings on in this House is that more than 50 Opposition Bills passed by a majority of Dáil Éireann, in some cases more than once, have been blocked, effectively sabotaged, by the use of the money message. People Before Profit and Solidarity have time to put forward motions. We have that time very rarely and the next occasion on which we will have it will be tomorrow. Some 11 days ago, we submitted a motion to change Standing Orders, the rules of this House, in order to remove this blockage in respect of all the Bills to which I refer and allow them to continue their passage through the House. Last night, however, we received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle in which it is stated that we would not even be allowed to have our motion put on the Order Paper, never mind having it debated or voted upon. The Constitution states, "each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders". We are allowed - and it is one of the few things it seems we are allowed to do in this House - to put forward motions to change our own rules. We have put forward a motion to change the rules regarding money messages. In that motion, we made it absolutely clear that we respect the constitutional provision that prevents Opposition Deputies, anybody but the Government, proposing a Bill seeking to appropriate or spend public money. That is stated in the motion. The motion also states that other Bills that do not involve the spending of public money or any attempt to seek to tax anybody should not be blocked by the money-message procedure and that the rules should be changed accordingly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We believe that this is an unprecedented situation. It is suggested in the Ceann Comhairle's letter that we should change our motion. As an Opposition party, we have the right to put forward motions. We received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle in which he states that if we change the wording of the motion, it will be acceptable. I just cannot believe that. We have the right to put forward motions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Constitution states that we have the right to put forward motions regarding the rules of this House. We are most strongly objecting to sabotage of the democratic process in this regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want the right to put forward our motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The salient rulings and conventions, as the Ceann Comhairle refers to, are clear on this. Salient ruling 258 states-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on. People need to know this. Salient ruling 258 states, "It is not a function of Chair to interpret Bills, Acts or the Constitution". Salient Ruling 259 states, "Chair does not rule on the constitutionality of any measure coming before the House — this is a matter for the courts". That could not be clearer. What the Ceann Comhairle has stated in his letter is that he is choosing to interpret our motion as possibly infringing on the Constitution, when in fact our motion explicitly states it respects the constitutional provision the Ceann Comhairle refers to that seeks to change the Standing Orders of the House, which the Constitution allows us to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are now in uncharted territory because the Ceann Comhairle is now saying that a motion, which we submitted 11 days ago, which the Ceann Comhairle now will not allow on the Order Paper, and which is due to be debated in the Dáil tomorrow, cannot be moved by us, debated or voted upon. That is absolutely sabotaging the right of Deputies to put forward motions in this House. That is totally unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This House has the right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the point when we cannot pass laws?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This ruling is infringing the Constitution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Article 15 of the Constitution?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Article 15.10 of the Constitution?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, can you please explain to me how your ruling is not conflicting with Article 15.10 of the Constitution that states: "Each House shall make its own rules and standing orders"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are saying we are not allowed to do that and that you can decide the House is not allowed to do what the Constitution says it is allowed to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not. I am asking you to explain that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not being obstructive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our motion is being obstructed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can you explain that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not accepting the Order of Business for Wednesday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are we supposed to do with our time if we are not allowed to put our motion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is unbelievable. It has never ever happened.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rules of this House do not infringe on the Constitution in any shape or form.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This advice is based on what Bills could hypothetically do, not on the motion itself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is interesting that this was not mentioned on the Order of Business, by the way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We cannot vote on a motion that is not on the Order Paper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Ceann Comhairle that I really think this place has brought itself into-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely despicable what is going on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Things are being done here that have never been done before to scupper the voice of elected representatives and to gag this House from its constitutional right-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----which was set out in article-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the point-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rules are being made up as we go along.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are making them up-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in order to scupper the rights of elected representatives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For what?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For what? What is the point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the point of this charade if rules cast by a majority of Members cannot proceed through the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The House is being disrupted by the fact that we are not allowed to put a motion-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You might as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Vótáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The housing crisis has reached absolutely dire proportions and, to be frank, in my part of Dublin it is getting worse every day. There are many reasons for this but one is the failure to put in place the necessary infrastructure in order to develop public lands for social and affordable housing. Our representatives on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have discovered something that I suspect is the case right across the country. Of seven major sites in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown that were identified in 2016 and zoned for public and affordable housing, only one has been progressed in any way, although no bricks have been laid. Nothing has been built. Six of those sites, or the overwhelming majority, have problems arising from infrastructure, with much of these down to Irish Water not putting in the required water infrastructure. Nothing has moved, houses have not been built and the housing crisis gets worse. Perhaps the Government is hoping the private sector will come in to save the day but it was also reported in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown that the amount from planning fees coming from the private sector has reduced in 2019. That means the private sector is doing less building and the expectation is the amount gained from these fees will reduce further in 2020. The private sector is slowing down in terms of housing delivery in a key part of Dublin that is affected by the housing crisis. It is very likely that this is also happening in many other parts of Dublin and elsewhere. Public land zoned for housing development is not seeing any activity because of a lack of infrastructure. Is the Taoiseach concerned about that or does he have an explanation? Is this indicative of a failure in the Government's policy for delivering the necessary infrastructure for housing and the affordable housing we so desperately need to address the housing crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach not think he should apologise for trivialising the issue of the climate emergency by making those comments? It really gives succour to climate deniers like Donald Trump to make glib trivialising comments of that sort. It would be helpful if the Taoiseach said they were comments he regretted. I question the Taoiseach's more general bona fides on this given the continued commitment to go ahead with the liquefied natural gas terminal in Shannon, which is going to import toxic fracked gas from the United States. It is okay to ban fracking here, and rightly so, because of the damage it does to the environment, but we have no problem with visiting it on the people of the United States.I also want to ask about public transport and the Government's commitments in that regard. We have been holding a series of meetings on BusConnects over the last while and when one looks into the facts of public transport in this country, one really has to wonder about the Government's commitment to getting people out of their cars. How does improving public transport square with the fact that bus fares in the last ten years have increased by 80%, the PSO subsidy to Dublin Bus has dropped dramatically from €87 million to €50 million and there are now fewer buses in the Dublin Bus fleet than in 2008? How do these stark facts about the poor state of our public transport system, which is one of the most costly in Europe in terms of fares, square with a commitment to improving public transport in order to get people out of private cars and thus reduce CO² emissions? I put it to the Taoiseach that they do not; they square more with a privatisation of public transport agenda which will do nothing to reduce CO² emissions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Time is running out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not of this time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise in advance for the fact that I will have to leave before I can hear the Taoiseach's answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know. I just wanted to say that I am not being rude but must leave to take a call. I propose that the Taoiseach take the issue of disability under his Department's remit. Disability advocacy groups and service users have been calling for this for some time. The UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disability, UNCRPD, has been ratified, although the Government notably opted out of the optional protocol which would make it legally accountable for ensuring equality for people with disabilities. This is important because the equality that people with disabilities should have under law due to the UNCRPD is not being delivered. One of the reasons is that the issue is spread across a series of Departments and areas, including housing, health, planning, transport, jobs and enterprise, and so on. Nobody is responsible for ensuring that a huge cohort of our citizens have the equality to which they are legally entitled. I suggest that the Taoiseach take the issue of disability under his remit. I will listen back to his answer later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The income thresholds for affordable housing must be established clearly. Certainly, what the Minister has said to date indicates that there are huge numbers of people we cannot identify or say how they will access affordable housing. The Minister promised a review of the income thresholds for social housing. When will that review take place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were told the Enniskerry site would commence two years ago but it still has not commenced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Due to the fact that the Minister is linking affordability to market and cost issues, people on low incomes will not be able to afford these houses, in particular in areas like mine where market prices are very high. Given the income thresholds for social housing, thousands of people are having their hopes and dreams, to use the Minister's phrase of earlier, dashed because they are being thrown off housing lists after years of waiting when their incomes marginally exceed the income threshold whether temporarily or simply on foot of the lapse of time. When they are thrown off the housing list, they may lose ten, 15 or even 20 years of waiting time while their incomes still mean they do not have a prayer of buying or renting anything in their area and cannot expect that the affordable housing, which has yet to appear but which the Minister promises will come, will ever be affordable to them. What does he say to those people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought we had a second round of supplementary questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We usually do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rules do not seem to be working very well for some of us.
