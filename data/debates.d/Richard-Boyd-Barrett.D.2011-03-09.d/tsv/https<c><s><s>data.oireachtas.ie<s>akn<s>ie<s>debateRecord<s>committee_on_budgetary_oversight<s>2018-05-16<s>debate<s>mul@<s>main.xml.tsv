RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the last point made by Mr. Coffey because it deals with one of the issues I wanted to raise with him. Is the intangible assets issue not a big scam in the light of the higher contributions the Irish people have to pay to the European Union? As stated by Mr. Coffey, companies get to write off gross profits resulting from these intangible assets as an allowance. They can effectively name their own price for these assets. Is it not the case that they are paying one of their own subsidiaries for the assets such that whatever profits they make they set as the price tag for their use?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what they do. They make up the price.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How are the assets valued?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They can put any value they like on them. It appears that the value they put on them is just enough to make sure they do not pay any tax. Effectively, they write their own tax bills, but we then make additional EU contributions which are based on gross trading profits, rather than taxable income which is zero.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will agree to disagree with Mr. Coffey on the first point. This is akin to Richard Boyd Barrett setting up a company and then setting up a subsidiary and calling it Richard Boyd Barrett 2, following which one charges the other for the brilliant idea and claims a tax deduction on the basis of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	God help us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will move on from that issue. I thank Mr. Coffey for the graph which is very helpful in getting to the heart of matters. Even if I do not always agree with his interpretation of the facts, I thank him for setting them out. For me, the big issue is the spectacular rise in gross trading profits we have witnessed in recent years and which doubled between 2011 and 2015. To me, the dirty big secret of the Irish economic story is the spectacular rise in profits during many of the years when the country was on its knees and crippled by austerity.We have been calling for a minimum effective corporation tax rate at least since 2012 because of the enormous gap between gross trading profits and corporation tax yield. When the revenue figure of €6 billion is compared to €144 million paid in corporation tax, it equates to a tax rate of 4.5% approximately, not 10% or 12.5%. Even if it is put against net trading income, the figure is approximately 6.5%. That is the effective rate and a huge proportion of the yield is being paid by a small number of companies that pay an effective rate that is much lower. Is it not clear when one considers the allowances that permit them to write down their taxable income that they find loopholes and exploit them? Capital allowances for intangible assets jumped between 2014 and 2015 from €18 billion to €46 billion. The Government creates the loophole and they jump in as part of a massive tax evasion scam. Similarly, deductions in trade charges jumped from €16 billion to €23 billion. That presumably is intergroup transactions between subsidiaries of the same corporations. Then we have the research and development tax relief mentioned by Mr. Coffey. Are they not just bloody big loopholes that need to be closed through having an effective rate because companies will always exploit them? No matter what adjustments or tweaking the State manages to make after the fact, unless there is an effective rate, they will always be one step ahead.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Mr. Coffey using technical language to describe my general accusation against corporations as being tax evaders, but he is saying in a nice way that we need to examine this issue. I agree. The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on it and Mr. Coffey has reinforced the point about the over-reliance on a small number of corporations and that we can only be sure of this income in the medium term. This is an accident waiting to happen and at some point there will be a glitch. The domination of a relatively small number of companies at a global level will not last. Historically, it has not lasted; therefore, that makes Ireland vulnerable. The need for us to develop the domestic economy and ensure a sustainable economic and industrial base is critical. I read a number of articles, possibly written by Mr. Coffey, which highlighted that the amount going into research and development was not being matched by investment. There are more tax breaks for research and development than investment generated, while the productivity figures again suggest a gross distortion because they are ridiculous. Even though Irish workers are productive and so on, they are not so productive that the mad productivity figures can be explained. They can only be explained by gross distortions consequent on companies distorting the figures. Is it not urgent to transition the economy away from this dependence and grab a little more of the tax revenue to invest in developing a sustainable economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Coffey think there has been a worrying preponderance of special purpose vehicles, SPVs?I think we have one of the highest number of registered SPVs in Europe. These are, in many cases, companies that just appear and then disappear and do not really leave much behind. In the film industry, for example, companies appear and then disappear but they get a lot of tax relief. There are other types of SPVs in operation here too. Is Mr. Coffey concerned about them? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Coffey must get out his crystal ball now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can. Dr. Coffey mentioned housing as a difficulty. Does he agree that precarious employment is another difficulty? I ask that because there was a time-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----when there was much competition for jobs. We are now suffering major labour shortages. That is why I mentioned the film industry. At the moment, because of the special purpose vehicle, SPV, structure, employment in that sector is completely precarious. People now have choices, however. They can leave the country or they can work in another sector. There is a danger that capacity can be run down in areas where we need to build it up. Should we be demanding greater conditionality around conditions of employment linked to tax reliefs? If there is going to be a tax relief, should it not actually guarantee sustainable employment over the long term?
