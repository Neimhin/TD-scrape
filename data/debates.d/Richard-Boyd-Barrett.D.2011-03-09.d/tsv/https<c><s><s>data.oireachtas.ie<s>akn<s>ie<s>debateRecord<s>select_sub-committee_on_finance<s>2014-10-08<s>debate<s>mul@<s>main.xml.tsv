RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do.  I have a question on direct recapitalisation, not just retroactive recapitalisation.  I wish to translate it into simple layman’s terms that people can understand.  If the Minister makes an application for recapitalisation, the deal is that the ESM would buy a share in the financial institution, and in the case of retroactive recapitalisation we would get the money back.  Is it envisaged that it would retain the shareholding?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the ESM sell the shares to the private sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished yet.  I have a few more questions for the Minister, but I just wanted to get clarity in order to fully understand the situation.  The ESM would buy shares and sell them on, and we would get the money back.  What the Minister seems to be saying, without making allegations, is that he will decide as the situation progresses whether it is better value for us, in terms of getting a better return on what we put into the banks, to sell the shares to private investors, or if we could get a better deal by applying to the ESM and seeing whether that is the best way to maximise our return.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister mean it might be a private financial entity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or it could be the ESM.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or we could hold on to it ourselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make a point on the application, which is the point I made on Second Stage.  I thought I heard the Minister say something on that in response to Deputy Doherty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although it will be discussed case by case, and the details could vary a little, that is broadly the way they are likely to consider any applications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not keep the Minister much longer.  Does he not think the €60 billion figure suggests it is not envisaged by the ESM that there will be a recapitalisation of our banks that would be any substantial portion of the amount we put in?  If the Minister is talking about €60 billion for all of Europe and we put €64 billion into our banks, would that not strongly suggest they do not envisage us getting a substantial amount back, even if we decided to apply, and the Minister is saying he is not sure if we should apply, that he will look at it and so on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  Given that it is only €60 billion, would it not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Listen-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For what it is worth, my interpretation of the game-changer, and various things are being attributed to that term, was Cyprus and the resistance of the Cypriot people which forced the change in policy where countries had a bail-in.  I welcome the bail-in, and the Minister's point is well made and reasonable but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, on the backs of many people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over €100,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, thanks to the Cypriot people.  That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  I do not agree.  There was a big fight over the €100,000 limit and so on.  The bail-in is welcome but it is 8% of liabilities, with the state's 5%.  Then we have all the conditions about the extent to which it may threaten the stability of the wider eurozone and the debt sustainability of an individual state.  After that bail-in, which is welcome but limited, the next port of call is back to Joe Bloggs on the street and, as I read it, and I would welcome the Minister telling me I am wrong, all the conditions are to stop it getting to the ESM and to put the citizens and the state on the hook big time as the next step in the cascade, with a fairly high threshold to move on to the next stage in the cascade.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, with the deal it was translated into debt.
