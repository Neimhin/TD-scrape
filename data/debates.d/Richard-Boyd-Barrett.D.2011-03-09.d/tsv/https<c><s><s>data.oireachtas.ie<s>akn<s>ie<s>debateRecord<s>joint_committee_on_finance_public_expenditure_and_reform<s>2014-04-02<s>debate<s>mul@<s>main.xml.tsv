RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair.  When I listened to what the witnesses had to say about the use of computers, it struck me that the comedy "Little Britain" was prescient when it depicted a customer being given the response "computer says no" regardless of what he or she asked.  That seems more or less to sum up what the banks are at.  I have to say that the bleak picture which has been painted by the witnesses is reflected in my clinic daily when I hear from people who are in dire straits.  One of the worst aspects of all of this is that people are threatened with homelessness.  I do not know whether the witnesses would like to comment on a point that should be made.  I recently asked my local authority how much it costs weekly to look after someone who is homeless.  I was told it costs approximately €800 a week, which means the State has to pay approximately €3,200 a month to look after a homeless person.  Given that this is probably a fraction of the monthly mortgage repayment someone might be required to make, it is clear we are getting screwed.  I refer not only to those who are in danger of homelessness because of the activities of the banks, but also to the State and the public finances, which are screwed when repossessions take place.  The witnesses seem to be saying that the banks will act as banks do by taking the fastest and most direct route to get money.  If that means repossessing people's houses, that is what they will do.  There is an onus on the Government to change this.  I would like the witnesses to set out specifically what the Government needs to do in that context.  Most ordinary people are wondering how the hell we can let the banks, which we bailed out, act as a law unto themselves to the detriment of mortgage holders and society as a whole.  Can the witnesses specify what they want the Government to tell the banks to do and how this should be done?  Do the witnesses agree that unless someone refuses point blank to engage in any shape or form, the State should not allow repossessions to take place?  This is the proper approach for financial reasons and for humanitarian reasons of basic human decency.  No other approach makes any sense, as it will put people out on the street and we will have to pick up the bill.  Do the witnesses agree that the approach I have set out should be written clearly into the guidelines?  Do they agree that all this is simply about the bank veto, about which many of us kicked up at the time?  If this problem is to be sorted out, the bank veto must be removed from the insolvency legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank all the attendees.  I commend them on filling the gap in trying to help people to navigate through the crisis they are facing.  A question I have on the big picture concerns the fact that there was, in effect, a ban on repossessions.  Perhaps the banks had no great inclination to repossess at the outset of the crisis because property values and rents were on the floor.  There was not a hell of a lot in it for them, but now the ban is gone and the pressure is on them to repossess.  There is a growing incentive for them to do so.  Are the delegates alarmed by the prospect that the current rise in rents and property values could actively incentivise the banks to ratchet up the number of repossessions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just about to say that.  On looking at the arithmetic, I believe there is a strong case for saying we have got to bring back the mortgage interest supplement because it would actually be cheaper for the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Local authorities estimate that it costs approximately €800 per week to look after a person who becomes homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree.  Does Mr. Maguire think that is a conscious policy on their part to inflate the value?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the analysis of the 6,000 people that Phoenix Project Ireland has seen, Ms Sadlier gives a very shocking figure and estimates that 50% are likely to be evictions, be they so-called voluntary surrenders, which are not really voluntary; threatened repossessions; or repossessions in court.  In our conversation beforehand, she said that the figure may be considerably higher.  This is pretty alarming because it means that the crisis about which we have been talking for four or five years may be about to be unleashed.  There seems to be quite a big distinction between people who are working - even people who are working are in great difficulty - and those who are not working.  People who are not working are really banjaxed.  Given that the mortgage to rent scheme is not happening at all, they are doubly banjaxed.  No local authority housing is being provided either.  What does Ms Sadlier have to say about that, particularly people who have lost their jobs and just cannot come up with a solution that the bank is willing to entertain?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wanted to ask a question about that.  The fact that Mr. Burgess mentioned construction workers is interesting because another thing that stares one in the face is the irony of the people who built all the houses being the ones who are facing the possibility of having their homes repossessed.  If one lived in a rational world, one would ask why we would not get the construction workers to build some houses for themselves, particularly given the shortage mentioned by Mr. Burgess.  Could I ask about repossession?  What Mr. Burgess said about bankruptcy is extremely interesting.  Can he explain it further?  Who will the judge accept?  If a person applies to go bankrupt, can they apply if the bank has moved to repossess their house?  If the bank states that it is going to repossess the house, can a person say they are going bankrupt?  Who is the judge likely to accept for bankruptcy?  When they decide yes or no, what grounds are they likely to base it on based on Mr. Burgess's experience, particularly in the case of people who are unemployed and have no income?  Will the judge accept these people because it sounds like a pretty good deal?
