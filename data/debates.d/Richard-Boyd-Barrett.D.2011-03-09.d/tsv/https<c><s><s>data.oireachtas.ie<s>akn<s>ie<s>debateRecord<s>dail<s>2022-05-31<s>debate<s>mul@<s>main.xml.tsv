RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The recently established Cost of Living Coalition is calling people out onto the streets on Saturday, 18 June, for a national demonstration and day of protest to demand a comprehensive, urgent and radical package of measures to address the cost-of-living crisis that is absolutely crucifying workers, pensioners, students and people on low and middle incomes. It will be a protest against the Government's spectacular failure to address the cost-of-living crisis. Today, we have more evidence of the Government's failure in this regard. EUROSTAT has indicated that we are facing inflation of 8.3%. This means that the value in purchasing power terms of workers' wages, pensions and incomes will drop by more than 8%, meaning real cuts in income for the people who can least afford them. Then we have the Taoiseach warning of a new era of high energy prices. That is on top of a 42% increase in energy and heating costs for ordinary people in the past year alone. Against this background of a cost-of-living crisis, the Government acts like a helpless, innocent bystander that can do absolutely nothing about it. The Government is not going to do anything before the budget, and it is totally unclear whether it will do anything at all. That is why people are coming onto the streets. Even the crisis in Dublin Airport is linked to this problem. In a word, the problem there is that the DAA, which has executives on total packages in excess of €366,000, expects the security workers it hires to operate on rubbishy flexible contracts for €14 an hour. When they cannot even plan and will not even know what hours they will have and, therefore, what income they will have in a week's time, is it any wonder that the DAA has difficulty recruiting people? The chief executive overseeing this is on a package of €366,000 a year. That is the problem in the context of the bigger crisis we face. More than 600,000 people in this country are suffering deprivation and there are hundreds of thousands of workers are on low pay. However, spectacular profits are being made by the energy companies. Last year, Energia's profits were up 46% and the ESB's were up to nearly €700 million. Even Boris Johnson, a Tory, can introduce a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies to try to get some revenues to protect ordinary people from the cost-of-living crisis, but this Government will not do what even Boris Johnson is doing - and, my God, he is no left-winger. When is the Government going to bring in emergency measures in respect of housing costs, the slaughtering of people's incomes and a cost of living that is crucifying ordinary people? What is going to be in that package? So far, the Government has done nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason so many people have got involved in this new Cost of Living Coalition - pensioners groups, retired workers groups, student unions, single-parent advocacy groups, anti-poverty groups, trade unions and others - is because the measures the Government has been taking are a drop in the ocean; they are making little or no difference to the crucifying increases in the cost of living that people face. The key point is that people are acutely aware that this is a tale of two crises. Ordinary working people, pensioners and students are being hammered with the cost of inflation, but they see simultaneously that some people are doing very well out of it. The Oxfam report published last week shows that Ireland's nine billionaires saw their assets and wealth increase by 55% last year. The energy companies see their profits going through the roof. The billionaires, millionaires and the CEOs of the DAA, who seem to be more interested in setting up airports in Saudi Arabia than in sorting out the problems at Dublin Airport, are doing very well. For workers, pensioners, students and ordinary people, however, the measures the Government is taking are simply not enough. This is because the Government will not address the elephant in the room, namely, the gross inequalities in income and wealth that exist in our society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Kerrane of Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion, which we support. Any contribution to people who are being absolutely hammered with cost-of-living increases should be welcomed. We are happy to support the motion. I want to set out what I believe needs to be a really comprehensive and radical package to deal with the inflation and cost-of-living crisis that people are enduring. There is a need for us to recognise that something is rotten in the way our economic system operates. If we do not get to the bottom of that, we are not going to either solve this problem or stop lurching from crisis to crisis, which is what we do. We do that because we allow the market to dictate what happens in our society, with commercial concerns coming before planning for the needs of society. Consider the mess at Dublin Airport. That is a Covid-related supply chain bottleneck according to the Government. When it replies to our criticism, the Government says that it is not its fault and that it is a Covid-related supply chain bottleneck. This was what the Minister of State said What does that actually mean? I believe it is just jargon and rubbish to try to cover up what is actually happening. I will outline what it actually means. The CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, was previously head of Brown Thomas. It baffles me what those two things have to do with each other. Somebody who used to run Brown Thomas is running the DAA. Another person who is running it is a former Goldman Sachs banker. They are running the DAA and during Covid they said they were going to get rid of 1,000 workers because not as many people were travelling as used to be the case. They decided to take advantage of that opportunity to get rid of people. They knew they would have to rehire them. When they knew it was time to do so, they would have taken a decision to give them absolutely rubbish contracts in order that they can have a workforce that can be turned on and off like a tap. They would also have to decided to guarantee those people only 20 hours' work a week but with the proviso that they must be on call for 40. Furthermore, they would have decided to pay them €14 per hour. Is it any wonder that people are not exactly jumping over themselves for those jobs or that the DAA has a problem retaining people in them? The DAA wants to hire people but does not want to pay them properly. It wants a workforce it can turn on and turn off. That is what a supply chain bottleneck looks like. It is people running our most important piece of national transport infrastructure on a for-profit basis at the expense of the workers who are needed to make the place function. The workers are treated like dirt, which is phrased as being "flexible", but, of course, eventually workers just do not want to do that. The people at the top have awarded themselves packages of €366,000 in pay and pension entitlements. They have also decided to run two airports down in Saudi Arabia for one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world, and are setting up duty-free shops all over the world. This is because they are interested in money. They are not interested in making our infrastructure work; they are interested in money. Does this sound familiar in the context of some of the other things affecting the cost of living, such as, for example, the cost of housing, accommodation and rent? The people running that sector are interested in making money out of it. If there is a shortage of housing, they actually make more money. In fact, they have absolutely no interest in creating a situation where there might be either a sufficient supply or and excess of housing. Why would they possibly do that when, if they did, they would not make as much money? That is how our housing sector works. One can also go through the list of areas where it is about people making money rather than supplying food, as was just mentioned. Our entire system of agriculture has been set up to supply export markets, which is a global market-led approach, rather than meeting the need for food and a diversity of food supply, which would be necessary to deliver locally-produced food of all types to the people of this country on a sustainable and secure basis. No. We are geared up for the market and we are geared up for the beef barons and certain people who control the dairy sector to make money. It does not work for the producers and it does not work for the ordinary consumers, but by God does it work for the beef barons, for Tesco and for all of the rest of them. That is the elephant in the room. While ordinary people are hammered with the cost-of-living crisis, Tesco's profits, energy companies' profits, Shell's profits, BP's profits and corporate profits generally in Ireland are all through the roof. That is what is going on. Inflation is not some sort of interesting economic phenomenon. Inflation is about making money for the people who control the things that we need to make our society function.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what it is about. One can look at any sector, but that is what we have to address. My God, even Boris Johnson has, under pressure, been forced to acknowledge this point at some level and introduce a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies that are making a fortune. In the past week, Oxfam produced a report showing that if we put a 1.5% tax on everyone in this country who has more than €4 million in wealth, we could raise €5 billion annually.My God, would that not do a lot to protect ordinary people from the rising cost of living to deliver affordable housing and so on? I think it would.
