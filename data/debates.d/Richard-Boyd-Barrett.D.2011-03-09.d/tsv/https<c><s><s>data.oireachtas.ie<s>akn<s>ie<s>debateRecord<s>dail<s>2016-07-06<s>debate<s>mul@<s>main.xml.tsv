RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Minister say, with a straight face, that he is doing anything other than putting a gun to the head of public sector workers? That gun is called FEMPI. The Minister has really outlined it. There is a series of pieces of legislation that have absolutely no justification any longer because there is no financial emergency. The financial emergency is over and the Government is never short of throwing around figures on the economic growth rates. How can the Minister say he is doing anything other than bullying all -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----public sector workers with this legislation that should be abolished?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of the victims of the FEMPI legislation are sitting in the Visitors Gallery today, newly qualified teachers, young teachers and local authority workers who have been crucified with this emergency legislation first brought in by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party and continued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The Minister has not answered the key question. Is there still an emergency? If there is not an emergency how can he possibly justify continuing to punish these workers? All of the things the Minister mentions, the instability and all the rest, were the fault of these young teachers or nurses or gardaí or local authority workers but they have suffered cruelly as a result. Even at the end of the Lansdowne Road agreement process they will be earning less than they were earning in 2009. Many of the conditions they lost are not even mentioned in the Lansdowne Road agreement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no problem doing that. First, the Minister got a bounce of an extra €2 billion in corporate tax receipts last year. We are €700 million ahead of target on tax revenue at the moment, much of it coming from the corporate sector because we on this side of the House began to demand action on the "double Irish" tax scam that has started to force these corporations to pay a bit more tax. The Minister should use some of that money. He should bring in a financial transaction tax and tax people earning in excess of €100,000 more, instead of maintaining absolutely draconian cuts in the pay and conditions of public sector workers and an Act which has extraordinarily draconian provisions and which can be described as nothing other than bullying. Most of the people who signed up to the agreement only signed up because the Government put a gun to their heads called FEMPI and told them to sign up to this, which was unacceptable, or they would be punished by not getting their increments or allowances and not allowing for promotions. How can the Minister justify that extraordinarily draconian behaviour?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much time is available?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the most shocking aspects of the emergency measures taken was what was done to newly qualified teachers, nurses and public servants. There is nothing in the Lansdowne Road agreement that commits to doing anything about that pay apartheid. What is the Minister going to do? How can he justify the sort of pay apartheid that will mean that somebody who happens to come in after 2012 will, over the course of 40 years of a working life, earn €250,000 less than somebody who happened to come in before that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Talk of negotiations is not a commitment to get rid of something that is patently unfair. Rather, it suggests that the Minister does not intend to fully get rid of something that is completely unjustifiable - namely, this sort of pay apartheid. In terms of new entrants, a lot of teachers now have no incentive whatsoever to increase their qualifications, particularly those that would allow them to work in areas such as special needs or with vulnerable groups, because most of the cuts imposed on newly qualified teachers were in the areas of allowances, which are mainly linked to qualifications. Not only has the Government imposed an unfair pay apartheid on teachers and other public sector workers but, now that the embargo has been lifted, a bomb will go off in terms of the injustice facing such public servants. The Government is also undermining the quality of education for children, particularly those who are vulnerable, in the education system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We never said there would not be economic growth. The question is whether the benefits of that growth would accrue to the majority or to a tiny elite. That is why we raise this issue. It is extraordinary, cynical and laughable for the Minister to suggest that FEMPI was not a major factor in essentially threatening people with a stick or sword over their head and saying that if they did not sign up to the Lansdowne Road agreement they would not get their increments and allowances. Could the Minister confirm that this is what he is going to do - namely, that the gardaí and the members of the ASTI are not going to get their allowances and increments? Does the Minister expect anything other than major industrial strife and justified resistance from teachers and gardaí if he goes ahead and does that? We have a motion on the Dáil Order Paper calling for the rescinding of FEMPI. We are having a debate because we kicked up last week about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we have the right to vote on the motion so that Members can at least show their colours in terms of their attitude to restoring the pay and conditions of public sector workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That could be collected in corporation tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a day of shame for the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Labour Party when he cut the pay of new entrant teachers and other public servants, something that played a big part in the decimation of the Labour Party. It is really unconscionable that this pay apartheid continues. I know the Minister has talked about negotiations but we want to know when he will commit to getting rid of something that is just plain wrong and indefensible. Pensioners have also asked about whether the Minister is willing to fast track the rolling back of the pension cuts imposed under the FEMPI legislation. Can the Minister give some commitment about whether he is willing to speed up the process of restoring moneys to pensioners who, along with the young, were another group attacked by the FEMPI legislation?
