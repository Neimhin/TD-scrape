RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the question spells out, it is about supports and funding to Coillte since it was set up in 1989. The context for this question is that I favour public support and investment for a semi-State company engaged in forestry. After the meeting which the Minister kindly set up with Coillte for me last week, what came across clearly was Coillte's fairly bald statement that it is precluded, primarily by the EU, from contributing to meeting our afforestation targets. Coillte cannot contribute to one of its core activities. I asked for what are we giving Coillte funding and support if it cannot do what should be its primary activity and whether it is, in fact, that funding is going to push Coillte towards more commercialised activities which have little to do with its core activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate if we could get the list of all contracts between Coillte and other State agencies going back to 1989 as soon as it becomes available. The initial loan facility for Coillte, when it was established and as provided for in legislation, was €30 million. In 2009, this was increased to €400 million. Around that time there was a large deficit in Coillte’s pension fund. The National Pensions Reserve Fund bought harvesting rights through the Irish Forestry Unit Trust for some of Coillte’s forests. When I met the company last week, it explained to me it sells the harvesting rights of its forests to entities of various sorts to get cash which it then invests elsewhere. Are we giving indirect supports and subsidies, as well as direct supports, to Coillte but not knowing where this money is going? It is certainly not going into afforestation programmes because Coillte is not allowed do such programmes and cannot contribute to what should be its core objective. Where is the money going then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Coillte was helpful and informative. My questions are more directed at the Government’s policy and, as it is the main shareholder, to where it is driving Coillte. If Coillte cannot contribute to afforestation and increasing our forest cover, then it seems to me that it is being driven in the direction of providing industrialised wind turbines, for example. In 2009, when the loan facility was extended from €30 million to €400 million, it was said in this House that some of that might be used to move into the area of providing nursing homes. Coillte is moving into controversial areas such as providing industrialised wind turbines which is arguably nothing to do with what it really should be doing. It is being pushed into a more commercialised, for-profit, privatised direction by government policy.We have no control over it even though we are owners of 100% of it. It is in a type of limbo where there is no transparency over its investment decisions, strategic direction or whether it is applying itself to its core activities, namely, growing trees and managing the forest estate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just wanted to throw in questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These statistical questions are important because there is nothing which infuriates people more than being told things are getting better for them when they self-evidently are not. The question relates both to the broader issue of jobs and unemployment and to different sectors and levels of pay. It is a problem from a statistical point of view if we cannot get a proper breakdown of these data. Some of the figures the Minister of State is giving us go back to 2011. We cannot, based on what he is telling us, judge whether the Government propaganda about the great success and improvement in employment is true, and we will not be able to do so for a considerable time. We can, however, conclude, based on what he has said, that if we did not have 20,000 people leaving the country this year and last, there would have been a zero decrease in unemployment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be helpful if the Government at least owned up to that fact. It is a disastrous situation, notwithstanding that the creation of any new job is, of course, welcome. The question also referred to pay rates and sectors, but the Minister of State has not been able to give us any proper statistics in this regard. Those data are important because people in this country are of the view, based on their own experience, that there is widespread displacement of what were previously well-paid jobs-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not making a statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister of State accept there is widespread and justified concern that displacement is going on? One example of this is what is happening at the Rhatigan site, where brick layers, after not being paid for five weeks, were given €100 per week for work for which they previously would have received €600 or €700.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this the type of job creation we are talking about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was out on the picket line at the site to which I referred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have spoken to them and they are not happy campers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to share time with Deputy Wallace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I have no doubt about the bravery and good intentions of the Irish troops participating in the UNDOF mission, I think the time has come to pull them out. I do not think we should continue to participate in this mission, which is largely irrelevant in the current context. We should not be endangering the lives of Irish troops in the middle of an extremely dangerous mess that has been created as a consequence of the US invasion and occupation of Iraq. I refer to its cynical manipulations in Iraq, and now in Syria. I could say the same about Russia. Their manipulations in this area have created an absolute hornet's nest, the worst expression of which is obviously ISIS. These dangerous people are now overrunning parts of Iraq and Syria. This mess has resulted directly from the US invasion and occupation of Iraq. The US sponsored a sectarian government that used sectarian politics - divisions between Shia and Sunni Muslims - to fuel the growth of ISIS. This needs to be taken alongside the Western support of brutal autocratic regimes like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have been sponsoring certain armed elements to manipulate cynically the crisis in Syria. I should also refer to the extraordinary double standards when it comes to the treatment of Israel, which has been allowed to get away literally with the murder of Palestinian people in Gaza. All of the chickens of the West's hypocritical policy in the region are coming home to roost in the most dangerous and terrifying way with the rise of ISIS. Our troops should not be put in the middle of that dangerous cocktail.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have already had one group-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The safest thing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should be careful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He should pull them out. There is no good reason for them to be there in this dangerous situation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation is getting completely out of control. It is spilling over into Kurdistan and Turkey. God knows where it will go from here. Therefore, I see no purpose in our troops being there. I think we should pull them out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our troops are in the UNDOF buffer area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of the rebel groups are operating in that area. Some of the conflict is taking place there. It is spreading across Syria and into Turkey. If the Minister knows where it will end, I think he is making a serious mistake. The US is escalating the conflict by starting to bomb. This will fuel a situation that is already dangerous and disastrous. The most useful thing we could do in these circumstances is pull our troops out for their own safety and finally begin to stand up to and challenge the inconsistency, hypocrisy, manipulation and double standards of what the big powers are doing in the region, which has fuelled the growth of ISIS and the other insurgent Islamic groups. We should stop supporting regimes like those in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. We should stop co-operating with an Egyptian regime that is digging the grave of the Arab Spring in Egypt. These are the sorts of things we could usefully do instead of endangering the lives of our troops. If there is no problem, why has the Minister said the mission should be reviewed? Why has he said we need to rethink its whole purpose? It is obviously in the context of what is happening in Syria that the Minister is making such remarks. If this was not an issue, the headquarters of the mission would not have redeployed and the Minister would not have said in his speech that the whole basis of the mission is being reconsidered. He said that it needs to be reviewed. That is being done because the Minister can see what a dangerous mess there is. I am saying we should go one step further by pulling the troops out and finally beginning to challenge the disastrous policies of the Western powers in the region.
