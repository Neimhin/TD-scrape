RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to start not with the detail that has been discussed but the bigger picture at stake in all of this. There was a report by Jim Power which received some publicity on Sunday. With all the news of Garda matters and the bus strike, it has been somewhat drowned out. This is very unfortunate because what the report suggests is pretty explosive and makes even the Apple scandal pale in comparison. It suggests we have lost out to the tune of €18 billion on NAMA's disposal of assets far beneath their value. It goes without saying that such an amount of money could utterly transform the situation of this country and resolve our housing and homelessness emergency, the crisis in our health services and much more besides. If one adds this sum to those in respect of the Apple case and the other tax loopholes benefiting the corporate sector, if these practices were not happening, it would utterly transform the lives of Irish citizens. If there is even a whit of truth in what - I wish the Minister would stop having a private conversation while I am trying to speak. This is a scandal beyond scandals. I know the pressure is on our friends in the media with all the various significant events happening but I appeal to them to look seriously into what is alleged in Mr. Power's report. It suggests that what we glimpse from one matter, namely, Project Eagle and the loss of several hundred million euro, as alleged by the Comptroller and Auditor General and confirmed by the Committee of Public Accounts in its report, may be only the tip of a massive iceberg. When one considers what happened in Project Eagle, any sum even close to that €18 billion - half of it or even a third or a quarter of it - would be a scandal beyond scandals. Was this failure of NAMA to deliver and protect the public interest to the tune of those billions all the result of murky dealings, insiders, conflicts of interest and the failure of NAMA to protect the public interest or people, such as Mr. Cushnahan, advising NAMA and being involved in, frankly, what looks like incredible corruption? Was this happening elsewhere or indeed right across the board? I find it quite extraordinary in this regard that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would respond in the way he did to the questions raised about his meeting with Cerberus, as if the appropriateness or otherwise of the meeting with Cerberus is not a legitimate question to ask. When one thinks of what is at stake in Project Eagle itself, but also far beyond it, does the fact of the Minister for Finance meeting with Cerberus - and I think there were 60 other meetings with these property investors and vulture funds - not beg very serious questions? I am not alleging any impropriety. The Minister has said that Cerberus raised the issue briefly but that it was said it would not be appropriate to discuss it at the meeting. Deputy Fleming has just reminded me that directly after that, Cerberus went to meet NAMA, at which point, presumably, the matter was discussed. It is deeply worrying that the issue was discussed the day before the process concluded and that Cerberus met the Minister for Finance and then went to discuss it with NAMA, given that all this and the finders' fees had happened previously with Frank Cushnahan. This is a process designed by Mr. Cushnahan and PIMCO whereby corruption is seriously at play and, effectively, that process he designed remains the process through which the sale eventually took place. Mr. Cushnahan left the scene but nobody pulled him up, called foul at the time or stopped the sales process. This should have been done immediately when it was discovered he was representing the NAMA debtors in the North, or significant numbers of them, and that fixers' fees were involved. It is incredible that the whole process was not stopped at that moment, but it was not. Therefore, when one thinks of what is at stake, for the Minister to get uppity and say we do not really have a right to ask these questions or impugn him is quite shocking. One can only conclude, when one considers all this, that we need to root out the truth about everything NAMA did, about all these sales processes and about whether Project Eagle and all the murky dealings and questions that arise from it would be found to be very similar in other sales processes. In this regard, I wish to refer to something to which I referred in the last debate as another example, and I am sure there are many more. I refer to the Spencer Dock development and Mr. Johnny Ronan. One element of Project Eagle is that the deal designed by Mr. Cushnahan on behalf of these developers was - Could people stop talking? It is difficult to concentrate when Deputy Mattie McGrath is having a conversation. One critical part of the arrangement was that the personal guarantees of these developers would be written off. They would be back in business as part of the deal whereby PIMCO or Cerberus would come in and buy Project Eagle at a discounted price. These guys, who had given personal guarantees, would have those personal guarantees disappeared for them so that they could get back into business, and they have. Mr. Kearney is back in business. That was one of the effects of this arrangement. This is exactly what happened with Johnny Ronan in a similar process in respect of Spencer Dock. I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, of what Deputy Enda Kenny said in 2011 about NAMA developers getting back their assets at the end of the NAMA process. When he was questioned about this in 2011, he specifically said, "I hope that NAMA are on top of that, and that where NAMA have acquired assets they don't find their way back to where they were acquired from in the first place." Yet this is exactly what happened with Mr. Johnny Ronan. Treasury Holdings, including the Spencer Dock development, owed more than €1 billion to NAMA and were taken over by NAMA.Another US-based investor fund pays off his debts or does a deal with NAMA for €300 million and now he is back in control of the Spencer Dock site, which is worth approximately €600 million. These US-based investors act as proxies to get him off the hook and get around the stipulation in the NAMA legislation that NAMA developers should not end up owning their assets at a discount, which is paid by the public because of the failure to realise the full value of those assets. The suggestion in the files sent anonymously to us, probably by rival developers, not that it matters because the point remains valid, is that they bought those assets back for €42 million but comparisons with similar sites in the docklands suggest the actual value of those sites is in the region of €100 million to €120 million. Mr. Ronan gets back stuff he was never supposed to get back for €42 million, with the assistance of these US funds, although it is worth approximately €100 million or €120 million.  These are just two examples that stink to high heaven and this can of worms must be opened and fully investigated and every sale and disposal of NAMA assets has to be investigated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We debated quite a bit of this on Committee Stage so I will not delay excessively. I will reiterate briefly the reasons we have tabled a series of amendments to this Bill and more generally why we will, at the end of this process, be opposing this Bill and calling for a vote on it. I indicated this on Second and Committee Stages. This Bill, which will probably go largely unnoticed by the public and media, proposes to provide another tax loophole for the corporate sector such that if one qualifies for the knowledge development box tax break, one will pay tax at a rate of 6.25% rather than 12.5%. I find this extraordinary although it is quite consistent with the general approach of both this Government and Fianna Fáil. Their policy, on which they are united, is to reduce an already extraordinarily low tax burden on corporations' profits even further. This is at a time when we have had the scandal of Apple. There is €19 billion, including interest, that we do not want to collect. This could transform the lives of all those suffering and struggling in the face of the housing and health crises. The revenue would provide the money we need to resolve the dispute in Bus Éireann and so much more. We could literally transform the country just by collecting the taxes from one company, Apple, which according to European Commission dodged tax to the tune of €13 billion. The Apple tax scam was just the tip of a very big iceberg, however. I addressed this matter in the debate on Second and Committee Stages. It needs to be shouted from the rooftops as often as possible. With the exception of only one of seven years after the crash in 2008, during which years the whole country expected the corporations to be crushed with austerity, the profits of the corporations went up consistently. There was a slight dip in 2008. Therefore, while everybody else was getting poorer, the corporations were making profits and getting richer. Not only that, when the financial emergency caused by the gambling and speculation of the corporate and financial elite was resulting in the imposition of the most cruel and vicious austerity on working people in this country, at which time the Government believed it was justifiable to bring in financial emergency measures Acts and lash up taxes on workers and slash housing budgets, everybody bar one group got hit cruelly hard time and again. One group did not get hit at all.There was not even an emergency levy or a little bit of extra emergency tax on the corporate sector which was paying pitifully low levels of tax. The 12.5% rate, which is lower than what any average worker would pay on his or her income, is not good enough. Actually, due to a whole rake of loopholes, these corporations were paying on average, interestingly, 6.25%. The Government wants to legitimise this with this knowledge development box proposal to get around moves on an international scale to close down some of those loopholes. It is the new double Irish. I oppose this fundamentally. This set of amendments at least attempts to oblige the Government to give us detailed information as to who is benefitting from this tax break, in what sectors and in what areas, as well as other information that would allow the public to at least know who is benefitting from this tax scam.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will leave the more philosophical debate to the next group amendments. The bottom line is that this is a tax loophole, exploiting the rather vague notion of intellectual property, which was at the centre of the double Irish tax scam. This is another tax loophole revolving around the concept of intellectual property, whatever that is.That is why I say it is the double Irish mark II. It is the new official double Irish, sanctioned by the State and even by the OECD. The reason we want information is that I suspect the people who will benefit from this will be a select few, just as the corporations which benefited from the double Irish will be the select few. It will not be the corner shop or a small and medium enterprise, it will be a select few corporations which know how to exploit the tax code and the concept of intellectual property in order to reduce their tax liability as Apple, Goggle, Facebook and the lot of them have done. That is what this is about. The Minister of State, in these set of amendments, is resisting this under the vague argument about commercial secrecy or anonymity but why does the Government really want to resist this? It does not want us to have detailed information which would confirm that it is the select few industries and businesses that will benefit from it, and that will blow the lie that the ordinary small and medium enterprise will benefit from it. It will not be the corner shop or the small guy in the local town who has come up with an enterprising idea who will benefit from it, it will be the corporate sector. The figure of €7.5 million and the figure of €50 million globally in this context constitutes the definition of a small and medium enterprise, but those figures are not small, they are big.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is too late on that one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 15, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“(h) such general information as to the operation of the scheme as may be appropriate or relevant,”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 15, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:

19. (1) The Minister shall, as part of the annual Budget process, produce a report on the operation of the KDB including a consideration of the intersection of the KDB with other tax expenditure measures and its impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate for corporations.(2) The Minister shall ensure appropriate annual information exchange between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in order to facilitate the publication of information on the cost of this initiative, including the cost to date for the Exchequer in revenues forgone, as part of the annual budgetary process.”. I will be calling a vote on this amendment just to let Members know who may be wondering when there will be a vote. There will be a vote on this amendment in approximately ten minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In approximately ten or 12 minutes. The reason I will call a vote on this amendment is that there is a cost to these tax breaks and it is an important cost. I heard Deputy Lawless refer to the fact that we need this so-called knowledge development box because it will incentivise creativity and innovation. That is the argument for it. I am wholeheartedly in favour of creativity and innovation but the question is where should the State invest public money to get the best bang for it buck in terms of innovation and creativity. Should it give its money in tax breaks to profitable corporations or should it give it to universities and invest it in education? That is the choice in reality. If corporations that are making great profits do not pay taxes, we will have less money for the universities, schools and education. I believe that is from where the innovation comes. It is not that I do not believe that genuinely small and medium enterprises should not get some help. I think they should get help but it should be grant help from the State.However, I do not think that somebody who comes up with a brilliant idea in business, which is the intellectual property, and develops a product from that brilliant idea should forever and a day be permitted to pay 6.25% on all sales generated from that idea. That would not be acceptable. The company could be making an absolute fortune - €7.5 million in income and €50 million globally - but it would only pay 6.25%, not even the 12.5%, which is the lowest level of corporation tax almost anywhere in Europe. These people are already pampered. They are already paying virtually nothing. This is money that should be going into our schools and universities, which, let us not forget, have been axed. A lot of money has been taken out of third level education and postgraduate grants and study. There are many ideas and much creativity and innovation to be found in postgraduate study, but their grants have been cut. It is apparently fine for a profitable company to make millions of euro domestically and globally and to pay 6.5% but because they are not paying more tax, there is no money to go into the universities. There is no money for postgraduate grants, there are miserable maintenance grants for students living in poverty, and so on. That is the trade-off and it needs to be called out. I am, therefore, very much opposed to this entire knowledge box package. I accept it is linked to what was passed in the Finance Bill 2015, but I opposed that too and did so vigorously. Another point that needs to be raised is that this is about the amount of forgone revenue. Does the House remember what happened in the last budget when there was only €1 billion in fiscal space to spread around for everybody? How much extra would be available if the corporations in this country paid 12.5%? Going on existing Revenue figures, there would be an extra €4 billion to €5 billion per year if they paid 12.5%. That is not much, but the Government wants them to pay 6.25%, which is, on average, the effective rate they currently pay. Some of them pay less than 1%. Apple was paying less than 1% because of all the other tax loopholes from which these companies benefit. I ask the House to imagine if we had an extra €4 billion or €5 billion in budget 2017 because these corporations were forced to pay the actual 12.5% rate. Imagine what that would do for our universities that have been starved of money. Imagine what it would do for education. Imagine what it would do for public transport, health and the capacity to pay public sector and other workers decently. It would transform the situation. We would get major creativity and innovation from the majority of the population whose lives would be improved, whose services would be improved and whose education would be upscaled to a massive extent. That is what is at stake in the Bill, so I do not buy this for one minute. It is another tax scam in tax haven Ireland. That is what we are - a tax haven - and because we got caught out on the double Irish, we have brought in the knowledge development box to create another mechanism for the corporations to dodge tax. In so far as the Bill is directed at small and medium-sized enterprise, as I said, they should be given grants, including start-up grants. They should be given some money to develop things in such a way that the Bill is targeted at them. However, once a company starts to make millions in profits, it should pay its taxes. What this Bill will allow it to do is, forever and a day on all sales generated from the wonderful idea, to pay an even lower level of tax than the existing incredibly low level of tax applied to corporations in this country. It is a scandal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that we need to know. I have given the wider argument. When it comes to the budget, we need to know, and that is what these amendments seek. Whether one agrees or disagrees, there is merit in saying we need to know how much money is forgone. Choices are made in budgets, and we will have to decide whether €50 million, €100 million or whatever should be forgone through this mechanism, along with all the other mechanisms. We need to know about the other mechanisms too, such as the €30 billion of tax loopholes per year given away to these corporations, but that is another day's work. We are dealing with this new tax loophole the Government is proposing. These amendments propose that the relevant committee should scrutinise this measure and that we need information provided prior to the budget as to how much revenue is forgone so that when we vote on the budget, we can say we would rather that €50 million, €100 million, €20 million or whatever it may be go into the universities or second level education or whatever. It seems to me at a very minimum a reasonable thing to ask, that we be allowed monitor this, that the public be made aware and that we be allowed debate whether these tax breaks are actually beneficial for society and the economy as a whole or if they just benefit the select few who have done so well out of the already extensive, myriad tax loopholes from which big corporations have benefited.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments seek to do two things, to see how this knowledge development box which is a limited tax loophole, intersects with other tax loopholes that I referred to, and what is the overall benefit to the companies that benefit from this and potentially other tax loopholes. The sum total of all these loopholes, the deductions and allowances allowed to the corporate sector generally, of which this is yet another, results in the loss of billions of euro, not €50 million, which one can see in Revenue's figures. This is part of that architecture and it will expand. I want to scotch it before it gets off the ground because we saw what the double Irish did. It expanded to extraordinary levels of tax avoidance by corporations. That is one aspect. We need to know how it intersects and whether companies are benefiting from multiple tax breaks of which this would be one. We also need to know, and this should not be left to the Minister, and the committees need to scrutinise how much money is forgone so that we can count the extent and value of this tax break and decide whether this money would be better spent elsewhere. That is the logic of it. Even if the Minister of State does not agree with my philosophical perspective on the knowledge development box it seems to me this is vital information to be able to monitor and judge the benefit and effectiveness of such a tax break. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not have it.
