RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Eleven years after the Government promised to sign the UNCRPD it was finally signed in April 2018. However, signing a convention and ensuring equal participation in society for people with disabilities are two different matters. In the area of transport, we are a long way short of the mark. There are massive problems with the regular and frequent breakdown of lifts at the DART stations, stranding people, and denying them access to DART services. There are major problems of accessibility to buses and lack of accessible taxis. The Government needs to do a hell of a lot more. I will go through some of the problems in more detail later but I want to know what the Minister is going to do to make equal access for people with disabilities to public transport a reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has had 11 years to progressively realise equality and it is still a long way short. I will give the Minister a glimpse of the reality on the DART. On 22 August, lifts were out of order in nine stations; on 6 September, they were out of order in eight; on 9 September, online information stated lifts were out of order in two stations when in fact the number was six; and on 23 September online information stated no lifts were out of order when in fact eight were. Seán O'Kelly, a wheelchair user and disability activist, who is in the Visitors Gallery today said that in August he was due to meet somebody in Pearse Street station. He came from Glenageary. On his return he decided to go to Blackrock where he understood the lift was functioning. When he got there he found that it was not. He then had to go on to Salthill and back to Blackrock on the other side, and then had to go to Booterstown in order to get to Glenageary. In other words, what should have been a three-stop journey became a six-stop journey because of the problems with lifts at DART stations.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just not good enough and in order to highlight this, Bernard Mulvany, who the Minister mentioned, and Seán O’Kelly and others, have had to organise multiple protests about this. It is not acceptable and we need it sorted urgently. The four hours' notice to access trains in Dublin and the 24 hours needed in the country is not equality. Some private bus companies which do not get state aid do not have to be accessible. There is a lack of accessible taxis. One taxi driver told me that there is a new purpose-built, all electric taxi in London that is fully accessible. If we redirected some of the grants for accessible taxis to purchase those and dropped the vehicle registration tax, VRT, we could have lots of accessible taxis in Dublin in short order. A lot more needs to be done. There needs to be a real focus on this. The situations that Seán and others find themselves in are absolutely unacceptable. Equality means equality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I too want to raise what I believe to be the scandal of the strategic housing development scheme. I raised it with the Taoiseach yesterday. We put in a submission to the review weeks ago calling for the scheme to be scrapped.Before the summer, a People Before Profit motion calling for the scheme to be scrapped was passed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. This motion was proposed in light of Bartra's absolutely disgraceful strategic housing scheme in Dún Laoghaire, which involves 210 units of little box rooms with fold-out beds but no social or affordable housing. Our opposition to this scheme has now been confirmed by the revelations in an article in The Sunday Business Post at the weekend and by the studies carried out in UCD and elsewhere. It has clearly emerged that the strategic housing development scheme was dreamed up by developers. The Minister who put it forward needs to explain how it is being claimed by developers that he took their plans on board - lock, stock and barrel - and stuck them into the housing Bill. It is now clear that this scheme is nothing more than a licence for property speculators to speculate, to hoard land, to flip land and to print money. It is not delivering what the Minister promised when he introduced the Bill. He said it would deliver housing to address the housing emergency that has developed after the Minister's eight years in government. We all know the sins of Fianna Fáil and of those who put money into bailing out the rotten and toxic banks, instead of putting it into housing and other public services and forms of infrastructure. We are now paying the cost of that. We need answers. Is it the case, as the developers are claiming, that this Bill was dreamed up by them for them? It is enriching them, while failing to deliver the affordable housing that is needed to address the housing crisis. Two thirds of the houses or apartments that have been approved under this scheme have not commenced. Some of them are for sale. In such cases, it is absolutely clear that properties are being flipped. When planning permission is provided under the fast-track strategic housing scheme, the value of the asset held by the property developer is inflated. This encourages the developer to flip it on and make a lot of money. We know that speculation and hoarding by developers is rampant at the moment. The Minister has said that the delivery of housing has improved, but all the experts are saying we need 35,000 housing units at this stage if we are to catch up with the deficit. We are nowhere near that, but we have the scandal of this scheme failing. Rather than building public and affordable housing on public land, which is what some of us have been asking it to do for five or six years, the Government is continuing to expect profit-driven property speculators to solve the housing crisis when all they are doing is exploiting it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have proposed a solution. We have called for the scheme to be scrapped. We have pointed out that nothing in the scheme guarantees that there will be any - any - affordable or public housing, as we witnessed with the Bartra proposal at Eblana Avenue with no social and affordable housing but box rooms. The strategic housing development application at Cross Avenue in Blackrock involved apartments that would cost €1 million each, in effect. This would be completely unaffordable for the local authority, even if there was 10% social housing. What is the point in that? What is the point in giving fast-track planning permission for housing which, even if it is constructed, is totally unaffordable and totally unsuitable, does nothing to address the housing crisis and may not even deliver social housing? There is no point in doing that. When the Government introduced this legislation, we were told it would help to address the housing crisis. That was the central context and was why people did not oppose it at the time. Now it is becoming clear that it is not doing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not delivering housing at all in many cases. There is evidence that sites are being sold on after planning permission has been obtained. Rather than delivering affordable housing, this scheme is facilitating flipping, speculating and hoarding. We are calling on the Taoiseach to scrap it because it is being used and abused by property speculators. The Government must start do what we called for all along, even at the time of the legislation, namely to build public and affordable housing on public land on the scale that was done in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. The Government seems to claim it cannot be done in the 21st century. We do not believe the Taoiseach. The developers are telling the Government what to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As Hurricane Lorenzo careers towards this country, we have further evidence of the greater frequency of extreme weather events and of what the scientists tell us are the results of climate change. The Taoiseach says he wants to do something about that. However, this week - I want to ask if this was discussed at the environment committee - the Government is going to put forward a liquid natural gas terminal, which will cost hundreds of millions, to be built on the Shannon Estuary as a project of common interest on a list for the European Union to import fracked gas, potentially locking this country into the use of fossil fuels and dirty, dangerous fracked gas from the United States for decades to come. That is being done without the approval having been discussed at the joint committee or here in this House. It is absolutely outrageous. As we speak, there are people here from Pennsylvania and other parts of the United States who have come to give testament to the extraordinary pollution, damage and adverse health effects that have been inflicted on the people of Pennsylvania and elsewhere from this fracked gas. Mark Ruffalo, the actor, has been tweeting all week appealing to the Government not to approve this terminal because of the damage to human health and the environment fracking is doing in the United States. We banned fracking in this country because we did not want those effects in our countryside. Do we think simultaneously that it is okay to inflict them on the people of the United States for a so-called transitional fuel which in actuality is every bit as dangerous for global warming as carbon dioxide when we take into account methane leakage?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we look at the mob scenes at the DUP meeting and Boris Johnson being part of that mob last night, and we consider that Johnson is clearly willing to risk everything in this country, economically and politically, I think people should be a little less keen to join in the sort of Johnson-type attacks on Jeremy Corbyn. There are a few things we know about Jeremy Corbyn. First, he is very committed to peace on this island and to Ireland in general, and he takes these issues very seriously. Unlike Johnson, he does not want a race to the bottom, not just for the North but he does not want a race to the bottom for Britain in the context of exit. He has said that he wants to remain in the customs union, so many of the problems Johnson's version of exit would cause would not even be at stake if we had a Corbyn government. Is it not the fact, whatever the Taoiseach might think about him ideologically and all the rest of it, that in the context where a general election is now looming and, indeed, may be the only way we can actually stop a hard Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn is the best of all options available in terms of the outcome of the British general election?
