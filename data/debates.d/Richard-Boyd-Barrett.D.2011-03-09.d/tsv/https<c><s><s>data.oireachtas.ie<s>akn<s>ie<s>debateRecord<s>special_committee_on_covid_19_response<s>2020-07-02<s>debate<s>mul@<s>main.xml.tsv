RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses. I would like to pay tribute to the National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, the EPIC working group, the EIAI and all the arts workers and crew who have made their voices heard. It is good that their campaigning has led to an additional â‚¬20 million in funding, although it is worth saying that is against a backdrop of historically low levels of support for culture and the arts in this country relative to our European counterparts. EPIC, the NCFA and all in the arts and entertainment sector want to know whether the other asks are being considered and whether they will be recommended to the Government.These are Government decisions but the key is whether the Department is going to recommend them to it. They want to know if the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme will be retained. Will they get certainty on that, particularly in view of the fact that there is a very strong likelihood that they will not get back to normal levels of activity and employment and income for the foreseeable future? Is Ms Licken going to recommend that those payments be retained for them? What does Ms Licken make of the long-standing demand - now even more important - that the national broadcaster and other broadcasters be required to produce a minimum percentage of perhaps 40% to 50% of domestic cultural output? This might be music, drama or other forms and it would be a big boost for artists and arts workers. Workers in the sector also asked about local authority arts budgets. This is not within the Department's remit but, again, it should be recommended to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that local authority budgets for the arts and entertainment should be ring-fenced and protected. While there may be an underspend in the context of those streams of funding this year, that should not lead to reductions in them into next year. Does Ms Licken support those demands and will she be recommending them to the Minister? I want a chance to ask another question when I hear the answers, so I ask the witnesses to keep their answers brief enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have only one minute left and I want to ask one further question, if Ms Licken does not mind. It concerns the film industry, which she referred to in her answer. The Government's clearly stated policy with the wage subsidy scheme was that it wanted to maintain the relationship between workers and employers. In the film industry - which is essentially publicly-funded by means of section 481 - all of the film producers terminated the employment of every single member of their crews rather than put them on the wage subsidy scheme on 12 March. That showed direct and flagrant disregard for stated Government policy. Is Ms Licken aware of this and what does she think of it? To me, it is completely unacceptable. This seems to be another example of film producers not wanting to take responsibility for employees. Most of the time they deny that they have any employees at all. How can they draw up health and safety guidelines for the reopening of film production in the wake of Covid-19 when they have no employees to consult about those guidelines?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were no PAYE employees on the working group on the guidelines. There were none, even though that is Government policy. Let us be clear on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Falvey should note the Abbey Theatre used the wage subsidy scheme and kept its employees. It did what the Government asked, which was to maintain the relationship between employers and employees. It is publicly funded. Why did the film producers not do the same thing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not the film producers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is caviar a substantial meal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is just a proposal, Chairman, which maybe the panel will comment on or they will pass it up the line. This is a serious proposal. We have four fewer bank holidays than is the average in Europe. I suggest it might be a good boost, particularly at the moment, although at any time, for both culture and tourism, and indeed for workers generally, but especially in the context of Covid if we are talking about re-energising those specific sectors, to have additional bank holidays and bring us up to the level of the average number of European bank holidays.
