RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 19 measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, all of which will have very far-reaching effects on ordinary people, particularly working people.  For some of us it looks like a menu to make ordinary working people work longer and harder for less over the course of their lifetimes, particularly hitting the least well off and manual workers who will be forced to work longer.  To push all those measures through in such a short time without allowing adequate time for debate is a subversion of democratic debate in this House and this country.In this regard, the Taoiseach should examine what is happening in Slovenia where there has been a referendum on the issue of raising the retirement age.  The people of Slovenia were consulted in a proper referendum on this very serious measure and they voted 72% against raising the retirement age——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——but at least they had a proper public consultation and the right to have a say on what is by any standard a serious measure.  The Taoiseach will not give us a referendum.  He will not even allow a proper debate in the Dáil on such a serious measure.  I appeal to him to allow for proper debate on what is a very serious attack on the rights and entitlements of working people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In light of the Taoiseach's reply to the questions, will he explain where is the consistency in his policy on this matter of the so-called bailout deals, either with the IMF-EU or with Britain, Sweden and Denmark?  Prior to the election, the Taoiseach's party policy was that it was neither morally right nor economically sustainable to beggar the Irish taxpayers to enrich speculators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the consistency——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——between the loans and the answer just given by the Taoiseach, to the effect that he refuses even to raise the issue of this punitive interest rate?  Why on earth would we thank the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, for imposing a punitive interest rate on the working and vulnerable people of our society in order to pay back bankers and bondholders?  This is punishment imposed on Irish working people for the reckless gambling of bankers and speculators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a final question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have asked the Taoiseach the same question on several occasions.  I would like to refer to an issue that was mentioned earlier by Deputy Martin.  A question I tabled on this subject was disallowed, inexplicably as far as I can see.  The question should have been before the House today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question that was disallowed related to whether the Taoiseach raised with President Obama the allegation that Mr. Geithner intervened on the matter of bondholders.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach is disallowing questions like that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question was phrased in a way that referred to the Taoiseach's meeting with Mr. Geithner.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am going to ask it.  I want to register the fact that it was disallowed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the substantial matter, I find it inexplicable that the proposal to burn unguaranteed senior bondholders was not pursued.  If it had been accepted, we would be talking about a lesser burden of €20 billion.  Apparently, such a proposal was being discussed at the time of Mr. Geithner's alleged intervention.  It would have made a difference of €20 billion to the Irish people.  Given that it would have funded 100 of the Government's jobs initiatives, it would have alleviated this country's unemployment crisis.  The Taoiseach is telling us that he did not raise the matter with President Obama.  He seems completely uninterested in whether this allegation is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Taoiseach happens to see the US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, perhaps he will raise this matter with him.  I suggest it is more serious than that, however.  Do we not need to know whether the policy of the US Government is to force the burden of the gambling debts of bankers and financiers onto the backs of Irish working people, while vetoing any attempt to relieve that burden?  Should the Taoiseach not want to know whether that allegation is true?  It is absolutely bizarre that he would not ask about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Taoiseach to explain why he is not taking this issue seriously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I rephrased it twice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach interested in whether he made them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not just an assertion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The failure of the Government to reverse the €500 increase in the student service charge is already a significant betrayal of the promises the Labour Party made before the election.  I believe "fighting to defend free education tooth and nail" was the expression used.  In that context, I must express great concern as, I suspect, many students do, about recent comments by the Minister, who stated there was no such thing as free education and that he would look seriously at how third level education would be funded.  That, along with the review he mentioned, leads me to believe that people, students in particular, should be very much afraid about plans to abandon yet another promise made before the election to defend free education and the extreme likelihood that fees are to be reintroduced in some shape or form.I wish to hear an assurance that this will not happen.  There are more important people than me who wish to hear this, namely students.  In addition, they wish to have an assurance in regard to the already unacceptable €500 increase in the service charge and the reductions in grants.  The pay many students receive for weekend work may now come under attack via the attack, or review, of the joint labour committees, JLCs and the registered employment agreements, REAs.  They need to know they do not face yet another attack in the form of student fees.The Minister knows, and if it were six months ago he would be saying what I say, that the introduction of fees would be a major disincentive to enter third level education, particularly for the less well-off in our society.  It would make a mockery of any proposals to develop a knowledge economy to aid economic recovery.  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that no tuition fees will be introduced, in any shape or form?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were two aspects to the Minister's response but not much time to examine them.  I merely point out that it is a political decision to effectively hand over the education budget of this country as interest repayments to bondholders.  We do not have to make this decision.  Does the Minister find it interesting that Greek students, among others, are on the streets now and because of their resistance to the austerity programme Europe is reconsidering restructuring the Greek debt and allowing the country more time to pay it?  Would we not be better off taking that sort of action rather than accepting these unacceptable restraints which are strangling our education system and forcing us towards unpalatable measures such as the introduction of fees?Given the restraints the Minister is under and given that his fellow Minister stated only minutes ago it was not possible to exempt any sector from pain, there is also a choice to be made in that regard, in terms of funding our services, education included.  Instead of service charges which are inevitably regressive and hit the lowest earners, we might consider putting taxes on the wealthy.  If we taxed the wealthy, which group this Government and the last one exempted from the pain, we could get the money elsewhere to fund our services.  However, that option never seems to be considered.  It is always about how we will squeeze more and more money out of people who cannot afford it.  If any further financial obstacles are put in front of people entering third level education this will be devastating for our prospects for economic recovery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if we made those who can pay tax?  Give me a break.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Buttimer's question is for me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Shall I answer that?
