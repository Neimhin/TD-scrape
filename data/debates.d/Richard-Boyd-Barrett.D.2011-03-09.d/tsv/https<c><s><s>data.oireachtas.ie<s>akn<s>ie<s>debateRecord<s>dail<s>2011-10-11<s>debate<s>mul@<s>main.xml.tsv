RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach not agree it is a bit tokenistic and a bit of a joke, frankly, to talk about commemorating the 1916 rebellion when this country is being recolonised by the dictatorship of the EU-IMF?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The best commemoration we could have for 1916 is to stand up together and tell the EU-IMF to get off our backs and stop asset-stripping this country——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Taoiseach tell us when the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill will come through the Dáil?  Can he clarify that this Bill will deal with raising the retirement age for public service workers and reducing their pension entitlements?Can the Taoiseach tell us exactly when the housing Bill, which is due to be published in 2012, will be published and introduced to the Dáil?  Can he confirm that this Bill will give a legal underpinning to the new policies on social housing outlined in June and July, which are effectively doing away with direct provision of council housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just do not understand what the legislation is, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought the Government Members were oracles.
