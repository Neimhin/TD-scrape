RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to spend much time on matters that have already been covered, such as the intricacies of medium-term objectives and the fiscal rules. I will concentrate on a view I hold and which was also expressed by a number of witnesses during our deliberations on the budget, which is that the fiscal space available, notwithstanding debates on whether we should recalculate it this or that way, is simply miserable compared with the requirements to invest in housing, health, education, public transport, climate mitigation and so forth. There is a list of strategically important areas of infrastructure spending and other forms of spending that will facilitate our economy becoming sustainable and robust in a volatile international environment. What does the Minister think about that? It is a very small amount of discretionary space to deal with the scale of the problems, most obviously, urgently and immediately the housing crisis. With regard to the housing crisis, does the Minister think that the plans, and the resources invested in them, are adequate to deal with the problem? The Minister has indicated that next year there will be 3,000 council houses and 5,000 social houses, whatever they are. That is against a background of 96,000 households on the list, although I believe that is an extremely conservative and, frankly, inaccurate figure. It is a drop in the ocean. Does the Minister not think we must dramatically increase the investment in social housing beyond what the Government has proposed in Rebuilding Ireland? Social Justice Ireland says we need direct build of approximately 90,000 units over the next few years, whereas the Government's Rebuilding Ireland programme for direct build provides for much less. From the point of view of fiscal prudence with regard to Rebuilding Ireland, has the Minister calculated the cost of HAPS payments over the next number of years as against the cost of direct build, that is, the efficiency of relying overwhelmingly on HAPS, the private sector and making payments to private landlords, which in Rebuilding Ireland currently represents approximately two thirds of the money going out on housing plans, as against direct build? I am referring to the financial cost of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the financial cost of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister compared, from a financial point of view, the efficiency of direct build as against HAPS? Direct build gives the State an asset and revenue stream, whereas the HAPS payment is money out that we do not recoup. Has the Minister done any mathematics on that? Again on housing and property, given the limited fiscal space and the need to raise revenue for housing and other things does the Minister not think that we should seek to have a form of landlords' tax or some taxes to get back some of the enormous profits that have been made by people in the property sector, such as landlords, vulture funds and so forth? Does the Minister think it is acceptable that he cannot even give us figures, unless he can do so today unlike in reply to questions I and others have asked to date, on how much tax will be forgone on the section 110 tax break? Everybody knows we are talking about hundreds of millions, if not billions, of euro. Does the Minister consider it fair or acceptable that we do not know how much tax is forgone under that tax break? Should we not seek to put special levies or taxes on that profit to give us some extra revenue? Has the Minister thought about or considered increasing employers' PRSI as another source of potential revenue? We have one of the lowest levels of employers' PRSI in Europe. It is probably one of the big differences between our tax regime and the regimes of other countries in Europe. Last year, for example, we proposed that if there was a higher PRSI band for employers' PRSI for people earning over €100,000 it would raise €600 million. Has the Minister looked at this? Our proposal was costed by the Minister's Department. A number of people have given evidence to the committee on many of the tax expenditures generally, such as research and development tax expenditures, REITs, losses brought forward and pension-based tax reliefs.One witness suggested there is in excess of €20 billion of tax expenditures. Has the Minister forensically looked at these and assessed whether they are good ways to expend tax revenue rather than changing them and getting extra revenue? Will the Minister get rid of the help-to-buy scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister give us the answer to the financial question on the housing expenditure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask one brief supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister confirm there is a change in the balance of public housing output as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland? At present, Rebuilding Ireland proposes 87,000 houses will be delivered out to 2020 through the housing assistance payment as opposed to 40,000 through various forms of direct provision. This is two thirds to one third, with two thirds being current expenditure going out, year in, year out. The Government has given a figure whereby if we hit the target, €800 million a year would be going out in housing assistance payment to private landlords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister considering shifting this balance? Surely the balance should be the other way around. Even if we accept the Minister's argument that the housing assistance payment is a temporary measure, Rebuilding Ireland does not propose it as a temporary measure. It proposes it as two thirds of the housing plan out to 2020. It is all money out the door with nothing returned in the long term as a State asset. Does the Minister propose to change it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mean the State building houses, which are then State assets and which generate rental revenue for the State, as against relying on private landlords and money going out the door every year that never comes back to us. It is just money out the door.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a financial matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A big one.
