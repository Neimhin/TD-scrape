RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier this week, I warned that the Government's eviction ban Bill might not protect people with notice-to-quit termination dates before its passage. Those concerns were dismissed. The Bill was published earlier and, sadly, it is very clear I was right. The Bill states explicitly that only those with termination dates that fall after its passage will receive protection against eviction. That means anybody who is overholding on a termination notice, as large numbers of those facing eviction are, through no fault of their own and purely because they have nowhere to go, still face the threat of eviction. Tenants often overhold on notices to quit based on the informal advice of councils. I am dealing with a family in Blackrock, a working couple with children who are terrified. They are not covered by the Bill. Will the Minister offer clarification, amend the Bill and accept our amendments to it? If not, he will have misled the public and the DÃ¡il.
