RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For months we have been asking the Government to increase the social housing income thresholds. There was an announcement a couple of weeks ago, but we have had no detail about that whatsoever. There needs to be a debate to establish what the new thresholds are and, critically, whether the thousands of people who were taken off the housing list in recent years because of the failure of the Government to increase the thresholds will be restored to the list. We also need to know what will happen to people who are above the new thresholds and what housing supports they will get if they find themselves threatened with eviction or homelessness or if they are unable to afford market prices on houses. Those matters need to be discussed before the end of this term. Will we get a commitment from the Government to that effect?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we have a debate or statements on the matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we have statements on the thresholds before the end of term?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been asking for this for months.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Egyptian authorities arrested 1,540 Egyptian people in the weeks just before COP to prevent them organising protests. Thousands of people have been imprisoned and detained. Even when they get judicial orders for their release, they disappear. Alaa Abd El-Fattah has been imprisoned for five years for “spreading fake news”, by which it is meant that he utters words critical of the El-Sisi regime. Did the Taoiseach even raise these issues with the Egyptian authorities, never mind question whether it was appropriate to go to a conference held in a country whose regime is so brutal that it crushes even the mildest voices of criticism of the El-Sisi regime?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is pretty clear that the Government is using the appalling war Putin launched in Ukraine, which we all condemn, to move us ever closer to NATO. Last week, I asked why NATO assessors were assessing Irish troops in County Cork-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in recent weeks and I still have not heard an explanation. These assessors were headed up by a military commander of the US Navy. This follows on from our participation in the Ukraine defence contact group which, according to the US Secretary of Defence, is part of NATO and whose first meeting was held on a NATO base in Germany. It is absolutely clear that the Irish Government is disregarding this country's neutrality and the commitment of this majority of people in this country to that neutrality in order to align us with NATO to the extent that we now have NATO commanders assessing our troops in County Cork.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What were they doing in Cork then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With NATO.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I doubt that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He cannot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One terrible aspect of the absolutely dire housing crisis over which the Government is presiding is that people with very serious medical conditions are looking to gain medical priority but waiting months for their cases to be looked at, even though they are in dire situations, clearly because of lack of resources for medical assessment in local authorities. Something needs to be done about it urgently. I will give the Taoiseach a few examples: a 73-year-old with a very severe spinal condition who is couch-surfing with family members and being asked for more and more reports; a man of 66 receiving cancer treatment who was sleeping in his van, has made several attempts on his life and has still not been properly assessed; a woman who was for nine hours on a dialysis machine and who submitted medical forms in November of last year; and a 68-year-old man who is epileptic and facing the possibility of eviction, having submitted his stuff in September. The list goes on. Something urgently needs to be done about vulnerable, unwell, mostly elderly people not having their housing needs assessed quickly and efficiently.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a massive backlog.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about medical assessment.
