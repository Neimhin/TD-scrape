RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the international and EU division of the Taoiseach's Department at all concerned about the massacre that Israel has been perpetrating against unarmed protesters in Gaza for the last number of weeks? Two days before those protests began I begged the Taoiseach to condemn and speak out against any likely Israeli armed attack on those protests but the Taoiseach ignored me in the Dáil that day. I have asked the Taoiseach about this every week since then, as the death toll has risen to 42. Unarmed protesters who represent no threat to human life have been shot down by Israeli armed forces. Those forces have admitted, in the face of protests by Israeli and Palestinian civil society, that they are using the rules of war and military engagement to deal with unarmed protesters. The UN has spoken out on this. Last week Mr. Ilan Baruch, the former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, compared what has been done in the last few weeks to Bloody Sunday. He said that these events are Palestine's Bloody Sunday but are happening week in, week out. He condemned the European Union, including Ireland, for its failure to use diplomatic means to deter Israel from such direct and brutal violence towards unarmed, non-violent Palestinian demonstrators. He asked if Irish and EU leaders preferred profitable economic co-operation with Israel over upholding international human rights. He went on to say that firing live ammunition at non-violent, unarmed demonstrators is "an act of inconceivable brutality, yet standing indifferently on the sidelines is inconceivable, too". He accused European governments, including the Irish Government, of doing exactly that. Where is the condemnation? Where are the expulsions and sanctions? We have absolute, deadly silence. Teenagers are being mowed down by snipers and nobody is doing anything. I ask the Taoiseach to say something about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned the expenditure planned in arts, heritage and culture in Project Ireland 2040. Did the committee discuss the absolutely shameful decision to sell the State's share in what are effectively the national film studios? They are both an important part of Ireland's cultural and film heritage and an important location for developing the film industry. Over the past number of weeks it was barely reported and seems not to have been discussed at all. The Comptroller and Auditor General must investigate the circumstances of the sale. When it was first mooted there might be a sale, the estimated value of the Government's share was €15 million. It has been reported in the press that the sale took place for €6 million but as part of the sale, €7 million in debt owed by Ardmore was written off, meaning we gave away the State's share in Ardmore for nothing and gave the purchasers €1 million on top of that. The purchaser was a company set up three to four weeks before the sale went through. It did not have a history of involvement in the film industry, although some of the people involved are connected with a rival studio in Limerick. Frankly, this stinks to high heaven, particularly when six of Ardmore's seven purpose-built stages have been empty for a period when there is supposed to be a lack of capacity in the Irish film industry. Films are being made in derelict NAMA buildings on the South Circular Road and Tallaght, where there have been major protests and disputes by film workers about the conditions in which they work. The State's studio, meanwhile, has been sitting empty and then we flogged the share. It is extraordinary stuff.I could say more, but I do not have time. What is going on? Grants given by the Irish Film Board are never repaid. There are serious matters that need to be looked into in this area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did, but I got no answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did for 50 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the Deputy has.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Deputy Bríd Smith's question, the Minister was not around in 2008. However, he has direct responsibility for the concerns that were flagged by Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith and other scientists. They went as far as resigning from the quality assurance committee over this issue. That is not insignificant. They were so concerned about the inferiority of the testing regime that would result from outsourcing it to the United States. They had evidence to back that up. I refer to the view that thtanumber of missed positives would be significantly higher with the outsourcing. Can the Minister tell us they were wrong? That matters not just in respect of the 208 people but in respect of every single person who has been screened and who will be screened. I have been asked to ask the Minister about the retests now being promised to anyone who wants one. Who will do the tests? Will the tests be inferior? I refer to what Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said - he is saying it as we speak - about the problems that have emerged inevitably emerging because of the difference and the mismatch between standards here and in the United States. Can the Minister assure people that they were wrong? The academy that was mentioned, the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine, is saying the whole thing should be repatriated now. Does the Minister agree? Should it be repatriated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all agree with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all agree with the screening programme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all know the screening programme saves lives. Let us be absolutely clear: we believe people should avail of that screening programme. Furthermore, anyone who is concerned should immediately seek to be screened. There is no question about that. The issue at stake – to be honest, the Minister knows this – is whether the standard of that screening system was inferior as a result of the decision to outsource it. That fear was well-flagged by eminent people who had evidence. It is not simply that they thought and speculated. They had evidence based on Quest and the fact that in the USA the particular nature of the screening programme meant that 1.2 out of 100 rather than 1.8 out of 100 – the rate achieved here – from the same sample population was the average rate. That means the tests were missing people who had abnormal cells. The difference is one third and that is very serious. Were some of the 208 people victims? Were some of the others to whom the Minister referred in the bombshell that has been dropped tonight victims? Were others who have been tested and who may have had false negatives victims of the fact that we may have a screening system inferior to the system we would have had if we had taken the advice of David Gibbons, Sam Coulter-Smith and the scientists? That is very important. There is a political line of responsibility there. Does the Minister agree that it is very important?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the politicians who made this decision were wrong, they are accountable for what is happening. If that contributed to the scandal that has now unfolded, they are accountable. Does the Minister agree with that? That is an important question. Is it not strange? Can the Minister explain this to me? The then Opposition spokesperson, James Reilly, flagged these concerns in the Dáil in 2008. When he got into government, why did he not follow through on it? He expressed in the Dáil exactly the same concerns that Sam Coulter-Smith and David Gibbons had expressed very strongly. When he was appointed Minister, he did absolutely nothing about it. His successor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, did nothing about it. The Minister has done nothing about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is not up yet.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Having raised those concerns and echoed those concerns in 2008, why did Fine Gael not then immediately look into it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----when it got into power to see if Sam Coulter-Smith-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is not up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not. He has two and a half minutes at the end.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has two and a half minutes at the end.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not in the Order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has still two and a half or three minutes left.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is just Fine Gael messing around in the Chair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is Fine Gael messing around in the Chair. That is outrageous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What you have done is outrageous, Acting Chairman. You have just cut across my time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is rubbish. You are shouting us down when serious questions are being asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Now the Minister has two and a half minutes remaining, one minute after you interrupted me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on, a minute is going begging. I will-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said today that failure to tell the 167 women would not have changed their outcomes. That is true because they had already been diagnosed with cancer. Had that disclosure happened then, the storm we are having now would have happened then prompting the changes and alerts about the possible problems with the tests. In fact, it may have saved other lives and prompted earlier diagnoses of false negatives that may have happened subsequently. Is that not the case?
