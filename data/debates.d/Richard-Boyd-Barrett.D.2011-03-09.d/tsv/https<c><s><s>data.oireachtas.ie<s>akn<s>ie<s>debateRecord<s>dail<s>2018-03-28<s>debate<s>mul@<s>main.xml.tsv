RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am joking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The last questions are mine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much time is the Ceann Comhairle allocating for each block?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be happy to cut my very specific question about correspondence to six or seven minutes-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and then give extra time to the other two.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am so helpful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Taoiseach not accept that telling a joke about assisting Donald Trump with a planning matter was at best an embarrassing mistake but at worst conveyed a desire to cuddle up to the US President and make common cause with him rather than criticise him for some of his dangerous and, in many cases, obnoxious policies? I say this in all seriousness, setting aside the debate as to whether the Taoiseach was naive, whether he lost his nerve, etc. There was a more serious side to this, which was a desire to show common cause. We might help a multimillionaire like Trump on a planning matter or perhaps it was just a joke. However, it was not very funny from the point of view of the people who take these things seriously. It was part of a pattern, as the Taoiseach also, incredibly, commended Donald Trump on reducing taxes on corporations and pointed out how similar this was to Irish policy. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that the race to the bottom in respect of corporate tax, whatever about Irish domestic policy, is not a good thing in a world where it is contributing directly to growing inequality in the distribution of wealth? Did the Taoiseach have a conversation about the Salisbury attack, which had happened prior to his visit, and were there discussions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----about possible diplomatic retaliation? Whatever about Putin being an authoritarian, which he certainly is, and a dangerous force, Donald Trump is clearly ratcheting up-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the cold war confrontation as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a stretch.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us avoid that indignity at least.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Honesty is an important prerequisite to serious debate. Deputy Martin said that those who are critical of the decision to expel are defending Russia, in response to which I noted the Taoiseach was nodding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy did say it. As recently as last week, Deputy Gino Kenny and I condemned the behaviour of Russia on the floor of the Dáil. We asked the Government to bring in the Russian ambassador to answer questions about what Russia is doing in Syria. Lest anybody is in any doubt, Putin is an authoritarian war monger but this does not, however, mean that Russia is guilty, without evidence, of what happened in Salisbury, nor does it mean that, therefore, President Trump and the European Union are without sin in an escalating cold war. Do we think President Trump, in his expulsion of Russian diplomats, is any less of a dodgy authoritarian or at least in the same league as Putin in his attitude to geopolitical affairs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are the Russians trying to hack? Definitely. We are all aware of the scandal that unfolded recently in regard to Facebook, an American company which gave information to Cambridge Analytica, which is being used to subvert democratic elections. The Russians and the Americans are dodgy and there are spies in the Russian embassy, the American embassy and the Israeli embassy. Let us be even handed in all of this. What is required is a bit of consistency. I ask the Taoiseach for consistency in dealing with these matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said a substantive response is usually given to any correspondence his Department receives within an appropriate time. I have a specific question about a piece of correspondence dealing with a serious matter. It relates to a whistleblower whose story and the issue he brought to public attention featured in a "Prime Time Investigates" programme in 2015. It involved a company called Eurosurgical which was subsequently wound up with big tax liabilities. The company was exposed as having given gifts to procurement managers in 13 different hospitals to manipulate the tendering process and to get contracts to sell surgical equipment to those hospitals. It was very serious stuff. It was exposed and brought to public attention by a whistleblower who formerly worked for that company. That whistleblower has requested some assistance from the Minister for Health. A journalist who helped break the story wrote to the Taoiseach on 31 October last to point out that the whistleblower has been blackballed ever since then. He cannot get a job anywhere in the private health sector because he blew the whistle. The whistleblower legislation does not apply retrospectively and it was passed after he had blown the whistle and done the State a service on a very serious matter. The State has offered the guy nothing and he cannot get a job. A letter was sent to the Taoiseach's Department and to the Minister for Health asking that they give this whistleblower some support and assistance. He has even spoken about going into the witness protection programme because of a fear of intimidation and retaliation. I ask the Taoiseach to look into this correspondence and to have the decency to respond in a serious manner to a whistleblower who has done the State a service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach could give him a reference.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Barry has outlined how a state of the European Union is engaged in pretty unacceptable and brutal repression of those protesting against injustice. There is also an ally of the European Union with preferential trade arrangements, Israel, whose actions we should consider as we come to Easter weekend. Easter, of course, commemorates the persecution of the Israelites by the Roman Empire during the time of Jesus Christ. I am not particularly religious, but nonetheless I note that it commemorates the crucifixion of somebody who spoke up for a persecuted minority. Most people in Europe now give allegiance to that religion. As we speak, in the very same land, the modern day Israelites are the Palestinians. This weekend, on Good Friday, there will be peaceful protests all over the land of Palestine. Members can see for themselves online. I suggest they read about the international co-ordination for the great return march. It is a protest that will involve all civil society groups and families who were dispossessed in 1948. All political parties in Palestine are supporting these protests, although they will not be visibly present because they want it to be a genuine grassroots protest. There is absolute commitment that there will be no violence. There will be totally peaceful sit-downs very close to the Gaza border and to the security line between the West Bank and Israel. This protest will run from Land Day, which is this Friday, until 15 May. The protestors are going to occupy the area of the security zone, and at some point they will peacefully approach the barriers, citing a United Nations resolution which gives refugees who have been dispossessed the right to return to their own country. They expect to be met with pretty brutal violence by the Israelis, who are already gearing up to attack the protests. If that happens I think it is terribly important that we, the Taoiseach and the European Union speak up for the Palestinian people, who are simply seeking to assert their right under international law, the right to return.The United Nations has just produced several reports detailing the continuing illegal expansion into east Jerusalem, Hebron and the Golan Heights. It has called for an end to this. There have been demolitions of houses and hundreds of young people have been jailed. Ahed Tamimi, a child, has spent eight months in prison. She joined hundreds of other children in administrative detention on having been arrested by the Israelis. Twelve elected representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council are in prison on administrative detention, most without any charge. We have to speak out. This is the weekend to do it if we care about rights, opposing oppression and persecution and preventing the violence from which these peaceful protesters are very likely to suffer. I invite all those who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause to a short Solidarity gathering outside the Dáil at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow in solidarity with the international march. I hope people will join that. Today the Central Bank is likely to recommend the closing down of the Sandyford printing press where we print euro notes. If its recommendation is implemented, Ireland will no longer have independent capacity to print currency. I do not know what will happen to the euro. It will probably last, and might last a long time, but we know from the most recent crisis that not being able to print our own currency in the event of a serious problem with the euro is very retrograde. The representatives of the workers at the press pointed out an extraordinary fact, namely, that much State printing - security printing - is outsourced but could be done in Sandyford, thereby preventing the closure. Did the Government know Irish stamps are printed in Australia? I did not know. Could this work and some of the other security work be given to the Sandyford printing press rather than having 45 jobs go, robbing this State of the capacity to produce its own currency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How long do we have for questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are only two questions and we have a while so we will give plenty of time to the Minister of State to reply. I want to press the Minister of State on the question of the nerve agent and the evidence on which the decision to expel a Russian diplomat was based. It was done on the word of British intelligence services, or perhaps it was that of the British Government alone, and then European leaders. There have been many references to the nerve agent. We all abhor the use of such agents. They are horrendous and the people responsible for their use should be brought to justice and prosecuted to the nth degree. However, what has not become clear - and I am asking the Minister of State if she can clarify the position in this regard - is the actual evidence that has been provided. I attended the Tánaiste's briefing yesterday. He said, frankly, that there is no smoking gun. He actually used the phrase, "There is no smoking gun". That worries me because two and two have been added together and we have got five. We are being told that a nerve agent was used - and we all agree that is unacceptable - and we think it was used by Russia. However, there is no evidence directly connecting Russia to what happened. Can the Minister of State shine any light on this? "Most plausible" or "highly likely" are not thresholds for making decisions that are really very serious for us. Can the Minister of State respond on that point? The other explanation was that it was the only plausible explanation. There are, however, other plausible explanations. This material was produced from the 1970s, often in states that are now not under Russian control. We know that it is very likely that in some areas which broke away from the Soviet Union, central government lost control over materials like that. I am not saying that the Russians did not do it, but to say there is no alternative plausible explanation in the absence of a smoking gun does not add up.On the issue of double standards, specifically in respect of Palestine, if our line as an ethical foreign policy is that we are not going to put up with states that engage in behaviour which we consider to be beyond the Pale and that we are going to expel people, will that extend to what Israel is doing in flouting international law in its treatment of the Palestinians? Even when the United Nations is saying and producing reports in the past few weeks to the effect that Israel is doing things that are absolutely in direct violation of UN resolutions and international law, there are no expulsions or talk of sanctions. There is nothing. Is that going to change? Can we at least have some consistency in our foreign policy stances?
