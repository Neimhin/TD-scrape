RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the weekend, there was further evidence of the desire of Fine Gael to abandon Ireland's neutrality with its resolution to get rid of the triple lock arrangement and, essentially, create more flexibility for the Government to deploy Irish troops in military adventures and conflicts. That is an outrageous attack on our neutrality and is not in line with what the majority of people want. Could the Taoiseach comment on whether he supports this line of thought? Will we remove one of the important restrictions on any Government abandoning our neutrality and further galloping towards the involvement of this country in NATO or the project of EU militarisation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is visiting NATO bases for fun.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The US is too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I note the Taoiseach mentioned climate change and security. I wonder did he raise the point that the single biggest institutional emitter of CO2 emissions in the world is the United States military. Did he raise the point that major military powers are not even required to reveal their CO2 emissions? We count everybody else's emissions but we do not count the US military's emissions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because there have been estimates done which suggest it produces about 51 million tonnes per year but it is not required to reveal that. I find it amazing that the Deputy would even joke about something as serious as that. Did the Taoiseach ask for that? How does he tally his commitment to increase military expenditure and the EU's commitment to increase military expenditure when there is a direct relationship between the size of military activity, armies and so on and the level of CO2 emissions and climate damage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked about the military and emissions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While their army just keeps-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach totally ignored my question. He cannot answer it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. You are a puppet for the Americans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, we were not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, we were not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record, when Bertie Ahern was shaking the hand of Vladimir Putin, some of us were protesting outside the Russian embassy about Putin's bloody and murderous invasion of Chechnya. I did not see the Taoiseach there. We are consistent. He is right when he says we are against illegal annexations in eastern Ukraine by Russia. Nobody should facilitate such things; he is right. Next Tuesday, 29 November, is UN day of solidarity with the Palestinian people. Every single year, the UN General Assembly reaffirms its commitment to the Palestinian right to return of approximately 7 million to 8 million Palestinian refugees who are denied that right by the apartheid state of Israel. What sanctions will the Government take against Israel, or propose to the UN or the European Union, over their continued support to Israel, when it commits crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people and denies the vindication of their right to return under UN resolution?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We campaigned for that for years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Paul Murphy and Mick Barry. In the middle of a debate on an unprecedented and utterly dire housing and homelessness emergency, the Minister responsible for housing said there is no emergency and has now left the debate before it is over.If people did not have enough reasons to come out on the street this Saturday for the Raise the Roof demonstration, that show of contempt for the people who are suffering as a result of the failure of this and the previous Government to deal with a crisis that is causing so much trauma, hardship and suffering for tens of thousands of families should give them a reason now. They should get out on the streets because, frankly, people are fed up, sick and tired of the spoof, dishonesty and denial from the Government. I urge them in the strongest terms to get out on the streets this Saturday in their thousands and, it is be hoped, tens of thousands, assemble at Parnell Square and march to this building to frighten the living daylights out of a Government that does not seem to understand the pain and suffering its policy failures are inflicting. It is an insult for the Government to deny there is a housing emergency. Nearly 11,000 families, including 3,000 children, are in homeless accommodation. Rents have gone up another 14% in the past year. Record house prices mean the vast majority of young and working people can never dream of owning their own home. There is no protection for tenants against unfair and unjustified evictions. There are 122,000 families on various housing waiting lists. In many cases, they are waiting up to 20 years for homes. The Government has said we do not have any solutions, but the solution is staring it in the face. There are 166,000 empty homes in the country. Very often they are in the hands of vulture funds, investors and speculators who make more money the worse the housing crisis gets. That is the essence of this crisis. I have mentioned St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire many times. It comprises 17 apartments and the landlord is trying to bully and intimidate the remaining tenants until they leave. Such developers are making money every day the housing crisis gets worse because their property becomes more valuable. They know that and are allowed to act in that way. Let us consider the response of the Government to that. In my area, there are 4,226 people on the housing, HAP and RAS transfer lists. Another 2,825 people will join those lists during the period of Housing for All. Over the next five years, 7,051 people alone will need council housing. However, the Government is planning to build 2,318 units. There will be more people on housing lists in Dún Laoghaire at the end Housing for All than there is now. There will be more suffering, people homeless and trauma and neglect for families and children. I do not have the time to read most of a letter to the Minister, who has just walked out, but I will read a bit of it. He will receive it shortly. The letter states:We are being evicted. I am 55 years living in my home. My parents are living in it since 1958. They are since deceased. I was led to believe all my life we were safe as long as we were lifelong tenants. When we were in a position to buy our home we were told it was not for sale. The woman that is now selling it does not even know me or my family. I need your help because we cannot fix this situation and we are running out of time. So when you are at home this Christmas sitting having your Christmas dinner and sitting back enjoying your family please have a picture of my family sitting in our car at the side of the road having no Christmas because we do not have a home. My darling beloved husband will be put into an early grave as he is a broken man, dad and husband.That is what we are putting people through, and this Government shows nothing but contempt for them.
