RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Dr. Collins for attending. I welcome the fact that he welcomes our focus on this. It is an area about which everyone needs to think more. I wish there was more media attention on it. There is major debate in respect of direct expenditures in the budget. There is almost no debate about the massive amount of money that could be used for other things but is accounted for by tax expenditures, many of which could arguably be described in layman's terms as tax loopholes. It is controversial, but some of them certainly are. Whatever we may think about some of these expenditures they should at the very least be scrutinised and they are not. I will go as far as to say it is a hidden economy on which nobody is focusing. Due to the fact that it is shrouded in technical language, people do not pay much attention to it or understand it. While I am here, I call on the media to scrutinise this area and pay the same attention to it that I hope the committee will. There is a lot of really important stuff here. I welcome Dr. Collins' initial comments. I have a few questions about establishing the scale and extent of tax expenditures. Dr. Collins stated that some €21 billion could arguably be described as discretionary. That is a major amount and needs to be scrutinised. I hope this committee will do so. I wonder if the figure is greater than that. I am not an accountant like Dr. Collins. He can provide a more expert opinion on this. In the corporate tax area, I showed a table in the last committee meeting that was provided by Mr. Seamus Coffey, based on Revenue figures in his report on corporate taxation. In 2015, the last year for which figures were available when he produced his report, pre-tax gross profits were €144 billion. By the time allowances and deductions were allowed for the taxable profit came down to about €70 billion. The actual tax collected was about €7 billion. On a straight calculation that means the figure of 12.5% is a total fantasy. There is no 12.5% corporate tax rate. Similarly, on a straight-line basis, there were about €77 billion worth of corporate tax reliefs, credits, deductions and allowances, which is a lot more than €21 billion. I would like Dr. Collins to outline his understanding of that. The explanation we got on the previous occasion was that some of those are just part of the tax base. Dr. Collins referred to that in his introduction. They are part of the administration of the tax system and are not really discretionary tax expenditures. I have to question how that distinction is made. Dr. Collins referred to intra-group transactions as an example of things that are administrative and not really discretionary. In comparing the Revenue table for 2016 with that for 2015, I see that tax relief for intra-group transactions jumped from €2.9 billion to €9 billion. That is not administrative. Something else is going on when tax relief for intra-group transactions goes from €2.9 billion to €9 billion in one year. My guess is it has something to do with the big IT companies moving royalties on intellectual property around. It is not just administrative. It is actually a huge loophole, at least potentially, and it needs to be scrutinised. I would like Dr. Collins to comment on that. Does he think that corporate area is one we need to heavily scrutinise? From my observations and certain allegations that have been made to me by people in the film industry for example, which we talked about last week, it seems costs are being massively inflated in certain circumstances in order to benefit from tax reliefs. To what extent are we checking that those are legitimate? Expenditures and allowances need to be heavily scrutinised. However the practices have been followed for years. As such it is felt that we do not need to look at them, only at the ones introduced in the past few budgets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dr. Collins said that every tax expenditure - and I absolutely agree with him on this - is money that could be spent in a different way on the same sector or on something completely different. Does he believe that as part of proper scrutiny that there needs to be a comparison done on that? Let us take two examples that we looked at recently. The research and development tax credit is up to €700 million a year. It is nearly €1 billion and has jumped significantly. That is overwhelmingly going to benefit that same small group of multinationals we are talking about. They are the ones that benefit most from it. In order to assess whether that is good use of public money, one of the things one would need to do is to ask what would happen if we took €700 million and invested it in public universities for research purposes which would generate a better impact for Irish society, economy, research and development and innovation. To me that is a no-brainer. If we put €700 million into our universities, it would be far better than giving €700 million to Apple, Google and Facebook in terms of the impact on stimulating our own economy and a more sustainable economy. That is just my view. Would Dr. Collins agree that is one of the things we need to look at? Similarly, in respect of the film industry, section 481 in its existence involved approximately €1.7 billion going to the film industry, comprising between €80 million to €90 million a year between the various sources. There were claims that there were 17,000 jobs in the Irish film sector but when this was scrutinised and challenged, it came down to a figure of 2,000. One could add to that that the film industry got €1.7 billion over ten years but where is the infrastructure? What does the State own for the €1.7 billion forgone? We do not own any studios. We have absolutely nothing. We have hardly any jobs and hardly any infrastructure. What exactly did we get for our money? Some people will say we got a number of films made, and let them put that argument. A useful way to establish whether that was good or bad expenditure, would be to ask the following question. What would have happened if instead we had invested that money in building public studios and employed people directly to make films? If we did it that way, would there be a greater benefit? Those are just two examples I can think of. Does Dr. Collins believe that in general we need to look at those sorts of comparisons in order to assess the effectiveness and the usefulness of tax expenditures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a couple of brief questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there potential for significant abuse in the area of capital allowances, deductibles and reliefs of various sorts in the corporate area? I am of the opinion that there is. How do we scrutinise such allowances to prevent abuse? I refer to company cars and supposed business trips which confer a very significant benefit on the traveller. Is it in the public interest for a businessperson to stay in a five star rather than a three star hotel? We need to drill down into the detail of reliefs and claims to ascertain whether the measures are being abused or the public interest is being served and the policy objective met. Dr. Collins referred to assets. Assets may be valued in a particular way that suits the tax objectives of a corporation. I have seen company books which indicate that assets were valued at a certain level in one year and that in the next their value jumped or reduced. That has very convenient consequences for the company in terms of its tax liabilities. Is there significant potential for abuse in that area? I do not know the number of reliefs available, but it is substantial. How do we dig into the detail to get to the nitty gritty of whether these measures are justified, beneficial or effective?  I ask Dr. Collins to elaborate further on the issue of what is in the base and what is discretionary. I am curious about that matter because estimates of tax expenditures range from €5 billion. Dr. Collins referred to a figure of €21 billion. I asked about the €70 billion worth of allowances and deductions under the corporate heading alone. How do we ascertain what should reasonably be in the base? Given the paucity of information on these matters and the fact that the area has not been focused on, nearly everything needs to be looked at. We can then consider whether it is fair to put something into the base or if it needs further scrutiny.
