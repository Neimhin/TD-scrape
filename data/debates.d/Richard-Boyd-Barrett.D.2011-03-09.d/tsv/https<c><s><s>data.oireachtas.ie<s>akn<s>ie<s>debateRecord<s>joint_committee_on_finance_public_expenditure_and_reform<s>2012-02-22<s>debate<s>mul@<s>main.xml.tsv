RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for arriving late to the meeting and missing the beginning of the presentation.  I am particularly sorry because the subject of pensions completely befuddles me.  I find it difficult to get my head around the subject.  The only thing I fully understand about this Bill is that it will raise the pension age to 68 years, which in my view is appalling.  I suppose it is a done deal from the Government point of view but from the point of view of society it is really a shocker because it is a backward step for society.  We are forcing people to work longer and harder for less money.It is stated the Government claims there will be a saving of €1.8 billion but the delegation questions whether this saving will be achieved for the reason that the Government is assuming wages will keep ahead of inflation and this certainly does not seem to be the case at the moment and quite possibly it will not be the case in the foreseeable future, given the way things are moving.  How far off could the Government be in its prediction or is it difficult to calculate?  It is a significant statement because if the Government does not realise the savings - which are required to be made according to the arithmetic of the troika agreement - if the maths are incorrect, are off, and the expected savings do not materialise, then the troika will have to come looking for other things.  Is this a fair assumption?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the other point I understood, that it is based on median earnings now rather than on final salary.  I would like to hear some more about that point.  I suppose the one piece of public sentiment the Government could trade on - given the scapegoating of public sector workers the Government could probably trade on quite a lot of public sentiment - one that it could convincingly argue is that pensions based on final salary of very highly paid public servants could reasonably be examined.  How could it be organised to get those on obscenely high salaries, top public servants and civil servants who are paid pensions while ensuring that low and middle income public sector workers are not hit with reduced pensions?  How could it be done differently from the way the Government has chosen to do it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We discussed this point on Second Stage.  Following Deputy McDonald's point, does this apply to politicians in the Dáil prior to the commencement date of the scheme?  If they lose their seats and subsequently get re-elected, will the scheme not apply to them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The old pension scheme will apply.  That is unbelievable.  These guys have some neck.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was reminded of some of the things I was trying to understand when the issue first arose.  I hope the information will penetrate my head fully and I will be able to deal with it on Committee Stage.On raising the pension age to 68, is it not fair to say any benefit the State might hope to accrue from this move will be counteracted by the fact fewer jobs will be available for young people at a time when people are mouthing great concern about the rise in youth unemployment?  I was shocked to hear the Government say recently it is now 27% in this country.  It is a fair point.  I do not know whether it was emphasised strongly.  I would like the delegation to comment on it.  It is an obvious consequence of this measure.Deputy Alex White resumed the Chair.
