RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My questions relate to the issue of corporate tax. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Féin have all made it clear that they are committed to retaining a low corporate tax regime, supposedly to lure in investment, as a key part of the State's economic strategy. As the Taoiseach knows, a small minority of Deputies question this attitude.I wonder how the Taoiseach will respond to allegations that are now circulating widely regarding the much-trumpeted ending of the so-called "double Irish". When its ending was first mooted in the finance committee, members initially were told this could not be done because Ireland could not act unilaterally but the Government is now trumpeting the fact that it has acted unilaterally to close off this tax scam. However, the allegation now circulating widely internationally is that the Government is simply replacing one tax scam with another in the form of the so-called patent box. I subscribe to this view but would like to hear the Taoiseach's response. For example, Nicholas Shaxson, the well-respected expert on the area of corporate tax avoidance has described the United Kingdom as a rogue state for its deployment of the so-called patent box system and has described it as an instance of naked capitalism in which states do everything they possibly can to reduce the tax burden on enormously profitable corporations. I put it to the Taoiseach that he is right. The "double Irish" was a scam that centred critically around the way in which profits were allocated by multinationals in the area of intellectual property. The Government reportedly closes off the "double Irish" and then sets up a new mechanism for corporations to reduce their tax obligations, precisely in the area of intellectual property. What is to stop such companies doing exactly what they have been doing up until now, that is, allocating vast amounts of their profits into this area of intellectual property, thereby artificially inflating its value to reduce their tax liability? This is what they have done thus far and there is no reason to believe they will do anything different under this patent box system. The evidence is this is precisely what they intend to do. Is the Taoiseach aware The Irish Times is now reporting on a discussion that apparently has been going on in the French media for a few days to the effect that Google is now thinking of closing its Bermuda operation and moving everything to Dublin? This is extraordinary when one considers that Google's Bermuda operation is a brass plate designed to avoid tax. Its response to the so-called closing off of the "double Irish" is to recognise that Ireland is a better tax haven than Bermuda under the proposals the Taoiseach has now outlined. Extraordinarily, these proposals in the first instance give four years to multinationals engaged in massive tax avoidance in which to work out new schemes and scams to avoid paying tax and after that four-year period, when they have been able to re-engineer their tax avoidance plans and policies, there will be something akin to treasure at the end of the rainbow in the form of this patent box system, which yet again will allow them to use the value of intellectual property to avoid paying tax. Does the Taoiseach not accept this is extraordinary, in the context of meeting President Obama and so on, when at the heart of the world's capitalist system even they are demanding that multinationals pay a bigger contribution from their enormous profits in tax while Ireland is being embarrassed and humiliated at an international level for acting as a tax haven? Moreover, instead of responding seriously by following an ethical policy in this matter and agreeing that Ireland should join in the increasing chorus of voices who find it obnoxious and obscene that vastly profitable multinationals should pay a lower proportion of their profits in tax than do ordinary workers, who pay approximately three to four times as much of their incomes proportionately in tax than do such multinationals, and five or six times as much in some cases, the Government, joined by the main Opposition parties, appears to be seeking and up to now has sought to continue to facilitate such corporate tax avoidance. Is this not shameful when Ireland, at the very least, should insist that such corporations pay something approximating the proportion of their profits in tax as does the ordinary worker? I believe they should pay more but would even this not be fair? Instead, the Government is facilitating further tax avoidance and is giving them the chance for four years to work out how they can avoid tax again under the new regime and at the end of that period is providing a new scheme for them to do precisely that, namely, the patent box. Is this not shameful? As for the climate change discussions, in his response to Deputy Martin, the Taoiseach mentioned the issue of forestry and its role as a carbon sink and in ameliorating climate change. I have had lengthy discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, on this matter because I strongly believe - and the Minister of State agrees - that to date, the State has underperformed spectacularly in terms of afforestation. This is a State in which the conditions for growing trees are more favourable than anywhere else in Europe but in which each year, we miss our afforestation targets by a long mile. These targets are missed when afforestation could be critical in helping us to meet climate change targets and to generate employment in spin-off industries, as well as deriving all kinds of value from tourism and amenity value and in developing renewable and sustainable energy. Although this is the case on so many different fronts, we are underperforming spectacularly in this area. It appears to me to be a matter of urgency, from every point of view, that something be done about this. Did the Taoiseach discuss this matter during his discussions on climate change and what are his views on it? For example, the McCarthy report identified that Coillte has half a million acres that it cannot afforest and which are doing nothing but gathering dust. The company states it either does not have the resources to invest in this land or that it would not be commercially viable from the narrow commercial model that Coillte operates. However, there are communities, co-operatives and environmental groups that would be very glad to get hold of some of that land to grow their own trees with all the positive benefits for local communities, climate change and all the rest of it. Is the Taoiseach thinking about this issue seriously, because this area has not being taken seriously to date?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council might have written a different pre-budget statement about the capacity of people to bear even more austerity because of the crisis memory, as referred to by Deputy Paul Murphy, had it been written following the demonstration last Saturday week. It got that very wrong. What the demonstration showed is that people have had enough and they are not willing to take any more. I apologise to the Minister for not being present for his speech. The reason I was late is because I was attending a meeting to organise the next big demonstration which will take place on 1 November. He will see that last Saturday week was not a one-off event but is part of a growing and sustained revolt throughout the country with people saying they have had it and they are drawing a line with water charges or any attempt to make them pay any more for the crimes of others such as bankers and bondholders. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has got it very wrong on that front. I have no problem with the concept of independent monitoring or overview of Government economic policy in terms of ensuring policies are not pursued which would create instability or crisis. I would equally say democratically elected Governments and, more important, the people who elect them must ultimately have the freedom to make their own decisions. I do not have a problem with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, saying he does not agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Government will do things in its own way because, ultimately, such decisions must be made by the people. The problem I have is that this so-called independent group has been set up by the troika and its main task has been to ensure ordinary people pay the price for a banking and financial crisis that was not created by them but was created by the financial institutions, the big political institutions in Europe and the political establishment in this country. Its main job has been to ensure ordinary people pay the price for that. That has been a terrible price. The choices we are offered are between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council saying we have to continue down this road and take a further €2 billion out of the economy, thus inflicting even more suffering on ordinary people, or the Government’s claim that we do not have to do it because its policies are such a fantastic success that it is not necessary to do so, that we are out of the woods now due to its policies which charted the way forward, and that perhaps the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council did not fully understand just how fantastically successful the Government’s policies have been, which is the reason it is not necessary to make a further cut of €2 billion. Both of those options are false, but there are aspects of truth in both. I agree with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's statement that the downside risks in terms of the European economy are such that we must be careful about the rather spectacular growth projections that are emerging. The IFAC has a good point to make about there being a serious danger involved in that regard. I worry a lot about the Government’s current triumphalism in terms of the projected growth it states will alleviate the debt burden, solve the deficit problems, and chart us on the way back to economic recovery and out of a boom and slump cycle. I do not see that at all. There is a problem with both the way the Government and the Fiscal Advisory Council look at the situation in that they have not identified what it is that produces the boom and bust cycle in the first place. The analysis of both parties has failed to address that fundamental question. As Deputy Paul Murphy indicated, there is a significant element of trying to rewrite what happened. The Government’s narrative, which it shares with IFAC, is that the problem was we were spending way beyond our means and therefore it was all about reining in public spending to avoid the boom and bust cycle. I put it to the Minister that is not what caused the crisis. I am amazed the Minister does not understand that and I am shocked beyond belief that IFAC, as a body of economic experts, does not understand it. Of course one needs a balanced budget and a link between expenditure and revenue, but the claim that such was the problem is simply not true. Our debt was manageable until the crash came. Our expenditure was not vastly outstripping revenue but what was a problem was the type of growth we had. At various times the Minister acknowledged the point, although even when he was in opposition he did not do much about it. Very few people - really only the left - called for a stop to what was happening and said the focus and disproportionate emphasis on the property sector was dangerous and was an accident waiting to happen that could result in an economic crash. That was the problem that led to the crash, which was facilitated by bankers, rather than us spending more than we were getting in revenue. I am worried about precisely the same thing now. There does not seem to be any real analysis either from the Government or IFAC about the type of growth that is necessary if we want to get out of the boom and bust cycle. Could the Minister clarify whether our plans for economic growth are based on sustainable models where one takes into account what we produce, for whom, and whether it is about meeting the needs of people and society or if it is just about growth numbers and balance sheets? That is the fundamental problem with the approach of both the Minister and IFAC. We need a different model that starts with what society needs, what people need and plans to meet those needs rather than the market model which is just about rampant, naked competition which is what produces the boom and bust cycle the Minister says he wants to get away from.
