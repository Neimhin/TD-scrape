RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am disappointed that the Taoiseach is not here.  His presence was requested by a number of Deputies in the Dáil last week.  Given the importance of this summit and its implications for the future of this country and its economy and people, it is very disappointing that the Taoiseach is not here.  In fairness to Members of the Oireachtas from all parties and groups who have turned up today, I ask that this meeting be extended.  Time is ticking away towards the end of the meeting.  The various spokespeople and I have been given a chance to speak.  Many others want to ask questions of the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The duration of this meeting should be extended, if necessary, to allow people to fully-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Stop heckling now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking on behalf of other Deputies from the Technical Group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Chair to keep the Deputies opposite quiet.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my request to the Minister.  We should consider extending the time for this meeting to allow others to ask questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not going to mention the events in Egypt and the Arab Spring until the Minister did so.  They are very relevant.  Some of us were in Egypt in 2004, 2005 and 2006 with the opposition groups that led the revolt this year.  We know the people directly involved.  We were quite aware that the revolt was coming in Egypt.  We said publicly that it was building.  It might be instructive and of interest to the Minister to mention what they revolted against.  The narrative favoured by the Minister and other western leaders attempts to separate the fate of this country from events like those in Egypt, Greece and elsewhere.  The Minister's analysis is seriously mistaken.  One of the major reasons for the Egyptian revolt, if not the major reason, was opposition to an IMF austerity programme implemented by Mubarak.  The programme involved privatising State assets, cutting the pay of public sector workers, reducing the number of such workers and attacking the subsidies for food and other basic things that are given to the people of Egypt.  Massive unemployment resulted from it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I assure the Deputy that this is very relevant because Egypt is coming here.  Just as we listened to the Minister, the Deputy and his colleagues should listen to what we have to say.  They do not like to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Facts are facts.  An IMF austerity programme, just like the ones being imposed in Greece and in Ireland, was imposed in Egypt.  After a few years of massive suffering, the people revolted.  The Minister said we should be obedient and should not have a general strike like that in Greece.  He said we do not want that sort of stuff.  He suggested we will somehow be better off if we are obedient and we toe the line of the EU-IMF austerity programme.  Does the EU statement not give the lie to that assertion?  In Greece, they have decided to burn the bondholders.  The EU-IMF-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were heckling me.  In Greece, the private sector will be burnt to the tune of €54 billion over three years, or €135 billion up to 2020.  We have been told this will be unique to Greece and will not happen here.  The Greeks will be allowed to burn the bondholders because they resisted.  The programme that the Minister is heralding as a great success does not involve the burning of bondholders here.  It will not bring about a write-down of this debt, which was not our debt in the first place.  That will not happen because we did not get out on the streets and protest.  Greece is getting some relief, at least, on the gambling debts of private bondholders.I would like the Minister to give a straight answer to a question.  Although he is heralding the reduction in the interest rate and a possible extension in the maturity dates of the loans, and so on, is it not the case that this deal guarantees that such changes will not make an iota of difference to working, vulnerable and poor people in our society who are being savaged with austerity, cutbacks and unemployment?  The conditionality of this deal is precisely that we maintain the drive towards austerity, privatisation-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking questions.  The Chair should give me a little more time because I was heckled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You have not.  There is no way my five minutes are up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly finished.  Under this deal, people will not get the relief they are demanding.  The EU statement also refers to collateral arrangements that may be required.  Can the Minister explain what those collateral arrangements might be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will more State assets have to be put up as collateral if we run into problems repaying our unsustainable debt?I will conclude by speaking about the restructuring of the banks.  Mr. Matthew Elderfield suggested yesterday that the cap on bankers' pay could have to be lifted.  Will this be allowed?  Are we being told by the EU and the IMF that the restructuring of the banks requires every available penny to be sucked out of the pockets of ordinary people and the potential funds that could be invested in jobs and economic recovery in this country and into the banks to recapitalise them?  Are we being told it is all right to impoverish the country and destroy its chances of economic growth-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but it is all right to raise the pay of top bankers to attract people into such positions?  Is that the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the conditionality on bankers' pay being cut?  Did the Minister raise the question of Ireland being allowed to put a stimulus in place?  As a result of the so-called-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we all start heckling now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You let everybody else speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked questions that were not answered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I got 15 minutes, while they got half an hour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They did.  I was watching the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The senior bondholders have been burned in Greece to the extent of €50 billion.  It is being said that this is specifically limited to Greece and that it will not apply here.  Why is Greece being allowed to burn its bondholders while we are not allowed?  Is it not as a result of the protests?In respect of our own situation, is not everything dependent on Ireland having economic growth?  If we do not meet the growth targets and require a second bailout, will other things be put up for collateral under these arrangements?
