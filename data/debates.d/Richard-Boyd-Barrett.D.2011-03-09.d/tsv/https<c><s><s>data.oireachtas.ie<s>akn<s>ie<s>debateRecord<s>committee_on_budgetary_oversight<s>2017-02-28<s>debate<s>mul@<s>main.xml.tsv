RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was shocked to hear that Peter had passed away. Obviously, the most important thing is to pass on our sympathies and condolences to his wife and family. Peter was somebody who was incredibly passionate about his particular area of interest, which was the whole area of banking. He had a passionate belief that the way in which we dealt with the financial crisis, given the responsibility of the banking sector and, for that matter, the regulators, was not the way we should have dealt with it. He was relentless, frankly, in his pursuit of those arguments. We have to give him great credit because it was motivated by a genuine belief. While there were some issues on which I would have disagreed with him quite profoundly, there were some, particularly in that area, where he did illuminate our understanding significantly. His dedication was extremely impressive. I remember him travelling with us to meet the finance committee of the Bundestag to make the case that the treatment of Ireland was despicable and mistaken, as he saw it, and he put a very persuasive and passionate case on that. It is a significant loss. All we can do is pay tribute to the man and the efforts he made while he was still here.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank everyone who has contributed today. I welcome the new measurements, because they help to give a more accurate picture of what is happening in the economy. People have already made the point about the practical problem that poses for how Europe measures us and what that means for official debt ratios, fiscal space and all of that. That is one dilemma but at least we now have information. It throws responsibility back on political authorities here, to some extent, to be prudent and realistic about where we are. My fear is that the debate will then be an austerity debate. The difference between GNI* and GDP given by Professor Lane is quite dramatic, at about 20%. That is a huge amount. That means that, far from Ireland being one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and a model economy, we are in a much worse, incredibly vulnerable position. That is what I would conclude from those numbers. Would Professor Lane agree that that is a more accurate picture? To use a football analogy, if one judged British football from the premiership, which is packed full of international stars which they buy in from elsewhere, one would think that English football is in a great state, but of course the domestic game in Britain is at its lowest ebb ever. There is a connection between these two. The standard of the domestic game has collapsed because they import all their quality. One might argue that is not a bad analogy for the economy. The incredible overdependence on foreign direct investment, multinational investment and so on, and the distorting impact that it has, means we are extraordinarily vulnerable here and the domestic economy is in a very poor position. I know Professor Lane is somewhat restricted in comments he can make on politics, but he and the Central Bank have a responsibility for stability - not so much the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which just provides the figures. What would he say about the stability of that kind of scenario? It seems to me that it is not a good scenario.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What would Professor Lane say on the vulnerability argument? We are much more vulnerable. I do not know how far he can venture into opinions on what is partly-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The vulnerability is heightened now because the race to the bottom on corporate tax has intensified. I do not think anybody would dispute that. Whether one thinks it is good or bad, and I think it is very bad and dangerous, it has definitely intensified. The lights are flashing even more brightly in terms of our potential vulnerability. I do not know what Professor Lane thinks about that. The other interesting thing in what Professor Lane said, which struck me very strongly, is about the value ascribed to intellectual property. It seems to me that that is a political debate which needs to be had but is not being had. It is about how much value is put on intellectual property as against sales, many of which are done here or in Europe, or the manufacturing process, because they are all different things. That is a highly political argument. It suits a certain political view, or corporate view for some companies, to say that all the value is in the idea. One could easily say that it is not really, because the idea without a product or sale does not mean anything at all. Is one of the ways we could lessen the vulnerability on this to be to the forefront, which we are not, in arguing for some sort of international, not just European-wide, consolidated tax base where we assign, and have a serious debate about, relative value of intellectual property versus other parts of the production chain?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps this is a question for both witnesses but it seems to me that on the statistics side, if there is a significant disparity between GNI* and GDP, and I welcome the new measurement as it at least gives us a fleshed out picture, does is it not also mean that to facilitate the full spectrum of debate around how we respond to the real state of the Irish economy, we need more statistics on the distribution of wealth? I would also like to ask for statistics on wage share, which should be included in figures. There is a very definite trajectory, which is not good as far as I am concerned, in terms of wage share as a proportion of national income as against profits. That should be measured and be included in the figures. We should see it and see what the pattern is. Perhaps the witnesses could respond to that point. If the real fiscal space that we can depend on is much narrower than GDP would allow us, the other side of that is if we are going to find money for investment in capital or anything else, we have to look at other possible ways of getting revenue. That means a much more forensic set of figures and statistics in terms of the distribution of different aspects of wealth, income, property, resources and all that kind of stuff. Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At present, the CSO does not produce figures on wage share specifically. Mr. Dalton mentioned income and income distribution and I accept that but I refer to the measurement of wage share as a proportion of national income.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a one-liner-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to throw in. This might be useful information for all of us. I presume the levels of overcrowding in Irish housing is available in the census material. Has that been extrapolated?
