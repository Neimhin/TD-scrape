RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are there time limits for speaking on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does this apply to the Deputy who moves the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is somewhat complicated today. Should I move all of my amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a final clarification, am I speaking to the group of amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, line 5, to delete “human” and substitute “maternal”.This Bill has become something of a sham. People expected and hoped the Bill would protect the lives of women and prevent tragedies like that of Savita Halappanavar, the tragic circumstances surrounding X, a 14-year-old child who was raped and became suicidal and the tragic circumstances surrounding the A, B and C v. Ireland and D v. Ireland cases. It failed on all counts to live up to the expectations of ordinary people that the Government would prevent such tragic circumstances from happening again. The reason the Bill has failed and the reason I am tabling this amendment, along with 40 others with other Deputies, is because we want the Bill to be what it should be and what people expect it to be, one that ensures a woman's life will never again be put at risk because of the State refusing to safeguard the lives of women and the rights of women. It is a tragic and sad fact that the Bill, instead of preventing those sort of tragedies and protecting the lives of women, has become about the internal politics of Fine Gael, holding the Government together and preventing political defections. The Bill is a fudge and a sham and the lives of women have become secondary to the needs of the Government to protect itself and prevent a major split in its ranks. That means, with absolute certainty, that we will be here again facing the tragic circumstances that prompted the Bill to be drafted and that prompted this debate. We will be back because the Government has not vindicated the rights of women. The problems with the Bill begin, as my amendment suggests, with its title and the objective the Bill sets itself. It fudges the key issue, which the Bill is supposed to be about, and it talks about human life when the issue is women's lives. Women's lives have been put at risk because of the legal situation in Ireland and the political cowardice of successive Governments. Women have died and suffered and have been forced to flee in the dead of night under a stigma of criminality and of doing something wrong when they simply wanted to protect their lives, their health and their rights. The Government has vindicated none of those things and instead sought to protect Fine Gael and to assure Fine Gael's political interests. That is a tragedy. After the Bill passes-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying, Ceann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that but I am making the point about the failure to specify that the Bill is about protecting maternal life, which is at stake.It is the thing that prompted the tragedy of Savita Halappanavar’s death. It is the thing that prompted the tragic circumstances in which a 14 year old rape victim was denied the right to an abortion. These circumstances could happen again, even if the legislation passes. Were X in the same situation again, it is likely that she would not have the right to an abortion as she would be put through such a terrible interrogation. It is almost certain that no woman in her circumstances would even attempt to put herself through the hoops the Bill requires her to jump through. The Bill does not provide the medical certainty doctors require to intervene decisively to protect the lives of women like Savita Halappanavar and others whose lives may be endangered by the continuation of a pregnancy. The Government has made a fudge between its need to assuage dissent from those within its ranks who are opposed to abortion and the legal imperative to vindicate the lives of women. As a result, women's lives have not been vindicated. The Bill should have been referred to as a Bill to protect maternal life. That is the point of the amendment. Similarly, there is a reference in the definitions section of the Bill to the need to have due regard to the right to life of the unborn in relation to the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner. There is no mention of the need to have due regard to the life of the mother. It is all about assuaging the opposition of the anti-abortion lobby to the Bill as a whole and to prevent defections. That is tragic. It is a recipe for further human tragedies and for putting life and health at risk. People who have suicidal thoughts because of pregnancy are having their lives put at risk. That is unacceptable. I hope the Minister will take seriously the concerns being expressed and the amendments being tabled and change the Bill. Otherwise, we will be back here within weeks, months or years, faced with tragedies which have resulted from the political failure of the Government to deal properly with the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I received a text stating there were problems with the microphones. Could the Leas-Cheann Comhairle check? Does anybody know if there were problems with the microphones?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There have been problems. Are they resolved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has been a problem since the beginning of the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is impacting on the broadcast sound. I have received a text from a radio station that the debate cannot be broadcast. This is an important public debate. Is there any guidance on how long it will take to fix the problem? It is problematic to continue with the debate when it cannot be broadcast.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In response to what the Minister said, the point of these amendments is to state the key imperative is to protect women's lives because they have not been protected. Of course the Minister is right to say that the Constitution as it currently stands, reinforced by the X case judgment, provides protection for what is called the "unborn child" although it did not define what that is. This is something the Minister has done, in such a way as to expand that definition to a point that is very problematic. As we will see when we return to it, it is extremely problematic particularly in the tragic circumstance of fatal foetal abnormalities. It may preclude any future effort by the Minister's Government or any other to allow for terminations in those tragic circumstances. The substantive point of these amendments is to state that although legal protections have existed and continue to exist for what is termed the unborn child no protections have existed for the lives of women which is what we are trying to address. That is what most people believe this Bill was supposed to do, to prevent tragic circumstances such as those of the X case, where a 14 year old child was raped and became suicidal, was threatened with incarceration and denied the right to have an abortion in this country, or the case of a woman like Savita whose life might be put at risk because of the legal situation surrounding abortion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what we are trying to address in these amendments. As it stands, and in the way the Minister has structured this Bill, including the extra amendments he has introduced on this Stage, the matter is further confused. The Bill does not provide the clarity the Minister claims it will provide but will again leave open the likelihood that any woman subjected to this process would have her life put at risk. We would be back to the same tragic circumstances we saw in Savita's case, the X case and the cases of A, B, C and D. That is the point. We are trying to shift the focus of this Bill to where it should be, on the protection of women's lives which have not been protected until now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 5, line 14, after “of” to insert “maternal”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We believe such legislation should be enacted quickly and not left in the hands of the Minister. We have waited too long already.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to follow on from the points that were made and also speak about amendment No. 97, which relates to the requirement to have an obstetrician on the review committee. Why the hell is there a requirement for an obstetrician when dealing with the threat of suicide? To be crude about it, the Minister of State or I or anybody else in here is as qualified as an obstetrician to certify whether somebody is suicidal or not. In other words, none of us is qualified. Unless one of us happens to be a psychiatrist, we are not qualified to assess suicidal ideation, so why is the obstetrician included? It is simply inexplicable and no justification has been provided for that inclusion. Many psychiatrists, including one I heard interviewed on the radio a few days ago, as well as Doctors for Choice, have questioned the objective of including a requirement either to have an obstetrician to certify suicidal ideation that might be a risk to the life of the mother or to have an obstetrician on the review committee in those cases. There is no reason for it, so one would have to draw the conclusion that it is a blocking requirement. It simply increases the possibility that a woman who is suicidal, with a consequent risk to her life, could have that risk certified by two psychiatrists, but then have it blocked by an obstetrician who has no qualification whatsoever to make any assessment of whether there is a risk to that woman's life due to her suicidal feelings. I would like the Minister of State to explain all that, but I do not think there is an explanation. I think it is unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be helpful if we could get an answer from the Minister of State on that point. Our argument is that the Bill is too prescriptive in respect of the medical professionals required in the first instance and on the review committee. In the case of a threat of suicide, why would one need an obstetrician? An obstetrician's qualifications have no bearing whatsoever on the assessment of whether there is a real and substantial threat of suicide by a woman. Can the Minister of State explain why this is so prescriptive? We are arguing that it should not be so prescriptive. The bar is being set higher for a woman whose life is threatened than would be the case if there was no pregnancy at stake. In any other circumstances, one doctor rather than three would be required to make an assessment of whether somebody's life is under threat. Therefore, the Government is setting a higher bar here and consequently jeopardising the safety of women.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have tabled a different amendment on that issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am one of the movers of amendment No. 97.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I understand that movers of amendments have the opportunity to speak again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I have been given to understand. May I speak on the amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State made an alarming admission on the issue of the obstetrician. Section 9 provides that if there is a real and substantial threat of suicide, the woman is entitled to a termination of her pregnancy. He is arguing that her right is qualified because an obstetrician who can make a foetal assessment but is not qualified to assess the threat to life of the mother as a result of suicide will have a say on her right to a termination. That is a shocking dilution of her right to protect her life or the right of the psychiatrists who assess the threat to her life to make the decision to allow a termination. We are getting a heavily qualified protection of the woman's life in such a way that her life is threatened by the qualification. It is disingenuous of the Minister of State to say the amendments do not deal with the issue of three doctors versus two doctors. They deal with the issue in so far as an obstetrician is required in addition to two psychiatrists or, as we propose, one psychiatrist and a GP. His insistence that an obstetrician should have an input into the process increases the number of doctors to three, places more hoops for the woman to jump through and endangers her life.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will refer to some of the Technical Group's section 9 amendments that are in this grouping, but I also wish to comment on some of the amendments tabled by the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, and others who are opposed full stop to the section, who are coming at it from a different perspective. Deputy Tóibín and the Minister of State referred a number of times to the concern they have about the floodgates opening. It is important to respond to this point. In recent hours I listened to the debate, which often got bogged down in the important and necessary detail of the Bill and the arguments around that detail. It is important to say that in so far as the term "floodgates" is even useful in this debate - I am not sure it is - the floodgates are open. Whatever happens with this Bill will not affect one jot the number of desperate Irishwomen who seek and receive abortions. Desperate women whose health or whose lives are at risk, desperate women who are suicidal, desperate women who get the awful news that their baby has been diagnosed with a fatal abnormality, desperate women in a whole range of circumstances will still make the decision to have an abortion. The only issue is where they will have that abortion, not whether they will have it. Those who profess to be pro-life or anti-abortion when they make their arguments fail to acknowledge that fundamental point. Abortion is an Irish reality and Irishwomen in their thousands are forced to travel to Britain to receive the treatment they need or want. In spite of those Deputies who propose to strike section 9 from the Bill, although it is clear the Government will not accept their arguments, women will still seek those abortions. It will make no difference. The Deputies have to answer that question if they are addressing these issues in good conscience. If women need or are going to seek those abortions in any case, do those Deputies believe it is acceptable or right that those women are forced to go abroad and be away from their homes, with all the stigma, without support and in spite of the costs involved? I believe it is unacceptable, and those who call themselves pro-life and express a concern for the care of women must address that point. The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, made the argument that it was the job of the Oireachtas, not the Supreme Court, to legislate. The implication that what we are doing in legislating for the X case was somehow dictated by the Supreme Court, which was going outside its remit, is a very legalistic and convoluted argument that does not stand up at all. The Supreme Court has not dictated to the Parliament. We know that because its judgment was made 20 years ago, yet the Parliament still has not legislated for it. It was forced to legislate not because of anything the Supreme Court said but because of the tragic case of Savita Halappanavar. That is why we are here today. It is why we have finally been forced to deal with this issue. We had tragedy after tragedy and then, most recently, we had the awful and terrible case of Savita Halappanavar. The argument made by the Minister of State in comparing the threat of suicide in this situation to a threat of suicide by a person who may be deported is a terrible one that tries to undermine the seriousness of that threat.People who are deported generally speaking receive awful treatment. They are incarcerated, they are often grabbed in the middle of the night, in many cases they are bound and gagged and shoved onto planes with little or no regard for the consequences of their deportation. For the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Creighton, to say that to concede the argument of somebody facing that prospect who might feel suicidal would be to open the floodgates to people to make false claims of suicidal ideation in order to avoid deportation, desperately trivialises the horror of deportation for many people who face that reality. When she says the alternative put forward in a case to which she referred, that there should be a care plan, as she proposes in cases of suicidal ideation in pregnancy, and compares that with a judge saying a care plan is necessary for someone who faces deportation and says they might be suicidal, she should acknowledge that no such care plan is ever put in place for deportees, irrespective of whether they say they are suicidal. They are just bound, gagged, put on a plane and deported once the decision has been made to deport them. It is a very bad comparison for the Minister of State to make. The logic of it is to suggest that women who threaten to commit suicide, or say they are suicidal because they are pregnant should be incarcerated rather than have their wishes for a termination granted. That is completely unacceptable. It is a pity that some of those who oppose abortion have constantly said, and say again in the debate on this group of amendments, that abortion is not a treatment for suicide, as if that were ever the issue. Nobody has ever claimed abortion was a treatment for suicide. Those who oppose giving such rights to the women who are suicidal and whose lives are at risk as a result of suicidal ideation need honestly to admit, or at least address when debating this issue, that if a woman is pregnant and feels suicidal at the thought of continuing with that pregnancy, and if she is forced against her will to carry on that pregnancy, that will almost inevitably increase the anxiety, suffering and stress she will feel and very likely contribute to a greater risk to her life and of her carrying through with that threat of suicide. It does not mean that having the right to a termination automatically does away with suicidal ideation but they surely must acknowledge that forcing a woman who does not want to have a child and feels suicidal at the thought of having one is dangerous and puts women's lives at risk. As other speakers have said, there is an unacceptable and unsustainable distinction being made by those who oppose any limited introduction of abortion in the case of suicidal ideation. They are making an untenable distinction between physical and mental health, suggesting that somehow the bar that one has to reach for a threat to one's life because of mental illness or suicidal ideation should be higher than it would be for a physical medical emergency. In medicine no such distinction is made. No distinction can be made in medicine between a physical and a psychological threat to life and it is wrong to do so. I disagree fundamentally with the arguments that these people make. My problem with section 9 is the opposite of theirs because sadly, as a political fudge, the Government has made unnecessary and unacceptable concessions to the untenable arguments made by those who oppose any limited introduction of abortion in the case of a possible suicide. The Government also makes the distinction in the legislation between a physical threat to life and a threat to life as a result of suicidal ideation or psychiatric illness. The Minister makes that distinction in the Bill and I believe it is absolutely untenable. As I said on Committee Stage, and the point was made very strongly to the Minister by psychiatrists and groups such as Doctors for Choice, if somebody has to be certified in a situation where there is no pregnancy involved as being a threat to themselves, as a result of mental illness, there is only a requirement for one psychiatrist and a GP. There is no requirement for two psychiatrists, an obstetrician and indeed a fourth doctor, in that the Bill requires consultation with the GP as well. Why does the Minister make that distinction? There simply is no basis for doing it. It puts more obstacles in the way of women whose lives are at risk and who are feeling suicidal because of their pregnancies. The Minister is making that distinction only because there is a pregnancy. That means he is in a dangerous way playing fast and loose with a threat to the life of a woman, putting extra obstacles in her way in accessing the service she needs or feels she needs. That is unacceptable. That requirement, among other serious flaws and weaknesses in this Bill, has forced some of us who are pro-choice to say we simply cannot vote for it. Much as we wanted a Bill that would legislate for the X case and even if, as far as we were concerned, it did not go far enough, we would have voted for it, had the Minister not tightened it up to such an extent that it is actually regressive and puts more restrictions in the way of women accessing terminations when they need them than there were before this Bill was drafted. That is quite shameful on the part of the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will they be given an opportunity to agree in a referendum?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, on recalling the terrible tragic circumstances surrounding the X case and reminding us that suicide in pregnancy is a real threat which must be dealt with. That is what the X case judgment requires us to do, morally, politically and legally. Given the powerful accounts that they both gave, I do not understand how they can propose a Bill that effectively rows back on that right and gives us less than was agreed to by the judges in the X case judgment. One consultant psychologist made the assessment that X was suicidal and that she had the right to an abortion. The Government, however, is now proposing that similar cases will be examined by an obstetrician, two psychiatrists in consultation with a doctor and then a review panel. Potentially, a 14 year old girl, a victim of rape and feeling suicidal, could have to be put through a review by eight doctors and potentially denied her right to have an abortion in these appalling circumstances. The X case judgment does not require the Government to do this. That is the point we are making. The number should be reduced to two doctors instead of putting obstacles in the way. The Minister asked for honesty. Will the Government be honest? As it stands, is Deputy Olivia Mitchell correct in saying most woman who will feel suicidal during pregnancy will not avail of the rights this Bill purports to give them? They will not put themselves through this. Then the Minister asks us what is the point of the Bill and what does it do for women.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, earlier suggested the six avidly pro-choice Deputies voting "No" might be explained by some kind of political posturing. I want to make it clear to him and to the Government that it is a mistaken judgment. Some of us feel we must, reluctantly, vote against the Bill. There is nothing in it for us to vote "No". We wanted a Bill that legislated for the X case and went as far as it could go. We were conscious of the limitations on how far it could go. We do not expect things that cannot be given within the framework of the X case judgment but we do want everything that could be given within the framework and limitations of the X case judgment to advance the welfare and the rights of women to terminations where they need them. We have already discussed a couple of the issues we are particularly concerned about, which are unnecessary, too restrictive and erode the rights given to women under the X case. I refer to the requirement for more doctors than necessary or prescribed by the X case judgment, which does not prescribe a particular number of doctors. Similarly, we are deeply concerned about criminalisation. For me and for many of the Deputies forced to vote "No", this issue is the dealbreaker. It is unacceptable that the Government passes up an opportunity to deal with the most terrible circumstances. If the Government could not deal with it, we would accept it, although we would ask for, and expect, an assurance and a commitment that it will deal with the matter forthwith. The Government has not provided a commitment, despite the fact that the Government said it agrees pregnancies with fatal foetal abnormality are terrible and tragic and that no woman should have to be put through a situation where she must travel to Britain for an abortion and not be able to avail of the service here with the support of family and friends. Members on all sides of the House accept that the situation is unacceptable and that something must be done yet the Government has made no commitment to do something about it. That is of deep concern and is unacceptable if anything could be done, as we believe is the case. At least 20 eminent legal experts, barristers, law lecturers and solicitors have said that in situations where a wanted pregnancy is diagnosed as involving fatal foetal abnormality, because the conditions are incompatible with life, allowing a termination does not clash with the imperative in the Constitution to protect the unborn child. A condition incompatible with life is not a viable life. It is not an unborn child because we are talking about a foetus that cannot live, where there is no prospect of life or viability and therefore there is no clash. We believe it is entirely compatible and that there is legal evidence to support the view that it is compatible with the X case judgment and the current constitutional limitations. The Government has said that it could be subject to legal challenge and that the legal advice of the Government runs counter to the view. That may well be the case and those who support our view accept that our viewpoint is not cast-iron in respect of the potential compatibility with the Constitution of allowing for terminations in these cases. However, they go on to say something the Minister of State, Deputy White, acknowledged on Committee Stage, that nothing is certain in law until it is tested. It has as good a chance of passing legal muster as many elements included in the Bill. Saying that it could be legally challenged is not a reason to exclude it because it is so important and everyone agrees it is unacceptable that the situation should persist if it does not need to. We have an obligation to include it in the legislation and to try to deal with it. If it is struck down, we can do something afterwards to deal with that. The Government should give a commitment to do so but it has not done so.When that is combined with the criminality clause providing for a potential 14 year prison sentence if terminations are carried out or procured outside the terms of the Bill, it maintains a stigma of criminalisation over women in these tragic circumstances who are forced at a rate of 1,500 a year to travel abroad where a pregnancy they wanted is not viable because of fatal foetal abnormality. It is unacceptable that women forced to travel abroad in those circumstances, which they have a legitimate right to do, are doing something that is treated as a criminal offence in this country subject to 14 years imprisonment. That is terrible. It is bad enough that women should be put through this. To be put through it in circumstances where the State describes what they are doing as criminal and subject to 14 years in prison is appalling. To how much extra anxiety, horror and cruelty does that subject women faced with that appalling situation? It is unacceptable to allow that to persist. Even if the Minister did not accept those first two points, the third point is unanswerable. The definition of "unborn" included in the Bill sets it down for the first time in law. It states that the unborn child begins at the moment of implantation. That means the Minister is not only failing to deal with the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities in the Bill and maintaining the stigma of criminality over it, he is putting into law something that will prevent him dealing with the situation of fatal foetal abnormalities in the future. Under that definition of the unborn child, a woman who seeks a termination of a foetus with a fatal foetal abnormality will be guilty of killing an unborn child as defined in the legislation. That is unacceptable. We have proposed an alternative wording. I think I speak for the other six Deputies sponsoring the motion in saying that if the Minister changes the definition, we will vote for the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that we want it to go much further and that we have major problems with its regressive characteristics. If he just conceded this unanswerable plea for compassion and action, we could support the Bill. Families in the Terminations for Medical Reasons group said they did not want any more compassion, they wanted action. We appeal to the Minister on their behalf and on behalf of all those families who will go through this terrible situation and who have gone through it, for action. The action the Minister could take is to change the definition of "unborn" to ensure that terminations in these circumstances will not be equated with the taking of the life of an unborn child. It is a different, unique case. We have proposed an alternative definition of "unborn" which deals with that problem. We do not see why the Government cannot adopt it. We do not see why the Minister had to include a definition of "unborn" in the Bill at all. We would appreciate an explanation from the Minister of why he has failed to deal with that and why he appears to be including in the Bill a provision which will preclude him from dealing with these most terrible circumstances without having to repeal this section of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not defined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extremely disappointing for the Minister of State to make that charge. The simple reason we brought it up is because families affected by this question asked us to. We chose not to say “No” because we believe they have an unanswerable case for the issue that has affected them to be dealt with. It is as simple as that. I also have personal experience of it and so I understood and sympathised with what they went through. I understand Deputy Healy Rae’s ignorance of this issue, as many people do not fully understand what these conditions are. It is not about illness, disease or an infection but about the genetic building blocks of life not being constituted properly such that life can be sustained. It is a hard concept to get one’s head around when that diagnosis is delivered. One cannot believe that the baby that one wants will not live. It takes quite a while to understand that. When one does, one understands how terrible it is and that no one should be made suffer unnecessarily more as a result. I do not fully accept what the Minister of State said but I accept he believes it. There are other people with legal expertise who dispute what he has said.That needs to be debated properly and the argument needs to be taken seriously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even if the Minister is correct, will he give a commitment or an assurance that he will do something?
