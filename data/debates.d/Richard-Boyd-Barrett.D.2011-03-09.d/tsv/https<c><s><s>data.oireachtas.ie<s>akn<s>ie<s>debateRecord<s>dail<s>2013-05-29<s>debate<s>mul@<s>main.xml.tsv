RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a joke.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a joke. We wanted to hear from-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Joe Higgins, Shane Ross and Mick Wallace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many occasions when the issues we discuss in the Chamber could almost be amusing if they were not so serious. There has been quite a bit of that today, starting with the announcement in some media that the EU Commission is issuing what were described as "much-awaited economic guidelines for member states". I would like to know by whom they are much awaited because I did not notice many people at bus stops, in pubs or walking down Grafton Street saying they could not wait for the EU Commission to issue its new guidelines on how economies should be organised in EU member states. There is a good reason why people in this country are not waiting with bated breath for what the EU Commission might suggest for the economy. It is because for the past five years they have been victims of what the EU Commission has dictated and directed for this economy and that has had utterly disastrous consequences for the economy and for the vast majority of citizens. The EU Commission, along with its friends in the IMF and the ECB were the people who said from the outset when the crisis hit – a crisis they had to a large extent facilitated in the first place – that at all costs bondholders and banks must be protected and ordinary people must bear the cost of an unprecedented economic crisis. Five years on even they now have to admit that the policy has been a disastrous failure with every single meaningful indicator from the point of view of ordinary citizens showing that the policy has made things far worse, not better. They have certainly succeeded in protecting the banks and the bondholders, but from the point of view of unemployment, we have a crisis that is unprecedented since the 1930s. We have a disastrous situation from the point of view of youth unemployment, the future of the economy and society with a quarter of young people across Europe left to rot and who are not allowed to contribute to society. Finally, our EU masters are forced to admit that we have reached the limits of austerity but its alternative, which we can expect to hear in the “much-awaited guidelines” is for so-called structural reforms which is a euphemism - the EU admits it does not mean more investment in the economy – for privatisation and imposing what it calls greater flexibility on workers, which in other words means sacking workers, cutting their pay and conditions and forcing young people to emigrate. That is what flexibility means. The alternative, which the EU Commission should be discussing, and which was finally discussed at the EU Council, is to get the investment funds that our economy and the European economy needs from those who are holding the money. The people who are holding the money are the corporations which this Government is facilitating in dodging their taxes. That is what we should be doing.The Government should end its state of denial about Ireland's tax haven status, own up to its guilt in facilitating corporate tax-dodging and demand that multinationals making tens of billions in profits pay their fair share of tax in order that the country has the revenues to invest in employment and economic growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Answer that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State claims Ireland is not a tax haven and that we have an effective corporate tax rate of close to 12%. If that is the case, could the Minister of State explain to me and the public why the European Union's own website, which shows figures for the implicit corporate tax rate across Europe, states that Ireland's implicit tax rate is 6.8%? Contrary to the Minister of State's remarks about France, the website shows France's corporate tax rate at 21.6%, Germany's at 17.1%, Greece's at 17.8%, Sweden's at 27.2% and Britain's at 17.7%. According to the EU Commission, our corporate tax rate is a fraction of the average across Europe. I am not saying it, the Commission is saying it. Could the Minister of State respond the remarks of a former senior staff member in Google, who sent me an e-mail? He said that Google Ireland had a turnover of €47 billion between 2005 and 2011. The profits over that period were a minimum of €9.5 billion. Over that period, the company paid taxes of €69.91 million, a 0.7% tax rate. It is another company to add to the list, along with Apple and Abbot Laboratories. How can the Minister of State tell us we have a transparent corporate tax system when that is a reality? This person explained how this works with Google. Google Ireland Holdings owns the internal systems and software the advertising network runs on. Google Ireland employs people, charges clients money and makes those profits. Google Ireland pays a licence fee to Google Ireland Holdings for the use of that software and in a strange coincidence Google Ireland Holdings Limited charges a fee that is almost exactly the amount Google Ireland Limited makes each year. Of course, the fee changes each year to match the growing profits. That is what is known as the double Irish; that is how it works, it is a tax dodge and we facilitate it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are talking about Google Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is three.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought there were four.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to object in the strongest terms possible to the ruling out of these amendments. I submitted 25 amendments to this Bill and 24 have been ruled out of order. That is in the context of a Bill which is being rammed through with a guillotine, which is undemocratic in its very nature in that it attempts to put a gun to the head of trade unionists in this country. It is making a sham of democracy and is utterly unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of the first amendments-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The time is a joke anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but the whole thing is a joke. We voted against this guillotine-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----earlier because what this Government is doing is a disgraceful subversion of the democratic process-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----namely, imposing a guillotine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government continues to do this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It shows the arrogance of this Government which thinks it can play fast and loose with democracy because it has a majority.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is really outrageous that the Labour Party-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----on the anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out would engage in what is effectively a legislative and a democratic lock-out-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	------against the workers of this country. It is a disgrace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle. I understand you have to do your job but what this Government is doing is absolutely out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must continue with my objection.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a sham of a democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has completely subverted the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a sham of democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are not going to get away with this without us hitting out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is monstrous. The Minister should be ashamed of himself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a sham of democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government knows it is manipulating the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has no respect for workers or trade unionists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I have still not been given an explanation as to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the reason 50 of 71 amendments have been ruled out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is making a joke of democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is precisely to protest about the joke the Government is making of democracy and the way it is conducting this debate that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I wish to comment on the way in which the vast majority of amendments that have been submitted have been ruled out of order. It makes an extraordinary joke of democracy that out of 71 amendments, more than 50 are ruled out of order on a Bill that has such profound effects on hundreds of thousands of families in this country, their quality of life, pay and conditions, and that debate on such issues is short-circuited in this way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decision to rule the amendments out of order is even more extraordinary in that, on the one hand, of the 25 amendments I submitted, 24 were ruled out of order, many of them on the grounds that they would result in a charge on the Exchequer and that they would interfere with the finances of the Bill, while on the other hand, a series of amendments to section 1 were ruled out of order because they did not have any impact on the Bill. If one's amendments have an impact on the Bill, they are out of order, and if the amendments do not have an impact on the Bill they are out of order. Pretty much everything is out of order if one disagrees with the Government. Particular amendments were ruled out of order on the grounds that they were "declaratory" - whatever that means - because they factually sought to rename the Bill as the "Financial Emergency Measures in the Banks' Interest" rather than the current name referring to "the Public Interest". It seems to me that one can justify what is in the Bill in many ways but the one thing one cannot do is claim it is in the public interest. Even the Minister, at times of slightly greater honesty in dealing with this current crisis, has said when pushed that he does not like doing this to people and that he would rather not have to do it to them. I suppose when he says that, it is a begrudging admission that what he is doing is not fair, just or good for the public or the workers on whom he is imposing the changes. He tells us he is doing it because he has to because the policy to which he has agreed and that is being pushed on us by the ECB and the troika is that the first step on the road to so-called economic stability is to protect the banks. They say we must get the banks and the financial system up and running before we can do anything else. At least it would be honest to say that is the purpose of the Bill, that it is a Bill to shore up the banks yet again and to ask public sector workers to pay for it, but one cannot even make an amendment to the name of the Bill even though it is a factually accurate description of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everyone was speaking to the entire Bill, so I will just do what everyone else did. The key issue is that this Bill is a subversion of democracy and it follows on from the manner in which the Government has tried to browbeat the trade union movement-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in this country and public sector workers into accepting a cruelly unjust, economically stupid and unsustainable attack on their pay and conditions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is disgraceful that a Labour Party Government, on the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out, would try to do this to the very people who voted for them in the belief that the Labour Party would protect them, when instead it has stabbed them in the back and is trying to force even more cuts in their pay and conditions on top of those they have already suffered over the past five years with disastrous consequences for those people, their families and the economy as a whole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not have a Second Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Technical Group did not even get a second round.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is not interested in changing Standing Orders. It would not entertain a debate on the guillotine. It just rammed the Bill through.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has short-circuited debate deliberately because it wants to kill the debate. It is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and trying to railroad the Bill through on top of people who have suffered cruelly in the past five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people sought the protection of the Labour Party and it has betrayed them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a real point of order. Section 1 refers to the public interest and the name of the Bill as being in-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, section 1 refers several times to measures in the public interest. That is the title of the Bill. It is perfectly in order for Members to question whether that is an accurate definition of what is this Bill, because I and others on this side do not believe it is in the public interest. Consequently, it is in order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----for them to question whether this is accurate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a point of order on whether Members' points-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----are relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Had the Minister allocated time for a Second Stage debate, it would have been all right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it fascism when a Government does not allow people time to speak?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What has that got to do with the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would get more sense from the back of a lorry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yet another one. Amendment No. 5 not moved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 20:In page 6, line 24, column 2, to delete “9 per cent” and substitute “15 per cent”.The point of the amendment is shift the burden of cuts and adjustment onto those on higher salaries of over €100,000 per year. It was linked to amendments that sought to remove the Minister's intention to further cut the salaries of those under €100,000 per year. It was part of a package where instead of attacking those who earn less than €100,000 per year, the Minister would impose whatever cuts he is seeking on those earning over €100,000 because they can afford it. That is a principle many have articulated inside and outside of this House because they believe a Government that is interested in the welfare of ordinary working people, low and middle income families, should uphold that principle. It should protect those on low and middle incomes and impose the burden of adjustment on those who can afford it. I do not see why this Government resists such a way to deal with the adjustment it claims is necessary. The advantage of this is that it means low and middle income workers, who have already been hammered with the universal social charge, cuts in their pay and levies, and who are at the edge of being able to manage, would not have to suffer further. It would also benefit the wider economy. As many on this side of the House have said to the Government, as the trade union movement has said time and again, and as many mainstream economists have said, if we take money out of the pockets of low and middle income earners, we adversely affect the wider economy. If we take it off those on higher earnings, because they can afford it, it will not have such a damaging effect on spending and, therefore, on the economy. The Minister always resists that logic. I can understand Fine Gael doing that because traditionally it is a party that protects the well off and the super wealthy but it is astonishing that a Labour Minister and the Labour Party component of this Government resist this sort of alternative approach to dealing with the country's financial crisis. I do not see why the Minister would oppose such amendments or the principle that lies behind them. Amendment No. 23 operates on the same principle, shifting the burden from those earning less than €100,000 to those earning more than €100,000.It is connected to a wider set of alternative policies that have been articulated, not only by those in People Before Profit and United Left, but by the trade union movement itself. The trade union movement has stated we need to move in this alternative direction, and well the Minister knows it. If the Minister were on the other side of the House, as he was a few years ago, this is precisely the argument he would have been making and, indeed, Labour Deputies made it. It is astonishing that sections of the trade union movement have signed up to what the Minister is proposing in this Bill because it runs counter to everything they have said for the past number of years when criticising austerity and talking about the economic damage that austerity is doing, both to the economy and to ordinary low and middle-income workers. They say that and then they recommend that their members accept what is clearly cruelly unjust and economically counterproductive. These amendments point to the alternative. The Minister knows the alternative and I do not understand why the Labour Party is not supporting that alternative.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Core pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My heart breaks for him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will he manage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is from an obscene level.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister made an important admission in his response to the amendments I and others have tabled on the section. He stated he costed our amendments and I thank him very much for doing so because we certainly did not have time as we had less than 24 hours between seeing the Bill and the deadline for amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course. What else could we do given the time available? It is interesting that it was not a bad shot in the dark considering, because the Minister stated if he agreed to these amendments they would gather €400 million, that is 40% of the adjustment, and shift the adjustment from those earning less than €100,000 to those earning more than €100,000. It would still leave those earning more than €100,000 very well off. I do not think they will have trouble paying their bills, but it would do a great deal to alleviate the burden the Minister is imposing on people earning less than €100,000. To respond to the Minister's suggestion and quip that our definition of the working class makes it very hard to be in the working class, let me point out, although I am sure the Minister knows, that many people who earn between €65,000 and €100,000 are in single income large families with nobody else working. They incur many costs such as mortgages. If one happens to be in a single income family earning between €65,000 and €100,000 it does not make one wealthy. Many people in this bracket are having extreme trouble paying their mortgages and bills and educating their children. This is not to say that if we had believed adjustments over recent years were necessary people earning more than €65,000 should not have had to bear some of them, but this group has already taken a hammering with the universal social charge and the levies. The reason we strike a ceiling at €100,000 in these amendments, and seek to shift the burden to people earning more than €100,000, is because we can be absolutely certain people earning more than €100,000 can afford it. This is the point. If we want to then parse a little more the people earning less than this we can examine it, but the point is once people earn more than €100,000 we know they can afford it. As has been pointed out by Deputy Nulty and many of us on this side of the House, we see this attempt to shift the burden as part of a wider package of putting forward an alternative to unfair, unjust and, we believe, economically counter-productive austerity. It would also involve the tax system which, as has been stated, is a fair and progressive way to deal with collecting revenue for the State which does not discriminate. There should not be discrimination between the public and private sectors. The Minister's quoting of the CSO figures, if he does not mind me saying so, plays a little bit into demonising the public sector and setting it against the private sector by stating private sector wages averages only €32,000 but public sector wages are higher. This is not the definition or the line which should be drawn. The line which should be drawn is between low and middle income people who are genuinely struggling to pay their mortgages and bills and those who can afford to do so. As Deputy Healy and others stated, these proposals form a suite of alternative and more progressive ways to gather revenue for the State which would also include wealth taxes and increased corporation taxes. Even in the narrow remit of this legislation why would the Minister not accept an amendment? If he could even bother to listen perhaps he would explain to us why it would not be fair to shift €400 million of the adjustment he wants to impose on people earning less than €100,000? He stated it was 40%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will change his mind now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All right, but am I supposed to be able to read the Minister's mind? Debate adjourned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made. I will let matters proceed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand why my amendment on section 2B was ruled out of order because it would not impose a charge on the Exchequer and it was not declaratory.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems there is a third string to the exclusion bow but we will deal with it later. Section 2B is the draconian heart of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, the last section demonstrated the injustice of imposing the burden of cuts and adjustments on people earning less than €100,000. This section is the draconian heart of the Bill because it is essentially telling public sector workers that the Government will negotiate with them as long as there is agreement. If the workers dare to disagree, the Government will inflict whatever it likes on them.We are giving the power to the Minister to do this, making a mockery of negotiation with trade union members, undermining the basis of collective bargaining and moving in a very dangerous direction of dictatorial imposition of cuts in pay and conditions on working people. It is very shameful that it is a Labour Party Minister who is doing this on the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out. It truly is. The Minister may not wish to believe this, but earlier I spoke to a trade unionist who described this as a legislative lock-out. I cannot mention his name because he did not give me permission to do so, but he was a card-carrying member of the Labour Party. This is how he described the Bill and he is absolutely right because this is what the Minister is doing. He is fundamentally undermining the basis of negotiation between employers and employees and fundamentally undermining collective bargaining. It is a serious attack on trade unionism and it is depressing in the extreme that the Labour Party would choose to do this. The Minister and the Labour Party should be ashamed of themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a real attack. This is anti-trade union legislation. It is not only anti-low and middle income worker legislation or a specific austerity measure. It is about giving draconian powers to the Government and future Governments to attack by fiat the conditions of trade unionists over their heads and making a mockery of the basic principles of trade unionism.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister was heckling me a moment ago.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have received a lot more from the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a side issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I said.
