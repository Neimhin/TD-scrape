RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like the Minister of State to consider a fiscally neutral proposal put to me by someone from Bettystown in County Meath, and it relates to the retrofit scheme.  The proposal is that we introduce a loan scheme to cover the cost of insulating people's houses.If we were to do this and the repayments on the loan scheme were to correspond roughly to the monthly savings achieved as a result of houses being insulated, that would make the scheme attractive and there could be a massive take-up by people to insulate their homes.  It would result perhaps in up to a 50% reduction in their energy costs, as Deputy Wallace said, not to mention the potential to create work for thousands of people in home insulation works which would substantially reduce carbon emissions and energy imports.  Such a scheme would not involve a great cost.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Durkan cannot have three of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is the Minister insulting these people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Workers only get two weeks off in the summer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To repeat the call made, the situation is getting worse all the time.  Given the gravity of the circumstances surrounding this Council meeting, the Taoiseach owes it to the Dáil and the public to give us some opportunity to discuss the matter this week, either before or after the summit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we break for the summer, I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that for the 450,000 people or so who have no jobs, this will be a difficult summer.  In terms of forthcoming legislation dealing with matters such as the strategic investment bank and the McCarthy report on State assets and, more generally, job creation, will the Taoiseach indicate that as soon as we return in the autumn there will be a major debate on job creation to bring forward positive proposals to get people back to work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean Members can have that in September?
