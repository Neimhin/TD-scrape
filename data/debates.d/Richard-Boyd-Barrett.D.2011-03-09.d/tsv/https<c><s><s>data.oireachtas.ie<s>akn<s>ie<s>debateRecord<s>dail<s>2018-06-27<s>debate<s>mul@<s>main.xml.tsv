RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The visit of the Pope will be an important event for those of the Catholic faith in this country and they have every right to celebrate his visit and the occasions around it. I acknowledge Deputy Micheál Martin's comments that Pope Francis has spoken in a very progressive manner on migration against a frightening background of a rise in far right xenophobic and anti-migrant political forces in Europe. That is positive. The Pope has also spoken positively about the need to address global poverty and on behalf of the people of Palestine. We should be respectful of the visit and the celebration of those who are of that faith. However, it is also important that this would not prevent us from asking important questions of the Vatican. The questions that matter most to people who felt they have been hurt by the church and its role in the likes of the adoption scandals and particularly in clerical abuse relate to the Vatican files on what it knew, when it knew and what it did about reports of clerical sex abuse. That is terribly important. The survivors and victims of clerical sex abuse deserve that and we must ask those hard questions. There have been reports and tribunals here but those questions must be asked of the Vatican itself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Both the marriage equality referendum and that on the eighth amendment show that there has been a sea change in Irish society and that whatever people's religious convictions, or none, that people believe that religious expression and freedom should be separate from the policies and institutions of the State. There is no doubt in my mind that that is the majority opinion by a significant margin in this country now. That message must be taken on board and the churches, and particularly the Catholic Church, need to understand that. That means that we have to move towards the complete separation of church and State in the management of our schools and hospitals. It is simply not acceptable that the religious persuasion of particular schools or school patrons would, for example, influence sex education when it is such an important matter. It involves issues such as consent, contraception and abortion, all things that young people have a right to know and the State has an obligation to teach in an objective manner. It is not acceptable that the religious views of a patron body would impact and prevent pupils being educated on those things. Furthermore, it is not acceptable that as we speak, religious patrons such as the Christian Brothers are flogging off school property to bolster their own finances at the expense of schoolchildren and school facilities. Nor is it acceptable that there be any question marks over what kind of medical treatment might be available to people in hospitals because the religious persuasion of hospital patron bodies might impact on the services those hospitals are willing to deliver. After the repeal of the eighth amendment, is it the Taoiseach's understanding that we have to convey this to the religious institutions and bodies in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	"Trump is a pig" ran the banner at the Roger Waters gig last night in the 3Arena. The audience at the gig erupted in applause and cheering when it saw the words emblazoned behind Roger Waters. The visual imagery conveyed the horror of Trump's racist, anti-migrant policies, his plans for walls and his incarceration of children. It was then followed by another banner that highlighted the rise of the far right across Europe, naming Orban in Hungary, Kurz in Austria, Le Pen in France, Farage in the UK and the Lega in Italy. One can go through the frightening list of racist and, in some cases, openly fascist forces. Deputy Paul Murphy is absolutely right to point to the fact, as Roger Waters did at the concert last night, that the horror of Trump is being echoed in the growth of terrifying far-right and racist forces across Europe. This is impacting on the policies of the European Union in the creation of its own version of the racist wall and the vast expansion of fortress Europe, the budget of which will be multiplied by five between 2021 and 2027.The previous budget for frontier officers, which was €4 billion for the previous five years is now going up to €25 billion. There will be more officers to keep desperate migrants coming from North Africa, Syria and elsewhere out of Europe with the consequence that 35,000 men, women and children, including babies, have drowned in the Mediterranean because Europe, while often condemning Trump, rightly, is doing the same thing. It is hatching agreements with authoritarian, brutal, despotic regimes in Libya and across the Middle East, co-operating with regimes such as the one in Egypt and so on, which are involved in vile policies that are creating the refugee crisis that is leading thousands of people in desperation to try to enter Europe from where they are repelled. It worries me that in the Taoiseach’s references to the discussions about what is to be discussed, he used the slightly sanitised language about the need for investment in maintaining Europe's external borders. That is sanitised language for fortress Europe and for all those people who are drowning and for those rotten cynical deals with regimes such as that in Libya and others, which are treating human beings coming through their countries seeking asylum and sanctuary like animals and slaves. They are abusing them, which is leading to the deaths of many.  The other theme highlighted by the Roger Waters concert, which is also relevant to the coming conference, was the plight of the Palestinian people and their treatment at the hands of Israel. Waters has taken the very commendable stance of refusing to go to or to have concerts in Israel and has joined the international Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel because of its horrific treatment of the Palestinians. The latest instance of this crisis, because of what Trump has done, is that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, budget is about to collapse so there may be no schools in Gaza and 5 million Palestinians who depend on that budget are now in serious trouble. Save the Children has stated Gaza is now uninhabitable for many children. I warned the Taoiseach before the great return march took place that Palestinians would be killed, as more than 100 of them were. I appealed to the Taoiseach to speak to his European colleagues about what Israel was planning to do. Let me again warn him: on Tuesday, 3 July, women in Gaza will be marching demanding an end to the siege which is strangling their habitation and destroying the lives of their children. They will be marching to demand the right to return, the right to justice and an end to the siege. I hope we do not see another unleashing of ferocious attacks by Israel on women who will march next Tuesday but I appeal to the Taoiseach once again to raise the plight of the Palestinians and demand from his European counterparts that Europe does something instead of mouthing words of concern to alleviate the suffering and plight of the Palestinians.
