RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like other speakers, I welcome the acknowledgment by the Minister that these concerns need to be addressed and he is attempting to do so.  That is vitally important for reasons on which we all agree.  The credit unions were at pains to stress that they should not suffer the backlash as a result of the failures of other sectors of the financial services industry, the banking sector and so on, as we move to correctly regulate the banks and the financial services sector, whose reckless activities helped crash the economy, given that the sector has no responsibility for that crisis.  The danger is that if the legislation is applied to them, they could be regulated in an inappropriate way that could undermine their fundamental ethos and character.  It is vitally important that does not happen.  As has been mentioned, they were alarmed that it was proposed that legislation that applies to the rest of the banking sector was to apply to credit unions given that it had not been discussed at the Commission on Credit Unions.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will examine the issue.  To allay concerns is it his intention to seek to amend the wording in conjunction with the Irish League of Credit Unions and on the basis of agreement with it.  That is what should be done as it knows the sector best.  Whatever amendments the Minister proposes to deal with these concerns should be in accord with its views and wishes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has acknowledged the concern raised by the Irish League of Credit Unions and Opposition Deputies.  We take it that the Minister is on the job trying to deal with those concerns.  The main point is that credit unions are not banks and should not be treated like banks in a way that could damage their essential character.  As long as the Minister is committed to amending the legislation in such a way that regulation appropriate to banks is not applied to credit unions and such that the Irish League of Credit Unions is satisfied prior to Report Stage that this is the case, then we are all singing from the same hymn sheet and I hope we can all move together on this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, does the group of amendments we are discussing include those tabled by myself?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I tabled amendments Nos. 16 and 17.  Are those not being discussed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should I move those?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendments deal with the issues being discussed, but with a slightly different formulation.  These are among the most important amendments being proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  When I discussed the proposals with representatives of the league they put it to me that we have had a catastrophic failure of the for-profit banking model.  The credit unions are asking that the Bill, as recommended in the commission's report, should facilitate the promotion and expansion of an alternative financial services model that is not for profit and remove any impediment to the promotion and expansion of that alternative model.  The case for doing that is overwhelming, given the failure of the for-profit model.  Here is a model that does not carry the guilt of crashing our economy and provides an alternative way of doing financial services that is democratic and socially focused.  We should do everything in our power, given the current circumstances, to expand, develop and promote that model and remove any obstacle or impediment to its expansion.  That is the essence of the amendments.  Part of doing this is to allow credit unions to expand the range of financial services they make available to their members so that those services can be accessed everywhere in the country and the full range of services can be offered by credit unions to provide an alternative and a choice for people.   The fact that many for-profit banks are closing branches, particularly in small towns and rural areas, often means that a credit union is the only financial services outlet in an area.  In that context, it is even more important that they be able to offer the full range of services to their members throughout the country and not be limited or impeded from doing that in any other way. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment is exactly about shared services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was speaking to the amendment, Chairman.  What aspect of the amendment was I not speaking to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Shared services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand the point, Chairman.  I was talking about shared services, the capacity of credit unions to provide those shared services and removing impediments to their providing them.That is precisely what they have asked for in their representations to me and in their discussions with me. I suspect this is also the case for other members. It is very creditable that the credit unions say they wish to use some of their assets to promote social projects, social enterprise and other government projects which would be beneficial for the economy, would create employment and be beneficial in boosting demand in the economy. They want to be allowed to do this. However, because of certain restrictions on them they are having to send money abroad when what they would prefer to do is to invest money in this country for the promotion of employment and enterprise. They would prefer to be assisting the Government in its financial difficulties in trying to improve the economic lot of the country. These are very important amendments which we are proposing on behalf of the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Minister should accept them. They are very worthwhile and they will benefit not just the members of the credit unions but also the economy and the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendments are similar to the others in the group.  The Minister has indicated that there are three aspects to this matter, namely, the sharing of back office services, shared branching or front office services and credit unions being in a position to use their assets to invest in socially beneficial projects.  I do not want to question anyone's bona fides in this regard, but will the Minister explain why the credit unions believe there is an impediment to having shared back office services?  Is it simply the case that they do not understand that there is no such impediment?  Has the Minister discussed the matter with the credit unions in the interests of everyone moving forward together and reaching an understanding that there is nothing to prevent the sharing of such services in the way they would like? I am slightly more concerned about the Minister's response on the issue of front-office services. Obviously I will go back and talk to the credit unions but I would be interested to hear what further comment the Minister would make on this. I would hate to think that we were blocking the credit unions from expanding the number of services they can make available because, for example, it might not be to the liking of the for-profit banking sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am throwing out that comment because the credit unions were keen to emphasise that they want to offer an alternative to the for-profit banking model and that their inability to offer shared front-office services in a number of areas is inhibiting them from developing, expanding and promoting that alternative model.  The Minister said a settlement system between different credit unions was needed, that an underwriting service was required and that there were issues relating to loans being taken out and who was responsible for them.  Those are all reasonable concerns.  The infrastructure and safeguards for credit union members will need to be in place.  However, the important point is that this Bill indicates that the Minister is in favour of facilitating the expansion of these services.  He could easily insert wording into the Bill to indicate that - namely, that we want to move in that direction and to remove any impediment to doing so but that all of those safeguards would have to be put in place first.  The relevant legislation that would govern the provision of such sharing of services in the for-profit banking sector would have to apply where appropriate and so on.  It seems the credit unions are right to want to move in this direction and are disappointed the Bill has failed to do that.  Perhaps it is difficult and complex to put that infrastructure in place.  I do not know that and perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on whether it is very difficult to do so.  I will be keen to hear what the credit unions have to say, but they have expressed disappointment in that regard.  What they are asking for makes sense from the point of view of credit union members and with the aim of providing members of the public with a choice in terms of a different type of financial services.  On the issue of credit unions' ability to invest in socially beneficial projects that could help create employment and so on, the Minister said he was open to such suggestions.  I am sure that is welcome, but he also seemed to sound a note of caution by saying that credit unions could not put funds in a place where the members would not be able to call their money back on demand.  That is a reasonable point, but what the credit unions have said to me - and I have certainly heard this suggested - is that they would lend the money to the Government at a reasonably low interest rate and the State would guarantee a return on the money.  They would rather lend money to the Government for projects that would stimulate employment and help the domestic economy than have to invest it outside the country, as is currently the case.  I would be interested in the Minister's response to this.  Sallynoggin Credit Union has written to me to say it is now restricted to having 25% of the total value of its investment portfolio deposited with any single institution.  With fewer banks here now, that means it has to put its money in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, and when it has reached the limit of the amount it is allowed put into any one institution, it is left with the rest of the money.  There is nowhere to put it and it must invest it outside the country.  It does not want to do that; it wants to invest the money here.  The credit unions might be able to lend money to the Government at a reasonable interest rate with a guaranteed return, which means such an investment would pose no danger for their members in that they would know their money was safe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must object in the strongest terms.  I did not make that point previously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  I did not make any point about money being lent to the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  In my initial contribution I did not make any reference to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was speaking in response to the Minister's answer and refining the point because he said there was an impediment to this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I note the Chairman has cut across me twice in a way he has not cut across any other speaker.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point but I disagree with the Minister that credit unions and banks operate according to precisely the same principles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister made a comparison.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  The Minister made a comparison and it sounded a bit like that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister implied that the members’ dividend in the credit union was the same as a shareholding in banks in that they were both based on profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to differ.  We will leave it at that.  Of course it is reasonable and correct that the Minister would want to ensure the safety of the deposits and savings of credit union members.  I gather from his response that he is willing to consider any reasonable proposal that would both do that but also meet the objective of the credit unions, which could allow funds they have, which currently they are just putting in the banks, but which they would rather put elsewhere into purposes that might be beneficial to the Minister and the country’s interests.  I hope he will examine the options.  It seems a reasonable and credible aspiration on the part of credit unions and it should be examined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is precisely the opposite point that I am making.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I say to the Minister-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not finish my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I am acting simply as a conduit for points that were raised by the Irish League of Credit Unions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The credit union movement put a very convincing argument.  I do see myself as a delegate of movements outside of this Parliament that I admire and see as offering a useful model for how we can do things better.  The point I make is precisely the opposite to what the Minister suggested.The credit union movement is frustrated that the regulations are such that the deposits it has cannot be used to benefit the community, employment and society as a whole and must be deposited in for-profit banks both here and abroad. The representatives of the movement said this. The movement would like to be able to enter into an arrangement with the Government so that the funds could be used to benefit the community and economy and enhance employment prospects. That is the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are still serious doubts about banks everywhere.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 28:In page 19, line 33, to delete “or voluntary assistant”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 20, lines 43 and 44, to delete all words from and including “and” in line 43 down to and including “legislation” in line 44.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 21, to delete lines 8 to 18.These amendments relate to the problem of term limits and the impact they will have on smaller credit unions.  The credit unions made the point to us that smaller credit unions in rural areas, where there might be a small pool of people who keep the credit union going, could face problems if there are term limits.  The amendments would remove the term limits, which could be detrimental to the ability of credit unions of function.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is taking a reasonable approach to many of the issues raised and the proposed amendments.  Having listened to his views on the matter, I have still not fully arrived at a view on it.  I did not hear him express his view on the principle of rotation.  An issue arises with regard to the smaller credit unions, and suggestions for addressing the problem have been made by Deputies Pearse Doherty and Michael McGrath.  The proposal to impose limits on periods of service has provoked a major reaction from the credit unions.  The Irish League of Credit Unions, the representative body of credit unions, has acknowledged that it did not expect this response from member credit unions when it participated in discussions of the issue at the Commission on Credit Unions.  The publication of the draft legislation provoked a major reaction, which may have been partly because the credit unions believed the proposal undermined the democratic principle that members should make decisions of this nature.  Why should these limits apply to credit unions when they do not apply to banks?  Why is it necessary to make a special provision and apply term limits which restrict the right of members to make decisions about who they want on boards and as principal officers?  I apologise to the Minister if he has answered my questions.  If so, I do not expect a lengthy response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case, I apologise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 49:In page 27, line 31, to delete "3 consecutive terms" and substitute "5 consecutive terms".My amendment concerns the same issue, that is, the time limits.  There is no need to rehash the arguments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 54:In page 33, lines 11 and 12, to delete "and other financial services legislation".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 55:In page 35, line 16, after "committee," to insert the following:"as expressed through a written statement issued to the director in question,".This is a particular issue arising from a representation at my clinic of a person who had formerly served on the board of an oversight committee and considers that due process was not followed when it came to his removal from the board.  He made the point that if the oversight committee makes a decision to remove a person from the board of directors there should be a written record of it, in order that if somebody wants to challenge it subsequently it is possible to retrace the steps and the rationale behind that decision.  It appears to be a reasonable requirement for transparency and accountability and the functioning of the oversight committee and I hope the Minister does not find it controversial.  The person who has raised the issue would be very happy if the amendment was accepted because he considers it an important part of ensuring proper transparency and accountability in the functioning of these committees. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ditto.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 84:In page 55, lines 26 and 27, to delete all words from and including “and” in line 26 down to and including “legislation” in line 27.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish League of Credit Unions places significant emphasis on this issue in its representations.  It seems to be a reasonable request in what is now a very different regulatory environment that there be a clear understanding of how credit unions will relate to the Central Bank and the terms under which they will do so.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response, but it seems to be a reasonable request, given the new requirements being imposed on credit unions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister agrees with the principle that there would be such a protocol for how the credit unions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume that the credit unions, as very different bodies to the banks or other big financial institutions that are run by professionals, are worried about a regulatory environment that is extremely onerous on them, given their volunteer basis.  If I remember the representations they made to us, that is what they were afraid of.  The important point is that we are sensitive, in the drafting of this legislation, to that concern and do not do anything that is unnecessarily onerous, notwithstanding the obvious need for regulation, which the credit unions and everyone here accepts.  It is important that we do not do anything that makes life unnecessarily difficult for them.  In that context, while not wishing to get into an argument with the Minister, why does it interfere with the independence of the Central Bank to regulate if we require that such a memorandum be in place?  The amendment does not state what should be in the memorandum but rather that it would be a requirement that it be made clear to the credit unions what sort of obligations they might be operating under.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not telling the Central Bank how it is to relate to the credit unions.  It is just making it a requirement that it has an understanding so that the credit unions know what their potential obligations might be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Noonan is the Minister.  He should decide.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an important amendment.  A convincing case was made to me by the credit unions and the Irish League of Credit Unions to the effect that this threatened the democratic ethos of the credit unions.Whereas the credit unions recognise that certain functions are executive functions, the treasurer is elected directly by the members and is then responsible for preparing accounts and making sure everything is above board with regard to what the members want and what their priorities are and has oversight of the accounts of the credit union. Removing that role from someone who is directly elected by the members is problematic and undermines a key plank of what a credit union is. The credit unions accept that there is a division of labour between officers elected by members and the executive functions of full-time staff but they fear this measure is going too far towards putting all that power, or responsibility, into the hands of people who are not directly accountable to the members. That seems like a reasonable case.  This is about maintaining the fundamentally democratic ethos and character of what a credit union is and not turning it into something that begins to look more like a bank, I suppose. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The credit unions accept that much of the operational stuff has to be done by the managing director, but that there is a role for a directly elected treasurer who has oversight of the accounts.  That seems to be to be a reasonable position and I do not see why the Minister would not see the need at least to take on board what is being said here, as he has been very reasonable on other matters, and try to find a way to deal with these concerns and what is a legitimate point made by the members of the credit unions and the organisations that represent them.
