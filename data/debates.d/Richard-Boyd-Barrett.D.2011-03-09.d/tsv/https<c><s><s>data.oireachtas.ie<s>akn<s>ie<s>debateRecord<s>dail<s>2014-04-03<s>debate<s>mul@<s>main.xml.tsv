RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will discuss this issue in more depth later. I, and other Deputies, want to challenge the one-sided presentation of the very serious conflict in Ukraine. Russia is acting in its own interests and flouting international law. A referendum held at gun point is not legitimate and military incursions into another territory are not acceptable but equally, there are very dangerous elements in the Ukrainian Government, some of which are taking over the armed forces. There are alarming indications of intimidation, violence and so on against minorities and political opponents of the Ukrainian regime. The Government must view this in a more balanced way and not line up with a NATO-EU-US manipulation of a crisis in Ukraine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, we are getting the completely one-sided take on this. It is absolutely true that the demonstrations in Kiev were partly motivated by the corruption of the Yanukovych regime. Unquestionably, it was a corrupt and rotten regime. It is unquestionable that many Ukrainians - in certain parts of the country at least - may look towards Europe as against Russia but that is not the end of the story. The other side of the story is that Europe knows damn well that there are significant minorities which would look to Russia and that any expansion of the European Union or NATO would be seen as a direct provocation and threat to those minorities. Do not tell me the EU-NATO strategists do not understand these things and that they are stupid or blind to them. They know damn well that it represents a provocation and that Russia has traditionally seen states and places like Crimea as buffer states against rivalry from the West.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That stuff is archaic but, nonetheless, Europe knew that. Crucially, now in the Kiev government, which the Minister of State said he fully supports, there are extreme right-wing and fascist elements which are dangerous. We have seen some pretty horrific examples of the sort of stuff they are doing. These people have hijacked what may be a legitimate desire for more democracy in Ukraine essentially to implement a dangerous far right and, in some cases, neo-fascist agenda but the Minister of State fully supports this gang.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would start by understanding that there are different cultural and linguistic groups and that there is a history of tension between those groups. Any changes to the orientation of Ukraine must take those things into account if one does not want to spark the sort of disaster we saw in the Balkans. The unilateral recognition by Germany of Slovenia and Croatia sparked the civil war in Yugoslavia with disastrous consequences which were absolutely predictable because Yugoslavia was an ethnic patchwork. Everybody knew that if one started to unilaterally recognise certain states, it would be a provocation to others and the result would be ethnic cleansing. The EU is playing with fire in a very dangerous way and giving succour to extreme right-wing elements. The Minister of State should not tell me that EU-US-NATO did not know that. What the hell is NATO doing expanding into eastern Europe when it was supposed to be a Cold War entity? This is dangerous geopolitical expansionism by the EU-US-NATO and it could have very dangerous consequences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should have talked to all elements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said talk to all elements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not a democratic election.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what they said in the First World War.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes; Yugoslavia is an example. Germany did-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is where the hypocrisy is exposed. Europe jumps up and down and states it is fighting for self-determination and human rights in Ukraine and that it is to impose sanctions. It claims its justification in this regard but adopts a different approach to Egypt, where 529 Muslims have been sentenced to death by mass political execution by a brutal military regime based on trumped-up political charges. Where are the sanctions or calls for urgent action in this case? Where are the emergency debates in the DÃ¡il about this? They are not happening, such is the Government's hypocrisy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very heartened to hear clear and unequivocal condemnation of the sentences. While this is positive, why is there such a contrast between the approaches to Ukraine and Egypt? Five hundred and twenty-nine people are to be executed by the military regime in Egypt based on trumped-up charges but there is no talk of sanctions or urgent action. If the Russians decided to execute 529 people in Ukraine tomorrow, what would the Minister of State be doing or saying now? There would be emergency sessions of the United Nations, immediate sanctions, sabre rattling and probably talk of military action. I would not be in favour of military action but of an emergency response and the imposition of hard sanctions to show the proposed action is unacceptable. It is a question of not trading with Egypt, breaking off diplomatic relations with it and using every bit of power at our disposal to stop it engaging in mass political executions that are essentially to reconsolidate the dictatorship of Mubarak under a new name.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I appreciate the clarity of the Minister of State's response, I am conscious that the sense of urgency in this case seems to be smaller than in other cases. Some 529 people are under threat of execution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are Government or all-party motions not being tabled on this matter? Why are we not having an emergency debate on this issue like the debate on the situation in Ukraine that will take place later today? I do not understand why we are not taking a hard line with a regime that is essentially trying to drown in blood, or repress by means of fear and intimidation, the democratic revolution of the Egyptian people. We should make no bones about the fact that this is what the regime is doing. The Egyptian embassy is still happily operating in this city. I suspect that we are doing big trade with Egypt, for example, by selling beef to that country. What does the Government intend to do if the Egyptian authorities do not immediately indicate that they intend to drop these trumped-up charges and end any talk of executing people? Given that the current regime in Egypt executed a load of members of the Muslim Brotherhood outside a mosque, it seems that this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. I am no fan of the Muslim Brotherhood, but it is clear to me in this instance that the regime is guilty and has blood all over its hands.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is to be equally divided.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have agreed the order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an equal division of time between myself and Deputies Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Joe Higgins and John Halligan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are opposing the Government's motion because it is adding dangerous fuel to a very dangerous fire that is engulfing Ukraine. We have put forward an alternative motion which is absolutely clear in saying that we oppose the Russian military incursion into Ukraine and that we do not accept the legitimacy of a referendum which took place at gunpoint. We agree with the Government on that but we do not agree with the entirely one-sided approach it has taken in this matter, which could and will fuel the conflict. The approach is giving succour on the one hand to the expansionist agenda of NATO, the EU and the US into eastern Europe and, on the other, to a dangerous coalition of the far right, neo-fascists and billionaire oligarchs who have been busy plundering the resources and the wealth of Ukraine since the break up of the former Soviet Union. Some of those oligarchs, including Rinat Akhmetov and Dmitry Firtash, initially supported Yanukovych but have now opportunistically switched to the other side in order to further their own interests and garner favour from this dangerous, right-wing mob which is trying to manipulate the economic, social and political crisis in Ukraine. This has led, as others have said, to the Chief Rabbi in Kiev telling Jewish people that they had better leave the country for their own safety. It has also led to attacks on journalists who were critical of the Government line and so on. This is a dangerous situation. Ukraine has long been at the crossroads of competing imperial interests and has suffered desperately as a result. It suffered at the hands of the Romanovs and became part of what was known as the prison house of nations in the interplay between the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires. It was partitioned after the Russian revolution, suffered under the Hitler-Stalin pact with forced collectivisation under Stalin and 4 million Ukrainians were killed under the Nazis. It is worth remembering just how that history has polarised Ukrainian society. One hero for some in the east of Ukraine is a man called Bandera. He collaborated with the Nazis who were involved in the vicious killing of Ukrainians. The same man would be seen as a mortal threat to Russian speakers in other parts of Ukraine, most notably in Crimea. NATO and the EU are well aware of these dangers. Even Kissinger, of whom I am not a fan, has said that what is going on is dangerous and that NATO and the EU knew what they were doing in manipulating this situation, with the response from Russia being inevitable. We are saying that the Government should be even-handed and neutral in this - say "Yes" to the right to self-determination of the Ukrainian people but "No" to the interference by NATO, the EU, the US or Russia in the internal affairs of the Ukrainian people.
