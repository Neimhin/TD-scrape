RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wonder whether the African saying, the lion roared but gave birth to a mouse, might apply to the Government's great plans for Creative Ireland. When the arts were debated here, we heard noble words and fine aspirations from Government speakers who trumpeted their commitment to the arts. What is actually happening? What has actually been discussed in delivering on Creative Ireland? It is difficult to see what might be delivered with the miserable €5 million dedicated to this initiative. What is actually happening with the commitment to community arts? We were told that every child would have an opportunity to express himself or herself creatively. What exactly is happening with the pilot scheme for self-employed artists in receipt of jobseeker's allowance? It has been talked about, but there is no sign of anything being rolled out. Artists face difficulties when they are expected to show that they have been looking for work, but the arts do not work like that. The Government recognised that some scheme was needed. Ministers spoke about establishing a pilot scheme to accommodate the needs of artists, but there is no sign of such a scheme. In the light of its verbal and rhetorical commitment to the arts, has the Government started to consider whether it will provide for a serious increase in the allocation for the arts in the forthcoming budget? I remind the House that this country is at the bottom of the league table for GDP expenditure on the arts. Has the Government discussed this? Are there plans to increase the allocation for the arts significantly in the forthcoming budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a case of neoliberalism in the arts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	James Joyce would have been banjaxed on that principle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To put it mildly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While Simon and Leo battle it out to succeed the Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and there might be a dark horse or two - God knows - the programme for Government commitments in the area that is most urgent for the citizens of this country are failing disastrously. The Taoiseach might say to Simon and Leo that they are to keep the campaign short and deal with this housing crisis, which the Taoiseach has helped create. I want to ask a number of specific questions about the Taoiseach's programme for Government commitments. First, the very first line of the programme's chapter on housing refers to "affordable". There is no affordable scheme. There is no affordable rental scheme mentioned in the programme and no affordable housing scheme mentioned in Rebuilding Ireland. Even though these form centre pieces of Rebuilding Ireland, there is not a sign of these schemes. Second, the programme refers in great detail to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and its central role in delivering. Deputy Simon Coveney confirmed something yesterday, which every TD in this Dáil knows, that the figures are shocking and revealing. In Dublin, average rents for a two-bedroom house are now €2,600 a month whereas the HAP rent support is €1,250 a month for the same sized accommodation. In other words, average rents are more than twice what the Government is willing to give people in HAP support to find accommodation. Needless to say, they cannot find it and they end up homeless. What will the Taoiseach do to bridge that gap? Currently, it is simply a recipe for spiralling homelessness, which is shocking and obscene.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should respond to my specific question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not surprise me but it is completely scandalous that we have revelations from yet another Garda whistleblower alleging that innocent people's phones are being tapped. In one case, according to the allegation, a sitting Deputy had his or her phone tapped by An Garda Síochána, possibly as a result of pressure from a Minister. Certainly, the whistleblower believes it was a political move by a Minister at the time. The garda was subsequently transferred which certainly suggests that there was something seriously amiss and that the correct procedures for getting these taps were not being followed.Deputy Clare Daly has alluded to the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, which allows for bugging. The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 allows the police to break into one's house to install cameras and to come back after three months to take those cameras out. One might not know they were ever in one's house. There have been extraordinary allegations that all this is being done without proper procedure and oversight, and possibly for political reasons. The Taoiseach is supposed to get an annual report on complaints, but we have been told that no such records can be found, which is unacceptable. Will the Tánaiste get these reports? If there are any irregularities, will she hand the names over to the Director of Public Prosecutions? Can she say how times phone and mail surveillance has been authorised by her and other justice Ministers under her Government? How many of these cases of surveillance were political?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from that, the emergency clause in the 2009 Act, which allows a superior officer rather than a judge to carry out these recording or tracking of people doubled between 2009 and 2010. Will the Minister explain what the hell was going on in that period? I have a direct question for the Minister. During her tenure or the tenure of Ministers for Justice and Equality in this Government, how many phone and mail surveillance operations were authorised and how many of those were political in nature as opposed criminal? Will she comment on the report from the designated judge for 2016 on all the surveillance operations under both Acts and indicate if they were for political or criminal purposes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling the motion on an extremely important subject. Huge numbers of citizens are being ripped off by insurance companies. I primarily want to address the cost of motor insurance, but I will comment on the cost of health insurance initially. It is the biggest scam ever. I would never take out private health insurance on principle because in the area of health it is obscene and unacceptable that we have a two-tier system under which people receive premium health care if they pay and second-class health care if they do not. It is worse than that because many of the inadequacies in the public health system result precisely from the existence of a private health tier and private health insurance leeching off the public system, a little like fee-paying schools. They receive the benefits of public funding and support, while generating a premium above it to support a two-tier system. I understand many people take out private health insurance out of fear of the public system, but the problem is that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. By taking it out, they reinforce the system. I do not blame those who do it out of fear, but, ironically, are they better off with private health insurance? It is a serious question as to whether they are because when it comes to the most serious illnesses, they end up having to go back into the public system. The private health insurance industry is a parasite on the public health system and resources and finance that should go into providing a quality universal health system for all. The Government parties often talk, as a way of absolving themselves of the crisis in the public system, about the fact that Ireland spends one of the highest proportions of GDP on health services, but they always fail to say a huge portion of that figure, approximately €3 billion, is paid to the private system. When it is taken out, one realises why there is a crisis in the public health system. We mirror the United States in that sense. A total of 40% of expenditure on health services in the United States basically represents profiteering by the private health insurance industry and other private health service providers. We should get rid of private health insurance by having a national health system. It is one extortionate cost imposed on huge numbers of people that could be removed. I do not disagree with anything in the motion and there is not much with which I disagree in the reports of the Minister of State and the Oireachtas joint committee which made some good recommendations. However, none of them will address the problem, which is that motor insurance providers are profiteering from the fact that it is a mandatory legal requirement to have motor insurance if one drives. They have a captive audience.Many people do not have a choice about driving. A car is necessary for many people in rural areas where public transport is woefully inadequate. One has to have insurance, otherwise one is breaking the law. For elderly people, people with mobility problems and people who earn their living through driving - the most obvious are taxi drivers but there are other jobs that require a car - one is captive in that one has to drive and the law requires one to have insurance, but the State does not provide a minimum level of not-for-profit insurance. Therefore, one is prey for the private motor insurance companies which profiteer from the fact that they have a captive market. The transparency measures do not go far enough. The emphasis put by the Government in the prelude to these reports was all about fraudulent claims, overstating the extent of those fraudulent claims, legal costs, which are a factor but do not explain the dramatic increases in recent years, and giving more information to the consumer about the breakdown of premiums or increases and all the rest of that. They do not get to the fundamental problem, and I do not think any of these measures will get to the fundamental problem, that the private insurance companies with a captive market can always find ways to ratchet up premiums to make money. Private insurance companies are entirely tied up with a market. The biggest reason for the big increases was that their investments went bad. They lost much money on the markets and then decided to recoup that money by screwing the premium holders and people seeking insurance. That was the major reason for these dramatic increases, and nothing is going to stop, including the measures proposed in the Fianna Fáil motion, in the Government's recommendations or for that matter by the all-party Oireachtas committee. Given that it is a legal mandatory requirement, there has to be the provision of some sort of basic motor insurance which is affordable for everybody on a not-for-profit basis. If people want premium insurance after that, they can go to the private market. This is a legal requirement. If it is a legal requirement, the State has to make it affordable for those who need it. Taxi drivers are literally being put out of business by these guys. If one has the slightest prang - of course, one is going to have small prangs if one is driving all the time for a living - one is gone. Premiums are already massively high and people who have never had accidents are getting premiums of €17,000 and €20,000, which are ridiculous figures. That is not sustainable for taxi drivers. Of course, over the course of driving for a living, one is going to have some little accident, which is not even one's fault. It could be a small thing, but that is it - one is out of a job. There has to be a particular control or the provision of a special category of insurance premiums and policies to allow taxi drivers to function, or for that matter other people who have to drive for a living. Something has to be done about the issue of discrimination against the elderly, against young people and against rural dwellers. I also believe young nurses and other health care workers are getting punitive premiums, and I believe journalists also get punitive premiums for some reason just because they are journalists. I do not quite fully understand that. That discrimination should not be allowed. I asked the Minister of State about this and he said that is just the way insurance works. He said companies look at categories of drivers and this is going to influence the premiums. That is not fair. If one happens to be in one of those categories, but has a perfectly good record, or has a car that passed the NCT, but happens to be older, one is penalised. That penalises the young or less well-off but it is just not fair. None of the Minister of State's measures is doing anything to deal with that unfairness and discrimination.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly support Deputy Eoin Ó Broin's amendment on the need for us to have a report within at least six months on the Government's compliance with the European Union's environmental impact assessment directives and the Aarhus Convention. This issue has been drawn to my attention in recent weeks by environmental groups, specifically the Woodland League. I know that others are also very concerned about it. I had a discussion with some of the departmental officials before we came into the House about the number of cases pending against Ireland for breaches of the EIA directives and there seemed to be some debate about how many there were. I read an article recently in which it was suggested there were 15, including five at what was called the second phase. That may or may not be true and I see the officials shaking their heads. We will come back to that issue. I do not have the command of the detail that others outside this House might have, but the point made to me about the landslide at Derrybrien, where a mountain collapsed after a windfarm had been built there, was that a case had been brought against Ireland because the developers and the planning authorities had failed to ensure proper compliance with the EIA directives. Subsequently, there were court cases, but the ruling was that we had failed to comply. Afterwards, as I understand it, a new concept was brought forward - substitute consent - to give retrospective permission, as in a retention order, for developments that were illegal and that did not fully comply with the EIA directives. In the case of Derrybrien I have legal letters which suggest that, even with the substitute consent required afterwards, the EIA directives were not fully complied with, particularly in respect of public consultation. At the heart of the original problem was the failure to comply with the requirement for public consultation and an EIA. The same was true of the substitute consent, which in itself is dodgy because it involves the retention of something that should never have happened. In this case it led to an environmental disaster. The new concept retrospectively legitimises stuff that was illegal and breached the EIA directives. In the case of Derrybrien, even the processes involved in seeking substitute consent were not complied with in murky circumstances. I do not have time to go into all of the details on this point, but it merits proper debate and I will submit parliamentary questions about it. The State and semi-State companies are planning major infrastructural developments such as contentious wind farms and other renewable energy projects, but we have not fully transposed the EIA directives into domestic legislation. We have dodgy concepts such as substitute consent to try to cover our tracks and allow these developments to go ahead without full compliance. Do not get me wrong - I am very much in favour of renewable energy projects, but big wind farms are very contentious. There are real issues about whether communities are being consulted and about the environmental impacts which were disastrous in the case of Derrybrien. This area needs to be seriously scrutinised. Apart from anything else, we could be subject to major fines, but these are controversial issues in terms of the impact on communities, engaging in proper public consultation and a proper assessment of the potential damage to the environment. There are big questions about the way we do things and suggestions that where the State or semi-State companies are doing things, there is a nod and a wink culture to get stuff through and ride roughshod over local communities and best practice that seeks to ensure the environment is not damaged.  For all of these reasons, the amendment is terribly important. We need a detailed report on the issue and a very detailed discussion and debate in this House which should be well flagged to give environmental groups and those with knowledge an opportunity to feed into the debate before it happens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very disappointed the Minister of State is not accepting amendment No. 1, in the name of Deputy Ó Broin. It is because the Government essentially wants the flexibility to ram through big infrastructural projects without having them properly screened. I would like clarity from the officials because they said there are not 15 cases. A document by environmental consultants in Waterford states:There are currently 15 cases being taken against Ireland. Of these 5 could be considered to be at Stage Two. These are;- Failure to regulate septic tanks [...].- Failure to ensure that Environmental Impact Assessments are carried out on various agriculture and fish farming projects.- Failure to implement the Birds Directive with respect to the designation of SPAs [...].- Failure to implement the Habitats Directive.- Failure to require EIAs for particular projects and the facilitation of Planning Retentions which are seen as undermining the effectiveness of the EIA Directive. I am sure that, in making the latter point, the consultants are referring to the famous substitute consent. I have to hand a letter from the Director-General for Energy of the European Commission, Dominique Ristori. It is dated 2015 so perhaps there is an update on it. It states our national renewable energy action plan is not compliant with the Aarhus Convention, according to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee. This relates to many of these big infrastructural renewable energy projects. We saw what happened in Derrybrien. There was supposed to be legislative change to do something about that. The question is whether there was, but the signs are there was not. Interestingly, in the case we had in Dún Laoghaire, An Bord Pleanála allowed a development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour and when we engaged in a judicial review against that decision, it pulled out of the case. It withdrew the case. Even An Bord Pleanála was failing in its full application of the environmental impact assessment. When faced with a judicial review, it had to pull out. That tells one a lot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Privatised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept the Government's argument that establishing a genuinely independent regulator is somehow taking away the democratic imperative for people elected and accountable, as public representatives are, around policy and legislation. It is not what is being proposed. The point is to have some sort of genuinely independent checks and balances on that. The Minister and the Government cannot act as the ultimate watchdog of themselves so we need a fully independent regulator that will ensure we are fully compliant. Earlier we heard how some of us, at least, believe we are not compliant with the environmental impact assessment directive and have flagrantly failed to engage in genuinely sustainable development in every sense of that word, so we need somebody who will independently oversee these matters and adjudicate on them if people are not doing what they should be, playing by the rules or failing to vindicate legislation or environmental directives, etc. I have a question for Deputies Daly and Wallace, and Deputy Wallace alluded to it. Who regulates the regulator and who would appoint the regulator? It is a problem as we have the phenomenon of regulators who are not really regulators but rather rubber-stampers. We must deal with that issue as well and a number of aspects must be addressed. The Public Appointments Service must be examined as to whom are its personnel accountable when it comes to important public appointments? They seem to me like a group of insiders and very much the permanent government, selecting its own people. I am sure most of the public do not really know who is in the Public Appointments Service, never mind the top level appointments committee and all that stuff. That process should be examined as it must be much more open and transparent. We need to establish a much greater role for the stakeholder groups of civil society, communities and environmental groups so as to give them real power to oversee planning and legislation. This links to the debate about EIA directives and the failure to properly take into account public participation, as they are supposed to, in planning decisions. There is more work to be done in developing a greater civil society and stakeholder oversight of planning and all sorts of aspects of government and regulation. In this debate, I favour the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly, as there is more weight behind the argument they make than what the Government is saying. It is not really addressing the issues brought up in the Mahon report and the need to check the abuse of political power in the planning process. We probably need to go beyond even what is in the amendments in terms of deciding how we appoint regulators and ensure they are genuinely independent rather than other types of political appointees who are not really accountable to civil society and stakeholder groups but who end up being rubber-stampers for whatever Government happens to appoint them.
