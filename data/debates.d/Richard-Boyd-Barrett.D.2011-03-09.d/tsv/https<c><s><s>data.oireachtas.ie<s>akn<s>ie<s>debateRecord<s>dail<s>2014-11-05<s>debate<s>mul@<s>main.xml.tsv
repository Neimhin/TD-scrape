RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The weekend's protests were not the result of communication problems; they were really an elemental outburst of rage, not only against water charges but also against six years of unfairness, stealth taxes and cuts. Much of the anger is centred on the cumulative impact not only of direct taxation but also of indirect taxation and charges. If the Government is listening to what the people expressed on the streets at the weekend, as it says it is, will it do something about the cumulative impact of all the measures that drove so many people onto the streets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That response really demonstrates how the Minister just does not get it. He does not understand why people went out on the streets at the weekend. I will just throw his own figures back at him. Somebody earning €17,000, as mentioned by the Minister, got €173 back in the budget. Somebody earning €120,000 got €687 back, according to the budget document. The latter got almost five times more than people on the lowest incomes. Even if water charges are pitched at the figure mentioned yesterday by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton - namely, €200, which figure I doubt and which already seems to be causing great controversy in the Government - it would more than wipe out what the Government is giving back to the individual on €17,000. The person on €120,000, however, will be more than able to manage. Therefore, how can the Minister seriously say to me and, more important, the people of this country that this is fair and progressive? When the Minister adds to it the impact of rising bus fares and electricity prices, property tax, public service charges and all the other taxes and charges that disproportionately hit the less well off, can he not understand that there is nothing progressive about the way in which he is managing taxes and that tax justice is the issue at stake? He is not dealing with it in a fair way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the problem with statistics. The Minister knows what they say about statistics. It just does not reflect the human reality that people are facing. That is what was expressed at the weekend. The OECD found last week that Ireland, out of 41 countries in the OECD, was 37th, or near the bottom of the league table, in terms of child poverty. Since 2008, child poverty has increased far more here than in almost every other country in Europe bar Latvia, Greece and Iceland. Other countries, even in the teeth of recession and adjustment, have improved with regard to child poverty. Here we have gone from 18% child poverty to 28.6%. Is that not the clearest evidence that, despite all the statistics the Minister throws around, the adverse measures he has been introducing in recent years disproportionately affect those on the lowest incomes? That is why people are on the streets expressing their rage. The Minister has to listen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, while low and middle income families were preparing to get out on the streets to protest against the unjust water charges, it was reported that the Department of Finance was working with multinational companies to discuss the patent box proposal. Is it true that it was clearly indicated that the Department was reassuring multinational companies that no further tax burden would be imposed on them as a result of the changes to the double Irish scheme and the new patent box proposal? Is it fair that such companies are being reassured that they will have to pay no more tax, while ordinary people are being crushed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The double Irish was a massive tax avoidance scheme by the multinationals which centred, to a large extent, on the way in which they could charge for the intellectual property rights of subsidiary companies which were tax resident nowhere and, consequently, avoid paying billions of euro in tax. Is the patent box not exactly the same because it centres on intellectual property? It is about offering further tax reductions to corporations here which pay some of the lowest levels of tax anywhere in the world. Yet again, they will be able to avoid corporation tax through this mechanism. Is this not replacing one tax avoidance scheme with another? It was reported last week that the Minister's Department was working with multinational companies and that, when in the United States, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, had met 17 leading multinationals to reassure them that the patent box scheme would not in any way penalise them in terms of having to pay a little more in tax. Is that true? Is this fair when ordinary people are being absolutely hammered?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The workers who work in these companies pay tax in the region of 30% to 35%, but, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the people who own these companies pay tax at 2% on their enormous profits. Even according to Revenue's figures, they pay an effective rate of approximately 6%. How is it fair that these multinationals pay tax at 2% or 6% when the people who clean the floors in their buildings pay tax at 20% or 30%? Why is it that the Minister is consulting these multinationals and assuring them that they will not have to pay anything more when even a small extra tax contribution from them would do away with the need to introduce water charges and to have many of the crushing austerity taxes and charges he is imposing on ordinary workers? Why is it that he will not even have a serious debate on the fairness of this and look at the effective corporation tax rate and increase it for the companies in question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, before the protests that took place at the weekend, the Minister for Finance was reported as suggesting they would be the last rally of the anti-water charges movement. He could not have been more wrong. The Irish revolution for the 21st century has begun. The people, as they rise up off their knees against six years of cruel injustice and unfairness, will not be lying down again any time soon. Unless the Government genuinely listens and scraps these hated water charges and undoes some of the cruel injustices perpetrated against Irish citizens in the past six years, it will fall. Unless it genuinely listens to the voices of the people who have risen up, this will be the rock on which it will perish. The message could not be clearer. The people do not want tinkering, statistics or mud to be thrown in their eyes about economic growth and the success of the Government. They want these hated water charges to be scrapped, with the undoing of some of the other injustices perpetrated against them such as the home tax and the cruel burden of the universal social charge, as well as some of the absolute vicious cuts directed against some of the poorest people. That was the message on Saturday and it was unmistakable for those of us on the streets involved in organising the protests. I spoke at dozens of meetings in the run-up to and the mobilisation of the protests at the weekend. The anger, outrage and determination of the people involved were absolutely unmistakable.People have had enough, yet the Minister stills tries to throw mud in their eyes about the so-called progressivity of his budget. How can he stand over a situation where somebody on €17,000 - a miserable, poverty wage - gets €173 back in this budget, which will be more than wiped out by the water charges, but somebody on €120,000 gets €687 back? How can the Minister justify that for people who cannot pay their bills and are on their knees? They are being made homeless because they cannot pay the rent or feed their children.  I have pointed out to the Minister that we are at the bottom of the OECD league table for child poverty. It is extraordinary and it is not just to do with the recession or the adjustment. Even in the teeth of the recession, other OECD countries have seen an improvement in child poverty. Notwithstanding all the economic difficulties, their governments said: "We're not going to let children fall into poverty. It's just not acceptable. It's not fair." Child poverty gets worse in Ireland, however, because this Government does not care, is not listening or does not know. I do not understand what it is, but that is a fact. They have left children to suffer the consequences of an economic crash in their priorities for dealing with it. There are alternatives. The Minister always says that we do not put forward alternatives, although we do so again and again. In our alternative budget, for example, we proposed that if one increased tax on people earning in excess of €100,000 and created new tax bands for those on very high earnings, i.e. over €140,000, over €180,000 and over €250,000, a few extra percentage points would raise €922 million, according to the Department of Finance. That figure was contained in a parliamentary reply from the Minister's Department. That sum would allow him to do away with the USC for everybody under the average industrial wage and slash it for people earning between €30,000 and €60,000. It would genuinely shift the tax burden onto those who can afford it, rather than continuing to cripple those who simply cannot pay any more.  The Minister resists with incredible determination the tiniest extra tax imposition on the financial services sector. A financial transaction tax would impose 0.1% on the several trillion euro in financial trading that goes on in the IFSC. According to the EU Commission it would raise €500 million a year, more than the Minister hopes to raise from struggling low and middle-income families. Which is fairer - levying 0.1% on financial speculators who would not even feel it, or battering low and middle income families who cannot even pay their bills with hundreds of extra euro that they simply cannot afford? How can the Minister say the latter is fair? It is obviously unfair. The financial speculators who caused the crisis would not even feel 0.1%, but other people will be driven further into poverty. More children will be driven into poverty and more people will lose their homes because they cannot afford to pay their rent. How can the Minister say that he cannot do anything about that? We have also made proposals concerning corporation tax. Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that before deductions and charges, the corporate sector made €61.5 billion in profits but it only pays €4.17 billion in tax. That is an effective rate of 6.5%. If the Minister put that up to 12.5%, which is the nominal rate, as a minimal effective rate he would raise €4 billion. Would that not go a long way to fixing the water infrastructure that the Minister cares so much about? Why cannot some of NAMA's €4 billion in cash reserves go into water infrastructure? Some of it could also go into building housing for the homeless and the 90,000 people on the housing waiting list. Why can the Minister not do those things? It is because the Government repeatedly defends, with incredible tenacity, the wealth of the richest people in the country and the enormous profits of corporations. It unloads the cost of an economic crisis again and again on the backs of the poor, struggling, working people of this country who simply cannot take any more. If the Minister wants to avoid the revolution, he should listen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what we are talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Deputy Twomey show me a nurse earning more than €100,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The general election might be on the same day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the most popular slogans chanted by the 200,000 people who took to the streets at the weekend was: "Enda Kenny in your ivory tower, this is called people power." As the Labour Party in the Seanad rebels against the Government over a referendum on Irish Water and as a crisis is gripping the Government in the face of a massive popular rebellion against the hated water tax, should the Government not be telling its European counterparts that it may not be in government the next time the European Council meets? That is because the people have finally lost patience with the cruel injustice of taking out €8 billion in interest on a debt that is not citizens' debt. It is being sucked out to pay off bondholders and financial institutions in Europe, while ordinary people are being crushed with water taxes, property taxes and all of the other austerity cuts and charges. In all seriousness, should the Minister of State not be telling his European counterparts that he may not be in government the next time the European Council meets because the people have had enough and are rising up against him? It is the supreme irony that Ireland's new European Commissioner was the very Minister whose fingerprints were all over this shambles and fiasco that was Irish Water and the water charges. Does it not say everything about Governments in ivory towers that are utterly out of touch with the people they are supposed to represent that the Minister who was responsible for this debacle has been rewarded with the highest position we can give an Irish politician in the European bureaucracy? It is really beyond belief. In some ways, is this not the answer to the questions European leaders have debated among themselves, namely, why is the European economy on its knees and why is investment down? Why are they panicking now about a lack of growth? The answer to that question is that we do not have the money to invest in the economy to generate real and sustainable economic growth here or elsewhere in Europe because we are being sucked dry by banks and financial institutions. They are sucking €8 billion out of the economy and the pockets of citizens. Similarly, the European economy has been devastated by the cost of putting bankers, bondholders and financial institutions ahead of the needs of ordinary citizens and the need to invest in real economic activity to generate genuine and sustainable economic growth. Instead, the European Union, as well as the current and previous Governments here, have shoved the bubble economy and the corporate vulture economy down our throats for the past 25 years. The Minister of State should take this message to his European counterparts. If they do not lay off and give us a break, he will be swept out of power by a movement of people power. It will not be too long before other governments in Europe face the same rebellion, unless they come out of their ivory towers and listen to the voices of the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A stark position was outlined by the head of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi. He referred to the European economy as being on the floor and that it needed a massive investment programme in order to stimulate real economic growth. Notwithstanding the fact that the Government is blowing its own trumpet about successes, there will be no sustained recovery if the European economy does not move in a different direction. As we never tire of telling the Government, there is no real recovery for ordinary families who continue to be hammered. Is there any lateral thinking at the discussions as to why this is the case? Why, after six years of a response to an unprecedented economic crisis, have the strategies adopted by the European Union failed to kick-start recovery? This links with the climate change issue. At what point will it dawn on our European partners - and us - that the law in Europe which essentially precludes major public investment in any of these areas is blocking recovery? We can take afforestation as an example. The State forestry company cannot contribute one iota to afforestation because of EU rules which insist on the process happening via the private sector or it will not happen at all. The State company which was established to contribute to afforestation in the country which would contribute in a serious way to reducing the effects of climate change, while creating employment and generating sustainable economic growth, cannot contribute to this process because of EU rules. This is unbelievable. At what point will we stand up and argue that it borders on madness that the vehicle we set up specifically to contribute to afforestation is precluded by the European Union from doing so?  The same principle applies to housing - we cannot build houses for homeless people because there must be matching funding for the private sector. Unless the private sector can make money from engaging in the activity, there will not be enough housing and people will be homeless. This again is related to EU rules. Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about what was happening in Kobane and I did not receive a straight answer. There is a big campaign across Europe - it is correct - to have the Kurdish PKK delisted from the list of international terrorist organisations. It has been engaged in peace discussions with the Turkish Government for many years and in recent weeks has been the major bulwark on the Turkish-Syrian border against ISIS, the organisation about which everybody in Europe and America is concerned. The Kurdish Peshmerga and PKK are resisting the ISIS offensive in Kobane, but the Turkish Government is frustrating their attempts to defend themselves against ISIS by putting tanks along the border and so on. It would be a major contribution if this country and Europe as a whole acknowledged the Kurdish PKK as a legitimate representative of the Kurdish people. It is fighting a liberation war against ISIS and some of the despotic regimes in the region.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a little disappointing that the Government has refused to accept what is a modest proposal by Deputy Collins. I commend her on putting forward this motion and on consistently raising the issues of mortgage distress and the need to deal fairly with people who find themselves in this extremely difficult situation. The proposals Deputy Collins has put forward are nothing more than the proposals agreed by an all-party committee that examined these issues, including members of the Government parties. Therefore, I do not see why the Government has moved an amendment to the motion. There seems to be widespread acceptance that there is no consistency whatsoever in terms of the banks and mortgage lenders to deal with the problems of mortgage arrears and that we need to improve the situation considerably to bring fairness, certainty and assurance to the many tens of thousands of families who find themselves in extreme difficulty now, some six years after this crisis hit.One can bandy about statistics on the number of mortgages that are less than 90 days in arrears and the banks meeting targets and so forth, but all of that masks the human reality that 130,000 families have been living a nightmare for six years. For many of them, there is no end to that nightmare. That is a very debilitating, unfair situation to put families and children through - living in a constant state of anxiety and insecurity about the roof over their heads. The Government has failed to deal decisively with that, despite the fact that an all-party committee of the Oireachtas has stated that it should do precisely what is proposed in this motion. It is worth pointing out that I, Deputy Joan Collins, and many other Members would go a great deal further than what is proposed in the motion. We have said from the beginning that Ireland should have adopted the Norwegian model and simply forced the banks to agree deals with distressed mortgage holders which would ensure that they kept the roofs over their heads. The Government has resisted that. Instead, it has put in place some rules and regulations, but to a large extent it has left the ultimate decisions in the hands of private banks. The banks are commercially driven and interested in profit. They are not particularly interested in the distress in which mortgage holders find themselves. It is worth noting the contrast between a bank that is fully owned by the State and other banks that are privatised or close to being privatised, after we bailed them out. The State-owned bank at least has brought in a third party in the form of the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation, which has been campaigning consistently for fairness and consistency in how we deal with distressed mortgage holders and is showing itself capable of getting results. It raises the question of why other banks, such as Bank of Ireland, which we also bailed out, are allowed to behave in whatever way they wish. As they consider their first responsibility to be their shareholders and making money for those shareholders, they are far less interested in the fate and plight of people who have distressed mortgages. It is against that background that the Government is being asked to be fair. I wish to make a final point. The other side of this coin is the spiralling social housing lists, the bill for which is being picked up by the taxpayer. They are spiralling out of control and to a large extent this is being caused by banks forcing tenants out as receivers move in and the banks repossessing people's homes, as a result of which people go on social housing lists. It was confirmed last week that the social housing list in Dún Laoghaire has increased from 4,000 to over 5,000 in just one year. I have not seen the national figures yet, but if that increase is replicated around the country, we are facing a social housing crisis that is spiralling out of control. We have not dealt in a proper way with the issue of providing housing for people as a right and ensuring that banks treat people fairly. If the State is not going to step up to the mark in terms of forcing the banks to behave properly, it should at least build social and affordable housing to ensure that people will have somewhere to go when they are turfed out by the banks. Indeed, it is this and previous Governments' privatisation of the housing market that has left us in this sorry state in the first place.
