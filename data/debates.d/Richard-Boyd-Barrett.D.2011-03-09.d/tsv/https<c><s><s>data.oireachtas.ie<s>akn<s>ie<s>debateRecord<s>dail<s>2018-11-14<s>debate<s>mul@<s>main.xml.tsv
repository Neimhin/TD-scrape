RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 1 December, the National Housing and Homelessness Coalition will be organising another demonstration on the ongoing housing and homelessness crisis which we have talked much about in this House. The national reform programme makes significant reference to the Government's plans to address the housing situation, and reiterates its targets under the Rebuilding Ireland plan. Does the Taoiseach accept that even at this point in the year, the Government is not meeting even those completely inadequate targets? The figures at the end of quarter 2 for the building of social housing show a total of 1,400 units and just under 500 council houses. The Rebuilding Ireland targets were for 6,385. The Government is way below the targets it set itself in Rebuilding Ireland, which are totally inadequate compared to the number of people on housing lists and in homelessness and emergency situations. Does the Taoiseach accept that Rebuilding Ireland is failing even on its own terms, and that what is stated in the national reform programme in respect of it is simply not going to happen? What is the Taoiseach going to do to address that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is below target though.
