RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do local authorities need the approval of the Minister or the Minister of State in order to build council houses?  From what I can see, local authorities have no freedom to make decisions about providing housing or taking money from elsewhere in the capital budget, allocating it to housing and deciding to build houses.  Should we not give as much freedom and flexibility as possible to local authorities to make decisions about the housing they need and how they would use the funding available?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With the approval of the Department.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 22(3) states:(3) The purchase of a house under this Part does not apply to—(a) a separate and self-contained dwelling in a building that—(i) is divided into a dwelling and one or more dwellings or other properties or both, andThis refers to flats or maisonettes.  I think it is unfair on the people in flats and maisonettes.  Notwithstanding my agreement with Deputy Catherine Murphy on the point that the State should replace any housing it sells on a house-by-house basis, if we have a tenant purchase scheme it should apply equally to everyone.  It is not fair otherwise.  In our area, people get allocated whatever house they are allocated and it may be a self-standing house or it may be a maisonette.  In the older parts of Dun Laoghaire and Monkstown Farm, people live in the up-down flats and they cannot buy them.  The same applies to some of the new apartment complexes.  This is not fair and it is discrimination against people who are allocated a flat or a maisonette.  I ask the Minister of State whether she agrees it is unfair and discriminatory and whether she will remove the exclusion from the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe I am reading the Bill wrong, but it seems clear.  It is pretty clear and it seems it applies to any apartment complex or maisonette.  This is specifically excluding apartments and flats from the provisions of the tenant purchase scheme.  Does Minister of State think that is fair and reasonable?  I do not think it is, and it should be removed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must examine that section of the other Bill.  Does this provision override the existing provision?  Why is this particular tenant purchase scheme different?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can come back to the issue on Report Stage now that I have flagged it.  Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have this point underlined.  The Minister of State is planning to remove section 25(2)(f).  Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is removing the line "the purchaser shall not, without the prior consent of the housing authority, make material improvements to the house".  Is that the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe income is one good criterion, but there should be a few criteria.  We should have a textured position on it.  Deputy Ellis makes a good point about relatives and family who might be willing to assist.  If that can help people, it should be taken into account.  The other matter that was taken into account in the past was how long one had been in the house.  People will regularly say, "I have been here for 30 years and I have probably paid two mortgages."  I do not know if they have paid two mortgages but they have paid a great deal of money and have made a big contribution in rent over a long period of time.  They would say that should be taken into consideration in deciding what the sale price would be.  A number of matters must be taken into account in drafting a fairer scheme that gives people the maximum opportunity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Minister will explain why the Residential Tenancies Act should not apply to housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies.  The section refers to the restriction on the application of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the PRTB is going to have responsibility for tenancies involving housing assistance payments, HAPs, and also for voluntary housing associations, why will it not apply to housing built under the terms of the capital assistance scheme, CAS?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is provision for an exception being made in this section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take the Minister of State and her officials at their word.  However, I wish to flag my concern to the effect that the same processes of recourse should be available to everybody.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is one of the most problematic and objectionable sections in the Bill.  It goes to the heart of a policy shift which began with a document produced by the Department in either 2011 or 2012.  That shift involved a move away from direct provision of council housing to a situation where the provision of social housing was outsourced to landlords.  This was slightly glossed over by what is a positive idea, namely, that if a person happens to be in receipt of housing support, there should be no disincentive for him or her to work.  Such a disincentive currently exists under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  That element of what the Minister of State is trying to do is positive.  In addition, it is both sensible and positive that all of the matters in question should come within the remit of local authorities rather than a plethora of agencies or Government Departments.  However, what is proposed in this section presents a major problem.  In the first instance, people are going to be removed from the housing waiting list.  Essentially, it states that a short-term solution is, in fact, a long-term one.  That is absolutely not the case, particularly because we are institutionalising and making permanent a massive outflow of public money into the pockets of landlords.  The latter is incredibly wasteful and we need to move away from doing it.  The major difficulty with what is proposed in this regard is that it is just not going to work.  Landlords are running away from arrangements of any sort which involve local or rent allowance.  They either state - in the most horrendous and discriminatory manner - that they will not accept these arrangements or they run away from agreements with tenants for whose business they were desperate a number of years ago when matters were not going so well.  This is just not going to work.  It is also going to cause major problems in terms of relationships between tenants, landlords and local authorities.  As matters stand, nobody knows who is responsible for what.  For example, landlords are discussing matters with tenants which perhaps they should be bringing to the attention of local authorities.  Questions are also arising as to who is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of properties.  I wonder whether councils have proper oversight in respect of matters of that nature.  There are major problems in respect of this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point that there are many amendments to get through but this is a key one.  I agree, as I am sure does almost everybody here, that streamlining areas under the local authority makes sense.  There are many positive aspects to that move but suggesting that an interim or temporary solution is permanent and that being in a HAP arrangement is the same as getting a council house is wrong.  Tenants do not see it that way.  Objectively, that is not the case because the tenant is dealing with a private landlord.  A private landlord can pull out of the arrangement or may not maintain the house to the same standard required of a local authority.  I have some advice for anybody in a HAP or RAS scheme.  They should take photographs of the inside of the house as soon as they move in because in two or three years' time they may find that the landlord will blame them for problems in the house which are to do with their failure to maintain the house.  Those are serious issues that have arisen.  The Minister should probably include in the Bill that it shall be deemed an interim form of social housing but it must be distinguished from getting a council house because it is not the same.  There will be murder if people are taken off the housing list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State explain this for me?  This section has to do with people in shared accommodation.  Will the Minister of State explain what exactly is being done in this section, as it is unclear to me?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean it is like a house share?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to underline that point.  The rent caps do not work in large parts of this city and in other large urban centres.  Currently, local authorities are breaching the caps, but they are denying that right to individuals in receipt of rent allowance.  The council housing departments know the rent caps are unworkable and they are being forced into private arrangements with private landlords who say they are upping rents or pulling out of the RAS scheme.  Therefore, local authorities are breaching caps and must do so to avoid evicting people in RAS schemes who are deemed to be housed.  They do this because they have a duty of care to them.  This is an issue we must address.  What is the duty of care in a HAP or RAS scheme?  The local authorities are breaching the caps because they know the caps are unworkable, yet the Minister of State seems to be stitching caps into the legislation.  This will not work.  If the logic of this is to ensure that we do not have a runaway train in terms of costs for housing, let me point out that it is costing us more to put people up in hotels than to breach the rent caps or, in the long term, build a council house.  I heard from an official in the housing department in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown that it costs €800 a week to put somebody in a hotel.  This amounts to €3,200 a month, while the rent cap for that person is €975.  This is crazy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I heard on the grapevine that the Limerick phase is not going terribly well, but we shall see.  I take the point the Minister of State makes about creating pressure in respect of the long-term solution, which is council housing.  The more I think about this, the more I want to object.  The Minister of State says this does not fix us to the rent caps.  If there is flexibility and local authorities exercise it, they will just exhaust their budgets at a certain point and have to turn people away.  This is happening.  I was talking to Wicklow County Council yesterday about a particular woman who has a severely autistic child.  She was in a hotel which kicked her and the child out - probably because it is coming to the summer holidays.  She is now out on the street.  She went to the local authority on Friday and whoever she was dealing with just said, "Sorry, we have nothing for you."  I rang the senior housing official and said "You have an obligation to this woman.  She has a severely autistic child."  She said "Sorry; the budget has run out.  I agree with you and am sympathetic, but the budget is gone."  She said there was nothing to give this woman.  I do not know where the woman is today and will have to talk to her later.  She is out on the street with a child who has severe special needs.  That is the problem.  Therefore, the legislation should provide that housing needs must be met, not that a local authority must work within certain financial parameters.  It is the wrong way around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister explain the logic of this provision?  My priority and I suspect the priority of all members is the people who are being housed.  It is proposed in section 38 that the local authority does not have an obligation to the landlord and that seems to fly in the face of the Minister's comments on preventing arrears through direct deduction.  If the policy is to avoid top up payments to the landlord because the balance over and above the rent support will be deducted from people, does it not follow that the rent owed to landlords will not arise?  As I understand the scheme, and it seems to make the RAS scheme permanent, the local authority will pay the rent to the landlord, so how can it not be obliged to pay the rent?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If that is the case, I do not understand the reason for this section as I do not see its logic.  What is the reason for the provisions of the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to labour the point, but let me flag it as an issue for Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the landlord is coming down on the tenant for various reasons, whereas I think the landlord should be relating to the local authority.  There is a grey and blurry area about the relationships between the tenant, landlord and local authority.  This seems to feed into that uncertainty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to flag an issue on section 39(3)(b) and (c).  I think issues around 'the duty of care' are very serious.  If a landlord pulls out of an arrangement with a local authority, what obligation does the local authority have to the tenant?  Is it the same obligation, which I think it should be?  Under section 39(3)(b) "the household is residing in the dwelling, the housing authority may provide, or continue to provide, housing assistance ... ".  It becomes "maybe" but not definitely.  I have come across cases already and we will come across more cases where the landlord will pull out of these arrangements.  Then a very serious question arises about the duty of care and where the person stands in relation to other people on the housing list.  I think the provision runs the risk of making a mockery of the housing list because the local authority will suddenly have people to house as a matter of priority.  This is happening already and will happen more was we move in this direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make the same point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Asking for a review of a decision made by the local authority and then saying that if a person challenges it, the official who will carry out the review will be more senior in the same department is fair enough as a first step.  I do not cast aspersions on officials in any housing department, but let us be  honest.  They are all in the same department; they all know each other and there are discussions about this and that person and so on; therefore, there must be another level of appeal on these matters where those reviewing decisions are genuinely and thoroughly independent of the housing department or the local authority.  While the amendment is reasonable, it does not go far enough.  We all know there can be difficult, heated and complex disputes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not a member of the committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister of State has confused us enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Clear as mud.  There is a lot of detail in that response that needs to be examined.I have a concern, although it may be covered in the detail of the Bill. People who are homeless, particularly those on the streets, often have difficulty in navigating the elaborate bureaucracy and processes that must be gone through in order to get into the system. I am worried about the axe that falls if people do not take certain actions within a specified period to ensure they are in receipt of the HAP in the crossover period from the RAS to the HAP. If the onus is on the homeless person to ensure he or she is transferred, this is a cruel instrument of which many may fall foul because of literacy problems or their general plight. I need to examine the detail, but I urge the Minister of State to think about this. We may find that many will be told they are off the system because they did not comply with requirements and will not receive any rent allowance because they did not move correctly into the HAP scheme. Another issue I would like to mention may not be covered in the detail of the Bill. People on the street often have great difficulty in providing an address. I am aware of a number of cases in which people who have offered the address of a sister or a brother have problems because this is not acceptable. For example, a guy in Dún Laoghaire who is from the town has a bad drug problem but is trying to kick drugs. There is no place for him in Bentley House, the homeless accommodation centre in Dún Laoghaire. As a result, he is sent into town to find accommodation, but he will not go because there are people with a chronic drug problem in the accommodation and he thinks he will have no chance of getting off drugs if he goes there. If he was provided with accommodation in Dún Laoghaire, he believes he would be okay. Faced with the option of going to Cedar House, he says he would rather sleep on the street, but the Department of Social Protection will not accept this. It states that if he does not stay in Cedar House, it will not accept his claim. These issues need to be examined in order that we do not have an unfair and rigid system under which people will be axed and told that if they do not carry out a certain action, they will be off the system. While I do not know how we can legislate for this issue, I wanted to flag it. I will study the Bill in more detail.
