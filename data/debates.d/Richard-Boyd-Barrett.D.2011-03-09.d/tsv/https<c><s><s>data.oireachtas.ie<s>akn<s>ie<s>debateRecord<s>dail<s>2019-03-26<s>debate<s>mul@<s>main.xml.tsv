RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning I attended the latest meeting of the Raise the Roof housing campaign. It was agreed that there would be another major demonstration on 18 May because of the failure of the Government to address the housing crisis and provide the desperately needed public and affordable housing required to address the housing emergency. I have to say one aspect of the Government's policy commitments has been talking about the social mix and affordable housing. On Friday there were promises to provide 6,000 affordable homes with no fanfare and I am not terribly surprised when the contents are looked at. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, published the regulations on affordable housing. We have been promised 6,000 affordable homes, but not a single one has been delivered. We have been waiting for two years for the regulations, but what is in them? There is absolutely nothing in them that will do anything to provide affordable housing. They talk about 40% of the market price being the discount that will be offered. In south Dublin the average house price is €590,000. A 40% discount will not help to provide affordable housing for those on low and average incomes. As it does not even include income eligibility criteria, we do not know who will actually be able to apply and, most importantly, there are no affordable houses planned to be delivered. Could the Taoiseach blame us for thinking we have to get out on the streets again in advance of the local elections to say the Government has failed, that it is not delivering on the promises it made, that there is not a single affordable home being delivered and that the affordable home scheme the Government is offering will not actually deliver affordable homes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The crisis is still going on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy McDonald was supposed to speak before both me and Deputy Micheál Martin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The atrocity that took place in New Zealand should absolutely shock us all, but it should also make us consider how such a hate-filled racist and Islamophobic massacre could take place.How did it happen? New Zealand is not the sort of country one would associate with this kind of thing. When I witnessed that horror and just a couple of days before I witnessed the Taoiseach meeting Donald Trump, I thought that whatever debates we may have had about Donald Trump, meeting him, inviting him here and so on, does the Taoiseach not now recognise that the anti-Muslim, nakedly racist rhetoric of Donald Trump directly legitimises, encourages and promotes the sort of horror we saw in New Zealand? He has given licence to the sorts of people who would carry that out. I am making a serious assertion. Considering the horror of what is going on and considering the growth of the far right and racism, I do not believe anybody could honestly draw any other conclusion but that Donald Trump has given licence, as the most powerful leader in the world, to the politics of hate, of the sort of hate that drove that massacre. I ask seriously in that context, if it is not a strategic threat to invite him here. I was in the mosque in Clonskeagh over the weekend at the multicultural day. I am not exaggerating when I say that the worshippers there were really afraid. They were thinking about having to impose security around the mosque, something they never wanted to do before because when Muslim people pray, they pray with their backs to the entrances. They thought they are seriously vulnerable now and it only takes a few maniacs with that hate-filled politics to consider that sort of action. One would never have thought it would happen in New Zealand, but Mr. Trump legitimises that stuff. The sorts of people who share that sick ideology would be encouraged if he comes to this country. I seriously ask the Taoiseach to reconsider his invitation to Donald Trump to come to this country because it will give licence and encouragement to the sort of sick mentality that carried out that massacre in New Zealand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about my question about Trump? The Taoiseach does not want to answer that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will not answer that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Quite right, Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I am on the Business Committee. In front of the Ceann Comhairle, the Chief Whip said the reason the Government was not going to free the Bill and the process from the committee was that it opposed the content of the Bill. That is what he said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are telling the Government it has no right to frustrate this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The process relating to this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are trying to change the process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has covered itself with shame in how it has dealt with this Bill, just as it has covered itself with shame in how it has failed to deal with the climate emergency that represents an existential threat to the future of humanity. It did not feel shame before Christmas when it was being lobbied by the representatives of the oil companies. We have checked the lobby register and we know who was lobbied. They included the Chairman of the climate committee, Ministers, Opposition spokespersons and so forth. I am glad to say that some of them have not capitulated. If the Government did not feel shame as it danced to the tune of the profit hungry saboteurs of the global environment, it should feel shame after the 15,000 students went on strike a couple of weeks ago. They reminded the Government what is at stake as it tries to sabotage this Bill in the most underhand, devious and dishonest way possible. The Government does not have the guts to stand up and say it does not give a damn about climate change, and that it just cares about the profits of the oil companies. Instead, it used the dark cavernous committee rooms where it has a majority. It dragged in a few Senators who did not even bother to turn up for the scrutiny of the Bill but who toddled in to vote to keep it hostage. Then it introduced an amendment in this debate, the effect of which will be to frustrate the will of the Dáil again and ensure nothing is done on this. It has been sabotaging democracy in order to continue the sabotage of the environment, imperilling the future of our young people. It is shameful, but not surprising. The record of this Government has been to show complete contempt for the fight to address climate change. The Government opposed amendments to the climate mitigation Bill in which we sought binding targets. When I tabled amendments to the forestry Bill in 2015 seeking binding targets on afforestation it voted them down.It increased bus fares when it should be reducing them and increasing subsidies to public transport. Where is the national retrofit programme that would allow us to retrofit our homes, reduce energy usage and deal with the squalor in which many people in this country live because of poor building standards, as well as address the issue of energy emissions? Ministers go over to Europe and we hear special pleading for protections for the big ranchers. We are trying to worm our way out of our climate commitments, which we have catastrophically failed to meet. This will cost this country billions of euro in fines, not to mention the environmental disaster that will be visited on us. It is shameful. The contempt continues when the Minister with responsibility for climate change does not bother to come here to preside over the attempt to sabotage the contents of the Bill. It could not be worse. The contrast between what is supposed to be the embodiment of democracy in this country - the place people like Connolly and Pearse fought and died for - and the Government's devious attempts to sabotage this Bill and the energy, dynamism, commitment and concern for the future of our young people could not be sharper. God almighty, if it is left up to this Government, we are doomed. Thankfully, it is not left up to this Government. The future was out on the streets over the last few weeks. The Government should start to listen to those young people and show a little bit of respect for them. It is entirely in order to talk about the climate because the Government tabled an amendment that has nothing to do with the process, seeks to delete the motion dealing with the process concerning this Bill and includes only content relating to climate change and the Government's climate change policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a climate change policy that has failed and the Minister of State knows that. It is even acknowledged in the Government amendment. It is a policy that has failed. We are pathetically short of our targets and the Government is not willing to take the type of radical action that is necessary. The Government says it will not affect emissions. That is a nonsense. This is a global problem. It is not just about Ireland's little emissions, it is about stopping the poisoning of the global environment. For this to happen, 80% of the known reserves, never mind the unknown reserves that the Government wants to find, extract and hand over for profit to oil companies, have to be left in the ground. That is the scientific fact. This is what this Bill seeks to do. It is the absolute precondition to even starting to address the problem and then moving on to all the other things we need such as investment in public transport, afforestation, retrofit and developing renewable energy sources that do not wreck our environment. The Government shows no willingness or no interest in doing that. It has been dancing to the tune of the oil companies and big agribusiness but it will not succeed because the young people are on the march, the people are on the march, and that movement of people power to save our future will prevail in the end, of that I am absolutely certain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the point made by Deputy Bríd Smith, which I also made in my contribution, is the Government's amendment not out of order?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not in any way deal with the content of the motion, which the Ceann Comhairle also alluded to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, seriously-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on, you just said a minute ago-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that the motion deals with process. The Government's amendment does not deal with process. The Ceann Comhairle insisted that this had to be about process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's amendment has nothing to do with process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State can discuss whatever he likes while we are limited to discussing process. That is ridiculous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are also entitled to respond to the Government amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a parallel universe.
