RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. It would be a gross dereliction of its responsibility for the House to fail to discuss the nurses' strike this week. In the pelting rain this morning every nurse to whom I spoke expressed repeatedly his or her disbelief and fury at the failure of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to listen to the reasons nurses were striking and engage with them.I do not believe the House should compound the failure of the Government to engage with the nurses, listen to them and actually discuss the issues that have led them out on strike-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is why we need a debate. We need a full debate precisely because of what the nurses are saying that nobody is actually talking about the issues that have led them out on strike. If the Taoiseach wants to resolve it and the House wants to take its responsibility in trying to resolve it, it has to discuss the details of what is going on-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and end the spin and propaganda which the Taoiseach is using to evade his responsibility in the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I contacted the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think that is enough. It is not serious enough in the face of what is going on. The nurses do not want to be out. If the Taoiseach is serious about ending the dispute, we need to thrash out the issues fully.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is not engaging.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry; I am not trying to be disagreeable, but this issue is too serious. There is a need for a full Dáil debate on the issue-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fine as long as it is taken into account that it could be fitted in today at some stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Subject to what the Business Committee says.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should hire a nurse as an adviser.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach entered into Deputy Enda Kenny territory in Davos.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. We famously remember how the Army was going to be guarding the ATMs such was the severity of the economic crisis. The Taoiseach decided to emulate the rather bizarre comments of the former Taoiseach with the claims that we would have the Army deployed on the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This is despite the fact that the Taoiseach comes into the House and repeats the same answer week after week when we ask him whether he is considering erecting a border to protect the EU Single Market in the event of a no-deal scenario. The Taoiseach says "No" and claims it is not even being considered or dreamt of. Then, the Taoiseach goes on international television at the Davos gathering and says that he is thinking of sending the Army up to the Border. It is bizarre.Could the Taoiseach please explain that? Could he also explain the remarkable comment that we are "forever closing tax loopholes" when he was challenged about Ireland's tax haven status?  Can we just deal with facts instead of spin? According to the last available figures, €144 billion in pre-tax profits are declared in this country. By the time the taxable profit is calculated it is half that at approximately €70 billion. There are, therefore, approximately €70 billion worth of loopholes in the tax code. There are research and development tax credits, inter-group transactions, group losses, and losses brought forward. If one goes through the list, there are myriad tax loopholes, which allow the largest corporations in the world to write down their tax liability to almost nothing. Everyone else in the world knows this and is saying it, yet the Taoiseach continues to claim it is untrue. Precisely what tax loopholes has the Taoiseach closed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I indicated in the discussion before the motion was referred to the committee, there is something Orwellian about the Government's claim that involving ourselves in an arrangement with NATO does not impact in any way on our neutrality. The phrase "Partnership for Peace-NATO" is Orwellian, too. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a military alliance dominated by some of the most aggressive military and imperial powers in the world. As an organisation, it should not exist. One could have claimed a rationale for it during the Cold War, although I would not have. Both sides in the Cold War were aggressive imperial blocks competing for influence around the world, with devastating consequences in huge numbers of places, including South America, Vietnam, Africa and the Middle East. One can go through the list of the consequences of that geopolitical competition between NATO and the Soviet bloc. Whatever rationale there might have been for NATO before the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, there is no justification for it now. It should not exist, yet it does because the imperial ambitions of the major powers continue. They are the United States of America, Britain, France and so on. Europe is progressively aligning itself with these imperial ambitions and the expansionist and interventionist military machines. I note some recent examples of what NATO has done. The NATO chief has lauded the bombing in Syria and commented on how wonderful it was to bomb the hell out of it. The people concerned have complimented themselves on the NATO operation in Libya. It is incredible that they could compliment themselves on it. If ever there was a disaster, it was NATO's military intervention in Libya which virtually destroyed the country. We now have a situation where desperate people fleeing parts of North Africa are being herded like slaves, abused and exploited by militias operating in the mess NATO left behind in Libya. We are co-operating with them to prevent the people in question from crossing the Mediterranean as they flee in desperation to seek a better life here. This is the mess NATO created, yet the Minister of State wants us to align with it. The Government is going to drag Ireland into Europe's moves to align itself with that alliance, while claiming that doing so somehow does not infringe our neutrality. It is preposterous and ridiculous to even make that claim. It is equally ridiculous for the Minister of State to suggest that because the immunities and so on included in the status of forces agreement between NATO and Partnership for Peace will not operate here, our neutrality will not be infringed in that manner either. Give us a break. We have seen 2 million US soldiers pass through Shannon Airport to prosecute a war in Iraq which has completely destroyed that country. We have participated in it by allowing these troops to pass through Shannon Airport. The consequences for Iraq and the entire region have been a disaster, just as those of us who mobilised for the protest in 2003 warned. Our worst case estimates of what the war would cost Iraq were, in fact, dwarfed by its murderous reality. I remember writing an article in The Irish Times prior to the war in which I included estimates from some groups that up to 50,000 people would die in Iraq if the war went ahead.Credible estimates now put the death toll in Iraq as a result of the war at in excess of 1 million people. The greatest refugee crisis in the modern history of the world resulted from it, with approximately 4 million people displaced. Iraqi society was absolutely devastated and will probably never recover. Depleted uranium munitions are all over Iraq, poisoning and deforming children not even born and will do so for generations, munitions used by the very powers the Minister of State wants to align us with. The mess in Syria today would not have happened if it was not for that military intervention in Iraq. It is a direct consequence. The growth of ISIS and everything else is a direct consequence of the Iraq war, and the Minister of State wants us to align with these people and claims it does not infringe on our neutrality. It is dishonest nonsense. If the evidence of what NATO and the powers central to it have done, and I could give many more examples but I do not have time, is not enough in and of itself, what are the European promoters of European militarisation saying about their project? They are saying they are developing a European army. Merkel said it explicitly in the European Parliament in recent weeks. Macron says we are developing a European army. Tusk says we are developing a European army. Mogherini says we are developing a European army. Every major promoter of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, and what was inserted into the various treaties to institutionalise this evolving military structure has said it is about developing a European army, but the Minister of State comes in here and says it will have no impact on Irish neutrality and everything is fine. It is ridiculous. He knows it is ridiculous. Everybody knows it is ridiculous. Opinion polls have shown the population thinks it is ridiculous because they believed it was wrong for us to facilitate US troops in the Iraq war, and the majority believe these measures are infringing on our neutrality. The Minister of State resists properly defining neutrality because the fact it is not properly defined allows him to claim this ridiculous Orwellian suggestion that we are not eroding or destroying our neutrality. The Hague Convention's definition of neutrality when applied to what we did at Shannon would clearly put us outside any meaningful definition of neutrality because we allowed forces engaged in conducting a war, aggressive military action, to use our territory to do that, providing logistical support for it. That breaches neutrality. It is only because the Minister of State resists defining it that it is not clearly set out in the Constitution and law. Therefore he can make these ridiculous claims. It will not make any difference, and I know the Minister of State will get up and just repeat again and again that this will not impact on our neutrality and Fianna Fáil will do the same. Let us tell the truth. What is the dirty secret of all of this? We are afraid to say "boo" to the US. That is the truth. Everybody knows it is the truth. We would not dare suggest to the US it should remove its troops from Shannon or in any way question its right to act as a global policeman. That is the reality. At least it would be honest if the Minister of State just said this is the real reason we are shredding our neutrality. On the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, this is poignant. Among other things, the Irish revolution was against empires. That is what it was about. Fundamentally, it was against empires, but what the Minister of State is doing is progressively dragging us into the imperial project that is NATO and, frankly, it is quite shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will read a couple of excerpts from an article in The Guardian published in the last couple of days. Under the headline "Yemen: inquiry finds Saudis diverting arms to factions loyal to their cause" the article reads "An investigation into weapons being used in the war in Yemen has shown numerous examples of arms supplied by the UK and the US, among others, ending up in the hands of militias including those linked to al-Qaida and Isis." That says it all. The purpose of the EDA is to develop the European arms industry. We are involving ourselves in the EDA and PESCO, whose specific objective is to monitor closely that all states that are signed up to it are upgrading their military capabilities on a progressive basis.This means making more and more sophisticated weapons. The Minister of State called the major European states to which we are aligned like-minded states. Are we like-minded with states that sell weapons to the Saudi dictatorship? They sell weapons to a regime that denies all human rights and any right of political dissent, locks up women activists who are fighting for rights for women and anyone who dissents against the autocratic Saudi royal family, and shifts weapons on to ISIS and al-Qaeda in a murderous war in Yemen which has claimed tens of thousands of lives and has put almost 11 million people on the brink of famine. That is the connection. That is what Europe and major European powers are doing. The Minister of State calls them like-minded and says that he wants us to develop closer military co-operation with them and to assist them in upgrading, developing and enhancing the European arms industry. That is where the weapons come from. The reason I am in politics is that I was in a refugee camp in Palestine in 1987 when the intifada had just started. I was not even involved in politics. A family, two of whose members had been dragged off to jail by the Israelis just because they participated in a protest, showed me tear gas canisters and other leftovers from weapons that were deployed by the Israeli defence forces which were made in the USA. That is where the weapons come from. They come from America, France and Britain and now we want to align ourselves with this machine of making money from producing the means to kill people. These like-minded states sell weapons to the most vile, vicious regimes and innocent people die as a result. Why on earth would we want to be part of that? I beg the Minister of State not to tell me it is about protecting our soldiers. I got a communication from people who were part of the Irish Defence Forces. A commanding officer in the siege of Jadotville had recommended that a number of the very brave Irish troops who were involved in that siege receive military awards but for some reason they have never got them. If I have not submitted a parliamentary question on the matter I will do so. We do not even show respect for these people. They have made films about the famous siege of Jadotville and the film industry shows some respect for them. They are recommended for military honours and they do not get them. We have soldiers protesting because their families are dependent on family income supplement, so miserable are their wages. We are buying military assets for the navy but we do not have enough personnel to man the ships because we pay them so pitifully. If the Minister of State really cared about the soldiers, he might give them the medals they deserve and he might pay them properly and treat them with respect so they and their families do not have to come protesting outside the Dáil because of the poverty they are suffering. That would show some real commitment and respect. The Minister of State must not tell me this in any way justifies getting involved with the European Defence Agency, whose sole purpose is to develop an industry of death and to sell weapons to vile and vicious regimes like the Saudi regime and many others.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are selling arms to al-Qaeda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record, it is not my birthday tomorrow. It says that it is on Wikipedia, and it slightly worries me that the Minister has been on my Wikipedia page.
