RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The United Nations conference at Rio de Janeiro, among other things, developed a set of principles known as the forest principles, which relate to how important forestry is in combating climate change and biodiversity destruction. The Taoiseach and others attended the UN-convened COP26 and the Taoiseach was at an environmental session in New York where he discussed the issue of climate. Forestry is key in this, as has been said on a number of occasions. Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the public forestry company, Coillte, selling 39 acres of forestry in a public amenity area in Enniskerry, which features Bronze Age stone pits, a right of way for the Dublin Mountains Way, important geological landscapes and so on. The Taoiseach, quite insultingly, tried to cast aspersions on the veracity of what I said but then said he would look into the matter. What I showed the Taoiseach was an advertisement from an estate agent's website, advertising the sale of this land for €250,000, an extraordinary price. The public forestry body was selling off a public amenity forest in the context of COP26, protecting biodiversity, the forest principles of the United Nations and so on. It subsequently confirmed to me in a letter that the sale was going ahead. I went up to the forest where I saw "For Sale" signs all over the place. I am glad to say that I got a call from Coillte this morning stating that it had decided, although the sale was at an advanced stage, to abandon it. That is a victory. It also subsequently suggested that it was not really going to sell this forestry, even though there were "For Sale" signs everywhere and, as of this morning, it was advertised on the website of an estate agent. Why did members of the public or the Opposition have to point the Government to the fact that the State forestry company was selling off a public amenity forest? Why was there no proper oversight?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach looked into the matter? Does he believe there needs to be a role for greater oversight of the sale of public forest land by the State forestry company?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	During the past decade, corporate profits here have gone through the roof. I estimate there has been an increase of approximately 127% in corporate profits. Last year, net household wealth increased by €89 billion to a record €883 billion and more than 50% of that is in the hands of the richest 10% of the population. In the interests of justice, fairness and equity and to provide funds for public services and infrastructure, is it not time to introduce wealth taxes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has just confirmed correctly, although he said it has reduced slightly, that the richest 10% of our population owns more than 50% of all the wealth in a study to which he referred. People need to understand how much that is. Net household wealth, according to the Central Bank report, is €883 billion. That means the richest 10% have €440 billion in personal wealth. The Minister said that is tied up in the family home. Our wealth tax proposal explicitly excludes the family home. There are 160,000 people in that top 10%. Let us allow them €1 million each to cover the family home and that is being very generous. That would be €160 billion of the €440 billion. Why not tax the rest even by 2% in order to redistribute some of the wealth to the bottom 50% who have less than 2% of the wealth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not in favour of taxing the family home in our wealth tax proposal. We are very explicit. We are in favour of taxing the wealth in excess of €1 million in the hands of a small group of people. I will put it another way to the Minister. We have approximately 2 million workers, and the Minister can confirm the numbers. Last year, between them they earned €130 billion but they paid €27 billion in tax. The corporations earned €203 billion in pre-tax profits and paid €11 billion in tax. In other words, the corporations made twice as much as 2 million workers in profit or income, whatever way the Minister would want to put it, but paid half as much tax. Where is the justice in that? The wealthiest group saw their wealth very significantly increase by approximately €50 billion last year. Should they not pay a bit more tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Growing public outrage and international pressure has finally forced some moves towards having a minimum effective corporate tax rate to deal with the phenomenon of aggressive tax avoidance by some of the wealthiest corporations in the world. Although the Government resisted quite hotly, it has now agreed to an effective rate of 15%. Will it actually be an effective rate, because the 12.5% was not effective, and these companies utilise loopholes in the tax code to avoid paying their fair share of tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Revenue figures to which the Minister refers, which I have in front of me, do not say what he just said. What they say for 2019 is that there was €195 billion worth of pre-tax profits, before deductions and allowances, and that €10 billion was paid on that. That is not 10% or anything like it, it is 5.6%. The reason the Minister can claim that it is 10% is because about €84 billion of their pre-tax profits are not taxed at all because they benefit from deductions, allowances and reliefs. It is in that area that these companies have exploited loopholes in the tax code to write down their taxable profits, so they end up paying tax on only about half of their actual profits, mostly through intergroup transactions, paying themselves royalties and paying for the use of patents from their own company, which is a scam. How are we actually going to make them pay the effective rate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to pre-empt what will probably be the Minister's final comment by saying we value the jobs these companies bring to this country. They do create employment and we want those jobs here. That does not mean they cannot pay their fair share of tax. Revenue figures show the major reliefs and allowances they benefit from are intragroup transactions worth €16 billion in 2019 as a cost to the Exchequer. They are from amalgamations, losses brought forward and other reliefs like that, not research and development. I refer to the big ones. That is why they are paying themselves money, which is profit, but writing it off as a cost. It would be like me saying my ma came up with a brilliant idea and I have to pay her for that brilliant idea and then I claim that as a deduction off my income tax. Revenue would laugh me out of the room, but that is what these corporations are doing. They are writing their own tax bill. The Minister knows it, and the OECD knows it. That is why there is a reform process. What are we going to do to make sure they pay an effective rate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what is recognised by the Minister.
