RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government, at the behest of the European Union and International Monetary Fund, is pursuing the economics of the madhouse.  It is bad enough that tens of billions of euro are being poured into the vaults of banks and pockets of bondholders but the price being paid for this policy is mass unemployment and extreme suffering among some of the most vulnerable sectors of society.  It is not, however, only the moral injustice of this approach for which society is paying the price because, critically, we are robbing ourselves of the means to deal with the unemployment crisis and put the economy back on a sound footing which would allow us to recover and develop a sustainable economic future.  Nowhere is this issue more sharply focused than in the question of capital investment.  The State needs to play a key role in investing in our future and prioritising capital investment if we are to have any chance of getting out of what increasingly appears will be a 1930s style economic meltdown in Europe.The policy of recapitalising private banks with a view to producing a flow of credit to small and medium enterprises, about which the Government argues it is seriously concerned, has been a catastrophic failure.  It has utterly failed either to produce a flow of credit to the SME sector or provide relief for mortgage holders whose circumstances are massively depressing demand in the economy.  If all of this were not bad enough, the one other possible avenue for moving matters forward and getting us out of the current mess, namely, State investment in key, strategic projects both in infrastructure and other areas where we could generate real wealth and employment, has been closed off.  State investment is even more important in light of the fact that the other key feature of the recession across Europe and specifically in this country has been the decision of the big players in the private sector effectively to go on strike and refuse to invest.  Given the collapse in private sector investment, who will make the investment that will get people back to work?  Only the State can fulfil this role but instead it is cutting capital investment at the behest of the EU and IMF.  There is no way forward if the Government persists with this approach.   I find it somewhat laughable that the Minister speaks about the improvements in our infrastructure in recent years.  Money has been spent on infrastructure and there may have been some improvements, but he only has to look at the floods last week and the devastating impact they have had on many parts of the city to realise how bad our water infrastructure is and how criminal it was that we did not invest in rehabilitating that water and drainage infrastructure.  That will cost not only the victims of those floods, but society in general, if we do not invest in that.  I suggest the Minister reads Ulysses, because James Joyce complained a hundred years ago about the failure of the Office of Public Works to invest in the water infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nothing has changed and these cuts will make it worse.Education is key if we are to have any chance.  The construction of a new DIT campus in Grangegorman has been scrapped when we should be investing in that area.  In my own constituency, the IADT in Dún Laoghaire is 1,000 students over capacity because it was expecting new buildings, but the construction of these new buildings has now been shelved.  This is disastrous.  We have 96,000 people on the housing list, and the Government's policy is to stop building social housing and lease properties from private landlords instead.  This will be more costly for the State and will cripple the possibilities of economic growth, development and recovery if the Government persists in going ahead with these cuts in capital expenditure.  We need to increase investment in capital expenditure and that means telling the troika to get lost and to stuff their monetarist mantras.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very nicely put, Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be as concise as possible.  I have a macro question and a micro question.  I will not waste time on the debate we have held many times here except to ask the Minister about the larger macro picture.  Notwithstanding previous differences we have had in debates on this issue, is there not some recognition on the part of the Government and euro leaders that in the wake of the significant downgrading of growth prospects in Europe we should start to raise our voices against the merits and sustainability of the austerity policy?  Should we not be shouting from the rooftops that it is not working?  It has been tried and it is not working.  In fact, it is robbing us of the investment funds we need to get things moving again.  I will not labour the point but it seems the evidence is piling up in that area.The Minister asked where we could we get the money.  Let us set aside the larger European questions of bondholders and so on.  Does the Minister not agree that the collapse in private sector investment means that we should get hold of the capital available in society which is not being invested?  To answer the Minister's question, does this not mean we should tax the small minority that have the capital and wealth but who are not investing it and who, frankly, in many cases got this wealth through questionable means?  This vast wealth which has been built up in this country is distributed among the top 5%.  Why will the Minister not consider wealth taxes to get from that small minority the investment funds that we could then put into developing infrastructure and strategic industry, instead of cutting the strategic investment area, a policy which will be so damaging for out economic future?My last question relates to a parochial issue but it is symptomatic and it relates to what Deputy Daly said as well.  The question is not simply parochial and it seems to me the Minister should examine this issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a question.  In some cases we are going ahead with capital projects that people do not want and the justification for which is questionable while in other areas there are projects that people want and the value of which is not disputed by most people but which are not proceeding.  The waste treatment plant in north Dublin is one example.  The local authority in my area is proposing to spend €35 million on a new administrative headquarters for the library which no one asked for and no one sought.  Yet there are empty buildings in public ownership which could be used for the same purpose but the local authority will not give one third of that money to develop the tourist infrastructure on the seafront, such as Dún Laoghaire baths, which people have been crying out for and which could attract tourists to the area or to the Carlisle Pier.  Will the Minister examine seriously such matters because it is a waste of money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should talk to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that we effectively own Allied Irish Bank and that it is supposed to be releasing money into the economy, why does the State not insist that the bank lend it money at a reasonable rate in order to invest in capital projects?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are our banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There can be no question about supporting this Bill.  I understand it is technical legislation, the purpose of which is to raise the ceiling for the amount the Irish Film Board is allowed to spend in its lifetime from €200 million to €300 million because it has almost reached that ceiling.  All of us should support this straightforward measure as it will allow the board to continue to function.No one could disagree with the Minister's comments on the value and importance of the film industry and the need to promote and develop it.  While I am not one for blowing national trumpets because all countries have talent and ability, as many speakers noted, Ireland appears to have produced a disproportionate amount of literary talent which has fed into the creative sphere generally and film in particular.  One could say the same about theatre.  We have produced an impressive array of writers, directors and actors and should be proud of this tradition which we should nurture, develop, expand and invest in irrespective of the economic circumstances.  Producing films and art is an end in itself.  It does not require economic justification because film and art are good things in themselves.  They raise us above the drudgery of daily work, toil and so forth and make life and existence worthwhile.  This is what culture is about and there should be no question that we should invest, develop and expand film and art.  In so far as the Minister has indicated a desire to do this, he is right and I could not but agree with him.In the current economic circumstances, it would be foolish not to recognise the economic advantage of developing this area in which we have resources, ability, talent and a reputation.  We can and should expand this sector because it has considerable potential to generate employment and, as a number of speakers noted, visitors to the country.  In this regard, I will make a passing comment which relates to my earlier point that film and the arts are an end in themselves.  We should be a little careful about turning film or art generally into a commodity or means of selling brand Ireland.  This is not what motivates our artists, writers and actors.  If this type of logic were to drift into the thinking or policy behind Government Departments' approach, it would do an injustice to film and art.  Art is not about selling or creating a brand or promoting an international reputation.  Handled sensitively and with respect and properly supported and nurtured, however, it will produce economic spin-offs in terms of employment, enhancing the country's reputation globally and attracting people to visit the country because they like what they see in representations of Ireland in film or when they see its artists, writers and actors represented in this arena.  All of these things are to be welcomed, as are all the statements that have been made in the House.While it is one thing to propose raising the expenditure limit for the Irish Film Board on technical grounds, it is another thing for the money to be invested in the sector and that is where the problem lies.  We have a large coterie of artists, film-makers, technicians and designers who are at the highest level globally and can stand toe to toe with the best in the world in all the different aspects and areas of film, whether creative or technical or in areas such as production.  We also have great landscapes and so forth and the tax incentive schemes have delivered some investment in film and an expansion in film making which has generated jobs and revenue.  Notwithstanding these factors, we continue to under-invest in this area despite its considerable potential and talent.  A large number of the approximately 6,000 people who are directly employed in the film industry and the many others who participate in the making of films are working for a pittance.The budget for the Irish Film Board this year, which stands at €16 million, has been cut significantly, although the reduction has not been as bad as some of the other austerity measures imposed elsewhere.  Nonetheless, the allocation is significantly lower than it was in 2008, for example.  Regardless of whether the Irish Film Board's budget is €16 million or €20 million, we must put it in perspective if we are to understand how little we are investing in this area, which all of us agree is important.  This year's allocation is about half the budget of one major Hollywood movie.  If we all agree that the Irish film sector has potential and talent and jobs can be created in it, clearly an allocation of €16 million is paltry.  Thousands more jobs could be created in the industry.The Bill's digest notes that while Irish films win awards, they do not do well at the box office.  Part of the reason is that we do not invest in a distribution infrastructure and must rely on American distributors and other global players.  We are at the bottom of the queue because the money and resources being invested to develop the domestic industry are insufficient.  We are completely reliant on foreign cinema capital and the infrastructure of the US and other film industries.  As a result, we are not sufficiently developing or promoting our movies, talent and ability.  This vast untapped potential can only be realised if the State substantially increases its direct investment in film.  To do so would create a win-win scenario from a cultural, economic and employment perspective.I ask the Minister to comment on an issue that has been raised with me by a number of people in recent days.  The individuals who contacted me pointed out that some of our tax incentive schemes amount to tax scams for certain wealthy elements in society as they are essentially a risk free investment on which wealthy people avoid tax.    It was also suggested to me that Anglo Irish Bank was up to its neck in lending to companies in this area but is not chasing them up for the moneys owed to the bank, and these same companies are not paying what they owe to technicians and the people who actually make the movies.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on putting forward this motion.  This could not be a bigger issue.  One quarter of the population are affected at some time by mental health issues.  We have all been touched by it.  I have been touched by the impact of it as have people close to me.  Let us consider the link, although not inevitable, to depression and alcohol-related abuse, both of which have been seriously on the rise in recent years.  It is important that we address this because it has been a significant problem and, as Deputy Daly has suggested, it has been growing for the past 20 or 30 years but it has dramatically worsened in the past few years.Without getting into a complex analysis of these difficult issues. it is clear that there is some causal link between unemployment, economic dislocation, poverty and mental health issues.  In addition there has been a rise in the levels of suicide, alcohol abuse, other drug abuse and so on.  While I have no wish to rehearse the economic debates we have in here every day of the week, this matter cannot be dealt with seriously and no commitment to deal with this issue can be taken seriously unless we address such issues as unemployment urgently.  If there are 300,000 or 400,000 people in the country with no hope of work then this problem will get worse.  The levels of depression will rise, the rates of suicide will increase, drug and alcohol abuse will get worse and all the costs of all of these problems will get worse as well.Although we have these problems, we know they can be helped by the provision of mental health services.  However, this State is failing to make a priority of the provision of these services.  We all acknowledge we should do so but in reality we are not doing it.  Some 5% of the health budget in the State goes on mental health services as against a budget of 12% in Northern Ireland and an average of 8% throughout Europe.A Vision for Change was not a bad document.  Nor was it a brilliant document or the last word on this issue but even this document has not been implemented.  Some 60% of child psychiatry teams continue to await the funds and the staffing they need.  Child mental health protection is of particular importance since it is preventative and it will prevent greater costs and more damage in the long term.  School counselling services are practically non-existent and school principals regularly tell parents that there is a quota of only two children per year per school to be seen by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  Up to three quarters of all mental health problems begin between the ages of 12 and 25 years.  However, the roll-out of Jigsaw walk-in centres for adolescents and young adults is painfully slow with only five centres open at present.  There are no functioning child psychiatry teams for children with severe intellectual disabilities, as promised by the A Vision for Change document.I put it to the Minister that under any universal health insurance, mental health will not be prioritised because it is not a profit-making area.  This is the case in such places as the United States.  Mental health treatment is manpower-heavy and, therefore, a recruitment embargo disproportionately hits the delivery of mental health services because of its reliance on manpower.  The cuts in staffing levels will force more people into dependence on drugs which, as Deputy Daly correctly stated, represents a concerning way to deal with the problem.  To deal with the problem effectively, we need more psycho-social interventions, social workers, occupational therapists, psychotherapists and so on.  I appeal to the Government to take this issue seriously.  The Government acknowledges that we must deal with the issue.  I emphasise my disbelief at the fact that the Government has amended the motion.  Given all that those in Government have said, I do not understand why they are playing politics with this motion when there is nothing controversial in it and many speakers on the Government side have endorsed it.
