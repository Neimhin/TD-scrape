RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put my questions to Mr. Dukes as someone who was a politician, who was acting as a public interest representative and was put into the banking system because he had been a public representative.  I assume he was chosen to examine it and oversee policy because he was not from the banking system.I accept Mr. Dukes is working within the parameters set down by the Government and the European authorities standing behind it to deal with this.  I am not in a position to question how well or badly he is doing the job.  I take at face value what he said, namely that he is just working within those parameters and doing the best he can to wind down the bank and recover what he can from the situation.However, he is a former politician and was put in the position as a public representative.  Following on from the comments of Deputy Broughan, that puts him in a slightly different position to the other bankers we have talked to.  There is public desire for an analysis from the perspective of the public, in the public interest, of what happened and how it happened in order that it might not happen again.  That is what people want.  I will ask some technical questions shortly.Mr. Dukes said all the banks broke all the prudential rules in terms of lending.  Anglo Irish Bank was leading the charge in the Irish banking sector in that regard.  A major question is why they all did it.  In his comments on accounting and auditing firms, Mr. Dukes said earlier that we should not throw doubt over all of them and their capacity to do the job.  If we do not ask a blanket question of them, the banks and the people who run them, one wonders what one is left with in terms of an analysis of why this happened, who was responsible and how we prevent it from happening again.In Mr. Dukes's opinion, having examined the bank, is it just about individuals and bringing criminal proceedings against those who behaved greedily or in a negligent way, or both?  A very unhealthy relationship seemed to exist between Anglo Irish Bank, the Regulator and, one might argue, the political system.  Was it greed, stupidity or a combination of both that led to the problem?If everybody was doing it and Anglo Irish Bank was leading the charge - the Nyberg report refers to the "herd mentality" - it raises fundamental questions about how banks, politicians and regulators all went along with the herd.  We still do not have an explanation as to how the herd mentality among highly paid bankers, politicians, regulators and so on developed.  They brought the country careering towards a cliff and nobody spotted it.  The people want some answers about that.Some individuals have to be taken to task but there is something bigger at stake.  Can Mr. Dukes provide a viewpoint on that?  It relates to a comment he made in passing about the fact the European Commission seems to think the banking sector should be treated as if normal rules of competition still apply when states are intervening all over the place to prop up the system.  We are paying the price for that.  It is very worrying.Mr. Dukes may say I am taking an ideological position but the question has to be asked.  One explanation for the herd mentality is competition.  The Bank of Ireland and AIB mimicked Anglo Irish Bank because they felt they had to compete.  That was the way it worked.  Mr. Dukes told us European authorities are still saying that is how the banking system should operate, even though states have had to intervene in it.We have to ask fundamental questions about how an ideology led to this mess.  It may have encouraged or facilitated individual greed, but it was an ideology that said it is okay to deal with the surplus wealth of society which the banks hold through competition, speculation for profit and all the rest.  That is what led to the mess and it is what we have to begin to question.I have not formulated my point very clearly but it seems to me there is no clear analysis of the bigger picture of how this happened.  The reason I raised this issue is now the same herd, comprising many of the same people who were in situ, has moved from promoting speculation in property to austerity as the way to deal with the current situation.  One was told to commit suicide if one questioned the way the economy was moving and now if one questions the austerity consensus the herd is pursuing one is considered to be equally off the wall.The herd took us one way which led to disaster and is now moving in the opposite direction.  Some people, most notably the UN committee on trade and development, are now saying the herd is moving in another disastrous direction in terms of austerity which will have detrimental effects for the possibility of economic growth and recovery.  As he has looked inside the bank, I ask Mr. Dukes to comment on the reasons why it did what it did, how it became caught up in the nexus of banking and how it moved in that direction.Does Mr. Dukes think criminal proceedings should be taken against people who were in key positions in Anglo Irish Bank at the time of the crash?  The people of this country would like to see individuals held to account if they engaged in criminal activities or negligence because we are picking up the tab for it.There are slightly more technical questions about the cost to the public of the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank, in terms of the figure of €30 billion and the bondholders.  I would like to hear the opinion of Mr. Dukes.  He said the decision whether to burn bondholders is one for Government and is not within his remit.  That is the deal to which we have signed up with the troika to continue to fund the State.  As a public interest representative, what does he think about that?Does Mr. Dukes consider, as a public interest representative, it is a sensible demand by the EU-IMF that we should continue to repay the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank?  It seems to me Anglo Irish Bank is now just a machine to pay back the people who speculated in the Irish property market.  Does Mr. Dukes consider that this is what we should be doing?  I ask him to clarify how much money has, so far, gone into the bank and how much more money has to be put into it?  This information will give the committee a sense of how foolish or otherwise it is to continue to prop up Anglo Irish Bank.  How much will be put in over the period of the winding down of the bank?I have asked this question of the other bankers.  As a former public representative now working in a bank, does Mr. Dukes regard as appropriate - and after everything that has happened - that bankers should be in receipt of €500,000 a year?  I refer to the chief executive officers of Anglo Irish Bank or any other bank which has been involved in the activities which have led this country to the current sorry pass.  Should these bankers be paid 12 or 13 times the average industrial wage?  I do not see the case for it, given the disaster of the banking system.  It is difficult to see that anybody has any credibility in terms of the financial chaos that is gripping Europe and the entire global banking system.  I do not buy the argument that we need to pay people €500,000 a year to get their expertise because there is no expertise on display that I can see, considering what has happened.  As a former public representative I ask Mr. Dukes to explain to me how - I will not say a child could probably have done better because that would be a naive and simplistic view - having been a politician who is now in the banking system whether he really thinks we need to pay these excessive salaries for what we are getting or could people who are paid a lot less do just as good a job?  From the point of view of ordinary members of the public, these people seem to be doing a pretty bad job.
