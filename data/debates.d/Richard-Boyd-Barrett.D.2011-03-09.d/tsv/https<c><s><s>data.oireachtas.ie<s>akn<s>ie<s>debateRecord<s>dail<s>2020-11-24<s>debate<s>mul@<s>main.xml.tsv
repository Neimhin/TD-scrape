RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Irrespective of the criticisms we may sometimes have of RTÉ, public service broadcasting and having a national broadcaster are important because the alternative is the big, private, for-profit IT companies and the big digital online purveyors of movies, such as Amazon and Netflix, which are making an absolute fortune. If we are to safeguard the future of public service broadcasting and the media, we should, rather than imposing broadcasting charges on ordinary people who are already paying through the nose for Sky, Netflix and God knows what and then imposing another charge on them, impose a digital tax on the profits of the companies. It is outrageous that important national matches, certain GAA matches and so on can be viewed only on some of the private, pay-per-view platforms. It should not be allowed. Similarly, we also need to ensure the public service broadcasters give more time to domestic musical and cultural output. Indeed, a set percentage of their output should be committed to this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems to me that the parliamentary liaison unit remit is to do everything to shut down the voices of questioning from the Opposition. There has essentially been a systematic drive by the Government to do that. The latest example of this is the refusal to allow the Minister for Justice to come to the House to address questions. We also saw this with the change in speaking arrangements. I have raised this several times but I am really aggrieved tonight. We have an important debate on Covid-19 strategy. Our party will have six and a half minutes. The Government will have 75 minutes. We will hear speaker after speaker backing up the Government line. Yet, we have six and a half minutes to put forward our thoughts and suggestions. To be honest, these suggestions might actually help the Government in the current situation.They might provide some important feedback to help it come to a reasonable perspective and strategy. However, we get six and a half minutes. It is a joke. The Government did that deliberately to shut the Opposition down and to push certain parts of the Opposition so far down the speaking order that their voices will not be heard. In the end, the Government's undoing will be these cynical parliamentary games it is playing to shut down the Opposition. They will always surface. The mistakes will come back to haunt the Taoiseach. I urge him to stop playing games of shutting down the Opposition and to allow for open debate in this Chamber.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has gone too far in the other direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The landslide in Donegal resulting from the construction of a wind farm was a shocking reminder of the Government's failure to take seriously what happens when the development of renewable energy is in the hands of private developers who only care about profit and do not give a hoot about the environment. It was not the first time we had seen that type of environmental damage resulting from the failure to conduct proper environmental impact assessments on such projects. This year, we were forced to pay €5 million in fines, with €15,000 per day in further penalties, as a result of the Derrybrien landslide in 2003 and the subsequent ruling of the European Court of Justice that the developers, namely, the ESB, which had built a wind farm on a mountain after cutting down the trees that held the mountain together, had ignored this basic knowledge about the role of forestation in holding mountains and soil together, thereby causing a massive landslide. We are paying €15,000 per day in penalties and have still not rectified the matter, and the same situation has occurred in Donegal. This is what happens when something as important as dealing with climate change and the development of renewable energy is put in the hands of private developers or people who are driven by profit. What will the Government do about this? Where are the directly employed ecologists, foresters and all the other people who will do the environmental impact assessment work for the State to ensure that this sort of disastrous situation does not recur?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those who are trying to underestimate the threat of Covid-19, as Deputy Eoghan Murphy just did, need to explain why there are hospitals in this city turning patients away because they have had Covid outbreaks, irrespective of whether the patients are Covid patients or non-Covid patients. That is with infection rates at a relatively low level. If the rates rise, our hospitals will be overrun, and people who make irresponsible comments will have a lot to answer for. In the insulting amount of time given to discuss the most important issue affecting this country, I am going to make just one point to the Minister. If he wants a Covid strategy that works, he should treat with respect, dignity and support the health workers who are on the front line fighting Covid-19. He is singularly failing to do that. I will not go through in detail the long list of comments made to me, including those of the contact tracers and testers who do not get sick pay and who are on temporary contracts and the nursing staff who have had their pay cut in recent years because of the FEMPI legislation and who have been affected by under-staffing and under-resourcing; I will just speak up for one particular group, the student nurses and midwives. Thousands of them have been working on the front line. The Minister was forced in March and April to accept they were working and should, therefore, be paid and then pulled the rug under that payment leaving them working for nothing again on the front line. I held an online meeting last night with student nurses and midwives. I will allude to some of the comments they made in the short time I have available. They were furious with the Minister over the €50 allowance for accommodation, which most or many of them do not get, and the miserable little travel allowance. They just laughed at the idea that the Minister is protecting their education. One individual said the student nurses are left to their own devices to do front-line work. Another said nurses are doing 12 and 13-hour shifts with no nurse beside them. Yet another said nurses are working in a red zone with Covid patients, covering for staff shortages and people who are sick. I was told student nurses are worried about their family members with underlying conditions. I was also told student nurses had to give up their jobs to do their placements and that this would not be tolerated if they were mostly men. They ask how it is that paramedics, gardaí, those who do military training and apprentices get paid while they are training and student nurses do not although they are actually working on the front line in hospitals. I was told the €50 allowance would not even cover the cost of accommodation and that it would barely cover the cost of a cardboard box. I was also told student nurses and midwives need to pay for parking and that the parking charges for one week are more than they get. Some are paying fees of €3,000 and not getting paid, and mature students are paying €7,000 and not getting paid. The individuals I spoke to say student nurses and midwives fear speaking out and were warned not to speak to the media. I discovered mental health nurses are talking about the fact that their mental health is absolutely in bits because of the situation they are facing. I learned that student nurses are doing multiple academic assignments while filling in for sick staff and understaffed hospitals. They ask how they are even supposed to live or do their shopping. That is how the Minister is treating them. He should pay the student nurses, end the exploitation and treat healthcare workers with respect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Minister talking about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who wants an unrealistic proposal? That is nonsense talk, and the reference to ideology is nonsense talk. The Minister has his ideology and the ideology of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party has dominated housing policy forever. The result is that sites in public ownership, which should long since have had public housing built on them, have sat empty because over those years they insisted, in one shape or another, on involving private capital and that delayed everything. I have a proposal for the lands at Oscar Traynor Road. Build public housing on the land now and lift the income thresholds so that people from different income backgrounds can get on the list to get housing. Why do we not try that? We do not try it because the Minister's ideology does not want it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What we have been doing is not realistic. It has not delivered, so that is not real. The lists are long and we should look at the cost. With HAP or RAS, in my area the rent is €2,000 a month to a private landlord. That is €580,000 over 25 years for social housing and the State does not even own it. If the State does a leasing deal of €28,000 per annum, that is €600,000 over 25 years and it does not own anything at the end of it. If the State purchases a turnkey property, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that it will cost €80,000 more than the local authority building it itself. Why do we not just get local authorities to build properties themselves? It is cheaper, we will own the properties at the end and it can be done more quickly because one does not have to involve all sorts of other players and thereby complicate and delay matters, as has happened. We either do not get it or it costs us a fortune and we own nothing at the end. Why do we not just build it ourselves?
