RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems as if we are paying lip-service to the idea of equal treatment for agency workers but trying to exclude certain allowances and certain payments.I accept fully the Ceann Comhairle's decision to rule amendment No. 18 out of order, but it is for the same reason that we, as Deputy Clare Daly indicated, had to refer specifically to the private sector because if we sought equality for all temporary agency employees, that would also be considered to be a charge on the Exchequer and would have been similarly ruled out of order because of the Minister's failure to deal with that issue of equality.It seems to amount to the Government wanting the right to have a second tier of workers which it can exploit and not give the same rights and allowances to as ones that would be directly employed.  There can be no other explanation for the Minister's refusal to deal with the issue of extending full equality to temporary agency workers in terms of all the rights, allowances and provisions that would be made for comparators who are directly employed.I suppose that merely indicates that the point of agency workers is to undermine the pay and conditions of directly employed workers.  It seems, in refusing to give equality in these area, the Minister is going along with that even while paying lip-service to the idea of giving equal rights to agency workers.  It is disappointing that the Minister is doing that.I strongly ask him to reconsider, although I doubt at this stage he will do so.  It is simply not right or fair that agency workers should be given lesser rights when it comes to matters such as sick pay, pension entitlements and other arrangements that directly employed people have.Similarly, although it is ruled out of order, the issue of persons who are permanently employed by the agencies being allowed to be paid as much as 50% less than those employed directly is outrageous and is a recipe to undermine the purpose of this legislation which is to give equality to agency workers.  It is very disappointing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled amendment No.18 out of order.  While we cannot move it, it is important that we record our deep concerns, shared by trade unions, about this section of the Bill.  We referred briefly to it earlier, but the provision which allows agencies to employ people on a permanent contract and only pay them 50% of what they were paid on their last assignment means that they can permanently have a group of employees for whom the central thrust of the Bill simply does not apply.  In that context, it completely undermines the Bill.  If I represented an employment agency, I would see this as a way around almost all the provisions of the Bill.The Minister has said agencies employing workers on a permanent basis is not a widespread phenomenon in Ireland.  However, what is to stop them from doing so now?  The Bill improves things for agency workers to a degree, although not as far we would like.  I accept that the Minister has taken on board some of the points made on Committee Stage, but this opt-out of the central provision of the Bill essentially allows agencies a way around equality and all the provisions of the Bill.  They can establish a permanent group of employees who will be paid less, no matter for whom they are working and to whom the provisions of the Bill simply will not apply.  It is not, as the Minister seems to be suggesting, just when they are not working.  The point is that the central equality provision of the Bill does not apply to them if they are employed permanently by the agency.  The only requirement is that they must, during the periods they are not working, receive 50% of what they received on their last assignment.  What they received on their last assignment might have been substantially lower than what a directly employed worker was paid for doing the same job.This is a recipe for a coterie of workers to work alongside others paid twice what they are paid, or God knows what.  It is a complete opt-out clause in respect of the equality provision included in the Bill.  If we do not grasp this, the agencies will.  We will have a new mechanism that will allow them to circumvent the Bill and create a second-tier workforce.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not quite sure the Minister grasps the point we are making and the concern we are expressing about a fundamental loophole in the entire thrust of the Bill.  I will spell it out to him.  Section 7(1) enunciates what I understand to be the absolute central kernel of the Bill, which is that the basic working and employment conditions to which an agency worker is entitled shall be the same as the basic working and employment conditions to which a comparable employee is entitled.  However, this shall not apply in so far as it relates to pay applied to an agency worker employed by an employment agency under a permanent contract of employment.  It is simple.  One has equality as an agency worker but not if one is employed permanently by the agency.  It is as simple as that.This is a way around the legislation.  It is a gaping hole in it.  If I were an agency I would see a very simple way to get around the legislation.  I would employ many people permanently, I would decide their pay and conditions and the equality demands of the legislation would not apply.  There will be nothing to stop an agency permanently employing nurses and paying them two thirds or half of what nurses normally earn because as permanent employees, the provisions of the legislation will not apply.  When these nurses work in a public or private hospital, they can be paid half of what nurses employed in the hospital are paid.The only requirement is that when the employees are not on assignment, they are paid at least 50% of what they were paid on their previous assignment.  What they got paid in the previous assignment could be virtually nothing or considerably less than what a comparable employee directly employed would receive.  The point is that this is a gaping hole in the legislation which fundamentally subverts the point of it.  It is an incentive to agencies to circumvent the demand for equality.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see why the Minister objects to the amendment.  It seeks to establish a legal bottom line regarding compliance and enforcement in order that there will be no ambiguity.  The agency and the hirer would be jointly and severally responsible for breaches of the legislation and it would be clear that this was the case.  This would not preclude workers from going to the rights commissioner and so on.  We want a legal bottom line written into the legislation whereby agencies and hiring employers will be held responsible if they breach the Bill.  That is what the amendment seeks and I do not see why the Minister objects to it.  He should consider it a sensible and reasonable addition to the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State not concerned that three of the most prominent economists in the country, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, roundly refuted what he is saying about the promissory notes?  They said they did not see us getting back to the financial markets, that the State would need re-financing in 2014, that they did not believe there is any chance of our being in a position to get money on the international markets and that, therefore, we would be in second bail-out territory.  They also stated that if this happens the austerity now being imposed will pale into insignificance and will reach Greek proportions.  What does the Minister of State have to say in response to those economists who say something must be done about the â‚¬3.1 billion payments due every year on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is time the Government admitted the reality of what is happening in the health service and dispensed with the ridiculous and meaningless slogan of "getting more for less".  The evidence everywhere is that as a result of the vicious cuts the Government is imposing on the health service, we are getting considerably less for less.  Sick and vulnerable people, including children in Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals, are suffering as a result of the cuts.  It is as simple as that.  Sick children are waiting on trolleys for hours on end.  The most vulnerable members of our society, those who most need to be protected and cared for when they are unwell, are feeling the effects.  When there are reductions in ambulance and accident and emergency services, bed closures and reduction in the numbers of health professionals in the system, one is inevitably faced with a disaster descending on the health service.  That disaster will only get worse as rising health insurance premia mean that more people will be forced to depend on a public system that is entirely unfit for purpose and being carved up in order to pay off the bankers and bondholders who have ruined the economy of the State and are ruining the European economy.The Minister's plans to close down local accident and emergency services in hospitals throughout the State are of particular concern.  I have a special interest in St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown where the plan seems to be - the Minister will not confirm it one way or the other - to shut down the 24 hour accident and emergency service at the end of March.  As recently as last month, Professor John Nichols, speaking at the Royal College of Surgeons, stated categorically that the distance a patient had to travel in an ambulance to receive treatment was a matter of life and death.  If local 24 hour accident and emergency services were shut down, he said, more people would die.  I appeal to the Government to end the butchery of local accident and emergency departments at Loughlinstown and elsewhere and to reinstate those such as the service in Roscommon which have been closed.  We must stop the cuts in order to save lives.  The bankers and the rich should be made to pay for the economic mess, not the sick and the vulnerable.
