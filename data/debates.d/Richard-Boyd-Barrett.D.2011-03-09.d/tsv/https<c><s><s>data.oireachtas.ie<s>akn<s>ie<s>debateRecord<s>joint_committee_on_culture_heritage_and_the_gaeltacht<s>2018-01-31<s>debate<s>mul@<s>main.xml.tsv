RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank all the contributors for helping to develop my understanding of the whole industry. On the broader picture of things, given the enormous potential the sector has for employment at many levels and to develop Ireland's reputation, we need to dramatically increase the amount of Government investment in film and the arts generally. It has been the poor relation of Government spending for a long time. That is a general comment. I am on the side of people who want to develop the film industry and I recognise the potential. I am, however, deeply concerned about some of the things I have heard today, and which I have learned recently. I particularly acknowledge the Irish Film Workers Association, members of which have acquainted me with their experience and who will appear before the committee in a few weeks. They paint a not very pleasant picture. First, I note an awful lot of money is going into the section 481 tax break. The witnesses may tell me if I have the figures right, and I may make silly mistakes here, but is it correct that in 2016, €258 million was given out in tax expenditures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What sort of figure are we looking at annually for section 481?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The tax expenditure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is still a lot of money. Is it correct that in addition to this figure there are grants and loans?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So is this €80 million, roughly, in grants and loans? Does the Irish Film Board give out loans as well as grants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask about that in a minute. The figure of €80 million is a lot of money. How many people are permanently directly employed by the production companies? Given that €80 million is going in, how many people are permanently employed in the sector? If I understand it correctly, a relatively small group of production companies - the parent companies - are the main beneficiaries of most of that money. I am aware there are a lot of small companies and so on but I understand there are ten or 15 parent companies who probably get the bulk of that expenditure, both directly and as tax relief?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mean full-time equivalents. What is the figure for people who are permanently employed by the production companies? I presume it is not the crew who apply for the section 481 tax relief and it is the company that applies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the companies who apply and who get the section 481 certificate and the funding?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of the companies who received it, how many people are permanently and directly employed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I fully understand that. Some of my comments are less focused on actors as the State should recognise that actors are not just normal jobseekers in between jobs. After a period, when it is acknowledged that a person is a professional actor, the State should ensure a decent living for them and make some sort of arrangement where they are employed by the State or given a decent level of income so that they do not have this precarious existence. I say that as an aside and perhaps Irish Equity could respond to that point. I am talking about the people who make the props, provide transport and build the sets. These are very skilled people who have absolutely no continuity of employment. Production companies get certain types of tax breaks, grants and loans. How many of these people do they employ directly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to cut across the witness but I am going to run out of time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do want an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not transparent to me but that is because I do not know enough about the industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The picture I am getting from people working in the industry is not a good one. I am hearing that the requirement under section 481 for quality of employment and training opportunities is not the case. I do not know how this has gone on for so long, given that section 481 has been in place for quite a long time and quite a lot of money has been dispensed. I met someone recently who was a trainee for 12 years. That is not acceptable. That is an abuse of the category of trainee. Quality employment, in my mind, cannot be defined as a hire-them-and-fire-them workforce where, at the end of every production, regardless of how long a person has worked in the industry, how many different productions they have worked on and what their level of skills are, there is no obligation whatsoever to take somebody back when the next production starts. If that person has been asking questions about health and safety issues, pay issues or conditions on the set, there is no obligation to take him or her back. There are allegations that this is happening. I do not know how widespread it is but I do not believe there is smoke without fire. The witnesses will no doubt say that the industry generally is not like that and perhaps that is true. I am simply saying that if those allegations are being made, I do not believe they are totally made up. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms O'Loughlin wanted to respond as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take up the invitations as I want to know what is going on. I would like the industry to get €160 million - do not get me wrong - but I believe that when an industry gets €80 million, it should create more permanent employment in exchange. I met some people the other day who were producing the most amazing props.It was blindingly good work. They are in their 70s and cannot retire because the on-off nature of their employment means that they do not have pension entitlements. That is a scandal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have some of the other groups in again to discuss this. I want to follow it through with everyone here. Is there a conflict of interest in the fact that one person - I should not mention a name or I will be rapped on the knuckles-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----owns one third of Ardmore Studios and is also one of the owners of Troy Studios. There is something of a conflict of interest there. Certainly, fears have been expressed to me that Ardmore is being run down in favour of Troy. I want to see all of these studios flourish, but I put it to the witnesses that there is a problem if the same person has the biggest stake in Troy and something of a stake in Ardmore when there are fears about the future of the latter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anyone who wants to answer it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a brief supplementary and as a matter of curiosity, is "Into the Badlands" filmed up in the old Dublin Sports Hotel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it up there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure, although I could talk for hours about this as the topic is interesting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will ask two questions, one of which will be on the central issue of continuity of employment for the people who are affected by precarious work. As Ms O'Loughlin indicated, there may be people at a very high and specific skill level who can pick and choose. Let us call it what it is. In the same way, a few A-list stars can pick and choose their movies. However, that is not the situation for the majority of people, and it is them whom we must discuss. I accept that there may be genuine breaks and so on, but I can see nothing from what has been described of the status quo that would prevent companies from deciding not to re-employ certain people because they did not like them. Some of the witnesses may say that is not going on, it rarely goes on or whatever, but we have workers who are saying that it is going on. It is not necessarily up to us to judge who is telling the truth, but there has to be a structure that prevents it from happening, links public funding to guarantees that it will not happen and ensures that there is enforcement and monitoring. If money is going into the film industry through tax reliefs or whatever and certificates are being given to people about quality employment and so on, there has to be monitoring and enforcement. We have to know that quality employment is being provided and that there is fairness in the treatment of the workers. Obviously, there is a pool of workers in the industry. Step 1 is that, after two, three or four years, a person is qualified, is in the pool and cannot be discriminated against within that pool on the arbitrary basis of someone liking or disliking him or her. That last aspect is what we must prevent in order to achieve fairness. People might respond to this comment, but we must reach that point. It is only fair to those who work in the industry. If there is this level of money going into the industry, and I would like to see more, there should be more permanent employment than is the case. I get the point about not wanting to employ someone for six months doing nothing but, on the other hand, the level of permanent employment – we cannot even get a figure on it – seems to be low compared with the amount of Government money. That needs to be addressed. There is something called the working time directive, which, if I remember correctly, allows someone to work 39 hours plus a certain amount of overtime under EU law. Is this being flagrantly disregarded in the film industry when it comes to many of the industry's workers?
