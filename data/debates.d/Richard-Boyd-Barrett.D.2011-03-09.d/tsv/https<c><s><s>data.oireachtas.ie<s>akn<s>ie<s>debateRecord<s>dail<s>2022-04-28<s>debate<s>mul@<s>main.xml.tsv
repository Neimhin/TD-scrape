RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know what the latest figure is but in some years we give out between €80 million and €100 million in section 481 film tax relief. It is supposed to be about developing an industry and industry capacity but, time and again, when workers on film productions take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or try to assert their rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, the film producers who get the section 481 relief go into court and say they could have no possible employment relationship with those workers. This is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On account of the campaigning of film workers, and issues I raised with the Minister, an undertaking was brought in that requires compliance with the relevant employment legislation. Specifically, and probably most important, it requires compliance with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, which means the people employed gain recognition of service. Under the operation of the law, they can gain contracts of indefinite duration even though the work is episodic. However, the employers are signing the Government's declaration and then completely refusing to acknowledge those rights for workers. They are making fools of the Government. The head of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, who the Minister of State says is negotiating an agreement, gave evidence to the court stating there was no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment could be said to have existed between the parties. That was on the basis of the clearly established industry norms of practices governing working arrangements in the sector, including section 481. The employers who sign that undertaking and get the film tax relief are saying they cannot have employees. How can there be quality employment and training when they are saying they have no employees?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is more familiar with this matter. These companies are flouting the regulations. They are flouting them openly. They are signing the undertaking and then doing the exact opposite. Not only are they doing the exact opposite, they are saying there is no basis on which they can have employees. How can the Government give people tens of millions of euro, purely on the basis of creating quality employment and training, when those same people say publicly they cannot have employees? Does the Minister of State get the point? There are no employees. There are no rights. These companies can hire and fire people at will and nobody acquires any rights, even though the money the Government gives them is conditional on giving those rights and signing an undertaking. The companies can blacklist, victimise or penalise people. Anybody they do not like does not get on the next film production and has no recourse because the companies hide behind this DAC, even though the money is not given to the DAC. The money - public money - is given by the Government to the film producer, which then says it has no employees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not complying with it. Nobody is enforcing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of the companies do not make a film for another year-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and then they are statute-barred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a joke.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question is very simple. Is the Government going to propose an emergency budget to deal with the cost-of-living crisis? The cost-of-living crisis is hitting people at every single level. It is hitting them in terms of rents, accommodation, energy prices and the cost of normal consumer goods. The value of people's pay and income is also falling commensurately with the rise in inflation. We cannot wait until October for the Government to seriously address all these issues. We need an emergency budget to do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have just received another report about new rents going up by 9%.That is on top of rents that have effectively doubled in recent years. They are going out of control. We need measures to address that, including rent controls, because that leads directly to people being homeless. The VAT reductions the Government has provided are pathetic, given the increased energy costs people are facing, particularly people with disabilities, single mothers, the vulnerable, the sick and so on who are disproportionately impacted, as well as low-paid workers. The Government's measures are nowhere near what is necessary. People's pay is effectively being slashed as we speak. We need increases in pay and income.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dún Laoghaire is higher.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was contacted by a local catering company in my area which says it has been informed that, without any tendering process, Aramark has been given all the contracts to provide catering to the refugee hubs for Ukrainians. This company is pretty disgusted about that. As the Minister will know, Aramark has been a very controversial company It has been criticised for the poor quality of its catering in US prisons and for the poor quality of some of the catering it provides people in the abhorrent direct provision system. There were protests by artists and workers at the National Gallery about it getting the contract for the café in the National Gallery, which is right here beside us. It was recently caught up in unofficial strike action because it did not give redundancy terms to catering workers in the old Bank of Ireland site. Is it true this company, a US multinational, has just been given all the contracts for catering for Ukrainian refugees?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So local caterers are cut out of it completely. That is bad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Local caterers can get better quality food.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not good and it is not fair.
