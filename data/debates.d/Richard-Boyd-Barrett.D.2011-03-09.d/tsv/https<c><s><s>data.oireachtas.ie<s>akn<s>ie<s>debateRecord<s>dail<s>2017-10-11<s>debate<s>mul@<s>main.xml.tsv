RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The budget announcements made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, yesterday on the issue of the emergency in housing and homelessness were nothing more than a hoax and a very cynical sleight of hand that involves rehashing commitments on social housing that were made long in advance of the budget and offering absolutely nothing to the thousands of families affected by the homelessness crisis or the 100,000 families rotting on housing lists with no hope of getting council homes. The Minister said that 3,800 new social houses will be provided next year. That was already announced by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, so there was nothing extra or new. A total of 17,000 housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies were announced. That matter was already dealt with in the Rebuilding Ireland plan published by the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney. There is nothing new a year on as the crisis escalates and the number of people in homelessness services gets worse. Some 8,000 people, including 3,000 children, are homeless now. There is nothing new on a failed plan. Is that acceptable? I want to let the Taoiseach know that, in the past two weeks, the situation has got worse. The first line of defence is council housing. The Government effectively stopped building that type of housing in 2011. The second line of defence is hubs and emergency accommodation. Both are now full. Families who are homeless are being told by text - they are not even receiving telephone calls - by local authorities that there is no emergency accommodation for them. The last line of defence against homelessness for families has collapsed in the past couple of weeks because all the hotels are full as well. My office spent two days ringing around last week for Kayley, a young mother and student, and her children. Three staff members phoned all the hotels on the approved list for hotel accommodation for those homeless people. There was nothing available. We also have Sinéad, Kayley's friend, another student with children who is in the same situation and there is nothing available for them. There is another of a mum and dad with five children. One is very heavily traumatised and her psychiatrist has expressed great worry about the young baby, two of them are toddlers and three are attending school. They phone around on a day-to-day basis and are thrown out every morning. They do not know if they will have a roof over their heads each day. There is another family with eight children - and one on the way - living in homeless accommodation and they are thrown out at the weekends because the hotels are full. They have to fend for themselves over the weekend with eight children. The defences against homelessness are collapsing and, against that background, the Government offers nothing new except a hoax, pretending to give something new when that something has all already been announced. Does the Taoiseach think that is acceptable in the face of the current housing emergency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ring the alarm bells for the Taoiseach. People cannot even get into hotels now.Families cannot get a family hub or emergency accommodation. They cannot even get a hotel now because when they ring the hotels they are told the hotels already have a full complement of Dublin City Council-approved homeless families. Not only has the Government not got them out of hotels - some of them would love a hotel because they have nowhere else to go - they cannot even get a hotel. I just wanted to tell the Taoiseach that this is where we have come to. As we had already heard about the 3,800 units, there was nothing new in the budget in this regard. Not a single extra social housing unit. This is against a situation where the last line of defence on homelessness has collapsed. It is not going to cut it. As for home building finance Ireland, HBFI, along with the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, it involves more handouts, extraordinarily, for private developers. As the banks we bailed out will not lend to the private developers, we are now going to give cheap money to private developers to build on public land and who will then sell the properties back to the State at inflated prices. What sort of madness is that? The LIHAF is a failure and the Government has allocated more money to it. Private developers are now looking for well in excess of the €300,000 cap, which the Government has lifted. They are going to sell us back at exorbitant prices the land we sold them at a discount. What madness is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is true. Look at Cherrywood.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We sold land to Hines and the average house price sought there is now €500,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For other people to build, for the market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is nonsense. Public housing is needed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Families cannot even find a place in a hotel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not include us in that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is right there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Paul Murphy, with 15 minutes each.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the courtesy of listening to the entirety of his speech yesterday. I also did the Taoiseach the courtesy of sitting here and listening to the entirety of his speech here this morning. On neither occasion did the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach do us the courtesy of being in the House to listen to the responses. I would say that this is a very studied decision on the part of the Government. There are certain critiques they do not want to hear. They want to dish out the criticism, which has now become almost an obsession with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who cannot miss the opportunity in his speech to hit out at what he describes as "the far left". He contrasts it with the moderate centre and he did this again this morning. The strategy is to attack the far left, to eulogise the Government as the pragmatic and moderate centre and not even bother to listen to what others have to say. We are good enough to attack but - it appears - not good enough to listen to. I suggest that this obsession tells its own story. It expresses a concern on the part of the Government about the traction that our arguments are getting with ordinary people in society. The strategy of the new communications unit - which is obviously writing these scripts with the Taoiseach - is to try to kill off the far left through silence and ignoring it. They will insult the left but will not actually take on board the arguments being made. I find it deeply ironic. Apparently the pragmatic centre consists of the people who think it is okay to have 8,000 people in homeless accommodation. They think it is okay to not ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to not allocate resources in the budget for those people. They think it is right to not mention Travellers at all in the budget. The second anniversary has just passed of the fire in Carrickmines when ten Travellers died because of the utter failure of the State to provide basic accommodation for Travellers. Two years on and there is not a dickie bird in the budget in this regard. We could go through the list - the poor, young people, the disadvantaged and those in homelessness. There has also been nothing for students in the budget. Third level students with inadequate grants are suffering from student poverty and paying fees they cannot afford but there is nothing for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I shall hear the Minister of State's response and I shall do her the courtesy of listening. I have spoken at length about housing in my last couple of interventions in the budget. I will not repeat the points except to say I really wish the Government would wake up to the new development that is happening. We do not even have hotel accommodation for families who are homeless, never mind emergency accommodation or council houses. The Government would want to get on to this because it has just started to happen in the last few weeks. We are now facing into the winter and it is getting serious. Families who are homeless cannot even get into a hotel now. The Government should wake up to the unfolding disaster. I will turn now to affordable housing, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF and the proposed home building finance Ireland vehicle, HBFI. Last year, LIHAF received €200 million to give to private developers for infrastructure. The fund is now getting €175 million and HBFI is getting hundreds of millions from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.What is shocking about this is that the premise for the funding was that we, supposedly, would get up to 40% affordable housing in return. I have no doubt that with that subvention developers will, at some point when they can make money, build houses. The issue is that if the State is putting the money in, are the houses going to be affordable? Will they help to address the housing crisis or will they just make money for developers? The Government has no guarantees about their affordability or the proportion that will be affordable and it does not have a fix on what constitutes affordability. Nevertheless, it is still giving them the money. In Cherrywood, we are giving Hines €15 million - having already given it the entire site at a knock-down price from NAMA - yet we do not even know how much affordable housing we will get. It may be 1% or even less than that. At the same time, Hines is saying that €300,000 is not enough for it to make a profit and is talking more in the region of €400,000. Meanwhile, average house prices in Dún Laoghaire are now €500,000 and it has been stated that what is on offer has to be relevant to market prices. We are giving the developer a massive subvention and we have no guarantee of getting anything back on that site. The same is true everywhere else. We do not know what affordability is or what will be the proportion of affordable housing. Nevertheless, we are dishing out the money to these guys. It is scandalous. The Taoiseach said it was all about first principles. The Government's first instinct and first principle on housing is "Give the private developers money and we will think about the rest and the consequences afterwards". I am afraid to say that this is also Fianna Fáil's instinct. The position in respect of disabilities is scandalous. The Disability Federation of Ireland, Mr. John Dolan and others from the community affected by disability are outraged. They are outraged that the Government broke its promise to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That was supposed to happen last year yet there is still no commitment to do it. What did we get for children with disabilities in the health budget? Against a disastrous background, there is €15 million extra and nothing more. Consistent poverty for people with disabilities rose from 14% to 22% in 2015 alone. There is nothing in the budget on personal assistance hours and nothing significant for home supports. There is nothing about the 7,600 people with disabilities who are on the housing list. If all new social housing units the Government says it will build next year were given to people with disabilities, it would not meet half the need. People with disabilities have been completely ignored in the face of an absolute crisis. There is chronic underfunding of assistive technologies for people with disabilities. The list goes on. It is a shocking omission in respect of one of our most vulnerable groups. There is no mention of Travellers. There was a 90% cut during the austerity years to funding for Traveller accommodation but two years after tears were shed in the House about the shocking, unacceptable deaths in Carrickmines as a result of the disgusting conditions in which Travellers are forced to exist, not 1 cent has been provided. There is nothing for Traveller education, funding for which was also cut during the austerity years. It is shocking. I turn to child care and I hope the journalists are listening because a little bit of mathematics needs to be done. I do not promise to know all the answers. What was the big-ticket item in the budget last year? There was a great deal of fanfare about it. I refer to the child care scheme of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, which was supposed to provide significant assistance from September 2017 to help parents meet the extortionate cost of child care, which runs at approximately €1,000 per month for working families. Last year, €35 million was allocated for the programme to cover its cost from September 2017 to the end of the year. That is €35 million for one third of the year. This year, the extra allocation is €20 million, which does not add up and which does not cover a full year. If €35 million covered the period from September to the end of the year, the full-year allocation to meet the requirements of the scheme would have to be €105 million. That is unless, of course, the scheme is not working at all or the Government is back-pedalling from it and not really bringing it in. I think the phrase used in the Budget Statement is "We are taking a step towards it". Therefore, we are not introducing it in September 2017, we are taking steps towards it. The reason the allocation may be inadequate could be the Government's reliance on private child care providers that cannot deliver. They do not have the capacity and, in any event, they are not required to supply the places. That is what is happening. It is either a failed scheme or not enough money is being allocated. I suggest it is both. What about students? Registration fees are now €3,000 while the average cost for a student to go through a year at third level is, according to the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, €11,000. The grant levels have remained unchanged, with the standard grant set at €3,000. This is against costs of €11,000 and registration fees. This is a Government which claims to be composed of the sensible, pragmatic people who want a sustainable economy and to create jobs. Does it think that is possible when students are existing in poverty and when many people are disbarred from education due to the fact that they cannot afford to enter third level or because postgraduate grants to further improve education levels were cut? There has been no restoration of those cuts nor has there been a reduction in apprenticeship charges. The position in respect of the environment and climate change is a joke. Everybody knows that if we are to meet our targets and deal with runaway climate change, we must massively increase the use of public transport. Where are the measures to do that? They are not there. How is the Government going to increase the use of public transport and get people out of their cars? The answer is just not there. The level of subvention is pathetically low while fares are prohibitively high and at punitive levels. In fact, some of the Government's policies have actually cut back bus services to towns, villages and suburbs. That is not going to cut it. I will not go over the points about forestry, which I have discussed, except to note the pathetic underperformance in the context of afforestation levels, which are significantly below the 4,000 ha per year level the National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, said was necessary in a serious programme to increase forest cover. There is nothing on that. It is just not happening. Are those at the pragmatic centre as sensible as they suggest or are they the ideological extremists who just attack the left, give massive tax breaks to the rich, fund developers, let the homeless rot and forget about Travellers and the disabled? Do they think that everything will be fine as long as they look after their rich friends with massive tax breaks and corporate welfare for the wealthiest people in the country? I call that extremism. That there are families with nowhere to go tonight is extremism. We have the temerity to suggest that housing is a human right, but the Government cannot agree with that. We suggest that health care is a human right, but it cannot agree. We suggest that people with disabilities have a human right to be treated equally, but the Government cannot agree with that either. That is extremism. It is apartheid, inequality, discrimination and every other rotten thing which destabilises and which is corrosive to the coherence of our society. Could we afford all of the things we propose? This is where we disagree with our Sinn Féin comrades and others on the left. We think it is possible to give working people a break and to fund all of those services.We would look at the money being made in profits by the big corporations, vulture funds and property speculators in enormous tax breaks that were deliberately designed to give massive amounts to them. I mentioned them last night. A total of €9 billion was given in 2016 in tax breaks for intragroup transactions in the big multinationals. Is anybody examining these? Could some of the business correspondents examine this stuff? A total of €23 billion in tax expenditures that mostly go to the big corporations in this country is not talked about. We pretend it does not exist but billions of euro are going into their pockets every year, which could be going into education, health, and housing, and giving struggling workers who have been hammered by the USC and other cuts a bit of a break in their incomes.
