We have just come from a discussion on setting up a special committee on climate change. Irrespective of whether we like it, we have no choice but to accelerate our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and the country will incur very significant fines starting in 2020 if we do not succeed and we are well behind. Transport is one of the big areas that is contributing to increases in CO2 emissions, which have increased by 7% in the past two years. I believe the Government has pledged that by 2030 all CO2 emission vehicles will be off the road. What do the representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association say to that? I understand their difficulty. It never particularly occurred to me but-----
