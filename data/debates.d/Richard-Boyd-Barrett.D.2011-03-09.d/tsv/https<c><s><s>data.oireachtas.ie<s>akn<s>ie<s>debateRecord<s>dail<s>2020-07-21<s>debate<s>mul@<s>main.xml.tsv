RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to challenge the Taoiseach's assertion that he is on top of dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. His Government has already lost its way in dealing with Covid-19 and if things do not change we are facing a very serious situation and the likelihood of a second wave and we will not be in a position to prevent that becoming a very significant problem if not a disaster.As well as the obvious need to state simply that non-essential travel into this country will not be allowed and that people will be checked on the way in, the other key area, the front line, which we seem to have completely forgotten about, is the capacity of our health service to deal with a second surge and, possibly, with influenza outbreaks, which are likely to increase in the autumn. I do not know if the Taoiseach heard the pretty alarming, frightening testimony of Siobhán Murphy, a young nurse, at the Covid-19 committee this morning, who had no underlying health conditions, was working in a Covid-19 ward, was infected with Covid-19, as were 12 of the 19 nurses on her ward, a number of whom were hospitalised with very severe symptoms, and who described her psychological trauma as a result of having to work in these conditions and the impact of Covid-19 on her. She was absolutely clear, as was Phil Ní Sheaghdha from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, that chronic understaffing and a lack of capacity in our health system was at the root of us having the highest infection rate among healthcare workers of those infected anywhere in the world. The global proportion of healthcare workers infected of all of those infected is 10%. Here it is 34%, and in the past two weeks it is 46%. Nearly half of the infections that have happened in the past two weeks are among healthcare workers, and this is even with personal protective equipment, PPE, because they are working 12-hour shifts, are not getting breaks, and are fatigued, frightened and traumatised by the situation. Critically, they are chronically understaffed. We have 1,000 fewer nurses in the health system than we had in 2007. We need 5,000 additional nurses to drive up the capacity of our system. We are desperately under-resourced and under capacity to deal with a possible second wave, yet all we hear about this week is guarantees for banks and big economic stimulus. It seems as if the Government has forgotten about the health pandemic and all it is concerned about now is business. Will the Taoiseach heed the call of the healthcare workers to embark immediately on an ambitious campaign of recruitment to drive up the capacity in our health service, to double the ICU capacity, and to make Covid-19 infections in our hospitals a notifiable issue so that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, can be called in to assess the health and safety conditions that our health workers are in? Will the Taoiseach support our health workers not just with words but by resourcing them and preparing for what is coming if we face, as we very likely will, a second wave of this infection in the autumn?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about checks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Actual checks are essential.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Words are simply not matched with deeds. The major source of infection in the context of Covid-19 is now among healthcare workers. After all that we went through, healthcare workers are getting the virus. Siobhán Murphy described what they are having to deal with. They are working 12-hour shifts and are not getting adequate breaks. Health facilities are chronically understaffed, which means that there are not people available to take over and reduce the number of hours that others are working. Even when people are identified as contacts of those who test positive, they are still encouraged to come to work sometimes because of staff shortages. That is the reality we are facing when infection levels are quite low. What will happen if a second wave arrives? There does not seem to be any focus on this. As I understand the reports, the July stimulus is money to guarantee banks and for big businesses, but there is nothing about building up capacity and recruiting healthcare workers in large numbers in order to reach safe staffing levels and create additional capacity in the health service. The matter has not received much coverage, but I note that the budget of the EU for health was slashed during the recent negotiations. The money that was supposed to be used to pay for stockpiles of ventilators and to assist national health services to deal with Covid-19 was slashed. As stated, this matter has received no coverage. That seems to be reflected in the priorities of this Government, which is not supporting the healthcare workers and the health service that we need to protect us and that will comprise the front line against Covid-19 in the autumn.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is cutting their payment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The nurses-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned the discussions in Europe about the need for a stimulus and the package that has just been agreed. I referred to something earlier which I find quite shocking. It beggars belief, to be honest. The EU4Health programme was a €9.4 billion programme to create strategic medical stockpiles and a pan-EU medical response force, strengthen public health systems, improve warning systems for epidemics and generally boost and increase healthcare capacity in response to Covid-19. One of the outcomes of the discussions which the Taoiseach is trumpeting as a success was that this fund is being cut from €9.4 billion to €1.7 billion. Is that true? I find that absolutely unbelievable, and it is indicative of how all of the concern about the health dimension of the Covid-19 crisis has dropped off the agenda and it is back to business now. I think that is reflected and will be reflected in the lack of focus on our health services in the Government's own stimulus. It seems to start at the top in Europe, presumably with austerity hawks. Was the Taoiseach aware of this cut? Did he argue against it? It is just shocking that when we should be massively increasing support to and investment in public health services, the original plan for €9.4 billion in funding was reduced to €1.7 billion. Will the Taoiseach confirm whether that is true, what he said about it, and what this reflects in terms of priorities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The frugal four, or is it five now, should be more aptly described as the austerity hawks. "Frugal four" is just too nice for the attitude these people seem to be taking. I am absolutely stunned that one of the victims of this negotiation should be an eightfold reduction in a health scheme to respond to Covid. The EU4Health programme and the details of it are set out on the EU's website. It tells us that there is this fantastic programme which is about recognising the lessons of Covid-19 and responding at every level to support and increase healthcare capacity. The website goes into great detail about the programme, but now it has, in effect, been eliminated at these negotiations, which are being heralded as a success, when we are facing the very strong likelihood of a second wave. It beggars belief. I will bring this particular issue up later but when one thinks about the St. Mary's nursing home and Caritas convalescent centre on Merrion Road, which is being closed down by the Sisters of Charity at a time when we desperately need nursing home capacity, and when we think about what happened in nursing homes during the Covid-19 crisis, it is extraordinary that the EU has slashed the budget that might give us the resources and funds to invest in those critical areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On one level, the programme for Government contains everything. It is motherhood and apple pie. Some of us have criticised it because, when one looks at the detail, it is vague and aspirational and does not make tangible commitments in the key areas in which people demanded change at the general election. That is where my question is focused. For example, the section entitled "An Age-Friendly Ireland" sounds great and appears broadly nice, but it is totally aspirational. We need to look at what is actually happening. There was a disaster in nursing homes in the context of Covid-19. There were significant infections and fatalities because our system of nursing home care is completely dysfunctional. A report published by HIQA found that more than 50% of nursing homes were below standard. I refer to the situation involving two nursing homes on Merrion Road. I wish to send a shout out to the workers and residents in the homes and their families. The homes in question are situated on land that is directly or indirectly owned by the Sisters of Charity and both are closing down because, essentially, a religious organisation decided that the land on Merrion Road is very valuable. It probably wants to flog the land to developers. The Sisters of Charity unilaterally ended the lease for the Caritas Convalescent Centre and shut down St. Mary's Centre, leaving the elderly residents, their families and the workers high and dry. By the way, these nursing homes did not have Covid cases. These were the good ones. This situation is indicative of the dysfunctionality in this area of policy. The Sisters of Charity are deciding to end care provision in these nursing homes. What is the Government doing about this? What tangible measures are going to be taken in the aftermath of Covid to ensure that the State is in charge of ensuring that we have the capacity we need in nursing home care? What will be done to ensure that the State has genuine control in that regard, that the sector has the resources it needs and that workers and residents in nursing homes are properly protected? Specifically, what will the Government do about the scandal that is unfolding on Merrion Road? It is just one example of dysfunctionality in the sector. A similar point could be made in respect of the specific commitment in the programme for Government to protect tenants during Covid-19. It is now unclear whether many tenants will be evicted on 1 August when the temporary ban ends. Where is the tangible action on the things people asked for?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If there is time, would the Taoiseach come back on my question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give him a bit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point, arising from what happened with Covid-19 in the nursing homes sector and from the Caritas and St. Mary's situation, is that we have a completely fragmented nursing home care sector. Some of it is good and some of it is not so good, but we are in control of hardly any of it. The nuns in this case seem to have turned into property magnates and to have lost any interest in the workers or the residents in the nursing homes. They just decided to close it down because it is valuable land and they can flog it, and that is allowed. This should be part of a cradle-to-grave national health service, yet its fate is decided by the Sisters of Charity, who have just become big business and see property value as more important than nursing home care, which was what was being delivered, and a good standard too, but the workers are just gone and the residents and their families are left high and dry. That is not acceptable. We need intervention. The State should just take that land and make sure those nursing home places and jobs are protected. That is the lesson more broadly of the Covid crisis. Paul Reid said it at some of the briefings the Taoiseach attended. When we asked him what was happening in the nursing homes, he more or less said he did not know because the HSE only controls 20% of them. That is the problem. They need to be part of a national health service so we know what is going on and we have the power to step in and ensure consistency, standards, proper resourcing and oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They should not control the health service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit fully supports the objective of the Bill, which is to try to protect and support employment in the SME sector. We are fully aware that small businesses are responsible for more than 1 million jobs. It is absolutely right that the Government takes the necessary measures to protect and sustain the jobs in that sector. While supporting the objective, we have a number of concerns about the approach being taken in the Bill and in the part it plays in the overall July stimulus measures, which we understand the Minister is planning. In some ways it repeats the mistakes of the past pursued by the Minister of State and his coalition partners Fianna Fáil in trying to deal with economic crises. Even more so, there has been a failure in the Government's overall approach to register just how the world has changed as a result of Covid-19, the challenges it poses and the need for an absolutely radical shift in the way we run our society and to try to construct a sustainable economy in the post-Covid-19 era. What do I mean by that? First, there is a sort of narrative, which I would call an ideology, that pervades the Government's approach in this Bill, and more broadly in the stimulus. It has really pervaded the Government's approach for the last decade. It is the view that the core of the economy is private enterprise. In the last few months we have learnt that quite literally our health is our wealth, but I do not know if the Minister of State has learnt this. It is not just a nice idea. We have suddenly learnt that this is a fact: our health is our wealth. When a pandemic as vicious and as virulent as Covid-19 arrives and public health is threatened in a fundamental way, and when this public health emergency threatens to overwhelm the ability of our under-resourced health system to cope, then the entire economy shuts down. All of the SMEs pretty much shut down and quite a lot, if not most, of big business shuts down. The economy shuts down. It is essential: our health is our wealth. If we cannot deal with the ongoing threat of Covid-19, all of these other measures are a waste of time. I do not believe that this understanding has penetrated the heads of the two major parties. They just imagine that if we nurse the system back to roughly where it was and hope that Covid-19 goes away then everything will be okay. This is a fundamental mistake. There is a failure to recognise this to the level of having systems in place necessary to cope with Covid-19 in the form of a health service that can deal with surges, an education system that has to function but which does not have the capacity, and a childcare system that has to function in order for the rest of the economy to operate. These are absolute preconditions for the rest of the economy to function. If they do not function then forget all the stimulus to SMEs, which would be irrelevant. If we do not have an education system that is capable of operating, if we do not have a health system that is capable of dealing with surges, and if we do not have childcare that can allow parents to go to work then forget the rest. This understanding has not permeated what will come out from the July stimulus. There is no radical programme to recruit the 5,000 healthcare workers we need. This is not just a health prerequisite, it is also an economic stimulus. It is a sustainable one because, Covid or no Covid, we need those healthcare workers. Those jobs will sustain the economy and sustain the ability of our health service to underpin our entire society and economy. Exactly the same point can be made for our chronically understaffed education system and our chronically under-resourced and fragmented national childcare system. I say this first as a key point. My second point concerns the Bill itself. As I said earlier, of course we need to support the small and medium-sized enterprises. Extending credit to them is probably, for some at least, important to do. Yes, we should do it. As other speakers have said, however, it is telling that the previous scheme, which this expands in the light of Covid-19, is questionable in its success and effectiveness with regard to its take-up. It is highly debatable whether the SMEs that really need the help will take on debts from banks that are, let us face it, not the most helpful people in the world to SMEs or to anybody else. This is the bit that really gets me about not learning lessons. Yes we need to extend supports and credit to the SMEs and it is right the State takes on the responsibility for doing it.The mechanism through which one plans to do this is by privatising the profits, if it succeeds, and socialising the costs or the debts if it fails. Where have we heard this before? The proposal is that if the banks lend a lot and if it works, they will profit from it. We will get a tiny 0.25% premium but the profits will flow to the banks. However, if it goes belly up, because the Government has not done the other things it needed to do in terms of the health service, education and dealing with Covid, and there are a load of defaults, the people pay the bill. It is a win-win for the banks. When we need to deal with a big economic problem, we come up with a proposal that is a win-win situation for the banks. They cannot lose. Where did we hear that before? How did that work out the last time around? Not very well. The banks will be the arbiters of who gets loans, if the SMEs even want credit from them which, as we said, is debatable. Why on earth would the Government not cut out the middleman in this situation? I do not understand it if we are going to pay the bill. The potential for massive defaults is very real if the pandemic continues to impact and we are forced back into further lockdowns. Why on earth would we go through the middleman of the banks and tell them they can have the profits if everything goes well but we will pick up the bill if it goes really badly? That is just madness. It will also be more expensive in interest terms, plus the premium, to go through the banks rather than for the State to do it directly itself. I do not see how that can be the case. The State can borrow money cheaper. It can, by the way, have a more hands-on and human approach to support businesses as opposed to banks which have an utterly inhuman approach. That is generally how most SMEs to which I talk see the banks. They do not see them as helpful or particularly human or looking at the specifics of their business. They see them instead as utterly ruthless. One argument the Government will come back with is that we cannot interfere with the commercial approach of the banks. That would be completely wrong for the Government to do. Instead, the Government will argue that we have to let the banks operate on a sound commercial basis except if the banks lose. Then all the sound commercial stuff goes out the window and we will underwrite them. That is the way it works for the banks. It is one law for the banks and another for the SMEs and everybody else with whom the banks deal. The only people who do not have to operate on a sound commercial basis, because they will be underwritten by the State, in other words, the people, are the banks. That is not an approach I favour. I do not want to stop any flow of credit which might be beneficial to SMEs in this dire situation. However, I have to seriously question whether this is effective and sensible as the way to do that. It is not about the objective of doing it but the way of doing it. It is about making it effective to actually help the SMEs. It is about ensuring that if the State, the people, takes the risk and if the enterprise goes well, then the benefits will flow back to the people, not to the shareholders of the banks. The latter is what the Government's proposal is offering. On the double standards involved, this is part of the wider stimulus package. This is a scheme which the banks will love but which is of questionable value to SMEs. If the leaks are to be believed, the Government is going to increase the possibility that this scheme will fail by cutting the income of those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of the pandemic. If it is true that the Government is going to cut the pandemic payment from €350 to €300, how will this help the high street and SMEs. I do not see how it will. It is counterintuitive, unless I am missing something, that the Government is planning to cut the income of the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, as well as further tapering the wage subsidy scheme. This will mean they will have less money in their pockets which, in turn, will mean they will be spending less money in SMEs. How is that sensible? The only people who are being nicely insulated from any of the problems and risks are the banks. Where did we hear that story before? These are the banks we bailed out to a far bigger tune the last time around but still do not pay any taxes and are making hundreds of millions of euro in profits. The Government, however, wants to make sure they do not have to take any risks. It makes a joke even of capitalism, not that I am a fan of capitalism. This is capitalism with no risk for capitalists. In the enterprise economy, the pioneers of enterprise do not take risks because the chumps representing the people will underwrite the risk for them and make sure that we pay. That does not seem very sensible. Our alternative is to nationalise the banks. They would not be here without the bailout we have given them. They have not treated the mortgage holders very well and are not treating the SMEs very well. We are underwriting their losses anyway. We cannot trust them to lend to the people who really need it but we are actually enabling them. Why on earth would we not be running them and dictating their priorities? Why can we not ensure that if they do make profits, those very profits come back to the people? Some 30 or 40 years ago, even in capitalist countries, that would not have been seen as a completely radical idea. Apparently, it is off the charts now. We will learn eventually about the folly of socialism for the banks and capitalism for the people. However, we continue to go round the hamster wheel of making the same mistake over and over again.
