RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a little confused by the Minister's comments. On the one hand, she is proposing that the default position is that a public inquiry would be held but she also indicates that there are many hoops to be gone through before getting to a public hearing. I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by teachers, particularly in Ireland, which is such a small place. That is one of the points that has been made. Having a default position where complaints are heard in a public hearing, when the potential for very damaging complaints that may not really have substance, could tarnish the reputation of a teacher or vulnerable children who are put in the limelight when they really should not be. That is quite problematic and for the protection of both teachers and children, if there is acknowledgement of the need to screen complaints, why should there be a default position of a public hearing? On a case-by-case basis, as unions and the Teaching Council have indicated, there may be good reason for something to go public. That should surely be considered on a case-by-case basis if we are going to be sensitive to all the concerns about people's reputations and potential damage. This should be examined on a case-by-case basis to decide whether it is appropriate for such issues to be in the public domain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, although teaching is not like politics or midwifery. In the midwifery area, people have either complied with the proper medical procedure or they have not. It is reasonable where there is negligence or professional misconduct, or an allegation of same, for the hearing to occur in public. Teaching is different. We are a small country so although international comparisons have some relevance, we need to be specific about this country.We are a very small country and if mud is thrown it can stick and follow one around in a serious way, even if there is no basis to the mud. The relationship between teachers and students is different. Various conflicts can occur between teachers and students on both sides, and people may simply not get on. There should not be a default position whereby disputes, many of which could have that sort of character and do not involve professional misconduct or unsuitability to teach, or which could be just the product of vulnerable children being upset or whatever, which are serious matters that need to be dealt with, are put before a type of public star chamber. That is problematic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 6, line 18, after “Oireachtas” to insert “and shall be immediately informed of this”.In fact this is my amendment in the name of Deputy Daly. The point of the amendment is that, as I have been informed, if someone is not registered or is removed or suspended from the register of the Teaching Council he or she is not paid, and teachers often do not know this. They are working for weeks and they do not know that they have not been paid and that they are not registered. They discover many weeks afterwards that they have not got paid because they were not registered or they had been removed from the register for some reason. While it is reasonable that they should not be paid, they should be informed immediately that this is about to happen to allow them remedy the situation if it is simply an omission that they should have registered, but it is not fair if people are not being paid and discover after the fact that it is because they are not on the register. It seems reasonable that there should be a requirement to inform the teacher. Ideally, when the decision is made that their pay will be stopped they should be told immediately that is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does if it is a requirement to inform them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was told this by a teacher. I will go back before Report Stage and report what the Minister said, but I was informed that this does happen and it clearly is unfair. Whatever is in place now is not adequate from the account I was given. I do not understand why it is a problem for the Teaching Council. Even though it does not pay people I do not see why it is a big deal to ask the Teaching Council to inform people that they are not on the register and if they are not on the register they should know they will not be paid.It does not matter that it is not the body that pays them. It should simply be a piece of information that it passes on to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It can inform them that the legislation means they will not be paid. It could say, "You are not registered and the consequence of that, according to legislation, is that you will not be paid". Why can the Teaching Council not tell them that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will return to it on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, line 26, to delete “fit and proper” and substitute “qualified”.This section deals with the fitness of teachers to teach and be admitted to the register. The concern raised in the amendment is that the term "fit and proper" is too subjective and is open to abuse or a subjective interpretation which is too wide. Obviously, one wants people to be fit and proper in the sense one would generally understand that, but that phraseology is too subjective. It is the type of phrase that could allow the parish priest to say somebody is not fit and proper, for example. The proposal is that we be a little more specific about what we mean by fit and proper and remove that subjective phraseology. What we want them to be, I presume, is qualified and vetted according to the legislation. The vetting ensures that they are fit and proper. If the Minister wishes to state there are other criteria that should be deployed in deciding what is fit and proper, that is fair enough but the obvious ones are that they would be properly qualified to do the job and that they would be vetted according to the legislation. However, fit and proper is too subjective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I gave it as an example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point. That is the reason I make reference in amendment No. 7 to the national vetting bureau in the legislation. My aim is to try to ensure that how "fit and proper" is defined by the council in making its decisions is not open to some type of over-subjective viewpoint. I take the point that qualification is only one dimension. The other dimension, as the Minister says, is that they have been properly vetted according to the legislation and are fit and proper. Perhaps I must look again at exactly where I should insert the amendment to make that point, or perhaps the Minister would look at it, and ensure we do not have that subjective phraseology whereby a subjective judgment could be made.It should be more specific and state that what we mean by fit and proper is qualified and vetted according to the legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those guidelines are not on a statutory footing, so they could change at any point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it not be an idea to define it in the Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point. That is why there is a need to define it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made the point, and I will not labour it. That should be defined in the Bill. The Minister should consider that because it is very subjective. It is a reasonable term to use, but it must be defined. Otherwise people-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think we just have and I am inviting the Minister to say whether there is any other dimension to it. We agree here that "fit and proper" means qualified and vetted according to the legislation. There is the definition. The definition of "fit and proper"-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can say that too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I have made the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which one?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In respect of a reference to the council’s code of conduct, “that he or she has engaged in conduct contrary to a code of professional conduct established by the Council under section 7(2)(b);” there is an ongoing dispute between the Minister and the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, about junior certificate reform. A concern was expressed to me that one can be de-registered on the basis of some of these provisions and that in the code of conduct there is a requirement to adhere to the policy of the Department of Education and Skills. Does that mean one could be denied registration if, as a teacher, one refused to implement the Minister’s policy of junior certificate reform in respect of the controversy about independent marking and teachers marking their own students?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If, in the course of an industrial dispute between the Minister and the teachers about policy changes teachers refuse to implement some of those policy changes, as part of a legitimate industrial dispute, there will be no question of this legislation being used to de-register them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is about the code of conduct. Under section 15-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was reading section 15 of the Bill. I apologise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the Minister's word on that but there is a reference in section 15 to compliance with the code of conduct. In that code, which is not in the Bill, there is a requirement to adhere to the policy of the Department of Education and Skills. Therefore, if teachers engaged in industrial dispute and did not comply with the Department’s policy that code could be invoked as a reason not to register that person.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There may be other references in the Bill to the same idea but it states in this section that "A person (including the Council) may make a complaint to the Investigating Committee in relation to a registered teacher, and the Committee may consider the complaint, where that complaint concerns any of the following matters in relation to the registered teacher". There then follows a series of cases, one of which is "that he or she has engaged in conduct contrary to a code of professional conduct established by the Council under section 7(2)(b)". I am reassured and, more to the point, teachers will be reassured by the Minister's earlier assurances that she would never dream of invoking any of this in the context of an industrial dispute but I wonder if there are legal grounds on which some other Minister might invoke this provision. If teachers were engaged in a legitimate industrial dispute could a Minister have the teachers deregistered because they were not doing as he or she had told them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Bill refers to grounds against which a person can complain against a teacher and request that he or she is deregistered. The Minister said she would not do this but another, nastier, Minister might deregister a teacher for being in breach of the code of conduct on the grounds that the law justifies it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about if somebody made a complaint that a teacher was in breach of the code.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anybody can.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Minister does not understand my point. If the code says that one must comply with departmental policy, which it does, and somebody then complains and says by refusing to implement the junior certificate reform a person does not comply with departmental policy, according to the Bill that could be a basis on which one could request the deregistration of an individual. It is in the law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously that would be the case with such a benign Minister as Deputy O'Sullivan, but it is possible legally. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that somebody might well do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is aware of unintended consequences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know it is, but it is amazing how people can sometimes construe the law for their own purposes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just being scrupulous in my scrutiny.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With what section are we now dealing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the final section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been informed that the Teaching Council has approximately €13 million in cash and that this is money paid to it by teachers. Apparently, the Teaching Council purchases property with money paid to it by teachers, which property it then rents out. That is pretty bizarre and appears to me to be a pretty strange thing for a council to do. Perhaps consideration should be given to the introduction of legislation around whether a Teaching Council should be purchasing property with funds garnered by way of registration fees from teachers, which money rather than being used to purchase property could be returned to the teachers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant to a possible amendment that could have been included in what is an amendment to the Teaching Council Act. This Bill is amending legislation of the primary legislation. It is something to consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am flagging my intention to do so now and alerting the Minister to the issue of the Teaching Council having €13 million with which it is purchasing property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was informed of this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If it has €13 million surplus, what is it doing with it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be helpful if the Minister could do so. She might also look into the matter.
