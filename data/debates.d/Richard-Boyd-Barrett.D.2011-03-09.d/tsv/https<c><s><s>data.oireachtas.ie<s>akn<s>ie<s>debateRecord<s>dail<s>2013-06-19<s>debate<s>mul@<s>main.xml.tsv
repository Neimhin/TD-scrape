RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised the issue of wind farms with the Minister yesterday, but I have one question about the legislation. The Minister said the legislation would probably be introduced later this year and that there would be guidelines for offshore wind energy farms. I asked the Minister about the guidelines and the new foreshore legislation yesterday. Can the Minister give us an assurance that licences and permissions will not be granted prior to the introduction of that legislation, in order that there is a proper legislative framework to deal with these matters? The Minister will be aware of the widespread belief, which is justified, that Ireland is a tax haven for multinationals seeking to avoid tax. Yesterday, the G8 leaders made a declaration calling for greater transparency, regulation and so on, and, in particular, action to deal with the use of shell companies by multinationals to avoid corporate tax, which is something they are doing in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said he was happy to try to implement this declaration. On foot of his comments yesterday in Lough Erne, can we expect that legislation will be introduced to deal with corporate tax avoidance by multinationals in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Acting Chairman. I also oppose this motion, as I did last year. The Omagh bombing was an outrageous tragedy and atrocity.It was tragic proof of the utter bankruptcy and callousness of a certain strand of unrepresentative republicanism in this country. I have no hesitation in saying that those who are nostalgic for a return to paramilitary struggle as a way to deal with problems in the North are wrong, and I call on them to adopt different tactics and perspectives in trying to address political and social problems in the North. Their tactics and actions should be unreservedly condemned. I believe in a very radical change in society and it is justified to engage in protest and sometimes even peaceful civil disobedience to try to bring about change in society. The tactics employed by these groups, as witnessed in Omagh, are utterly indefensible. Nevertheless, I have problems with this legislation and from where the Government is coming. I must point to the double standards of the Government in condemnations of violence and the use of force for political ends; I cannot understand how on the one hand it can rightly condemn atrocities like that which occurred in Omagh while on the other hand we can see no such indignation or outrage when it comes to the use of drones to kill innocent people in Afghanistan. Those people are every bit as innocent as the people in Omagh but where is the indignation and condemnation in that respect? Far from that, we get the feting in this country of the commander-in-chief of the military forces, President Obama, without mention of what his forces are doing in Afghanistan, what they did in Iraq or the consistent abuse of human rights in Guantanamo Bay. What occurred with the G8 protests is also evidence that the Government cannot be trusted with draconian powers, as 80 peaceful protestors who travelled in a bus - I was on the bus - were followed by a Garda armed response unit for 30 km or 40 km until the bus reached the Border. At that stage the protestors were faced with a phalanx of police, and I believe the full security bill for the G8 was £50 million. That was to deal with 3,000 peaceful protestors, so it cannot be justified. This was part of quite a cynical attempt to deter people from engaging in peaceful protest. Draconian legislation does not deal with political or social problems, and one must address the root cause. History has indicated that draconian legislation can be counterproductive and fuel support for organisations rather than deter them in their actions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Operations like following peaceful protesters around?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give Members a clue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish the Minister of State good luck in his new position. I hope the senior Minister, Deputy Coveney, makes the right decision on the proposed sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte. The Government is aware of the huge opposition to the plan to sell off the harvesting rights and I hope the Government has listened to the views of the public that have been clearly stated on that. The Minister of State is aware the EU timber regulation came into force across Europe on 3 March to deal with the problem of illegal logging, with all the subsequent problems it causes in deforestation and climate change, not to mention tax revenue being lost to states, which has further implications in these difficult financial times. This regulation is important and Ireland must implement it as a matter of urgency. Oddly, given this is a country that can grow trees very quickly and that should have a higher level of afforestation, we import about €500 million worth of timber annually. There is significant potential, therefore, for this country to import illegally logged timber, with all the consequences that can have for us economically. Why has there been such a delay in fully implementing this timber regulation? When asked in March about it, the Minister said legislation was being prepared but the Minister of State's reply seems to suggest there will not be legislation, so perhaps he might clarify that. When can we expect the introduction of a penalties regime to be brought in so operators who are not scrupulous in ensuring they use legally felled trees will be penalised for doing so? Can the Minister of State give an assurance that the competent authority that was supposed to be set up, but which has not been set up, will be adequately resourced to ensure the proper implementation of the timber regulations and the proper supervision of the industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the commitment to the development of Irish forestry but we are a long way from where we should be. Afforestation levels are the lowest in Europe. We are importing €500 million worth of timber that we should not have to import. That makes us vulnerable to illegally logged timber, which is bad for our economy, for the developing world and for climate change. I hope the Minister of State will commit to stringent implementation of the EU regulations and ensure the necessary resources are provided to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Higgins on bringing this motion into the Dáil. It is hugely important, 100 years after the great 1913 Lock-out, that we remember that event and consider how far have we achieved the demands that Connolly and Larkin and the working class of Dublin set out to achieve in 1913. We should consider some of the issues they were facing because the Government, particularly the Labour Party, seems keen to say how different it was then, the implication being that the politics and perspectives of Connolly and Larkin are not particularly relevant to today. Connolly fought against poverty in the first instance. Today, there are 200,000 children living in poverty and a Government that in the past few weeks has been imposing cuts on children with special needs. That is something Connolly and Larkin would oppose and resist with all their might. They fought for workers' rights and against the casualisation of labour. That battle is still being fought as governments encourage the casualisation of labour, the outsourcing of work and the proliferation of agencies which deny secure conditions of employment and rights for workers in this country.Most recently this has been evident in a public private partnership in my constituency between Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Sisk, along with a number of Spanish multinationals. They sacked a shop steward as soon as he joined a union and got others to do so as well. Those people only won their rights because they went out on strike, just as was the case in 1913. This Government has still failed to vindicate the basic right to trade union recognition and actively encourages the casualisation and outsourcing of labour. Connolly fought against empire and particularly emphasised the need for this State to control its natural resources. He stated "A free nation is one which possesses absolute control over its internal resources and powers" so how would Connolly stand with the outrageous and disgraceful plans to sell natural resources and State enterprises in order to pay off the gambling debts of bankers and bondholders? He believed in people power and struggle as the means to achieve goals and in the rights of trade unionists to take industrial action, including sympathetic industrial action. I note a Member opposite who denounced sympathetic strikes, and it is worth remembering what Connolly stated in that regard:We hold that the sympathetic strike is the affirmation of the Christrian principle that we are all members of one another, while those who oppose the sympathetic strike and uphold sectionalism in trade union struggles are repeating the question of Cain, who when questioned about his brother - the brother he had murdered - asked "Am I my brother's keeper?" We say "Yes", we are all the keepers of our brothers and sisters and responsible for them.That basic principle of solidarity and the right of working people to stick up for one another and take industrial action in order to defend each other's rights is a right denied under the current labour legislation. Crucially, Connolly believed in real democracy, and that is very pertinent to what is happening with this Government in this country. He stated:If Parliament, elected to carry out the wishes of the electors on one question, chooses to act in a manner contrary to the wishes of the electors in a dozen other questions, the electors have no redress except to wait for another general election to give them the opportunity to return other gentlemen under similar conditions and with similar opportunities of evil doing. The democracy of Parliament is, in short, the democracy of capitalism.That had the implication that it is not real democracy at all, so how true is that of this Government? There were promises about burning bondholders and protecting the vulnerable, as well as getting the country working. There has been a betrayal of all those promises, with a sacrifice of jobs, conditions, rights, incomes and livelihoods of ordinary people who elected the Government Members, and people have no recourse to do anything. In that context, the message of Connolly that struggle on the streets and industrial struggle is the way to gain redress is as relevant as ever.
