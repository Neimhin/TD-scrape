RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:“and shall be passed by both houses of the Oireachtas before being signed into law”.Let us be clear that we all want to see genuinely affordable housing being delivered. However, one of the many problems with this Bill is that a whole range of the key issues which would ensure we would finally get some affordable housing are not contained in the Bill itself but are bounced back to the Minister to be done by regulation. Thus, after years and years of promises from successive governments that we are going to get affordable housing through a plan for affordable housing and an affordable housing Bill, we get a Bill in which many of the key issues are bounced back to the Minister to be done by regulation afterwards. We have no idea what will happen with key issues such as the critical issues of defining what affordability actually is and whether it will be affordable for ordinary working families. There are also the public private partnerships, PPPs. Yet again the Government is insisting on bringing private property interests into the delivery of so-called affordable housing which has never succeeded but apparently will this time. On a whole range of other absolutely critical issues it will be up to the Minister, after the Bill is passed, to decide these things. That is not acceptable. We think those things should be in the Bill. We want real definitions of affordability based on people's income. We do not want private investment funds or property developers to be profiteering out of this. We do not want measures, which we will discuss later, which are very likely to reinforce if not worsen the affordability crisis we currently face because they essentially underpin the existing problem of the domination of the housing sector by profit-driven interests which are responsible for the affordability crisis. These amendments seek to ensure that, at the very minimum, matters relating to these key issues and that are going to be done afterwards must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is in order that we have democratic oversight of regulations which may be made afterwards and so that the Minister does not just get carte blanche to do things which may not actually help the situation, or which are, in any event, not transparent or, worse still, as we saw last night, which may actually benefit the wrong people - the investment funds and property developers - rather than the people we should be looking after with a Bill like this, namely, the working people being priced out of the housing sector. That is the logic of this amendment and it is the very least safeguard we should have over a Bill that in many ways is a pig in a poke because we do not know what is going to happen in the future on some of the key issues that will decide whether we get the affordable housing we want.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister and the Government know that our big concern and the concern of a lot of people out there is that affordable housing may turn out not to be affordable for the working people who desperately need it. People may not have heard it on the microphones, but across the Chamber just now the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, said that it will be. I have no doubt that the Minister hopes this will be the case, and that he would like it to be the case, but the Minister's wishes and the best intentions in the world do not make something true. I am sure that Enda Kenny probably meant it when he said in 2011, when the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government entered office, that by the end of its first term the Government would have eliminated homelessness. He probably actually wanted to get rid of homelessness, but in fact they made policy decisions that produced the worst homelessness crisis in the history of the State. One can call it unintended consequences or misguided ideology, but it means that what the Minister wants may not turn out to be the case. In this legislation we want something that guarantees affordable housing that is actually affordable for the working families who are facing a housing crisis, because housing is not affordable. Key to this is that those people who make money from property, from land and from housing, who just like to make money from investment, and who do absolutely nothing, do not dictate the price of the affordable housing. That is our concern. We will get onto the details on that in some of the other amendments. We get very worried when we hear of public private partnerships where affordability is related to market price, even with a discount on market price, or to local market conditions, which is worse. Local market conditions are absolutely dysfunctional and market prices are absolutely stratospheric. If that is what affordability is benchmarked against, I suspect that quite a few of us believe that the affordable housing in many of the areas where it is needed most will not be affordable. We want affordability to be hardwired into the legislation. It is critical that this is done on the issue of income. I believe affordability is based on one's income, as I have said to the Minister many times. It is not based on a particular price that is set by the market, the Minister or anybody else. It is based on income. What is a reasonable proportion of income for working people to have to spend on rent or on mortgage repayments? To my mind, that figure is 25% or maybe 30%, but no more. It is not 40%, 50% or 60%, or indeed 70%, as many people are paying who are at the epicentre of this housing crisis. We want this provision in the legislation. The Minister does not want it in the legislation. He has not put it in the legislation. Instead, it is to go back to regulation. That is a grave matter of concern. We want any decisions the Minister makes after this to be subject to scrutiny, and not just through information laid before the Dáil, considering that this week we are dealing with guillotine after guillotine. We are dizzy with the amount of legislation that is being rammed through. How would we possibly be able to spot what might be laid before the Dáil on a week like this? If there is a requirement that these things must be debated and passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas, we will have some insurance and some oversight against the possibility that decisions subsequently made by the Minister will not actually deliver the affordable housing we so desperately need. This is the logic of these amendments. I do not see why that basic level of oversight and accountability in this critically important area, which is the existential crisis facing a generation of our society, would not have the scrutiny it deserves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 7, to delete lines 27 and 28.As we discussed with the last group of amendments, we are happy to have arrangements with not-for-profit organisations. However, our concerns are not just ideological concerns, as the Minister regularly trots out, but concerns based on experience with what the private investors want out of property and housing and what their objectives do to the housing sector and to prices and rents. There is a need to ensure that in the Affordable Housing Bill, of all places, we do everything we can to make sure that the dynamics of profit-seeking do not end up making affordable housing unaffordable or in any other way mess up the objective of delivering that affordable housing. This set of amendments relates to the provisions in the Bill to allow for public private partnerships.Of course, this is where the danger does lie. To be honest, for anybody to say this is just ideological would be utterly dishonest. I hope the Minister is not going to go on about that now again and say it is just because I am ideological. Public-private partnerships have proven consistently to be more expensive and less reliable in the delivery of social housing or affordable housing. This is the reality. Why? It is because the private part of the partnership is in the deal to make money. They do not have the same objectives that we have simply to deliver housing that is affordable. They invest to make money. They do not invest in a project unless they are going to get their pound of flesh and, critically, they often do not continue with a project if at any point in the process they decide they will not make the money they originally thought they were going to make. Furthermore, there is no transparency in public-private partnerships because it is all shrouded in commercial sensitivity. Once there is a public-private partnership, transparency and accountability regarding the expenditure of public money goes out the window because commercial sensitivity issues kick in. We believe that public-private partnerships have no place in the delivery of affordable housing and these amendments seek to delete those references to public-private partnerships because we want to exclude the failed public-private partnerships model from a Bill that is supposed to be about delivering affordable housing. Let us remember the developments on Dominick Street, where we are finally starting to get something. That was because a public-private partnership showed the weaknesses inherent in those public-private partnerships. A certain developer just decided at a certain point not to proceed with it and the plans went out the window and we did not get anything. Dominick Street has been left there in disgraceful dereliction for 20 years as a result of this failed model of public-private partnership. We are not in favour of repeating it. Of course, I have seen many other examples of this and smaller versions. I might anticipate certain criticisms that occasionally come from Deputies Mattie McGrath or Michael Collins that this means we have no role for small private contractors. This is not what we are saying in these amendments. I want to stress this. Very often, public housing has been delivered by local authorities stating they want to build, for example, a public housing development of 200 houses and this is contracted out to a private developer. Frankly, I would prefer a State construction company and people directly employed by the local authorities but I understand that short of this often it is about contracting to private local builders. What does not happen in these traditional examples of delivering public housing is that the private builder dictates anything to do with the price of the dwelling or the rents in the dwelling, or that some arrangement is involved whereby large amounts of public money are paid out for 20, 25 or 30 years, paying over the odds for delivering housing. It is just a straightforward deal where the builders are paid a certain amount and they build the houses. This is different. This is not what we are saying here. Public-private partnerships are a failed model. They are more expensive and less reliable, there is less transparency and they infect the objective of delivering affordable housing with the priority of making profits for private investors. Let us not have more of the stuff we debated last night that once again, when it should be about delivering affordability for people, we have to sneak into the back door the interests that just want to make money. This is what is here. There is no purpose or benefit in it. They cannot deliver finance any cheaper than anybody else. We can do that better than they can. There is simply no justification for public-private partnerships in an affordable housing Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to be as brief as I can. We are not going to get to many of the key amendments to this Bill because we only have three hours to debate. That is a fact caused by the Government's guillotine. It is not necessary. We should have an opportunity to debate these amendments because this legislation is too important. Deputy Mattie McGrath made slightly personalised comments, although I do not take them overly personally, in asking have we ever done this, that or the other. I have built council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fact, I built council houses in Peckham in London, which I went to see recently, and they are still standing. I was delighted. They were built by Irish building contractors for whom I worked there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are still in public ownership. They were built through the model-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were built through the model by which houses should be built as against public-private partnership. I am speaking directly to the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that. They are my amendments and I am speaking directly to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those houses in Peckham were built under the model by which the local authority contracts to build a certain number of public houses and then small builders and private builders come in and build them. It is not a public-private partnership. The Government is throwing mud in people's eyes and trying to create a division by suggesting we are trying to exclude the small builder from involvement in public projects. It is dishonest. The Government should stop playing political games because that is not what we are proposing. Public-private partnership is a very specific model whereby the private financial interest or private developer is involved in deciding things such as the final price of the dwelling. They should have no role in that. That is our point. They have been contracted to build housing at genuinely affordable prices that are set in the interests of those who need social and affordable housing.They should have no say in what the rents are or at what level the affordable housing cost is set, but with PPPs, they do. Furthermore, there is no risk. Deputy Lahart said there is a risk in PPP. There is no risk; that is the whole problem. The PPP is win, win, win for the private investor. In fact, they will not even enter into the arrangement unless they are guaranteed a win and a pound of flesh. That affects the cost at which it is built and the price at which rent is charged. Even then, they still pull out sometimes, collapsing projects and failing to deliver. We are trying to exclude them because they are not reliable and it delivers housing that is more expensive and, very likely, not affordable. By the way, on a personalised note, we actively fought to get these sites developed in our area. People Before Profit representatives were the first to say that Shanganagh should be for public housing when the Department of Justice was selling it off. We called for it to be transferred to the local authority, which it subsequently was, and 15 years on not a sod has been turned. Why? When we said we should develop for public and affordable housing, the official ideology, with which this Government is continuing, was that it had to involve private finance. The Government could not then figure out how it could actually deliver affordable housing. Even though the Government approved Shanganagh the other day, we still do not know how much the affordable housing will cost. We still do not know 15 years on. We have no idea what the price is going to be. That is what public private partnership does as opposed to the local authority simply saying we will have this much public housing, these many cost rental and affordable homes, and then tendering out to whatever builder can build it. That is it. That will provide local work for local builders and all the rest of it. People concerned with profit, however, will have nothing to do with the speed at which that is developed, the mix of housing or the final rents and prices. Let us be absolutely clear, therefore, about what is being debated here. Deputy O'Callaghan said earlier that this is fundamental because of the four groups mentioned by the Minister. We absolutely want the local authorities, co-operatives, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and not-for-profit entities involved. We absolutely do not want unreliable property investors to have any say over whether we deliver housing because we cannot take a risk on it. This is the thing. If some builder in New York or anywhere else wants to take risks, let that builder take risks. We cannot take a risk with the delivery of affordable and public housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I too am looking for clarification on this. There may be a slight difference of opinion with my comrades and colleagues in the Opposition on this, or there may not. This is why I want clarification from the Minister. I am very much against anything that is going to reinforce or underpin unaffordable house prices as they exist in the epicentre of the housing crisis at the moment. Any kind of influence the unaffordable market price might have on the actual price of affordable housing that is delivered by the State is unacceptable to me. This is the fundamental problem. It should have no influence because at the moment the market is the problem. It is out of the reach of 70% to 80% of people. They just cannot afford these house prices. This is most certainly the case in my area and in most of Dublin, and in many of the other urban centres, although not exclusively. The State needs to do something that breaks with this logic if it is going to deliver housing that is genuinely affordable. In this legislation and all the other housing legislation that he trumpets, the Minister not only leaves the door open for the market, he also explicitly brings the market back in and brings in private interests that are concerned with market prices and profits they can make. I believe this guarantees unaffordability. If it were a choice between a vulture or a cuckoo fund buying up a housing estate and a local authority, I would rather the local authority bought it. This is the point I made yesterday about the stamp duty tax incentive that is being given to the vulture funds. The Taoiseach implied that if the local authority stepped in and bought that housing instead of the vulture funds, that somehow this would impact on first-time buyers. It would not. That is a deliberate misrepresentation of what I said yesterday, which was that this is not the choice. The choice is that these vulture or cuckoo funds are coming in and buying up estates and that we should do everything we can to stop that, and that if a local authority stepped in to purchase those homes and then allocated them for affordable and social housing, they could ensure some affordability. The criteria for affordability should be set by the local authority and real affordability could be based on incomes and on the delivery of social housing. The Minister needs to clarify this because we do not want the open market in any shape or form to dictate the cost of affordable housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can certainly see the logic for why a bit of flexibility is needed in rural areas, but I believe that a bit of flexibility is required in urban areas too, depending on the need to deliver, and notwithstanding the critical importance of not reinforcing or underpinning unaffordable prices.As I said, given a stark choice between a vulture fund buying up houses and a local authority buying them, I would prefer the local authority to buy them rather than us letting vulture funds have them and then having to lease housing from them. I am open to that sort of flexibility if that is what the Minister is saying. I am very conscious that we are going to hit a guillotine in about ten or 15 minutes and multiple groupings will not be reached. I would like to get a response from the Minister on one issue, given that we will not get to the amendment. There is one group of people who have been very hard done by in terms of not being eligible for social housing having previously been eligible. They are now in a situation where there are no affordable housing schemes. Special provision needs to be made for such people. I urge the Minister to address the eligibility criteria and prioritisation for affordable housing. Many people who have been on lists for ten or 15 years have been heartbroken year after year because when their incomes go slightly over the threshold all of those years are gone and there is no affordable scheme for them. There was a lottery for the Balbriggan project. I see a certain fairness in that. However, people have been knocked off lists. Many of the income thresholds for social housing should be restored and raised because they are too low. If that is not going to happen, the people affected should be given some level of priority in terms of eligibility for affordable schemes, whether that is cost rental or affordable purchase, given that they lost years, in many cases a decade or more, on a housing waiting list only for it all to come to nothing. We may not get a chance to speak again on the Bill. My next point relates to the open market. I want to acknowledge that the Minister listened to some of the issues we raised, such as changing undue segregation and so on. In some areas, things have been pointed towards people's income and ability to pay, although that should be in the Bill. Our notion of 25% or 30%, as others have proposed, is something that could have been in the Bill.  I take the Minister's point about arbitrary caps and so on. There is a difficulty with them. I do not think setting a proportion of income in order to assure affordability, so that the market does not dictate everything, was something the Minister could not have included in the Bill. The key point is that the market must not dictate the supply, the cost, the price or the rent of affordable housing. People's income and the ability of ordinary working families to pay should be the critical issue in delivering affordable housing.  The Minister has continued to include PPPs and the shared equity scheme in the Bill. People who are not left-wing by any stretch of the imagination, including officials in the Minister's Department, the Central Bank and the ESRI, have said that the shared equity scheme is likely to reinforce unaffordability and drive up the prices of homes.  There are things that are good in this Bill, but these are critical issues. Our group cannot bring ourselves to support a Bill that will include the shared equity scheme or PPPs, much as there are other aspects of it that we would welcome. There is concern that many key measures that need to be in this Bill are not in it, and have instead been pushed back to regulations which we have not seen and do not know about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And to housing spokespersons who are not on the committee, if the Minister would not mind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am like an honorary member.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The 4% RPZs were a total failure. I do not doubt that this is an attempt to improve matters and hopefully it will do so somewhat. I want to flag that there should be no rent increases for tenants in the present situation or any time in the foreseeable future, particularly in the areas most affected by completely unaffordable rents. That is where the RPZs are located. Against the background of rents of €2,000, €2,500 and €3,000 per month and even more for pretty basic private rented accommodation, even rent increases that are less than 4% and linked to the HICP are not acceptable. I will not vote against the Bill because it is a marginal improvement on the current situation but I want to flag that we will still find ourselves in a significant crisis. Let us not forget that the inability of people to find affordable rental accommodation is directly contributing to the homelessness crisis. It may be of interest to the Minister to note some encounters I had. They are straws in the wind. When I was walking into Leinster House this morning, I was randomly stopped by two people. The first one was somebody who was outraged about the stamp duty issue and the second one was a building worker who said that he was in a place where he was paying about €500 or €600 per month in rent, which was manageable, but that he had to leave that place. He had started looking around for places to rent and he could not find anything for a single individual that was less than €2,000, which is completely unpayable. This Bill will not address that. Does the Minister have a plan to deal with that fact in the short term?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will not deal with it in the short term. I have mentioned the St. Helen's Court residents on multiple occasions to the Minister, the previous Minister and probably the Minister before that. They are banjaxed. They are waiting for the vulture fund that has successfully evicted them en masse from an apartment complex and they are overholding because the eviction date has passed. They have nowhere to go, they are vigorously looking around and they cannot find anything even remotely close to being within HAP limits or their income limits. Their landlord has evicted them because it wants to increase the rents. They were all paying roughly €1,000 per month and the previous vulture fund tried, before the RPZs came in, to increase their rent by 60%. It has used various mechanisms to try to get them out over the last four years and it has finally succeeded. These people now have nowhere to go and to me that is unacceptable. If they are waiting for the vulture fund to seek an enforcement order on the RTB adjudication, they will be in the District Court, the judge will tell them they are out and the council will say it has nothing for them. I ask myself what we will do about this. Given that situation, we should have a complete ban on evictions until we can address that. If the Minister says his affordable housing scheme will sort it out for them he should ban evictions until it does. The problem is that in the immediate term, that building worker I met on the street and those people in St. Helen's Court simply cannot find affordable rental accommodation. They are working people and they may be in homeless services in a few weeks because of that fact. I would be interested to hear if the Minister has any view on another matter. Along with Deputies Ó Broin and Cian O'Callaghan, I took part in a debate with thejournal.ie the other day about housing policy and it had an expert group that was meeting beforehand. Those experts were recommending that there should be maximum rents based on square meterage and this is in line with People Before Profit policy. That happens in other countries and that is what should happen. Rent boards of local authorities should simply inspect any properties that are being put up for rent in their area and they should state what the maximum that can be charged for it is. Roughly speaking, those ceilings on what can be charged should be aligned to what is affordable for people on modest and average incomes. There can be exceptions around that but that should be the broad principle. That is what is necessary. I accept that this is an effort to try to improve things but it will not deal with the rental crisis or the homelessness that is flowing from same. It should deal with that. The Minister has often said that he wants to stop people going into homelessness. I can promise him that they will continue to go into homelessness until we address that and, for the moment at least, ban evictions that are no-fault or economic evictions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think she is going to be here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will briefly recapitulate on a few points from yesterday and add a few points on behalf of Deputy Bríd Smith, who could not make it along. A parents and children's schools charter is not a bad idea in principle. It is a very good idea in principle to have proper grievance procedures and transparency concerning the expenditure of school funds and voluntary contributions, even though, frankly, they should not exist. I will come to that point in a second. It is a good idea for people to have information and real engagement with parents in their school communities about that charter. These are all reasonable things in and of themselves. The problem, however, is that, to my mind, much of the focus of this Bill gives the Minister the right essentially to instruct school boards and schools to do certain things. The focus seems to be all internal rather than putting a charter of rights in place for education, children and pupils in education, and their parents which puts real obligations on the Government, Department or Minister to deliver a quality education. Many of the things this Bill seeks to do are, in fact, already mechanisms to deal with issues, such as the Teaching Council, boards of management, parent-teacher associations and so on. As I said yesterday, I would like to see a charter that essentially guarantees high-quality education and the resources necessary to deliver it for all children. That is not what this Bill is about. The fear is, therefore, that it ends up being a league table with schools competing with each other like the kind of neoliberal model we have seen in the UK. That is a concern, notwithstanding the fact the things the Bill is trying to achieve are not in themselves problematic. It could lead to that logic, however. The charter I would like to see is one that says pupils have a right to be in a proper size class and not oversized classrooms, and a right to proper school buildings, amenities and services, special needs assistants, SNAs, when they need one, free school meals and school books and free public transport. A staff member should have the right to ongoing professional development to deal with things like difficult emotional behaviours, special needs issues and so forth. That is the sort of charter we must have. As I and quite a few others mentioned yesterday, people should have the right not to have to fundraise to provide basic services, equipment or whatever in classrooms. A demand that really emerged very clearly from the pandemic is the right not to do stressful, archaic exams such as the leaving certificate, which put immense stress on pupils and teachers. These exams are anachronistic at a time when we should be trying to make sure everybody has a right to move on to higher and further education rather than having a gatekeeping exercise, which is essentially what the leaving certificate is. It is a one-size-fits-all exercise that does not really deal holistically with the individual abilities and differences that exist between people in education. Those are the sorts of things we should have in a charter rather than focusing too much on the internal regime of schools. I want to get on to this particular issue because I made most of those points yesterday. This is one of the really scandalous things, although I do not know the picture all over the country. A basic ability for a school community to deliver a quality education for our children and to involve parents and so on is to have the basic building - a quality building - or to have a building at all. It is amazing we have this system where we recognise there is a need for a school in a particular area based on census or demographic information. We have a system then for the local community to decide what type of school they will have in their area, whether it will be a Gaelscoil, an Educate Together school or another type of patronage for a particular school. We do not, however, plan to provide the location and deliver the building for that school once it is established. There are many examples of this in my area and it seems to be replicated elsewhere. It certainly seems to be the case with a number of examples Deputy Bríd Smith asked me to mention in Dublin South-Central. This may reflect the picture across the country and I suspect it does. I have heard many other Deputies speak about similar issues in their areas and refer to the number of schools that use prefabs and temporary buildings and so on or that lack recreation and sports halls, canteens, proper sports facilities, playing fields and things they need.We need a charter that guarantees those things to all schools, schoolchildren and the parents who are fighting for the best-quality education for their children. I will mention a few examples. St. Mary's Boys National School is in my area. There is a recognised need for an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in that area. A parish hall right next door to the school has been identified as suitable and the parish which owns it is willing to sell the hall to the school. The application has gone in to the Department and there has still been no decision received from the Department. There is a recognised need here and a physical building available yet an answer cannot be got from the Department about the use of this parish hall by the school for children with special needs and for other uses. Dún Laoghaire Educate Together has finally been recognised as a school after a big fight, a hard campaign and much pressure on local politicians. Eventually it was given a permanent location for the school but it is going to take another couple of years. That is a long fight followed by another couple of years before we actually get the school. Gaelscoil Laighean is in a temporary site and must fight and fight to find out which temporary site it is going to be in this year. It had to fight and fight to get a permanent site which it finally got, although interestingly it is going to come at the expense of Traveller accommodation and social housing, which is a conflict that should not happen. Obviously it meets the school's needs but nobody there has any idea when they will actually get the physical school. Sallynoggin Educate Together has now been given a temporary location. Up until a couple of weeks ago it did not even have that. Now it has been given a temporary location outside its catchment area. It is not in Sallynoggin but in Dún Laoghaire, in a building where there is no play area for the students. No permanent location for that school has been identified at all. The Red Door School is a special school that has been in temporary accommodation for more than a decade. Gaelscoil Phádraig in Ballybrack has been waiting for a permanent location for I do not know how many years now, I think it is about 12 or 13. Those are just a sample of the lack of planning and of provision for basic things like a physical location, a building or the special needs provision necessary to give the quality education we need. Deputy Bríd Smith has asked me to mention some cases from her area. In Ballyfermot there has been amalgamation of St. John’s College, Dominican College and Caritas College. A new location has been got at the St. John’s College campus but the 1,000 male and female students there will have no gym and no canteen in an area where there is considerable disadvantage, obesity and so on. The national school at Goldenbridge in Inchicore is in a very dilapidated building in one of the poorest areas in Dublin. It is a fantastic school, where teachers and the principal are concerned, but there is serious neglect of the infrastructure that should be provided for the school. In Dublin 10 and Dublin 12 there is also desperate demand for a gaelscoil in what is a very densely populated area of the country. The community is crying out for it but for some mysterious reason the Department will not grant the area a gaelscoil. Charters inside a school are all very well but unless we deliver the resources, buildings, facilities and the supports charters mean very little.
