RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Debt and jobs are the Moses and prophets for this country and for Europe. Everything else is secondary relative to those two issues. Unlike Deputy Martin - who just took a political pot shot for the sake of it in terms of the Tánaiste raising the issue of the promissory notes and debt in Latin America - I have no problem with the Tánaiste raising the promissory notes in Latin America, at EU Council meetings and on any and every platform he can. He absolutely should do so, both for the people of this country and for the people of Europe as a whole. However, when he raises it, is it just theatrics or are we serious? Is there serious intent behind it? Is there a red line being put up where we say that we are not crossing this line if the EU does not give us a deal that makes a difference to the debt and to jobs? The two are directly connected because every euro we have to pay out to bondholders and banks is a euro that we cannot invest in jobs. The equation is simple and it is not just simple in this country but in Europe also. If the priority is bailing out banks, then we do not have the money for jobs and investment collapses. If we do not have investment, there will be no jobs. On current projections, even in the best-case scenario - I have repeated this on numerous occasions and I hope at some point members of the media will focus on it - unemployment will only be down to 13.5% in 2015. Is that the vista that we have to look forward to? If that is our strategy and if that is our best outcome, it is nothing. It offers no hope to the people who are desperate for jobs and for our economy as a whole because if we do not get people back to work, our economy is banjaxed and will continue to be banjaxed. What, apart from appeals, are we saying to the European authorities to back up those appeals? Is there any red line? Is the Government saying to the authorities that they must give us a serious and meaningful deal, not one that is just stringing it out but a deal that will make a serious difference to the budget arithmetic next year and our ability to have funds to invest in jobs and economic growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	During Leaders' Questions on Tuesday last, I suggested to the Taoiseach that the Government was engaged in an elaborate charade designed to draw the media and the public into a heightened sense of anticipation and anxiety on whether the Government was going to get a deal on the promissory note. The carry-on that has been going on in this House tonight makes this absolutely clear. Questions on whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will come into the Chamber to make a statement or whether there will be a big announcement or a deal are almost up there with the Tánaiste in Chile talking about governments collapsing. They make clear this is precisely what is going on, namely, an elaborate charade or the politics of illusion. It is an attempt to sell a puff of smoke as some sort of great victory which the Government will announce and will claim to be a great stride forward for the country. However, as the Government has stated very clearly for the past year and a half when pressed on the issue, the deal it seeks involves paying every cent of the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank. This is the reality and this is the deal the Government intends to announce. One should be clear about what that means. However it might be structured, each cent and euro that we pay back on the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank is a cent or euro that is not going into public services, infrastructure or job creation. The Government simply cannot wriggle its way out of that fact. My point is we should not do that. We should not pay back gambling debts that are not ours, our children's or our grandchildren's, as they will be if the Government does the deal it proposes Instead, this money should go into jobs and public services and into alleviating the misery that is being inflicted on ordinary citizens in this country. The Government claims that were we to do this, there would be catastrophe because of the reaction of the markets. Even Patrick Honohan, when speaking at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, admitted the claim that money would not come out of the ATMs was nonsense. He made that point, not the members. This is a scare tactic on the part of the Government. The reality is that if we did not pay the €9.1 billion in interest next year - not just the €3.1 billion for the promissory note - we would be left with a manageable deficit of €6 billion. We could manage that by imposing taxes on wealth, on the corporations and on higher income earners and by using that money to generate growth and employment, which is the only way we can recover. One cannot recover by saddling this country with billions of euro in debts for 40 years. It is not a victory; it is a puff of smoke and I hope the public see through it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is just not on. This State was bankrupted as a result of decisions made in the early hours of the morning and rammed through in precisely the manner the Government is talking about now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are talking about a Bill that is dealing with assets of over €40 billion from Anglo Irish Bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The finance spokespeople were briefed 15 or 20 minutes before this session began. We were rushed through this Bill dealing with €40 billion worth of assets in about 15 minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is seriously suggesting we can make an informed decision-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, if they do not heckle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is too serious to be rammed through in this manner where we have not had time, certainly on this side of the House. It is debatable whether the Taoiseach has had a chance to read it - I suspect he has, but certainly we on this side of the House have not. It is absolutely unacceptable that we are expected to be bounced into making a decision on moneys to the tune of more than €40 billion which could have enormous ramifications for this State and this economy. It is not on. It is not sufficient to have an extra half an hour to have a quick glance at it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need an informed discussion on the Bill. We need a proper un-guillotined debate and we need an opportunity just to read the legislation. The Taoiseach should not do what the previous Government did. The idea that this-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----serious legislation could be rammed through in this way is absolutely shameful politics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Fianna Fáil Government bankrupted the country with a decision taken in the early hours of the morning, we now know under a diktat of the ECB. Tonight, in the same sort of circumstances, the Government is taking a decision about one of the main culprits of the financial crisis and involving vast amounts of money, also under a diktat of the ECB. The ECB says "jump" and the Government says "how high", even when it means trampling on the democracy of the House and the right of citizens to know what the Government, along with its friends in the ECB, is proposing for them. The suggestion that the Government is ramming through the Bill as a result of an unintended leak is an insult to the intelligence of the House and of the people. During Leaders' Questions on Tuesday last, I suggested that the Government was engaged in an elaborate charade. The Tánaiste was going around Chile talking about the Government collapsing. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, was talking about the Croke Park deal collapsing, and Ministers were smiling like Cheshire cats, as they still are, and saying there was nothing up. Tonight's events clearly confirm, however, that this is the second act in the amateur dramatics that started earlier this week that will conclude tomorrow-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----when the deal the Government has already planned, just as this legislation was clearly written some time ago, is rammed through to pin Anglo Irish Bank's gambling debts permanently, securely and legally to the backs of the Irish people in such a way that we cannot repudiate them. People are saying this is about giving the Minister powers, but it is not just about that - it is the action that will pin the debt to our backs because we now owe the money to the European Central Bank as a result of this Bill. It is no coincidence this is being rammed through when the Government knows tens of thousands of people will take to the streets this weekend demanding the Government lifts the burden.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I urge the people out there that the Government is trying to hoodwink - the nurses, teachers and gardaí, the bulk of our citizens - to take to the streets against this disgraceful attempt to hoodwink them and to unload Anglo Irish Bank's gambling debts on to their backs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where did they come from?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The key substance of the Bill is that whereas previously the promissory note was owed to Anglo Irish Bank now this money will be owed to the Central Bank and the European Central Bank. In the first case there was some chance for us to repudiate a debt which is not ours, but once we do this and once these assets and liabilities are transferred to the Central Bank there is simply no way we can repudiate the debt.The last bit of leverage with the ECB in terms of demanding a write-down will be gone. We were told that the winding up of the IBRC was part of the discussions as a prelude to any deal, but once this is done the ECB does not have to give the Government anything at all, despite any promises it may have made to the Government in the negotiations. That is because we will have fully taken on board the liability for the promissory note, which is what section 12 of the Bill does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were informed earlier that the transfer of undertakings that would normally apply to employees in a situation like this, will not apply to ordinary bank workers in Anglo Irish Bank who, as of tomorrow, will have no jobs. It will be at the whim of NAMA or the Government to decide which of those employees, if any, still have a job tomorrow. It is deplorable that the Minister has not, at least, inserted some safeguards and protections for ordinary workers in the bank who, as the Minister said himself, were not responsible for the financial casino gambling of Anglo Irish Bank. Those are abominable failings in this Bill and make it all the more reprehensible that the Taoiseach should try to ram this legislation through in such a short time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to get to the heart of the Bill so I will put my question in its simplest terms. The promissory note was about us promising to repay €30 billion of debts to Anglo Irish Bank. Is it true that this Bill means we will promise to repay the European Central Bank? That is what is happening with the Bill. The substantial deal is being done now in order to promise the European Central Bank that we will repay every cent. Its officials told the Irish Government that this must be done before they would even entertain any discussion on the rescheduling of the debt. This is being permanently pinned on our backs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is contained in section 12, which deals with the transfer of assets and liabilities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the speech. It is in the second paragraph.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To whom do we owe the money if Anglo Irish Bank no longer exists?
