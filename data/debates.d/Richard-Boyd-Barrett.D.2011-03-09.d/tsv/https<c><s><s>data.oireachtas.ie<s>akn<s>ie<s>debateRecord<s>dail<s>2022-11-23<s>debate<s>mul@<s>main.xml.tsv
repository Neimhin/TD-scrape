RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many thousands of people will come out on the streets for the Raise the Roof demonstration because of the failure of the Government to address the absolutely diabolical housing and homelessness crisis. I have brought to the Gallery some of the people for whom this is a life and death matter. Deputy Bacik may not have been aware that some of the residents of Tathony House she referred to are present. The 35 families in Tathony House have done nothing wrong but are facing eviction by a landlord who has had a massive rent roll of approximately €750,000 a year for all the years they have been his tenants. They now face eviction and the possibility of being put out on the street. They are scared and that is why they are here. Residents from Rathmines Road are also in the Gallery. More than 20 families and individuals there are facing the prospect of eviction on grounds of sale. I have also brought in residents from St. Helen's Court, who have faced four years with the sword of eviction hanging over their necks from two different vulture funds that are trying to mass evict them. This is important in the context of the Tyrrelstown amendment and all the rest of it. Although the residents are still there, they now have an active eviction order against them. Even when they defeated the last three attempts by the landlord to circumvent the Tyrrelstown amendment, the fear, stress and anxiety led many of the tenants to leave. They could not put up with the stress on them and their families. The fear, stress and hardship that these people in the Gallery are suffering is shocking. Jacqueline is also in the Gallery. She, her husband and her two teenage daughters are being evicted from the home in which they have lived for 55 years. Jacqueline was born in the house. They are a working family but they cannot get a mortgage because they are too old and the bank will not lend them money. They are over the income threshold so they are not entitled to social housing and they face the prospect of the street, unless the Government intervenes. Stella and her two daughters in Bray also face eviction, not only from where Stella lives but, since she is self-employed, from where she does her business. She will not only lose her home but her job. Their situation is best summed up by Jacqueline. She speaks for all of them when she wrote in a letter I will hand to the Taoiseach after this:My darling, beloved husband will be put into an early grave as he is a broken man. As the dad of the house and as a husband he cannot fix this, This whole situation is affecting both our health. We are a broken family living dark days in fear, Minister. I need you to fix this and I need you to fix this now. The question from all these people is: will the Government use the €500 million allocated to housing that it has not spent to buy their houses and apartment blocks to prevent these families and individuals from being put into homelessness, and end the suffering, hardship and trauma they and their families are suffering, as are many others?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Taoiseach to look those people in the eyes. There has to be a solution. They have done nothing wrong. They paid their rent, they worked and they paid their taxes. The Taoiseach cannot say that there may not be an answer because of this legislative shortcoming or that legislative loophole. If people's incomes, for example, are under €53,000, even according to the Government's schemes, they are in need of some subsidy because that is what the cost-rental threshold is. Every single one of the people I mentioned are below that threshold. There is no reason, with the €500 million that the Government has not spent on housing and that is in its hands, that it could not buy those apartment complexes and houses to prevent people being driven into homelessness. We are spending €213 million on homeless services in the Dublin region alone. The Government can keep spending money on people in desperate emergency accommodation or it could buy those houses and those people would be paying rent to the State. The Government would then save them the suffering, hardship and trauma they are now feeling. I ask the Taoiseach to give them hope. The Government has the money, there is nothing to stop it doing this and it would make life better for people who are really suffering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I am asking the Taoiseach to do. Please do it for these people who do not deserve to be put through what they are being put through at the moment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought there were 20-minute slots.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Acting Chairman can give me half an hour, if she wants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The simple fact about the situation for the vast majority of people on middle and low incomes, working people, or people dependent on pensions or social welfare is that they will be worse off next year than they were this year.This is the fundamental fact. As much as the Government may try and bedazzle people with a long list of measures it has taken to try to mitigate the absolutely diabolical cost-of-living and housing crisis that people face, this is the fact. The official rate of inflation is running at 8.1% but, of course, as everybody that examines these matters, such as the ESRI, has made clear, the inflation rate for people on lower incomes is higher. It is the highest for those who have the least because they spend most of their income on the things that have seen shocking increases in cost and price, whether food, energy or housing. The people who have the least are suffering the most. The vast majority of people will be poorer next year than they were this year. Meanwhile there is another group of people for whom it will be much better next year. It was better for them this year than it was last year and it was better last year than the year before. This is the truth that is never mentioned in these debates. There are a few facts in this regard that are worth putting on the record. Energy poverty in this country is at an all-time high of 29% of the population. It is shocking to think that just under one third of the population is suffering from energy poverty. It is estimated that if current trends of energy cost increases continue this figure will increase to 43%. This is almost double its previous recorded high of 23% in 1994 and 1995. If this trend continues, just under half of the population will soon suffer energy poverty. More generally, according to Social Justice Ireland when housing costs are taken into account, 19% of the population is living in poverty or on the poverty line. This is 935,000 people, including 300,000 children. Almost one in five of the population lives on or below the poverty line when energy and housing costs are taken into account. It is a very different story for others. The median pay package of top CEOs last year increased by 42% to an average of €2 million each in pay. Oxfam stated in a report produced earlier this year that the wealth of Ireland's nine richest billionaires increased in just one year by €15 billion. This is not how much they have; this is how much their wealth increased in one year. That brought the total wealth of nine individuals to €51 billion. We cannot even imagine how rich these people are. A report on the pay of directors for Irish companies shows that many of them recorded maximum bonus payments in 2021. While everybody else was getting poorer and being hammered with the cost-of-living and housing crisis the directors of companies, or most of them, received massive bonus payments. Last year, the average non-executive director, which is basically a part-time job sitting in on a few board meetings, was paid on average €107,000. The average for executive directors was close to €1 million for sitting on a company board. Look at how well these companies were doing while other people were being crushed. Electric Ireland made an additional €63 million in 2021, with profits reaching €679 million, yet in March this year it announced price increases of almost 25% and further increases in August of 11% for electricity and 32% for gas. That affects 1.2 million households. Bord Gais operating profits grew 74% in the first half of 2022 to €39.4 million. In the previous year, they were only €19 million. Bord Gais increased its prices twice in September 2021. Its domestic customers now pay an average of €760 more for electricity and €573 more for gas than last year. Overall estimates suggest that over the past year and next year most households will have lost between €4,000 and €6,000 in real terms because of the rise in the cost of living, housing costs and inflation. These are savage income cuts in real terms. It is also briefly worth mentioning the wealth figures. The richest 5% of people in this country amount to 93,000 households. Between them this group has €388 billion. It may be of interest to the public out there that net household wealth in this country has now reached more than €1 trillion for the first time. We are the fourth richest country in the world. There is a problem with the distribution of that wealth. According to TASC and the only study the Government did on this in recent years in 2017, the richest 10% of our population own 53% of the wealth but the least well off 50% of the population has 1.4% of the wealth. The average wealth of the richest 93,000 households in this country is €4 million whereas we have one fifth of the population living in poverty and this situation is getting worse. Against this background what did the Government do in the budget to address the situation? It provided a 5% increase for pensioners and social welfare recipients, which is €12 per week. According to Social Justice Ireland the necessary level of income per week to be sure of not suffering poverty is €286. The weekly pension went from €253 to €265. This is €21 short of the poverty line. This is the reality. While we are thinking about this, let us not forget about the 93,000 richest households, which have €4 million each in wealth, never mind income. The vast majority of those dependent on the State pension are, in effect, living in poverty or a very close to it. We have a 5% increase when inflation is officially running at 8% but in actuality is approximately 9% or more for those low-income households that spend most of their income on food and heating. There is no change to the basic rates of fuel allowance, living alone allowance, domiciliary care allowance, carer's support grant, back to school clothing and footwear allowance or child benefit. Many people went out on the Cost of Living Coalition protest in advance of the budget.There is no doubt the Minister was changing the figures over that weekend because we managed to get 20,000 people out on the streets. She was put under pressure and we got some one-off payments. I am sure everybody will be glad of those payments, but they are going to disappear into the pockets of the CEOs and executive board directors and the profits of the companies I mentioned. All that money is heading into their pockets. It will be gone come the new year. By the end of the winter months, the reality will kick in that, in terms of a basic income, people received less than the rate of inflation and the rises in the cost of living. They will be poorer next year than they were last year. That will be the reality once those one-off payments disappear. None of this would be necessary if there was a willingness to make a small increase in the tax burden of companies and extraordinary wealthy households that have become more extraordinarily wealthy and profitable in the past year or two and redirect that towards ensuring nobody in this country lives in poverty, everybody can afford a roof over their head and heating and food prices are affordable. That is the big picture as far as I am concerned. A few sticking plasters will not deal with the gaping wound of deprivation, poverty, housing misery and energy poverty that huge numbers of people are experiencing. Beyond those general points, I will make a few specific points. A child over 16 years may be entitled to a disability payment while he or she is at school. However, I discovered that if the mother applies for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for the child going back to school, she will be refused the allowance, unbelievably, because the child is getting a disability payment. Just so the Minister knows, the mother is not allowed to take the disability payment off her child. The child gets the disability payment because he or she has a disability and he or she is entitled to it. That is the child's income. The idea that the mother does not get money for the back-to-school costs, because the child is on a disability payment, is frankly obscene. This needs to be addressed immediately. It is shocking and, in reality, it is a form of discrimination against people with a disability. The husband of a very unwell woman came into my clinic. She is ten years on illness benefit. The rules around illness benefit were changed in 2009 so that a person could only be on it for two years. Prior to that, there were long-term recipients of illness benefit. When that change came in, people were given the option to stay on illness benefit if they thought it was the best payment for them, and this woman did so. As a result, even though she has been on that payment for ten years, she has been denied the fuel allowance all those years. She was also denied the one-off cost-of-living payment of €400, and I have received replies to parliamentary questions to that effect. In case the department official is passing a note to the Minister saying the woman can apply for other allowances, she did that and was denied them both.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If she is entitled to illness benefit, she should be entitled to the fuel allowance, which she should have been getting for the past nine years, as well as the cost-of-living payment. The Minister should do something about this. Beyond that, I see no justification for why people on illness benefit, jobseeker's benefit, maternity benefit, death benefit, injury benefit, or carer's benefit should not have the fuel allowance. Why should they not have it? There is no good reason for this. They will suffer during the coldest winter. They are suffering with the increases in bills. Just because of their short-term payment, based on their PRSI contributions, they are refused fuel allowance. That is outrageous and the fuel allowance should be extended to them. Deputy Devlin said it was good that the income thresholds for the fuel allowance, people in receipt of pensions, people aged over 70 or for people under 70 on a State pension have increased. I accept that is a positive measure. I received an answer from the Minister to a parliamentary question that stated she does not intend to advertise that fact in January. There will be no public information campaign. I suggest that she holds a public information campaign, in January, that is broadcast, loud and clear, informing people to check whether the new means thresholds will mean they are entitled to the allowance. It should be broadcast from the rooftops, on the radio and television that people may be entitled to the fuel allowance. The autumn bonus double payment was included for some benefits but not illness benefit. Why not? I do not see why it should not be included. People are off work as a result of illness. Just because it is short term does not mean they are any less affected by the cost-of-living crisis, winter costs and so on. Unless the Minister will say otherwise, I assume all the people who do not receive the double payment will also not get the double payment at Christmas. They should get the double payment at Christmas because they need it just as much as everyone else. Those are my points, which I hope the Minister will address. They are anomalies, which is a nice word for them. They are injustices. On the wider issue, the Government has to do a lot more. On the question of how we pay for all this, one way would be through employer PRSI contributions. In our budget, which was costed by the Department of Social Protection, People Before Profit suggested a new PRSI rate of 19.75% to be paid by employers for employees who are paid more than €90,000 per year. It would pertain to a relatively small cohort, for whom they would have an increased PRSI contribution and would raise €866 million in one year. We have some of the lowest employer PRSI rates in Europe. If we were to slightly increase the 11.5% rate to 13.05%, we would raise €1.5 billion, a calculation that was costed by the Minister's Department. If a relatively small increase were made to the lower rate of employer PRSI and to the higher rate of employer PRSI for the highest earners, we could raise €2.3 billion. That would go a long way to redistributing some of the wealth in this country to alleviate poverty and energy poverty in particular. The Minister will be aware of a study that suggests the average additional costs can be between €9,000 and €12,000 per year for those with a disability. Where in the Bill is the premium, on an ongoing basis, for people with disabilities to compensate them for the €9,000 to €12,000 additional cost they incur? We should do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:
“Reports
2. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the cost to the exchequer of abolishing the USC and replacing it with a High Income Social Charge of 10 per cent on all earnings over €90,000.”.This amendment asks the Dáil to look at the cost of abolishing the universal social charge, USC, and replacing it with a higher income social charge of 10% on all earnings over €90,000. I will also make reference to amendment No. 3 in my comments. The argument is very simple. We discussed it on Committee Stage but it is still important. I would not underestimate the sense of grievance working people still feel over the imposition of the USC. The Minister knows, but it is worth recalling, that working people in this country took an unprecedented hit for a financial and economic crisis that was not their fault. They had played no hand, act or part in creating it. It was a crisis entirely the responsibility of gambling bankers, gambling property developers and speculators and successive Governments that facilitated a sort of gold rush when it came to making money from property. That had dire consequences for this country and, it is worth saying, globally. That is not just a sort of history lesson because we are on so many different levels still dealing with the consequences of that, both in this country and internationally. The lesson has not been learned about the folly of turning to speculation on property for profit. It is still going on. It is still at the back of our current housing disaster and it crashed the entire global economy. It seems very few lessons were learned. The point with this amendment is it was working people who took the hit. One of the most egregious hits taken, which people are still suffering, was the imposition of the USC, which resulted in a dramatic increase in the tax burden on ordinary workers. I do not have the figures directly to hand but I think I am roughly correct in saying that prior to the USC, workers were in total paying about €23 billion between them in tax. That jumped to well over €30 billion as a result of the USC and the various austerity measures taken. It is worth pondering those sorts of figures. That was a dramatic increase in the burden of tax imposed on working people. This year, in what is being considered a bumper year for corporation tax receipts, all the corporations in this country will yield €20 billion in corporation tax receipts. The gross profits being recorded by those companies, in the latest available figures, were €193 billion, which is far in excess of what the total aggregate earnings of PAYE workers are. On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister if he had estimates of what corporate profits were for 2022 given that he was able to project a possible €21 billion coming in via corporation tax receipts. Looking at the pattern of all the previous years, that would suggest there was an enormous jump in corporate profits in 2021 or 2022, or both, to allow us to get from a figure of €11 billion being paid in corporation tax in 2020 up to the currently projected €21 billion. Maybe the Minister could enlighten us on that. Either way, the net point is that all the workers in this country combined earn less in gross income than all the corporations earn in gross profits but the workers pay much more tax.That is fundamentally unfair. A major contributory factor to that unfairness and inequality in who earns the most and pays the most is the universal social charge. That worsened an already iniquitous situation. Although the Government has made some adjustments to the universal social charge over the intervening years, it is still a very significant burden in people's pay cheques every week or month. It should be got rid of and we believe it could be paid for by first introducing the high earner income social charge I mentioned. Before the Minister says the charge we are proposing would not cover the full cost of abolishing the universal social charge, I will just say, as I said on Committee Stage and as we have made clear, that it is not the only measure we would take. We would also introduce new bands of income tax for the highest earners. There would be four bands for those earning in excess of €100,000. Between those two measures, we would cover the cost of abolishing the USC. That is not to mention the many other measures we proposed in our alternative budget, which I have here in front of me and which the Minister acknowledged he does actually read. Fair play to him. It sets out a number of other additional tax measures that would be taken to cover the cost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will tell Deputy Durkan what I do not understand. All of the people in various categories who earn in excess of €100,000, such as Ministers, executives of companies, upper management in companies, bankers, consultant doctors and barristers - I am sure we could think of others - do valuable work. However, is their work more valuable than a nurse's work? Should their work be better remunerated than a nurse' work? Should their work be better remunerated than a teacher's work? Should their work be better remunerated than a bus driver's work? According to the World Health Organisation, the second most stressful job anyone can possibly do is to be a bus driver. They are more likely to suffer from heart attacks than bankers, although we often have this image of the stressed-out banker or chief executive who is worried sick and is likely to drop dead of a heart attack. Actually, it is far more likely for that to happen to a bus driver.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Good point, and they should possibly pay an extra levy just for that. That is certainly the logic of our proposals to redress the balance in terms of net earnings ultimately, which is what we are trying to do through a myriad of means. I would say in response to the Minister's direct response to our proposal that in order to cover the cost of abolishing the USC, which he promised he would get rid of and he reneged on that promise - it was an austerity tax and he promised to get rid of it - as well as introducing the higher income social charge, we are also proposing to introduce additional bands of taxation for the highest earners. That would cover the cost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 15, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:
“Renters Tax Credit
12. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil on whether a regime of rent controls would be a more effective way to support renters than a renters tax credit.”.To move things along, I did not intervene in the previous discussion but, in a way, we are covering similar territory here. In this amendment, we suggest that rather than introducing a renter's tax credit of €500, the Minister would look at whether it would be more effective to deal with the crisis of unaffordable rents by examining a serious system of rent controls that seek to make rents affordable. It is self-evident that a €500 tax credit, which only some renters will be able to get, is just piddling. It is a fairly pathetic drop in the ocean compared to the situation renters face.  In the past year, rents in Dublin have gone from an average of €2,000 per month to €2,200 per month. That is an increase of €200 per month or €2,400 per year. In my area of Dún Laoghaire, average rents last year were €2,200. They are now €2,400 and rising. Against that background, to offer people a €500 tax credit is worse than a joke because those rents are utterly unsustainable. On average, €24,000 in after-tax income was required last year to pay the average rent and the figure is now up to €26,000.This is just insanity. It is not sustainable. The €500 tax credit just goes straight into the pockets of landlords and does not leave renters in any better position whatsoever.  As I did on Committee Stage, I wish to humanise this issue. I had several people in here today for Leaders' Questions from Tathony House, Rathmines Road and St. Helen's Court, all of whom are facing mass evictions from multi-unit complexes at the hands of landlords. There were also individuals facing eviction. All of them are in this dire situation. All of them are working families, people with jobs, but they just cannot afford this. They are in a hopeless situation because they are being evicted on the grounds of sale, which the Minister allows. They cannot afford these rents. I am talking here about people who have reasonable jobs. I will give one example, that of a couple, Jacqueline and her husband. He works for the ESB. They are being evicted from the house they have lived in for 55 years by the landlord on grounds of sale. She, her husband and her two children are absolutely terrified because there is nothing for them. Their earnings are just enough to place them above the income threshold in this regard, and even the new increased income thresholds, I think. Given their age, they went to the bank and asked if there was any chance they could borrow and get a mortgage to buy their house, now it was for sale. There was no chance. Jacqueline and her husband are in their mid-to-late 50s, so the bank would only give them a mortgage for seven years. Purchasing the house, therefore, was not a runner. Equally, they could not possibly afford to pay €1,200 or €1300 a month in rent. What are they to do? Seriously. Jacqueline was crying in the Gallery today. She was crying at the protest, along with her daughters. They are terrified. What are they to do? If the Minister can give me an answer, I will be happy. I will be happy if I can give an answer to Jacqueline, and to the other families, as to what they are to do to avoid ending up - and this is the vision Jacqueline has - of sitting in a car, along with the family, on the side of the road at Christmas because there is nowhere to go. Jacqueline is not even entitled to emergency accommodation if she is made homeless because her income is above the threshold. What do we do? One thing we could do would be to reduce rents and bring them down to affordable levels. What was the point in having, even if the supply of housing is increased, as the Minister often says, places being rented out at these prices? All the housing being built now is going to be rented out at these rents. What is the point of building stuff like this? Who can afford it? Nobody can. The only people who will be able to afford this housing, to buy it, will be the vulture and investment funds that will come in and charge these levels of rent. These are the only parties who can afford to buy the places being built, or very rich people. I am, therefore, genuinely asking the Minister, if he does not agree with or think our solution is viable, which is to bring in rent controls and ensure nobody has to pay more than 25% of their income in rent, to please tell me what people in a situation like the one I described are supposed to do. There are no answers to this question now. There is not even the prospect of there being answers being offered by the Government to these sorts of dilemmas. If I am missing something, then I ask the Minister to let me know what it is and I will relay this information to the people terrified they are going to be on the street because they cannot afford these rents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not surprisingly, the Minister is not able to answer the question as to what I say to Jacqueline, Richard and their two children who are facing homelessness because they are being evicted by their landlord on the grounds of sale, which the Government allows. In the middle of a housing emergency, which the Minister does not want to acknowledge, he is allowing evictions. What do I say to them? Where do they go? They cannot afford average rents of €2,400 per month. They would be lucky to find somewhere at that cost in Dún Laoghaire. This amounts to €28,000 a year just for rent before paying for anything else and after tax. This is what people need to find somewhere. Where do they go? I have cited only this case but it is true of the 35 families in Tathony House and the 25 families affected in Rathmines. It is also true of Stella who was in with us today and several thousand more people. The Government acknowledged that deferment of notice to quit, which, by the way, does not help Jacqueline because she had received the notice to quit prior to its introduction and could potentially be evicted before Christmas, means evictions will come in a flood afterwards. Families will have nowhere to go. We will then pay €200 million to accommodate them in substandard emergency accommodation. The State will pay for this anyway except the people, children and families affected will have to go through the misery, trauma, hardship and hurt of going into emergency accommodation or being on the side of the street. Eventually we will have to give them an answer but at present the Government is saying it does not have an answer. Give us an answer. Our answer is to control the rents and stop the evictions now. Even if the Minister will not do it, in the long term he should intervene to stop people being made homeless by making rents affordable and stopping people being evicted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is correct. It is just not good enough for the people. Believe me, we are engaging with the local authority. Sometimes that helps us get solutions, but more often than not, it does not. So many people are falling through the cracks and that number is growing all the time. It is just not good enough. I am not going to describe motives or anything else, but I do think there is politics involved. The Government is labouring under the illusion that at some point, if the supply of public and private houses reaches a certain level, rents or house prices will go down. That is not going to happen unless there is a crash. That is the only way that will happen. Does the Minister honestly believe the private sector will let prices go down? It will stop building before it does that. The private sector will not let rents or house prices go down. If the Government is labouring under that illusion, it is a mistaken illusion that will not happen. The public sector has to ramp up, on a massive scale, the direct provision of public and social housing. By the way, I supported all those projects and never opposed one of them. What I do oppose is the wasting of human labour building properties that no one can afford. We were 100% behind the Cherrywood development, which could have solved the entire south Dublin housing problem. We tried to fight for more social and affordable housing. The problem is, even though that one development could solve the entire south Dublin housing crisis, it will not because all of it will be unaffordable. We were campaigning for 15 years for the development in Shanganagh, where we only got the sod turned this week. Meanwhile, there are fellas building co-living apartments for rent at €1,300 a month, in which you would not put a dog. They were built and that is the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister about the projections for corporate pre-tax gross profits. I just found the note in that regard. To be honest, it is unbelievable. Deputy Barry just estimated what it might be, but it is way in excess of that. This is newsworthy. I do not know if the Minister has put this information out there, but Janey Mac. The Minister is estimating that gross pre-tax corporate profits for 2022 were €348 billion. That is astonishing. To put that in perspective, the figure for 2020, which is the most recent available and to which Deputy Barry just referred, is €193 billion. There has been a jump in profits of more than €150 billion in two years. From 2012 to 2020, there was a jump from €74 billion to €193 billion. Those are the figures on which I was working in the context of our pre-budget submission. That is a 157% increase in profits in eight years. Now it has taken another jump. I have not done the percentage calculation, but it has jumped another €150 billion in two years. That is unbelievable. We have seen a bonanza in corporate profitability like never before and that has accelerated at an extraordinary rate in the past two years. We should bear in mind that in those two years, ordinary working people were crushed by cost-of-living increases and lost between €4,000 and €6,000 in the value of their income in real terms.This is because of corporations, including energy and pharmaceutical corporations, all the big IT companies and so on - we could go through the list - are jacking up prices to reach these simply dizzying levels of profitability. Deputy Barry slightly understated the degree of tax relief these corporations are getting. In 2020, on €193 billion in pre-tax profits, €11 billion was paid in tax, which is a rate of 6.1%. It is not 8%, 10% or 12.5% but 6.1%. I have not worked out the percentage for the new figures the Minister has just given us but if he is projecting that he will get €21 billion in tax, and is estimating that on the basis of pre-tax profits of €348 billion, if these corporations paid 12.5%, never mind 15%, 20% or 25%, they would pay €40.8 billion in tax. We can more or less work it out; they are paying between 5% and 6% tax on their pre-tax profits. That is what they are actually paying. That is shocking and shameful. We could almost double corporate tax revenue if we just made them pay an effective minimum rate of 12.5%. In my opinion, the rate should go right up. These companies should at least pay the level of taxation the average worker is expected to pay on his or her income, but could we not even just make them pay the 12.5%? An extra €20 billion would then be available. When we consider what that could do for the housing crisis, the resourcing and staffing of our health service, public transport, higher education, wages for workers, all the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, and the cost of housing it is, quite frankly, staggering. This is never really talked about and, as Deputy Barry indicated, the Government's only argument against it is that if it raised the level of taxation, these companies would all run away. The Minister may have noticed they are starting to run away anyway when it comes to jobs, which has nothing to do with the tax measures taken by the Government and everything to do with international events that have nothing to do with our tax policy. It has to do with the fact that these corporations have disproportionate wealth that could be called profit driven and egotistical. I probably should not use some of the adjectives I could use to describe people like Elon Musk and so on but what happens when that much profit and control of the global economy is given to one individual, or wealthy multibillionaires, is that we eventually see the sort of jobs massacre we are seeing anyway. Surely, the thing to do is make these companies pay their taxes now, while the going is good, in order to give us the revenues we need to invest in housing, health and key infrastructure rather than continuing to give them massive tax breaks, deductions, reliefs, tax credits and so on, where they pay a fraction of the tax ordinary workers pay. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, I am fully aware the figure is not the taxable profit. Indeed it is precisely the point I make year after year. There are gross profits and then there is a myriad of tax reliefs, deductions and allowances that write down the taxable profit. That is the problem. Workers get a few tax credits but they do not see the level of write-down in what is taxable in their income that these corporations get. The figure for 2020 pre-tax profits was €193 billion. The taxable income after all the loopholes was €110 billion. This is a massive write-down of what was taxable. Workers do not get anything like that in terms of the deductions and allowances that are available to them. The effective rate is about 6.1%, so it is very important to look at what the gross pre-tax profits are. We can then get a sense of what these companies are earning, which is astronomical. It is now up to, and this is a newsflash, €348 billion projected. You project for next year and it will be up to €383 billion, but the Minister estimates that, this year, they will only pay €21 billion in tax when a 12.5% tax on that would give us €40 billion. Even if you allow for a few legitimate allowances, it would be very considerably higher than the €21 billion. Given how precarious these companies have now shown themselves to be, surely now is the time to get in and get what we can off them from a tax point of view to invest in developing industry and jobs that will actually be sustainable in the long term.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 17:In page 65, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:
“Wealth Taxes
24.	Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil on the amount of revenue that would be raised if he were to establish a Wealth Tax that taxed the top 5 per cent of households 2 per cent of their accumulated wealth less 1 million for a family home.”.We debated this on Committee Stage. I will leave it at that. I am keen to get to some amendments further down the line.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 21:In page 85, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:
“Reports
30.	Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil on intra-group transfers and whether reliefs on such transfers are being used as a means to shift profits and reduce taxable income.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 27:In page 101, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:
“Reports
40.	Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on amending the guidelines in relation to section 481 (Film Tax Relief), to clearly define the requirement for producer companies in receipt of the relief to be the legally responsible employer for all those working on film productions funded by the relief as against the DAC which only has a temporary existence; and further to guarantee the full vindication of workers rights under the Production of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; and further ensure genuinely equitable remuneration or performers and actors in relation to their intellectual property rights and full compliance with the EU copyright directive.”.We discussed this at considerable length on Committee Stage but I would like to give it one last airing. This relates to the section 481 film tax relief. I will read the amendment into the record so that it is clear what we are trying to do here. It states that within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on amending the guidelines in relation to section 481 film tax relief, to clearly define the requirement for producer companies in receipt of the relief to be the legally responsible employer for all those working on film productions funded by the relief as against the DAC, that is, the designated activity company ,which only has a temporary existence; and further to guarantee the full vindication of workers rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; and further ensure genuinely equitable remuneration for performers and actors in relation to their intellectual property rights and full compliance with the EU copyright directive.Why would I want that? It is critical that if we are giving out €100 million in State aid to the arts, in this case, specifically to the film industry, it is in compliance, not only with national law but also with European directives. I say that, and always predicate everything I say, as somebody who wants to see that much money and more go into Irish film and into arts and culture. I was one of the few people who noted that the arts and culture budget was cut marginally this year and condemned that fact. We need to put more money into arts and culture because we have an absolutely fantastic pool of creative people in this country. We have a tremendous tradition and reputation in all of the arts; poetry, music, theatre, dance, acting, film etc. I want to see more but I am deeply concerned that we are not vindicating the rights of stage crew and film crew who work in the Irish film industry, particularly in the live-action area of Irish film, or the performers, the writers, the actors and the dancers, and in failing to do so, we are not complying with the requirement to ensure that their rights are upheld and that certain things are achieved when one gives State aid to the film industry. I appreciate that the Minister has agreed, following our lengthy discussion, to have some of his officials meet some of the so-called contrarians, that is, the people who are critical of the way the current structure of section 481 relief is operating and I genuinely appreciate that. I ask the Minister to understand that it is very serious if we are required to comply with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and for the film producers who receive section 481 relief to tell us and the Minister that such compliance is impossible. I looked back at the transcripts of both what Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, stated at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, what has been alleged by groups such as the Irish Film Workers Association and what, in effect, was accepted by the Minister. On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that maybe we can sort these things out through discussion and negotiation. I thought maybe we could and then I thought, no actually while discussions are welcome, there is nothing to be discussed when it comes to compliance with the law. I want the Minister to consider that and make me a commitment if a serious allegation is being made that the recipients of section 481 relief are not in compliance with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. They have stated they cannot be because of the DAC structure and that it is not possible for somebody to acquire a contract of indefinite duration through the operation of law under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. That is what they have said because the DAC does not survive, project to project, longer than 18 months. The Minister echoed what they are telling him, that it is not possible, but it has to be possible because it is in EU law and it is in the declaration they sign. There is something very seriously problematic if one is saying the most fundamental protection for people on fixed-term contracts is not possible. I am looking in front of me - I have not time to quote them - at two cases that have gone to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. One person had 57 fixed-term contracts and has never got a contract of indefinite duration even though under the fixed-term workers directive and the law, that person is required to. Another had 26 such contracts. This is because the people the Minister gives the money to go into the Labour Court and state they could have no employment relationship with these people even though they set up the DAC for the film on which they were employed, in some cases, 26 times, 57 times or whatever it might be over decades. The whole point of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 is to protect workers in that situation. If it cannot apply, there is a serious problem with the form of state aid we are giving, which is specifically designed to create an industry and to create, as the directive states, a permanent pool of skills. In 30 seconds, I have not time to mention the performers other than to say they state their intellectual property is essentially being taken off them with buy-out contracts, which the copyright directive requires to be the exception, not the rule.This is what the copyright directive requires. Yet in Irish contracts given by the producers to whom the Minister gives section 481 tax relief, performers and actors are required to sign away their intellectual property rights, which, under the copyright directive, they are not allowed to do. I ask the Minister to respond. If there is any uncertainty about these matters, I genuinely ask that he write to the European Commission and ask for clarification.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 481 relief is state aid. Therefore, it has to comply with EU directives in this area. People cannot negotiate away their rights. They cannot do that. They are not allowed to do it. I want the Minister to understand the point I am making. People cannot negotiate away their rights. No group that claims to represent the industry can negotiate away their rights. I will send the Minister some of the correspondence from Equity, the Film Workers Association and the writer I quoted briefly who made the same point. They say that the law is not being complied with. This is not an allegation. The Minister has to investigate if there is even a possibility of it being true that either the law or the EU directive regarding state aid are not being complied with. The point about the DAC is that everything survives the DAC except the employment relationship. This is the only thing that does not survive. This is the evidence we have from the producers. It is not an allegation; they have admitted it. They state no employment relationship can survive the DAC. The fixed-term workers' directive and the Act require that the employment relationship goes beyond the DAC.That is the point of it. It is to protect people who are in episodic employment relationships. The other thing that survives the DAC is intellectual property, but it accrues to the producer company and not to the people who own it. That is a breach of the copyright directive. One cannot finance a structure that is being used to break the law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is complicated and it takes a while to get your head around it. The CEO of Screen Producers Ireland, who struck the agreement referred to by the Minister, gave evidence to the WRC in a case taken by a film crew worker that there was no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment could be said to have existed between the parties involved. This was on the basis of what she said were the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in the sector, including the operation of section 481 relief. Does the Minister understand what she is saying? She is saying there cannot be a relationship between the film producer company and the worker who works on the film because of the structure of section 481. That is what she said, and the Government is giving these people money. She said that her members cannot have employees because of the way the industry is structured. That is her saying it, yet at the same time, the Government continues to give them the money for quality employment and training purposes, and it takes them seriously when they say they are striking a balance between employers and employees while they say they cannot have employees. Does the Minister not understand what is being said to him?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying it is the structure of the relief. I am asking the Minister to go to Europe and ask for an adjudication on this. That is a reasonable thing to ask, is it not? How is that not a reasonable thing to ask, seriously, if there is question mark? Have we not been down this road before with compliance or non-compliance with EU directives, where people had to go all the way to flipping European courts to get adjudications?
