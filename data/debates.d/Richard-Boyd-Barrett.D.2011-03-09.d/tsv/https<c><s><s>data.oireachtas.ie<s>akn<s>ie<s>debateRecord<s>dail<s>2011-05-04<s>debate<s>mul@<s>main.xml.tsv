RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is outrageous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following publication of the McCarthy report, the Taoiseach indicated in response to questions put to him in this House that he would be open to a debate on it.  Those of us who believe it is a plan to asset strip the country to pay back the IMF and the bankers would like to know when a debate will take place on the McCarthy report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A number of parents of children with special needs are in the Gallery today.  Can the Minister give them any hope?  Some of their children have very severe special needs requirements.  One child, Aisling McEniff's five-year-old son, is unique in the world.  He has been in intensive care eight times and has had two heart operations.  He has Down's syndrome and——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has been approved for a special education place but because there is no sanction for another SNA, her child cannot get into school.  Can the Minister offer them any hope or is he telling them there is no hope because we have to pay off the IMF?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are needed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister wrote to schools in March and instructed them to stop allocating resource hours to pupils on foot of the review of the numbers employed in the area of education which was demanded by the IMF.  This means that children who have been lucky enough to receive assessments from NEPS and who are obliged to wait months for such assessments will not now get what they are due.  The stress that parents and children undergo while awaiting assessments and in dealing with the results thereof will be further exacerbated by the Minister withdrawing children's rights to resource hours.The Minister stated that it is child abuse not to read to children.  Is it not even worse abuse to deny some of the most vulnerable and needy children in society the educational resources they require?  It is estimated that approximately 400 additional resource teacher posts will be needed by the end of the year and that 300 of these could go unapproved at a cost of approximately €13.5 million per year.  I understand the Minister has recently been made aware that the costs associated with dealing with parents who are fighting legal cases relating to their children's entitlements amount to €14.5 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it not make more sense to give these children the resources they require?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not making a cheap political point but given that we are discussing the issue that will dictate and dominate our economic future for many years into the future I am amazed that so few Members have bothered to attend this debate.  The emphasis put by the Government parties in advance of the election was on how this was such a bad deal for Ireland and a bad deal for Europe, that it had to be renegotiated, that it was economic treason and would all be reviewed.  We are here discussing the review of that deal, yet hardly anybody bothers to attend.  I find that extraordinary.  That is not a cheap political point.  I understand that people cannot be here all the time because they cannot follow every Minister but I find it extraordinary that a significant number of Members did not bother to turn up to discuss a document that will dictate our future for years.Perhaps the reason so few Members have bothered to attend this debate is because nothing has changed.  The Minister said the EU-IMF programme was a bad deal for Ireland and for Europe and had to be renegotiated, that it was economic treason and that he would do something about it but nobody has turned up for this debate because it is clear that nothing has been done about it.  Nothing has changed.  The position is exactly as it was when the dirty deed was done by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister has agreed to carry on with the dirty deed of essentially selling this country down the river to pay off the bankers and bondholders who caused the economic crisis in the first place.Is it not the case that this unrevised and barely tweaked EU-IMF deal is nothing other than a cold-blooded decision by the European Central Bank and the big states in Europe to protect the bankers and bondholders who caused the crisis and whose greed and lending to the property sector here caused the property bubble and the economic crash, and to make ordinary working people pay with brutal austerity and cutbacks for that crisis?  This is not just a programme to make ordinary people pay for the crimes of bankers.  It is worse than that.  It is a programme to take advantage of the crisis and do things that these same bankers, bondholders and corporate elites would not have got away with previously.  They now believe, in the atmosphere of crisis, they can get away with it because hidden behind the innocuous "techno-babble" in the memorandum of understanding is a programme for the asset stripping of this country and even more brutal and savage attacks on ordinary people in the interests of the very same corporate elites and golden circles who caused the crisis in the first place.The reality behind words like "fiscal consolidation" is continued bank bailouts, savage cuts, home taxes, water taxes, and increased taxes on the low paid.  When the Minister refers to "labour market restructuring" what he actually means is to savage the pay of low paid workers and smash up sectoral agreements that have protected those workers who are the lowest paid in the country.  We can expect vicious attacks on their already beleaguered incomes.  What is actually meant by "structural reforms" is privatisation and the asset stripping of the public assets of this country and the State companies that could be the engine of economic rejuvenation, employment growth and so on.  The reality behind language like "structural fiscal reforms" is about making ordinary people work longer for less in order to pay off the bankers.  One of my favourites phrases is "social welfare reform and labour activation measures", which means to slash social welfare and then hound people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own but are unemployed because of the crisis created by others.The appalling human cost of all of that was on show in this Chamber earlier when we were discussing education during Question Time.  Parents of special needs children, some of the most vulnerable and innocent people in our society, were in the Visitors Gallery pleading with the Minister to take away the cap being demanded on special needs and education posts to ensure their vulnerable children could be provided with an education.  Yet we were told by the Minister that it cannot be done because of the dictates of the IMF and EU.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The crisis was caused by bankers and the deficit problem was caused by the fact that we lowered taxes on the rich in this country to unsustainable levels.  The answer, therefore, is to make the bankers pay for the crisis they caused and to put taxes on the wealthy rather than the vulnerable and working people in this country.  It can be done if there was a will to do it but there is no will on the part of this Government and therefore we are stuck with this austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not these Independents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a completely different group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was nothing to do with us.  We were calling for nationalisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us have such a debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Government gave us the time we would do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The essential and big question everybody in the country is asking is, "Where is the bailout for the people?"  There is a bailout for the bankers to the tune of over €100 billion but ordinary people who sought to do nothing more than put a roof over their heads — an entirely legitimate aspiration — are threatened with losing their homes and battered with unsustainable interest payments on inflated mortgages.  The mortgages were inflated because of the reckless lending of the bankers and the reckless greed driven policies of Fianna Fáil, the EU authorities which did nothing to address what the bankers were doing, the developers, etc.As with every problem we are facing, it is not those who are guilty and caused the crisis who are being asked to pay but those who are innocent, had nothing to do with causing it, cannot afford to pay and struggling to make ends meet.  There is no bailout for them, nor is there a State guarantee or guaranteed protection, yet there are guarantees, bailouts and State protections to the nth degree for the bankers and institutions which caused the crisis.  They stoked and pumped up the unsustainable bubble for no reason other than greed.  If one is greedy, one's greed is insatiable and one is willing to do the most reckless things, one will be bailed out and protected.  If, however, one is somebody who just wants to put a roof over one's head, tough luck.  All the State will do is ask the institutions which caused the crisis to offer some forbearance and, at best, a little breathing space.  However, as Deputy John Halligan stated, the banks actually keep threatening people and putting the pressure on them.I am sorry the Minister is not present.  The essence of this issue is summed up in the Orwellian doublethink of the Minister's speech thereon: "A key objective for the Government is to strengthen overall fiscal sustainability [of the State] by separating bank risk from sovereign risk."  We are doing the exact opposite.  The Government is welding the private gambling debts of the banks onto the backs of citizens of the State.  It is what the last Government did and the Government is stating it will continue to do.  As a consequence, people will lose their homes and are being screwed to the walls with debts they cannot afford to pay through no fault of their own.  The Government will not issue the same guarantee it is giving to the banks to ordinary people who are fighting to keep a roof over their heads and make ends meet.  In the process, the Government is crippling the economy because even those who can just about meet their mortgage repayments have no spending power left to fuel economic growth and meet the required domestic demand.What is the alternative?  The Government states there is none.  The first alternative is to determine the principles that will guide our actions.  The principle that must guide our actions is that the people, the innocent, should come first.  Their right to a home should come before the right of the banks to be recapitalised, make profit and protect themselves, given that it is the banks which caused the problem.  Let us not forget that those who are being threatened with having their homes taken from them and cannot meet interest repayments are the very people who have bailed out the banks.  This is because of levies and pay cuts.  The least we can ask for, given all the money that has been put into the banks and that the people now constitute the majority shareholder in the banks, is that the banks do not take people's homes from them and write down debts to levels that reflect the real values of properties during the bubble that was stoked up by the bankers and developers.  In this way, debts could become sustainable and people could pay back their loans.  Ultimately, it would save money for the State.It is a loss-making exercise for banks to have to foreclose on loans and sell off homes at rock bottom prices, as they are doing.  It is madness.  Will the Government, please, do something about this and bring to an end the circumstances where it only bails out banks rather than ordinary people?
