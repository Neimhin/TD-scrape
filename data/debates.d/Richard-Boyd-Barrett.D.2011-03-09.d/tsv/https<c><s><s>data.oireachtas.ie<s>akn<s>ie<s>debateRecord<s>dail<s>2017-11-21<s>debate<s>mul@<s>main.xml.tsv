RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the same issue, as a member of the Business Committee, I noted that when I and others agreed the Order of Business last week, we were not to know the Taoiseach would be forced to admit he had misled this House or given false information to it on what the Tánaiste knew and when she knew it regarding what was, let us remember, an absolutely scurrilous campaign to try to destroy Mr. Maurice McCabe, a brave man who was trying to blow the whistle on wrongdoing in the Garda. We have not got a clear commitment on whether the Tánaiste will answer questions on these most serious matters. We have to have that commitment. We cannot proceed with the Order of Business, as it stands, unless we get a commitment that the Tánaiste will answer those most serious questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is absolutely no point in accepting a proposal for the Business Committee to meet again unless we get a commitment from the Government here and now that at the meeting it will facilitate a debate, statements and responses from the Tánaiste on the matters surrounding this issue. As to the legal impediments, I am sure that if we agree this week - it has to be this week, ideally today or tomorrow - that such statements are made and that questions and answers will be had, I am sure it is within the ken of the Government and the Opposition to know what they can and cannot say that might infringe on the legal issues being dealt with at the tribunal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government states "Our approach to governing will be clearly seen in how we address the issues of housing and homelessness." Given that was stated as a priority and a key indicator of what the Government is like, what are we to make the series of statements coming from the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy English, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, Conor Skehan of the Housing Agency and Eileen Gleeson of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive? Quite frankly, they were scandalous and insulting statements which have tried to normalise, minimise or downplay the scale of the housing and homelessness emergency, or even worse, in the case of Eileen Gleeson, blame the homeless themselves. Her shocking comments referred to homelessness being a result of "years of bad behaviour" and chaotic lifestyle". The Minister of State, Deputy English, suggested that those who talk too much about housing and homelessness are doing damage to our reputation. In so far as the Government has power over these agencies, is it going to repudiate these kind of comments? It should denounce them for what they are, namely, shameful attempts to cover up, downplay or normalise the housing crisis. Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that as the housing analyst Mel Reynolds has suggested, the real problem is the refusal of the Government to build council housing on the thousands of hectares of publicly owned land? There is an aversion to building council houses. The Government is playing with figures to try to suggest more houses are being built than is actually the case. The evidence shows that what is actually happening is the Government is refusing to use public land to build council housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true but the Government is not building on its land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That does not get the Government off the hook for not building council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are more reasons than I can think of to withdraw the invitation to Donald Trump to this country. The Taoiseach's standard response when we ask him about this is to say our relationship with the American people is more important than that with any individual president. I do not want to hear that again because it is dodging the issue of Donald Trump, his policies and what he is doing. Is there any line over which he crosses that will make the Taoiseach say that is too much for us, that we must speak out and that it is not appropriate to invite somebody who supports or allows these kinds of policies? I will mention two: in Yemen, as we speak, a country of 28 million people, 80% of the population now has no food security. Millions are teetering on the brink of starvation in one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times. There is a cholera outbreak, a diphtheria outbreak, no secure water supply because Saudi Arabia has blocked all ports, all aid shipments into the country and is literally starving the entire population. This is a policy that was promoted, supported and facilitated by Donald Trump when he visited there and signed a massive arms deal to arm that state. Is there a point at which we say that is not acceptable, we are going to speak out, we are not going to invite somebody to this country who is complicit with a genocidal policy in Yemen? Is there any red line this man crosses that will cause the Taoiseach to say that is enough, we are having nothing to do with him and we are certainly not inviting him to this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 8, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:“3. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the cost and implications of abolishing the Universal Social Charge for everyone earning less than €90,000 per annum.”.This amendment seeks a report on abolishing the universal social charge for everyone earning less than €90,000 annually. It is a policy which was in the Solidarity-People Before Profit pre-budget proposal. It is coupled with amendment No. 3 which we will discuss in a moment which is to pay for the abolition of the USC by imposing new tax bands on the highest incomes. There is often a debate over whether, as the Government suggested, there ought to be some reductions in the tax burden on those who earn low and middle incomes or more generally.Alternatively, although the Government sort of abandoned the policy, the debate is whether we should progressively move towards the abolition of the USC. Then there are those who say we should not do that but should spend whatever fiscal space is available on public services and infrastructure. Solidarity-People Before Profit rejects the false choice that we can either have money for public services and infrastructure or money to reduce the tax burden on hard-pressed working people. We think it is possible to do both. However, to do both, it is necessary to be honest with people, which is where the Government fails. When it is criticised about the small €5 a week tax reductions it is proposing in this budget over the need to spend in other areas, it is open to that criticism and that is because we are fighting over crumbs. That is what we have in the budget. Do we have crumbs of €5 a week in tax breaks for workers or do we have crumbs of additional expenditure in public services such as health, education and the arts? We would have characterised the budget as a budget of crumbs. There were a few crumbs for the workers and a few crumbs for public services. However, it did not address the low levels of pay and the high tax burden, whether direct or indirect, on ordinary workers. It did not in any real sense tackle the massive shortfall in investment in public services, particularly areas such as housing, which is a disastrous situation, and health. To do both justice, it is necessary to find other sources of revenue. That is the point to both of the reports referred to in amendments Nos. 2 and 3. It is to look for other sources of revenue. We have a series of other amendments seeking reports in other areas where we believe significant revenues could be raised. However, for the most part the Government does not want to talk about these revenues, which include taxing those on very high incomes of in excess of €100,000 a year. When we make such suggestions, the Government states that it is necessary to reward work and that it does not want to impose higher levels of tax on high earners because it disincentivises work. However, if we are to be concerned about punishing people for working, we should be more concerned about punishing those on low and middle incomes who have suffered pay cuts and the USC and feel disproportionately the impact of regressive indirect taxes, whether they are bin charges, hospital charges, parking charges or any other of the array of stealth taxes which reduce the real income of low and middle income people but mean nothing to high earners. A person on €150,000 a year is not bothered about paying bin charges, water charges, parking charges or increased public transport costs. For those on €25,000 to €45,000 a year, however, these charges really hurt and they hurt them disproportionately. The USC disproportionately hurts them and the pension levy hurts public sector workers as do the pay cuts they suffered during the austerity period. In proposing the abolition of the hated universal social charge for those earning less than €90,000, we believe it, and a hell of a lot more, can be paid for by imposing higher taxes on those on higher incomes as well as on wealth and profits and other sources of untapped revenue. That is the basic proposal and we think it is fair.  The concept of wealth distribution is missing in the economic debate; however, it needs to be debated. It was often spoken of in the 1960s and 1970s but it is now gone from political discourse. We end up fighting over things called fiscal space. As I said, we are arguing about the crumbs but we do not talk about the redistribution of wealth and using the tax system as the main mechanism to do it. The reason we should talk about it is that the inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth are growing all the time. That is what these two related proposals in amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are trying to address: the redistribution of wealth from the have-a-lots to the have-very-littles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand the Minister's confusion about the criticism of the tax reductions because different things are being said by different people in this House. To clarify, we did not criticise the Government at any point for proposing tax changes to low and middle earners. Sinn Féin and the Labour Party did, as did others, and they are entitled to do so. Our criticism was that those tax reductions were crumbs and we equally rejected the Hobson's choice of whether we have small tax reductions for workers or if we spend all the money on public services. We reject that choice. That is the point we are making, and we are unique in this House in making that point. It is not correct for the Labour Party to mischaracterise our position but I understand why it is doing it, namely because it stood over the USC, which is hated by working people and is one of the reasons-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But it is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt Deputy Burton.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party stood over the USC but working people hate the USC. We are not proposing that working people should not pay, as they do, the 20% tax on the first €30,000 or €40,000 of their income and then 40% over and above that but we are saying they should not pay the USC, which was an austerity tax. We are saying that getting rid of that for people earning less than €90,000 can be paid for by introducing new tax bands of 50%, 55%, 60% and 65% on earnings over €100,000 up to more than €250,000. I will not go through all the details of the bands. I remind Deputy Burton that those were the policies of the Labour Party in the 1960s and 1970s but they have abandoned them now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We hold on to those policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is not discussed anymore, which I mentioned in my initial contribution, is wealth and income redistribution. We can argue from budget to budget about marginal moves this way or that way and in so doing not see the wood for the trees. By that I mean a staggering growth in the gap between rich and poor and a staggering growth in the differential between the highest earners and the lowest earners. Anybody on the left should recognise that. It is not just we who are saying it; this is what people like Thomas Piketty have done forensic analysis of, and to be honest, the jury has come in on that debate. There has been spectacular growth in the gap between the rich and poor and that is accelerating every few years. That is going to continue unless one has a radical policy of income and wealth redistribution. When one asks whether the top 5% or 10% should pay a disproportionate amount of income tax, as we propose, I am pleased that the Minister at least understands it because some of our critics do not. That is exactly what we are proposing and unless that happens we will not close the gap that is widening all the time. If one goes back to the 1950s and 1960s, the highest earners might have earned seven or eight times that of the average earner but now the highest earners are earning 20, 30 and 40 times that of the average earner. The Minister has said the top 10% pay 40% of all the tax, which is the case, but they also have 40% of all the income, and rising, and they have 50% of all the wealth, and rising. We need a tax system that addresses such inequality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will move on to that later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 9, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“4. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the additional revenue that could be raised by introducing new tax bands for earnings over €100,000 as follows:(a) earnings between €100,000 and €140,000 - 50 per cent,(b) earnings between €140,000 and €180,000 - 55 per cent,(c) earnings between €180,000 and €250,000 - 60 per cent,(d) earnings over €250,000 - 65 per cent.”.I will be more brief this time because I have made most of the points. In response to the Minister's last point, the inequality in the distribution of income leads directly to the inequality in the distribution of wealth that Piketty has identified. In fact, all the studies of the two show as much. Once a person has higher income or surplus income over and above what he or she needs to pay the mortgage, survive and pay day-to-day costs, he or she can then begin to develop capital. The person can start to make money out of money. That is the problem with the system. Once a person reaches over a certain threshold of income, the surplus available can start to self-expand. One can invest in property, shares and all manner of things that allow one to start to make money for doing nothing. We imagine that is fair and legitimate. However, the problem is that when one person makes money, it does not come out of thin air. The person is taking it from someone else. If a person invests in property and is making money out of money because he or she has invested in property, who is losing out? It is the person who is paying the rent he or she cannot afford. That is how one thing leads to another. The inequality in the distribution of income leads to the inequality in the distribution of wealth. Unless that is addressed, we will continue to see the gap grow, and it is growing. The Minister says our social transfers somewhat ameliorate the inequality. It is true that the Irish social welfare system somewhat ameliorates the inequality of income and wealth distribution but it only slows the growth in the gap. It is not stopping the growth in the gap. It somewhat slows the gap compared with jurisdictions that have no social welfare system. Everywhere in the western world the gap is growing. It is growing all the time at an exponential and obscene rate. We need policies of radical redistribution using the tax system. I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that somehow this is an unsustainable narrowing of the tax base. The problem is that low and middle-income people are not only hit with the ordinary tax bands and the universal social charge, they are also hit disproportionately by myriad indirect taxes. People are now paying taxes for things that they used to get because they paid tax. Consequently, they are paying twice. We used to get our bins paid for because we paid our tax. Now, we pay €5, €10, €15, €20 or €25 per month. That is a new tax. The Minister can call it a charge if he wishes, but in reality for low and middle-income people that is a new tax. When a motorist has to pay God knows how much in parking charges every day to get to work, something he did not have to pay for previously, it is a tax. Public transport costs are rising constantly and public transport is seen as something that has to be commercially feasible and profitable rather than something that we need to make the economy and society function. In reality, the increases in public transport costs are hidden taxes. Moreover, they disproportionately hit the less well-off. We can go through the list of public service obligation taxes and so on, all of which disproportionately hit people on low and middle incomes. Of course we must look at the whole package in the whole. Anyway, these amendments propose to make a radical move in the direction of redistributing income. Anything less will simply see the continual increase in the gap between the haves and the have-nots that has reached obscene and unacceptable levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that. The Deputy should not make things up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have my comrades.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to clarify that while there is obvious disagreement on all this, it is on individual earners. It is not on the joint cumulative earnings of a couple. The Minister of State's assertion is not the case. Our big problem in this country is we do not have enough teachers and nurses and young people coming out of university who could be doing these jobs. I refer also to occupational therapists, speech and language therapists or construction workers. These are workers earning under €90,000. Were the USC to be abolished, all those people would be much more likely either to stay in this country or, if they are abroad, to come back. If the Minister of State states he is hearing about the entry point in to the tax system, he is talking to people who are very different to those to whom I am talking. Workers to whom I am talking have been talking about how much they hate the USC since it came in. They ask me to look at their pay cheque stating that is what was imposed on them because of the economic crash where they were made pick up the can for the bankers and all the rest of it. It is a huge chunk out of their earnings which has significantly added to the burden of ordinary workers and it is now an active disincentive for ordinary workers who we need to stay in this country or to come back from Britain, Canada or Australia. We propose to take that burden, which was imposed because of the economic crimes of bankers, off the backs of workers and to pay for it by increasing the tax rates for people once they start to earn over €100,000. Incidentally, for the information of the former Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in case there is any confusion, those between €90,000 and €100,000 will continue to pay USC. Once one earns more than €100,000 one would pay a higher tax rate, once one earns more than €140,000 one would pay a higher tax rate again, once over €180,000 one would pay a higher tax rate again, and once over €250,000, a higher rate again. To my mind, that is completely just. Frankly, nobody should be earning over €250,000 a year. It is obscene. I am not in the least worried about how those earning €250,000 or €180,000 will feel about this but I am extremely worried about the teachers, the nurses, the construction workers and the care workers we need in all sorts of areas of the economy leaving this country or being unwilling to come back when we need them desperately.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not care how they feel about these tax changes.
