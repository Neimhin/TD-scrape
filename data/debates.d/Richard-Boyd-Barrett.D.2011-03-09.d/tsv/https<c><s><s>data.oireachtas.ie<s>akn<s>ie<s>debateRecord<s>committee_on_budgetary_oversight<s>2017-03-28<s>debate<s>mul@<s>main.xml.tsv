RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with a lot of the points made on the need to significantly ramp up capital investment and the madness of the EU fiscal rules. Without wishing to score a point, we flagged this at the time of the fiscal treaty and opposed it for that reason. Did the CIF see this coming too?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our main reason was the effect it was going to have on our ability to spend, both in terms of capital and current spending. We described it with a catchphrase, "neoliberal straitjacket". Some of the people who are now rightly complaining supported this neoliberal straitjacket. We need to ramp up infrastructure investment in a whole range of areas. Are CIF members the best people to carry through an investment programme? I ask for a number of reasons, including cost overruns and public-private partnerships. There is a scandalous history of cost overruns in public-private partnerships. It is a history of projects being tendered at one price but consistently coming in well over the original estimate. The Luas cost much more than we were originally told it would cost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The port tunnel cost far in excess of what we were originally told. The controversial library headquarters in Dún Laoghaire ended up costing some €10 million more than we were originally told and the national children's hospital will go way over budget. How can we have confidence in CIF members when this consistently happens? That is what Joe Public is asking. The State puts a lot into PPPs in terms of land, infrastructure and upfront capital investment but, because of commercial sensitivity rules, we do not have transparency about the arrangements between the private and public sectors. When one asks questions the reply is that there is commercial sensitivity and I find this deeply problematic. One of the main reasons I am opposed to PPPs is that one cannot find out what is going on because of commercial sensitivity agreements so why should we go down that road? I am a left winger.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I make no bones about it. Is the profit builders take out not just an extra cost? It inflates the cost and it would be cheaper for the State to do these things directly, to build up its own capacity and deliver infrastructure directly. NERI has spoken of a semi-State company but we think a State company should deliver the housing we need. What happened between 2002 and 2008 is proof that this is the way we should go. In that period it was primarily the private sector which was given money and it was primarily the private sector which policy favoured to deliver infrastructure and housing but it did not work for us. It caused a massive problem and led to a crash. Even when the construction industry was delivering between 70,000 and 90,000 houses per year they were unaffordable and the housing crisis got worse. It has got doubly worse now but even in that earlier period housing lists grew and social and affordable housing was not delivered. There was a complete failure to connect supply and demand and I contend that it was because development at that time was profit-driven rather than need-driven.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I add a brief follow-up? I do not imagine, short of the socialist revolution or whatever, that we are going to completely get rid of private involvement in construction of infrastructure or housing. Can the construction industry seriously deliver the low-cost housing that is needed? I have many concerns about water infrastructure, energy infrastructure and so on but the most urgent question is the one of housing. Huge numbers of people are never going to be able to afford market prices, in my opinion. Look at what is happening in urban centres around the world. People on low to middle incomes cannot afford to live in these places. They have to go into the wilderness, which causes its own problems, to get something they might afford, if even that. Has the Construction Industry Federation any serious role to play in providing low-cost, social and affordable housing? I do not doubt they will play some role in providing housing for those on higher incomes who can afford it. It seems to me that affordable housing has to be subsidised. It has to be below market price. I do not really see how it is in the Construction Industry Federation's interests or that there is any likelihood that it will deliver that. If that is the case, I think we have to return to something that we used to do even when this country was quite poor, which was that the State directly built housing. It was up to 30% to 40% of housing at some points. It did it directly. It had people working in the local authorities who had the skills. I agree that there is a problem there with that skills base running down in local authorities and in the State generally. I think that is a problem. Do we not have to return to that? I have one other brief point and my friends in the building industry would be very unhappy if I did not raise it. A very controversial issue over recent years, as employment has been picking up, has been the push for people working in the construction industry to go onto the C45 scheme. Many workers have said that this is contractors forcing people to declare themselves as self-employed when they are not self-employed and should be employed directly by the builders. They have also suggested quite a wide level of abuse of the category of self-employment, given the high proportion of it. Do the representatives of the Construction Industry Federation have any comment on that? It is a sore point for construction workers.
