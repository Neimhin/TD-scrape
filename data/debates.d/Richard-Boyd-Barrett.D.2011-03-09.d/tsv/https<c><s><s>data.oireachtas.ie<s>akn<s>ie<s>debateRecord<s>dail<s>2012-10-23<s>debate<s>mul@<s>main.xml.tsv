RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have raised this issue on a number of occasions but I still cannot obtain a straight answer. The Minister of State is not answering the question that has been put to her. Why has NAMA only managed to identify 2,000 suitable units out of a possible 340,000 empty units? Those 2,000 units are not going to help reduce the numbers on the housing lists. Why is the Minister of State expanding a policy under which we will be leasing properties on a long-term basis from developers and NAMA rather than pursuing a social housing policy which would lead to the State accruing rental revenues and saving €580 million per year? What is being done makes no sense, particularly at a time when the Government has stated that it is seeking to make savings. It is crazy.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could build a great many houses if we used the €580 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am painfully aware of it.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister responsible for the environment, community and local government or for trying to get blood out of a stone? He will not be able to get €400 or €500 from the 1.8 million people who have less than €100 left after they pay their bills each month. Perhaps the Thornhill report might enlighten us on how this will be done. Will the Minister explain how those who are living on or below the poverty line will be able to pay €400, €500, €600 or €700 per annum? This is arithmetic that no one can work out and people are fearful the Minister will ask them to pay money they do not have.
