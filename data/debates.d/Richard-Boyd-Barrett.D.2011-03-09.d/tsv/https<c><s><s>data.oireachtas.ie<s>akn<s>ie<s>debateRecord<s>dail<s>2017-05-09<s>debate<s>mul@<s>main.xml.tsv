RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today we saw yet another damning piece of evidence, in the form of the daft.ie report, of the abysmal failure of the Government to deal with the spiralling rental, housing and homelessness crisis. The report shows that rents have jumped by a record 13% in the past year - €134 per month on average over the course of a year - guaranteeing to escalate that crisis and lead to more emergency situations, more evictions and more people in homeless accommodation. Typically, the Taoiseach or the Minister says that the Government inherited this, that it takes time to deal with the problem and that the Government is on it. I will cite a very concrete example of how decisions the Government made in the past six months have contributed directly to this shambles and the hardship that follows. Robin Hill, a development of apartments in Balally in Sandyford, was originally built by the McEvaddy brothers in 2008. The development, which consists of 52 apartments, went into NAMA at some point. For most of the time it has been in NAMA, at least 15 and possibly as many as half of the apartments have been empty while the housing crisis spirals out of control. In May 2016, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council asked whether it would purchase 15 of the vacant units. It was told that it could only buy the entire block. Shortly after the Project Eagle scandal broke in September, NAMA agreed the sale of Project Gem, which included these apartments, to the vulture fund Cerberus. The sale, which was one of the biggest sales of property in the history of the State, went through. Since then, Cerberus has moved to start evicting the tenants in a block that is still half empty. Of the 21 remaining tenants I have met, five are to be evicted in June. Others whom Cerberus feels it cannot evict straight away have been told they must pay an extra €250 per month in heating and hot water charges that were previously included in the rent. They were never charged for that previously. In other words, this is a back-door rent increase of about 20%. These empty units are sitting there while we have record numbers in homeless accommodation with evictions to follow. This would have been avoidable if NAMA had not sold this development to a vulture fund but had given it to the local authority as it requested and if the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government had ensured his Bill before Christmas included a provision to prevent new owners from evicting tenants when apartments are sold, as we warned would happen, or finding back-door ways to ratchet up rents. Is it not the truth that the crisis is avoidable and has resulted from the Government's policy failures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A fantasy figure has just appeared, namely, that the State has apparently purchased 40,000 houses. The more accurate truth is that NAMA has flogged off thousands of homes or, worse, as the Balally example indicates, has sat on empty properties in public ownership and when local authorities sought to purchase them, it refused and chose to sell them to a vulture fund instead. The vulture fund is now moving to evict people, bypass the Minister's totally inadequate legislation and ratchet up the rent on tenants it cannot immediately evict. I suspect, and the tenants fear, that they will be evicted in phases because under the Tyrrelstown amendment, no more than ten tenants may be evicted at one time, which is leading to landlords evicting tenants en bloc. That is almost certainly the case and the Taoiseach allowed it to happen by selling apartment blocks. How many more Balallys are there? How many more in Project Gem? How many more people will get eviction notices from vulture funds to which NAMA sold properties at a massive discount rather than give them to the local authorities. There are 50,000 empty properties in Dublin. The Balally situation indicates why there is a supply problem in spite of that. That is the real issue. It is not an absolute supply problem, it is a man-made one resulting from the behaviour of NAMA and the vulture funds, which are sitting on empty properties, evicting people to inflate property prices and rents and make more profit from the misery of those they evict or who cannot afford to rent such properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Taoiseach going to do for these people? He should enforce a compulsory purchase order on those apartments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach could start that process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The State was sitting on empty properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two dimensions to the scenario of Brexit and, more generally, the scenario opening up across Europe that I want to discuss. One is the political side and the narrative surrounding all this, and the second is the more direct economic and practical issues. It is very important in the first instance, particularly on the back of the recent French presidential election, that we challenge a certain narrative, which I noted Government spokespeople were quick to come out with in the aftermath of the election result, namely, that the victory for Macron was about the centre reasserting and re-establishing itself, with the direct implication that this is a good thing, as against, presumably, the "extremes", as the Government and the political establishment of Europe would like to present it. We need to challenge this narrative because it is very dangerous and dishonest. I will explain what I mean by this. The alternative to Europe presented by the people who ran, led and dominated the Brexit campaign and now, in the case of the Tory Government, Theresa May, is obnoxious and needs to be completely resisted. Whether it is the vile anti-immigrant sentiment that has been whipped up by the likes of UKIP and the Tory Party, scapegoating immigrants as somehow responsible for the economic and social problems in Britain, or Marine Le Pen doing likewise in France, this obnoxious, vile ideology must be resisted and challenged. About that we need to be quite clear. However, far from being somehow the bulwark against this, the centre, whether it be Macron, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, perhaps - I do not know whether Fianna Fáil is included in whatever is defined as the moderate centre - the European mainstream and the European centre, of which the Government is a part, are responsible for fuelling the growth of these dangerous and far-right forces. The disillusionment and disenfranchisement that people feel - for a range of reasons - with the European Union and the centre ground of European politics are precisely what has fuelled the growth of these dangerous far-right forces. If one considers the French election, this is very clear. There is complacency about the Macron victory. We all welcome the fact Marine Le Pen did not win, but it is very important to say that the majority of people voted against her, not for Macron. A poll carried out straight after the result shows 57% of people voted for Macron only because they wanted to stop Le Pen, not because they had any enthusiasm for Macron. Many people, even though they hated Le Pen, could not bring themselves to vote for Macron because they were afraid what an investment banker, which is what he is, would likely do to French people suffering from inequality, mass unemployment, high levels of poverty and so on. If, as is very likely, Macron continues, as he is pretty much explicitly stating, with a kind of neo-liberal offensive against the French welfare state - talking about cutbacks in public expenditure and so on - far from his acting as a bulwark against the further rise of Le Pen, his policies will lead directly to the further growth of support for her. It is a terrifying prospect that she could even have attracted the 33% or 34% share of the vote she obtained. It is worth reminding ourselves that Adolf Hitler only ever got 33% support in a free election and he still came to power with all the horrors that followed. Therefore, any complacency about the threat represented by the National Front, the far right and other racist forces would be very misguided. A failure of the political centre to acknowledge how the policies of the EU, particularly those relating to austerity, privatisation, supporting banks over people and so on, has spurred the sort of disillusionment that has led to the growth of these forces would be a dangerous complacency that will have us riding towards a further disastrous growth of the far right. It is very important to say that. The hope I take from the French election is the growth in support for people such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is very - and rightly - critical of the European Union but robustly against racism and the anti-immigrant sentiment and is trying to offer a radical, progressive and left-wing alternative to the failures of the EU. The EU has laid the ground for this even on the issue of racism. How can the EU present itself as progressive on the issue of immigration? Last weekend, 6,000 people, most of whom were travelling from Libya, were rescued from the Mediterranean.At the same time, the European Union did a deal with the Libyan Government in which it provided money to try to prevent migrants from leaving the country. Appalling abuse is occurring in Libya, with large numbers of the refugees being picked up in the Mediterranean describing being raped, physically beaten and abused. Open slave markets at which desperate people are bought and sold are operating in Libya, yet the European Union is doing deals with its government to keep migrants out of Europe. If Europe was not operating a racist policy by refusing to let these people in, we would not have this disaster or encourage the view that somehow immigrants are the problem and, in turn, fuel the arguments of Marine Le Pen, the fascist far right and extreme right-wing nationalists in Britain. I do not have time to discuss major expenditure increases by the European Union in response to President Trump's decision to ramp up militarism in the United States. The European Union has decided to ramp up European military expenditure by spending €5 billion, in addition to the €200 billion it already spends, on developing research in areas such as drone technology and other vile and murderous military technologies. That is the response of the European Union, which is also using austerity and Brexit to further ram through the neo-liberal agenda of privatisation and public service cutbacks. It is very important that we take seriously the growth of the far right and do not absolve the extreme centre - it is not the moderate centre - from what it has done in fuelling the dangerous levels of disillusionment and alienation that are spurring the growth of the far right. On the practical matters facing Ireland, Brexit is becoming the new austerity and is being used as an excuse for everything, including more competitiveness. What does the phrase "more competitiveness", which the Taoiseach used in his contribution, mean? Does it mean we must keep down wages and public expenditure? That is what the European Union believes it means and what is has consistently meant for the Government. Brexit is also becoming the new excuse for privatisation, cutting public expenditure and keeping a lid on wages and it will be used as an excuse for attacking public service pensions. This is what the European Union has been doing under the impact of austerity. The centre, disaster capitalism-like, is using the crisis as an opportunity to ram through the misguided policies which are digging the grave of the European Union and fuelling the growth of the far right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are serious about avoiding a hard Border and maintaining the common travel area, rather than spoofing, why not tell Mr. Barnier and the European Union that our officials will not physically co-operate with or tolerate any attempt to impose a hard Border? If the EU negotiates a deal which does not ensure that we keep the Border open and maintain the common travel area, we should have a referendum and reject the deal. The Taoiseach should give such a commitment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes when we propose that we need to significantly increase investment in social housing, the creaking public health system, public transport or other strategic areas of industry and enterprise that are in need of investment such as the arts, forestry, the sustainable energy sector or whatever else, the Government accuses us of fantasy economics because, of course, we do not have the money for it. Quite often, those of us on the left respond by pointing to untapped sources of tax revenue in the areas of wealth generation, profits and financial transactions. It is something we should talk about more because it is so obvious and the motion highlights it. If we ask where the money is, it is almost childlike to answer that it is in the banks. However, it is literally in the banks. The money for all of the investment mentioned is in the banks. In the case of AIB, €20 billion of public money was put into it. These are banks that generated €1 billion in pre-tax profits in the first six months of last year and €1.9 billion in pre-tax profits in 2015. Before the crash, the two big banks were averaging approximately €2 billion a year in profits and they are now moving back into that territory. We put in €20 billion when the banks collapsed and helped to collapse the rest of the economy. Just at the moment when they are starting to make money, we want to give them away again. One could not make it up. It is madness to consider selling off AIB now or at any point, at it was madness to sell off most of our shares in the Bank of Ireland after bailing it out. What we should be doing is establishing and absorbing AIB into a public, not-for-profit banking system whereby we would direct investment and lending policy at strategic priorities for the State in terms of capital expenditure, infrastructure and the development of strategic enterprise and industry. It is so obvious that we should do this. After bailing the banks out, crippling the country and the cost of doing so, then nursing them back to health, we are now talking about flogging them off. All of the profits they are going to accumulate in the coming years will be given away to private investors. It is just bonkers and I do not know what case can be put forward for it. I cannot think of any other explanation for it other than ideological blindness and addiction to neoliberal dogma. There is finally recognition that we do not have enough capital investment but we are going to give away a vehicle that could actually deliver it. I find it ridiculous when we debate how distressed mortgage holders are being mistreated by the banks or how lending by the banks into areas such as housing is not satisfactory and we even have Fine Gael and other Government Members giving out about the behaviour of the banks. We own the banks, but the Government will not assert any control over them. Why is that? It is partly due to the ideological fetishes and addictions of Fine Gael and, albeit in a slightly diluted form, Fianna Fáil. The Labour Party has also joined in that failed neoliberal consensus, as is indicated by its support for the fiscal rules and, before them, the Lisbon treaty. I hate the politics of "I told you so." I must also tell my Sinn Féin comrades that it was not just Sinn Féin that had this analysis. The left had it also, going right back to the previous treaties. In fact, the main plank of our opposition to the Lisbon treaty, the previous treaties and the fiscal rules was not sovereignty issues, as was the case for some, although they were important; nor was it democracy issues or even military issues. The main plank of our opposition was that the state aid rules and subsequently the fiscal rules would act as an economic straitjacket which would prevent us from strategically investing in key areas of infrastructure, the economy, or strategic enterprise. Now finally, belatedly, this recognition seems to be occurring across the board at the budget scrutiny committee, amazingly, accompanied, however, by total amnesia about the fact that we had warned that this would be the case. When we did so in the fiscal treaty debate on the state aid rules and the Lisbon treaty, we were told we did not know what we were talking about and that we were making it up. Now we are stuck in that straitjacket and there is talk of special pleading. I am glad that we are recognising it at last, but why on earth did the other parties not see it coming?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We supported an exit from the European Union which had nothing to do with the exit-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not support treaties that tied us to mad economic policies and which had crippled the level of capital investment. It is important to remind people of this. On the specific issue of AIB, it is not just that it is the wrong time to sell it off. It should never be sold off. We should use it as a public bank to invest in infrastructure and the strategically important areas of the economy which are suffering from chronic under-investment.
