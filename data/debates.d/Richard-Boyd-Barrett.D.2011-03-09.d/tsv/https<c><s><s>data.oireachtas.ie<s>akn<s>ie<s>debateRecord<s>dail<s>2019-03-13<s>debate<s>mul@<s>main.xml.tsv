RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Fianna Fáil for the motion. I agree with the overall thrust of it and the various measures proposed to try to deal with high insurance costs. Costs have tailed off a bit for motorists but are still significantly impacting home insurance, business insurance, public liability insurance and so on where insurance premium increases have been very dramatic and punitive for some customers. Following on from the last speaker, the elephant in the room in all this is the profit taking of the insurance companies themselves. There should be more emphasis on that in the Fianna Fáil motion, much as I welcome many of the measures proposed relating to the book of quantum, the PIAB, addressing insurance fraud and so on. The evidence of the significant increase in profits for some of the biggest insurers shows that even if reforms are brought in to address these areas, the insurance companies do not pass it on in the form of lower premiums.They just take the profits and run. These measures on their own may not ultimately lead to more affordable insurance or prevent significant hikes in insurance premiums because there is no compulsion on the insurance companies to pass on the benefits of reform in the form of lower premiums. This is the issue that has to be addressed. From my point of view, the way to do this is to have a public insurance company. I doubt very much that Fine Gael will go for this but it is what should happen. In previous debates on this issue I pointed out that it has been done elsewhere. One of the best examples I have read about is in Manitoba in Canada where there were significant increases in car insurance of the sort we saw over recent years. As I said, I acknowledge they have tailed off somewhat. Against this background, and it can happen at any time that they just jack up premiums, Manitoba set up a public insurance company that provided basic insurance with third-party cover and personal injury cover at extremely affordable levels. It was a not-for-profit insurance company set up by the state. One does not have to be a socialist to subscribe to the view it would be of benefit to drivers, businesses and homeowners. I do not really see why the Government would set its face against it but certainly to date it has done so. The other particular group I would like to shout out for with regard to insurance, and notwithstanding there has been some tailing off of the dramatic increases in car insurance which I acknowledge, is that there should be a specific regime for taxi drivers. The increases we have seen in recent years, even if they have tailed off, mean the level of insurance that taxi drivers must pay is extremely high. If they lose their no claims bonus they can be in very serious trouble as to the viability of operating as taxi drivers. We should recognise that taxi drivers are an important part of the public transport system, that we need them and that insurance costs can be a real struggle for them. This is something a public insurance company could do, or the Government could take measures to provide a special affordable category of insurance for taxi drivers. The main message I want to give to the Government is it has to do something about profiteering by insurance companies. If we do not do something, all the reforms and the completion of the various measures from the working group that have not yet been done, even if they do come through and make a difference, will not be passed on to policyholders in the form of cheaper premiums.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are witnessing the rather shambolic death throes of the great British Empire, as it would have seen itself. Given the blood and hardship for which that empire was responsible across the globe, one cannot be terribly sorry to see this decline. The rotten politics, which dominates the British Tory party and to which Theresa May has been hostage, is propelling us towards the ever more imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. It is quite hard to predict what will happen over the next while. However, whatever may happen, if it produces one effect, namely, the death and discrediting of that rotten little Englander politics with imperial aspirations, it would not be bad. Beyond that, there is not much we can say about what will happen in the UK. They will probably vote for avoiding a no-deal Brexit but it does not mean anything because they can still crash into a no-deal scenario if a deal is not done. Whether it is done with or without an extension is difficult to say at this stage. Personally, I hope there is a general election in the UK soon and we get the Tories out because they are completely incapable of rational behaviour at this stage. They are torn by the rotten politics which dominates their thinking. Beyond that, what will Ireland do, given the greater likelihood of a no-deal Brexit? For its own cynical reasons as part of the negotiating process, Britain has said that, at least for a period, it will not impose customs checks and a border between the North and South. Members should not get me wrong. I do not trust the Tories on that. Their position is full of contradictions and is part of a bargaining process which also includes threatening tariffs which would do immense damage to significant sectors of the Irish economy. However, it does put it up a little to both the Government and the EU to answer in kind by committing that we will not, under any circumstances, impose controls, checks or a border infrastructure between the North and the South in the event of a no-deal scenario. That is something which the Government and the EU have still resisted doing. Today, at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I asked Carlos Martinez Mongay, director, DirectorateGeneral for Economic and Financial Affairs, whether the EU would put pressure on the Irish Government to protect the integrity of the Single Market by insisting on a border infrastructure in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We did not get any answers. Similarly, on protecting particular sectors, I asked him how flexible would the EU be on state aid rules and how much of a support package would be made available. It is not just about the rainy day fund or how much the Irish Government sets aside to protect workers and particular sectors of Irish society. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, I asked him what the EU would do to protect people in this country from the economic consequences that may ensue. Again, he refused to answer that question. We cannot dodge those questions anymore. Given that there are certain matters out of our control, there are also certain matters within our control. The Government needs to say to the UK, which cannot be trusted and does not give a damn about the consequences of all this for this country, that we will not be imposing a hard border under any circumstances. Similarly, we need to tell the European Union that we will not tolerate any pressure from it to impose border infrastructure in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We should also ask the EU to see the colour of its money in terms of real support if we take a significant hit.
