RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Ministers for their contributions. One of the issues that I am particularly exercised about is eligibility for social housing and social housing support. We have been repeatedly given commitments on publishing the outcome of a review that has been running for at least five years, which it was reported was concluded in December 2021. It still has not been published or announced despite repeated promises that it would be before the summer recess. There is absolutely no justification for the fact that the review has gone on for that long.There is certainly no justification for the fact that the Minister has sat on it from December. The ESRI quantified the number of people in need of housing support who were cut off their entitlement to social housing or social housing support in the form of HAP, RAS or whatever. That was pretty stark. We knew it anecdotally from the people coming in week after week saying they were on the housing list for ten years, that they cannot afford market rent and now they are off the list. The ESRI said in its recent report that the number of people eligible for social housing support has dropped from 46% about a decade ago to 33%. This is a massive stealth cut in housing support, affecting tens of thousands of working people who previously would have received some support to deal with extortionate rents or who might have gotten a social house at some point, who now do not get it and go over a cliff once their income goes over €35,000 net or perhaps a bit more depending on the family size. They are now left completely in the wilderness and have to pay rents that are completely unaffordable. My question for the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is whether he has discussed this with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, because I suspect that the reason this review has not been published is that the Government is terrified of the costs that could ensue if the income eligibility threshold is increased by whatever amount. If it was restored in real terms to the level it was at ten years ago, which to my mind is the absolute minimum that should be done, given that the number of people in need of the support has grown exponentially with high rents, I imagine the bill for that would be pretty high. I cannot conceive of the idea that the Minister has not discussed this and that it is not at the back of the delay in publishing the outcome of the review. Has the Minister discussed it? Is he aware of the cost? Is that the reason we have not seen the outcome of the review? What is going to happen to it? If that is not the case, when will we hear about what is going to happen with the income threshold, which is a very pressing matter now for huge numbers of people? I would like to hear the answer to that question first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very glad to hear that. Has the Minister quantified the cost, because it would have budgetary implications? I believe the thresholds should be raised substantially. That group of people whose income is in excess of €35,000 or perhaps up to €40,000 is still eligible depending on family size, but they are pushed over a cliff. Some of those people are in homeless accommodation as we speak and are now not even entitled to that. They are being threatened with eviction from homeless accommodation because they have gone over a threshold, having been on a housing list for ten years. To be honest, you could not make this stuff up in terms of what is going on. This is life and death stuff for some of them due to the situation they are in. On that level of income, they have no chance of paying the rents in Dublin and they have no chance of purchasing. The Government says the affordable housing schemes are coming and all the rest of it, but we are quite a few years away from them having any impact - even if they work - and there are question marks in that regard for that cohort. I refer to people earning above €35,000, and even up to €50,000 or €60,000. This is urgent. In his discussions, has the Minister even quantified what it might cost? For example, if we push the threshold up to €40,000, it will cost this much. If we push it up to €45,000, it will cost this much. If we push it up to €50,000, it will cost this much. If the Minister has not quantified it - I take his word that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not blocking this - and if that is what he tells me, I believe it, but is it even part of the Minister's budgetary considerations? If it is not, that tells me we are not going to have the thresholds moved before the budget, which is a very serious breach of promise, because we were told by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage - and I have been told by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions - that the outcome of that review was going to be made public before the summer recess. That promise has already been broken. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is saying it is not him blocking it, but he is not quite sure when all this is happening. He has just told me he does not have figures on that. If we do not know how it is going to impact on the budget then that tells me we are not going to hear about this any time soon.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That tells me it is not in the Minister's budget considerations currently. Is that fair to say? It does not figure in how we are going to spend that €2.7 billion, quite a bit of which will go on whatever public sector pay deal is reached. I will get to that in a moment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest to the Minister that it would be very sensible from a budgetary point of view to start to work out how much it would cost if the threshold went up to €40,000 and, likewise, how much it would cost if the threshold went up to €45,000, €50,000, and so on and so forth. To be honest, I cannot believe that we are not at least beginning to estimate that cost. If the Minister is not doing it, I strongly suggest that he does because he should know it if there is going to be any move or announcement on those thresholds.I repeat, that announcement has been promised. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one last question on housing. Despite the debates we may have about whether Housing for All is fit for purpose and can actually deliver, does the Minister accept that since Housing for All was published, the situation has deteriorated and that he may need to reconsider the envelope, as it were, of planned expenditure on housing to meet the crisis that we are now facing? I am not just referring to the fact that there are refugees coming into the country. According to every sort of measure, the situation has got worse. House prices have reached astronomical proportions. At the epicentre of the housing crisis, the rent situation is going from bad to worse on a weekly basis. On top of that, there is inflation, which is in effect an income cut for the very same people who have to pay those rents or consider taking out a mortgage with less income for higher cost accommodation. Is any consideration being given to the idea that that envelope of spending and investment in the area of housing is just going to have to increase?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have probably said enough on the issue. To my mind, it is the most pressing issue and the one that the Government has indicated is its top priority. If the housing delivery plan for my local authority - which has been signed off by the Department - is anything to go by, after applying a little bit of pressure in trying to extract the figures I know that the local authority's plan for the duration of Housing for All will mean that there will be more people on the housing list at the end of the five-year period than there are now, given the additional numbers that the local authority estimates will join it. Currently, there is a 20-year waiting list. If that is as far we are going to go, we will still be in trouble on this issue in five years' time. Added to that, the Minister has rightly identified the issue of rising costs in the construction sector, which has already scuppered one co-operative project in my area that was due to start. The co-op developer said it could not deliver the project at the cost previously estimated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, absolutely. It includes the LDA pipeline. In fact, the first LDA delivery is due to take place in Dún Laoghaire. It is rather telling that four years after the LDA came into existence, it has not delivered one house on that site. That is due to be the first LDA-delivered site and it is not going to be delivered until 2024. It is pretty shocking stuff. I can tell the Minister that there is nobody blocking the development. We are actively campaigning to get the sods on the ground turned, but nothing is happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is hard to understand. I am probably out of time, am I?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well, yes. Very quickly, I will ask the Minister for Finance some questions. I do not want to leave him out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister considering any additional revenue-raising measures in the current budget? As he is aware, in People Before Profit we are very prudential in our budgeting so that when we argue for substantially increasing expenditure beyond what the Minister is proposing, as we do, we always propose revenue-raising measures such as wealth taxes, increases in employer PRSI rates and increases in corporate tax and financial transaction taxes. The Government always pooh-poohs our figures as to what we could raise through the introduction of such measures. Recently, Oxfam estimated that a 2% wealth tax on those with over €4 million in assets would raise €4 billion. I am sure the Minister will say that is just not true. I personally think it is. Even if a quarter of that estimated amount could be raised by a wealth tax on the wealthiest people in this country, it would be a lot of money. Given the huge challenges and demands we face, is any consideration being given to the introduction of some additional revenue-raising measures in the form of taxes on those who have not done too badly or have done very well over the last period, including the very wealthy and some areas of big business? For example, we could introduce a windfall tax on the energy companies or the big investment funds in housing and property that have done very well over the last period. Is any consideration being given to the idea that such companies and funds should be asked to cough up a bit of extra tax from the gains that they have made while other people have been suffering, to help fund the big challenges we have and to shield others who are being hammered by the cost-of-living crisis? I am out of time, so I will throw in one last question. On the issue of public sector pay, our view is that pay, pensions and income should at least keep pace with inflation. Otherwise, we are reducing the spending power of people, which means human suffering for them, and it also potentially has a negative knock-on effect for the rest of the economy. People have less purchasing power, which then hits the economy. We think it is an economic, social and moral imperative to ensure that public sector pay, pensions and income at least keep pace with the rate of inflation so that people are not losing real income or purchasing power. What does the Minister say to that?
