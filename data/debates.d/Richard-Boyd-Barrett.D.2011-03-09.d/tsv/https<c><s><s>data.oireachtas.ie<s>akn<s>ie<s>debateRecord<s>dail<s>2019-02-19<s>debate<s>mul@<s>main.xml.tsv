RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised the matter with Deputy Gino Kenny in recent weeks. As other Deputies have noted, the Government urgently needs to review and abandon the proposal. It is worth bearing in mind that the revenue which is expected to be generated from the proposal is a miserable €8 million. Given the impact and hardship it will cause the many people who need food supplements, vitamins and so on which, in many cases, have been recommended by their doctors as necessary for their health, it would be a shocking decision to take in exchange for a miserable €8 million. I hope the Government is listening and that it will abandon the proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Barrett is quite right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask the Taoiseach about another aspect of British politics which we heard echoed today on "Morning Ireland", when a contributor echoed a position of Theresa May's about which we should have something to say. We had a journalist making a casual connection between support for Palestinians, criticism of the Israeli state and anti-Semitism, essentially suggesting they were all the same thing. This has been an extremely worrying narrative that Theresa May has echoed in attacking Jeremy Corbyn. They are attacking what they describe as the hard left and accusing them, incredibly, of being anti-Semitic because they support Palestinians and are critical of the apartheid policies of Israel. We all abhor anti-Semitism and should oppose it in the most robust fashion. However, it is absolutely unacceptable that an Orwellian narrative is now spreading across Britain. It had better not spread over here; it needs to be resisted. It suggests that legitimate criticism of apartheid policies in Israel and of the persecution of Palestinians by the Israeli state somehow equates to anti-Semitism. Opposing apartheid policies and racism should actually lead us to be critical of what Israel is doing, not to be silent about what Israel is doing. Precisely because we oppose racism and abhor the suffering of Jewish people in the past, it is absolutely important to criticise what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are critical of all those regimes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those regimes are not supported by my party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One unfortunate mantra the Taoiseach has continued to trot out, which we have just heard from Deputy Micheál Martin, is the notion that the renewable heat incentive scandal was some sort of little Mickey Mouse issue that should not have been of concern.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy implied it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy did imply it. That was my take on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the same attitude the Government seems to have. It is treated as if it was a small issue that the parties should get over, as if there was nothing important about it. Eamon McCann was the first Assembly member to call for an election over this issue because we were talking about hundreds of millions of pounds. It is an absolutely shocking scandal. It took place in the context of a raft of austerity measures that were agreed under the Stormont House Agreement, including the now notorious universal credit scheme and PIP social welfare assault on people in the North, plans to sell off state assets and to axe thousands of public service jobs. It was a vicious austerity campaign. We should not imply, whatever one might think about restoring the-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt the Deputy. We should take the scandal very seriously. There were very good reasons to challenge an Executive that was responsible for such a huge scandal in terms of the expenditure of public money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The interview with Owen Keegan, CEO of Dublin City Council, the biggest local and housing authority in the country, in The Sunday Business Post on the housing and homelessness crisis was, to some extent, very revealing, to a large extent, absolutely shocking, and, to a significant extent, absolutely unacceptable. I want to know what the Taoiseach thinks of his comments. They come as part of a pattern of trying to normalise homelessness and, incredibly, victim-blaming, suggesting that somehow homeless services were "attractive" to people because we had so many of them and they were so good. The implication was that people want to get into homelessness services. I have never met a person who wanted to get into homelessness services and who was not in absolute dire need. He also made very alarming statements about the wider policy remit of local authorities, of the State and of the private market. Does the Taoiseach agree or disagree with this? The head of the biggest local authority in the country, someone who is appointed by Government, said:Housing supply is going to have to be delivered by private sector even if we end up renting a significant number of units. We will only ever build a small proportion.He went on to say that social mix is not happening because, in many cases, the 10% we were supposed to get-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach agree with that? A small proportion-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It demonstrates a rotten attitude by the authorities that are supposed to be dealing with this housing and homelessness crisis. Mr. Keegan admitted that the private sector was failing but then went on to say that we have to rely on the private sector and that our homelessness services are so wonderful they are acting as a magnet. It is not on.
