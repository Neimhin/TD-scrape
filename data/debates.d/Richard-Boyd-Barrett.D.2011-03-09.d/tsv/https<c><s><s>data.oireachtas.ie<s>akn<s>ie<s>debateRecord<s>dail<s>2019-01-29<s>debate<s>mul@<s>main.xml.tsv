RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's researchers worked hard to find that one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government appealed the decision. It is fighting it in a court.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are a hell of a lot more vacancies than there are applications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It appears that anything recommended by a doctor is affected.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Briefly on that, the Taoiseach should start to prepare the ground for a border poll in the event of a hard Brexit and any effort by anybody to erect a border. It is a basic democratic call at this stage to let people make their decision if that eventuality occurs. My question is more generally about the Taoiseach's legislative priorities. I urge him to make a priority of legislating to change the income thresholds for social housing because an absolute cull is happening of the social housing waiting lists where much of the time people are being forced because rents in the private sector are extortionate to do overtime on a regular basis or get marginal increases in their income that do not allow them to buy a house on the private market or pay the extortionate rents but are then taking them over the income threshold for social housing, which has not changed since 2011. I was talking to a council worker the other day who has been on the list for years. In his wildest dreams his income would not buy him a house in the greater Dún Laoghaire area where rents are absolutely shocking. To pay his rent he has been forced to do Saturday overtime for the past year and a half or two years, and he has to do it because there are staff shortages, but he has now been taken off the housing list. That is happening again and again. A nurse came into our office recently who is on the housing list since 2004. She has just been taken off the list because her income has gone marginally over the limit. That is not acceptable. I would not mind if the Taoiseach had an affordable housing scheme, which he promised, so that those who go over the limit have some alternative available to them but despite promise after promise, we do not have an affordable housing scheme. Is the Taoiseach going to raise the income threshold for social housing to stop this cull of people from the housing list or, at the very least, could he say that basic pay is what should be taken into account? It is outrageous that marginal increases in income because of overtime that is enforced should take them off the housing list that they have been on for years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Taoiseach address my question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a specific question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have already asked a question about income thresholds and I will add this further comment. The Taoiseach has gone on and on about a social mix in housing but the failure to raise the income thresholds for social housing makes a nonsense of social mix because nurses, council workers and people who are on low-to-average earnings are being whacked off the social housing list. That completely eliminates any notion of social mix and at the same time no affordable housing scheme has been delivered so no council can move ahead, in reality, with an affordable housing scheme. I want to ask questions about the national children's hospital. The Taoiseach spoke earlier about his party's fiscal prudence and said that Fine Gael prides itself on its financial management as against the irresponsible populous representatives he accuses us of being. How did he manage to mismanage an infrastructural project of this importance and this scale, such that we have a 300% increase in the costs from the original tender? Did anybody bother to look at the rotten record of BAM, which got it and was €120 million lower than the nearest other bid. That should have raised alarm bells. It built car parks in Holland that collapsed. It had to make settlements with Cambridgeshire County Council over massive overruns on road projects. It built the Ballyfermot Leisure Centre on which there was a significant overrun and it had a five-year long battle with the council about who would pick up the tab for the overrun. There were also significant overruns in the Port of Cork. Did anybody bother looking into Mr. Costello's record on a project board? He was involved with significant overruns when working for Sisk in Poland and these nearly led the company to collapse. Is it any wonder he stated that there was no problem with BAM's tender because he had a record of it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we have them soon? Does the Taoiseach have a date?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us just let it roll. I can come up with a few questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is missing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we know which Minister it is?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Silence is golden.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The increase on VAT on food supplements to 23% is shocking for huge numbers of people who need and rely on food supplements and vitamins. To put it simply, the Government needs to abandon this misguided plan. I will give the Minister of State a very simple example. Tony is a cancer patient and a constituent of mine. He is a pensioner with a medical card. He spends all of his small income on keeping his house warm and feeding himself. His medication is covered by his medical card, but food supplements and vitamins recommended by his doctor for his health are not included under that scheme. He has had radical surgery and to keep his body functioning, he needs a range of vitamins and food supplements because his body cannot absorb certain vitamins. Currently, these cost him €70 a month. He cannot afford that. If the new VAT level is imposed, that will go up to €86. That will mean he will not be able to afford them at all. Does the Minister of State think it is acceptable that somebody who is ill and is suffering from cancer, whose doctor has recommended these vitamins and food supplements as absolutely essential keep his body functioning, should have to pay at all, or see any increases in what he pays?He should abandon this, and these products should be covered by the medical card.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have heard the script. Will the Minister of State get off the script for a minute? I asked him a question about Tony, who is suffering from cancer. Currently, he is paying €32.95 a month for a probiotic; €10 for thiamin; €10 for magnesium; and €20 for Vivioptal. Recommended by his doctor, he needs these products for his health and he is paying €70 a month for them. He should not be paying that at all. If this VAT change goes ahead, he will be paying €86. He cannot afford that.What is the Minister of State's answer to that? Does he believe Tony, who is ill, or other vulnerable elderly and sick people who need these products to maintain their health, should be paying for them? I believe they should be covered by the medical card. Does he think it is in any way acceptable that the price of those products will increase and make them unaffordable? These are products doctors are recommending in many cases for the maintenance of people's health.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are asking the Minister to think about the health and well-being of people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The simple-mindedness, paucity of thinking, ideological bankruptcy that lies behind this concept of a rainy day fund the Government is presenting in the Bill, which it has been arguing for some time, is staggering. It makes clear that the Government has not the faintest clue or simply does not want to acknowledge why we had an economic crisis previously and why we will have another economic crisis fairly soon. The Government had a rainy day fund prior to the previous crisis. Did it stop the crisis? No. Did it stop vicious austerity being imposed on the people of this country? No. Did it stop a virtual economic collapse in the country? No. Did it prevent us having to go begging to borrow money and impose vicious austerity in order to get money from the European Central Bank, ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, IMF? No. Did it achieve anything? The answer is "No", except – I am sorry but I forgot - that it bailed out the banks. That was the one thing it achieved. The same banks that are now selling off people's mortgages to vulture funds, repossessing their homes, and paying no tax because there is a tax loophole that incredibly allows them to write off previous losses for 20 years, even when they have restored themselves to extraordinary levels of profitability, and where the people running those banks are back earning shocking, obscene, staggering salaries of between €700,000 and €800,000. That is what it achieved. It did nothing to act as a buffer, and now the Government just wants to do it again. Has the Government learnt anything at all? It is just mind-boggling. The Government wants to draw us into an argument about how we fight over these little crumbs rather than look at the storm that hit us the last time and the storm that will hit us again when the markets to whom the Government bows down wrecks economies overnight. Its take on the economic crash which is used to justify this is Orwellian. It peddles the myth that we were spending beyond our means. The Taoiseach goes on about it and says the nurses cannot get paid because the reason we had an economic crisis the last time was public servants were paid too much. That is not the reason we had an economic crisis; we had an economic crisis because the rich in this country, in America, across Europe and just about everywhere in the western world, had spent the previous 15 to 20 years turning housing, the most basic human need, into an object of speculation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what happened. Even a child knows that. Everybody knows it but the Government pretends it is not the truth. It was something to do with the fact that public servants, apparently, were living beyond their means. That is just preposterous. I think it is happening again. All the developers who helped bankrupt the country, those greedy people who speculated on Irish housing then went into NAMA and were paid €200,000 a year to get back into business were nurtured back to profitability and then the State gave them back all the assets and property which we had at least off got them and should have kept. Now one of them, Seán Mulryan of the Ballymore Group, is selling back a property to the Central Bank. The ironies just pile up. The Central Bank moved from Dame Street a few years ago to the docklands and it is now going to buy another property beside its new headquarters from Mr. Mulryan. The total bill is €200 million. It is unbelievable. One could not make it up but it is happening. It was in the business pages of the Sunday Independent last weekend. I do not know if anyone has even mentioned that. I find it beyond belief. All the boys are back in town and now they are backed by an even greedier bunch. The previous Irish property crash was financed by the banks and the greedy Irish property speculators. Now, having nursed them back into business, in order to hoover up everything, they have gone to America to get the big vulture funds to come in and back them financially so that they can get everything back and get even more. They will have even greater control over the Irish property sector, which is running riot, and, against that background, the Government is saying we should put €500 million a year into a rainy day fund. It is an absolute joke. Even if I thought it was a good idea, by the time the next economic crash comes, there will be bugger all in it anyway compared to the likely hit. It is just nonsense. I would not mind if the Government said we need a safety net or a buffer after we do the things that would begin to create some insulation for the economy and society against the inevitable economic crash that will be caused by those people again. When the next economic crash comes, which it will, will the Government say it is down to the public servants or to the nurses? The Taoiseach was implying that today. He said if we concede to the nurses, we are one step closer to an economic crash. Whether the nurses get paid, an economic crash will come and it will have nothing to do with them. However, what it will have to do with is the greedy people in the financial markets and the people who have taken control of the property sector, many of whom are the same, deciding at a certain point that they are shifting their money somewhere else because it is not profitable enough for them anymore. That is when the crash will come. We have no control over what they do because we have given them more control over wealth, assets, the financial system and property than they even had before the previous crash, which they caused. That is what the Government has done and, against that background, this Bill is pathetic. What the Government could do if it wanted some insulation for the economy is to start to get back some of that surplus wealth those individuals control, the movement of which can destabilise this economy or the wider European or American economies. It is due to the fact that such wealth is even more concentrated than it was before the last crash that they can destabilise our economy and the global economy. Unless we address that fact we do not have a prayer of dealing with the next crash that is coming. I am amazed that nobody even asked those questions. I doubt that any economics or financial correspondents are even listening to this debate. They think they have heard it before and there is no point in discussing it. They will discuss tomorrow's crisis, whatever that is, but not provide a deeper analysis of why crashes happen and what we might do to the system that generates the crashes again and again, where they tend to get worse and where the concentration of wealth, the ingredients that generate the crises in the first place, are accumulated on a bigger scale each time there is a crisis. We will have part two tomorrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That old chestnut.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is ominous, sinister and deeply worrying that cases involving debt have been removed from Mr. Edmund Honohan. He challenged the ruthlessness and brutality of these banks and vulture funds in how they dealt with people in mortgage distress who were trying to engage with them, and called them out for their ruthlessness. This matter is related to what we are debating here and the way in which the Government, in defending its opposition to this eminently humane Bill, makes reference to the potential impact on the global financial system and the system of securitisation of loans which lay at the back of the global crash of 2008. The Government is defending that. The position under the Central Bank's voluntary code was that what this Bill proposes should, in fact, be the situation and people's mortgages should not be sold without their consent. However, the Government says that code was introduced 20 years ago and things have moved on since then. What has moved on is that the banking and financial system now depends on the securitisation of these loans in order to function. According to the Government, that is the reason we cannot do what the Central Bank, until recently, believed we should do when it comes to dealing with these loans and the relationship between the borrower and the lender.  One could be forgiven for concluding, as I do, that the Government's response to this Bill is to simply forget about the human being. The vast majority of people who were in front of Mr. Edmund Honohan, or in front of the courts, are just ordinary, decent human beings who, in good faith, obtained loans to put a roof over their heads because that is the only way vast numbers of people can get a roof over their heads. These people did not seek to rip off the banks and society but to put a roof over their heads, notwithstanding whether their loans are performing or non-performing loans. The bottom fell out of the economy because of the actions of the financial institutions and others speculating on property and driving the property market out of control. That was not the fault of ordinary people with either performing or non-performing loans. The idea seems to be that those people somehow have to take the rap to protect a financial system that is out of control. The fact that the financial system was out of control was what landed us all in this mess in the first place. The Government is defending that and has used it as its defence against a Bill that provides that people should have the right to consent or not consent to the sale of the mortgage loan they agreed with their bank or mortgage lender. I am trying to remember the type of lender Permanent TSB is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, there is a name for institutions like Permanent TSB. In any case, I am referring to banks and other forms of mortgage lenders. I do not accept the Government's defence for one minute because it means the human being goes out the window. It inflicts cruel anxiety and hardship on people who sought those loans in good faith. If borrowers have got into trouble with repayments, in the vast majority of cases it was not of their making. Deputy McGuinness and I have plenty of experience with people in these circumstances. When the chief executive officers of the banks appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach they state that all will be fine if people just engage with their bank. From direct experience of dealing with people, I know that trying to engage with the banks and find somebody to talk to in the banks is often like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Sometimes, the only reason people manage to get a bit of engagement is that a Deputy who, like me, has a line through the committee, steps in and he or she may get the phone number of the CEO. Those are the lengths to which people have to go to get a meeting between two human beings to discuss the case. Even then, a reasonable solution may not be found because a week or month later different officials will be dealing with the case and may say they do not remember there was a meeting or this, that or the other. It goes on and on and, at the same time, the letters and threats keep coming from the bank. These terrify people who then end up in court facing threats of repossession. This Bill proposes to bring this back down to a human level. It provides that the individuals who sought loans to put a roof over their heads would have the right to insist that the institution that gave them the loan maintain the existing arrangement. Borrowers would be able to refuse to allow their lender to flog off their loans to somebody else who does not know or care about them and views their mortgage loan as nothing more than an opportunity to make profit or trade on international markets. I see no justification for the Government's opposition to this Bill, other than that it has become a complete and utter slave to the financial markets and will do whatever the markets say. I will finish by repeating something I said in the earlier debate. Let us contrast the Government's defence of the right of these banks to flog off people's loans to vulture funds, which will do what the hell they like to distressed mortgage borrowers, with the case of our friend, Mr. Sean Mulryan, who was in the news over the weekend. Mr. Mulryan borrowed hundreds of millions of euro and helped to bankrupt the economy, along with his other developer friends, yet the State engaged with him. The National Asset Management Agency paid him €200,000 to get his business going again. Mr. Mulryan then got himself out of NAMA with the assistance of some of the major international financial operators and is now back in control of sites in the docks, which he is flogging to the Central Bank for about €200 million. The State engaged with Mr. Mulryan who was shown a great deal of human consideration. He was not a good faith borrower seeking to put a roof over his head. Having helped to crash the entire economy because of his greed, he is back in business and the Central Bank is to pay him €200 million to buy new premises beside the spanking new premises it has already required. Having moved from Dame Street, it will buy another new premises from Mr. Mulryan. The contrast could not be greater. That is a bit of moral hazard. The only moral hazard the Government is concerned with is the hazard that might impact on global financial speculators.
