RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to follow up on the last few questions. The witnesses are claiming a record number of trees being planted, with an increase of 30%. A figure was quoted in regard to how much of that is new forestry, but the figures for afforestation nationally are very poor. They are well below the set targets. A witness mentioned a figure of 14% that is being discussed with the Government and how Coillte will contribute to that 14%. I thought the target was 17%. Are we rolling back now from 17%, which in itself, as the witness pointed out, is about half of the average across Europe? Are we rolling back on targets yet again? What is Coillte contributing to the current level of afforestation, which we know is well below what it should be? I think there are about 6,000 to 7,000 ha of afforestation currently. How much of that is Coillte actually contributing? I am extremely interested in the non-productive land the witnesses refer to. A figure of 100,000 ha has been mentioned. I actually do not know how to convert acres into hectares.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That works out about right. Mr. McCarthy said there was half a million acres. If I remember correctly, he said half of that would require substantial investment to bring it on, and the rest was not viable in any sense. I would like to hear more about that. What somebody might consider commercially viable from a narrow commercial point of view is not necessarily unviable from an environmental, carbon lock-up and biodiversity point of view. I am not satisfied at all that land written off as not viable for forestry is actually not viable, if one takes a more holistic view of what forestry is and what it can contribute to dealing with climate change, mitigating flooding, and reversing the decline in biodiversity that is happening. It is not just that we are not enhancing biodiversity; biodiversity is declining.  That brings me on to the diversity of species. How many of the 18 million trees that Coillte is planting are deciduous? What is Coillte doing to shift the balance towards a diversity of species, particularly in the broadleaf area? Are we moving in the right direction? How fast are we moving in the right direction? How much of what Coillte is contributing to afforestation is expanding biodiversity and broadleaf species?Examining the mid-term review, I notice that broadleaf planting nationally is down from 24% in 2014 to 19% currently. To what extent is Coillte contributing to the worsening of the situation where broadleaf planting is concerned? The recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report also refers to deforestation. It points to deforestation resulting from a number of factors. One of the significant factors it refers to is wind farms, in which Coillte plays a part. I have to question what I see as a tension between Coillte's core mandate for afforestation, helping to deal with climate change, biodiversity and being the guardian of the forest estate on one hand, and the imperative to be commercially viable and get involved in non-core projects such as wind farms on the other and whether the two are actually conflicting with one another - in other words, whether the commercial imperative is adversely impacting upon Coillte's core mandate, which is to be the guardian of the forest estate. The EPA report does not say how much of this problem is Coillte's responsibility, but Coillte is one of the bodies promoting the use of lands owned by the forest estate to develop these wind farms, which may be contributing to deforestation. Along with others, of whom I am sure the witnesses are aware, I have talked about how the planting of the uplands, particularly with broad-leaf species, might actually contribute very significantly to mitigating flooding downstream. As the witnesses know, there are projects under way in Wales, where studies suggest this is very significantly reducing flooding. Should we not use some of these uplands for that? In particular, should Coillte, whose core mandate is forestry, be using the uplands for that, rather than for building giant wind farms which may actually be contributing to deforestation? I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  Lastly, I wish to ask about poles for telecommunications. Is it true that we are importing poles for electricity and telephone cables from outside the country, and that our forest industry cannot even meet that need? I would like the witnesses to comment on that. I have been told that is true. Some 40,000 poles are being imported. Maybe the witnesses could comment on that, but it seems quite extraordinary. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has Coillte planted them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On deforestation, holistically, if one works out the maths on this, significant questions arise over these large wind farms when one adds in construction costs, particularly if it includes cutting trees down. Up to 15,000 ha have gone in the past seven years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report referred to 15,000 ha of deforestation over the past seven years for wind farms, roads and other developments. It was not all down to Coillte but it was significant. Only 70 ha were afforested at the same time. One sees the maths. Against that background of deforestation, the rate of afforestation is minimal. Is it a good idea to hand over such lands for large wind farms if the overall impact is not significant or could even be negative?
