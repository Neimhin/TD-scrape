RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a slight change in the order. We will have Deputies Mick Wallace, me, Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly and Shane Ross.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we have seven and a half minutes each?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point that was made was that the Government should have allowed more time for the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The move to establish a strategic bank is a very long overdue recognition of the failure of the banking and wider economic strategy employed by this Government and that which preceded it in the aftermath of the economic crash. We bailed out the so-called pillar banks to the tune of €64 billion, privatised some of them and beggared the country in the process. The rationale behind doing so was that we needed these banks. The attitude was, "We do not like it but we need to do it because the main commercial banks are critical to economic recovery". Three or four years have passed and we now realise that this just did not work. We gave the banks all the money they required and they continued to act as a law unto themselves. They do not give a hoot about the State's rationale. They only have one rationale, namely, to make money. Their balance sheets constitute the bottom line. The strategic priorities relating to our economy and the needs of citizens are irrelevant to the banks. As a result of the realisation that has been reached, we are now obliged to set up a strategic bank. One could say it is better late than never and that at least we are doing this now. However, having made the decision to introduce legislation to facilitate the establishment of the new corporation, the Government has imposed a guillotine. We are whacking through this Bill in one day. In the context of anything discussed in the Dáil, this legislation is extremely important by any standards, particularly as it will have far-reaching implications for our economy's capacity to recover. The Bill contains provisions which will give the Minister for Finance power to guarantee up to €4 billion in investments by foreign entities without having to have recourse to the Dáil. That is extraordinary. Despite the damage done by the blanket bank guarantee, the Minister will have the power to issue a guarantee without being obliged to discuss the matter in the House. The art of political distraction currently being practised with mastery by the Government is amazing. What are we discussing while this Bill which involves bank guarantees and strategic investments and is the result of the failure of the Government's banking strategy is being whacked through the Dáil by means of the use of the guillotine? The answer is Garth Brooks and the drama of the Cabinet reshuffle. People have been speculating as to whether the latter would take place on Tuesday, yesterday or today and whether Phil or Eamon will be appointed as Ireland's next European Commissioner. They are also anticipating the press conference to be given later today by Garth Brooks. That is just extraordinary. What the Government is doing is on a par with the distraction tactics employed by the Roman emperors, namely, give them bread and circuses while the real business is taking place. The media, of course, go along for the ride, which is absolutely pathetic.The headlines on RTE and in the media are all about Garth Brooks while something substantial like this Bill, which is about the economic future of the country and a belated recognition of a failed economic and banking strategy, is going through. At least we are beginning to address it but there are major problems or gaps in this legislation because it is being whacked through, or, perhaps, the Minister is whacking it through with the these gaps and problems because he hopes everyone will be looking at Garth Brooks and the summer holidays and, therefore, we will not be looking at the deficiencies of the Bill and the issue of the guarantee. It is good that there is a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. I welcome this although it is a pity the Minister will not do all the other things that the SMEs have been asking for. It is a pity the Government is not doing something about the rates system or public contracts, which are going to multinationals all over the place instead of small and medium-sized enterprises and benefiting local economies. It is pity the Minister does not do something about the disaster of parking charges and so on. Unbelievably, the Comptroller and Auditor General wants to spread the disease of parking charges, which has blighted Dún Laoghaire's small and medium-sized enterprise sector, over to Howth and other such madness. At least we are talking about prioritising SMEs. The banks have singularly failed to help them, although that was supposed to be the purpose of the billions of euro we poured into those banks. Why is this strategic bank not dealing with other areas? KfW, the German strategic bank that will be investing in this bank has a far wider mandate than the mandate proposed for this bank and, crucially, it includes housing finance. This week the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and all the organisations dealing with the mortgage distress have all said the insolvency legislation is failing abysmally. They indicated that the banks have refused to engage properly with the mortgage arrears process. There are 136,000 households that are financially crippled and, consequently, unable to participate fully in the economy or help it recover because they are in mortgage distress. The banks are not interested in them or in the impact that their situation has on the wider economy. Why is this bank not going to deal with that area? Distressed loans should be transferred. The loans of people who cannot get a decent deal from the banks should be transferred to this State strategic bank and it should give them a decent a sustainable mortgage arrears resolution for their situation. I have tabled amendments to the effect that the mandate should be widened at least as far as that of KfW, which the Minister is proposing as a co-investor in this bank. The problem is similar with the issue of housing, which, we know, is an absolute disaster. We have seen hand-wringing from the Government on the issue of housing but no concrete action. The key issue is that the banks are not interested in financing the type of social and affordable housing that we need, yet here is an ideal opportunity for that to be done. This bank should have addressed housing as part of its mandate, just like the American Federal Reserve. The issue of housing is critical. Financing social and affordable housing is in the interests of citizens and vital in terms of the macroeconomic stability of the economy and the wider housing market. This should be one of the key priorities and imperatives in any strategic bank but it is not included. I will be dealing with the guarantee in the amendments later. It is absolute madness. At the very least the Minister should accept an amendment that will require any bank guarantees given to KfW or the European Investment Bank to be examined. It seems we have to bribe these banks with guarantees although this country has been bled dry by Europe with the debt interest repayments. We must bribe these banks with bank guarantees for them to invest into our economy. It is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I should have said that. I am sorry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Especially if the Government can micromanage Garth Brooks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, line 27, after "SMEs," to insert the following:"bodies seeking to provide social housing on a not for profit basis and households in mortgage distress unable to secure sustainable resolution arrangements with their mortgage providers,".Whatever about disagreements and criticisms in terms of the timing of this Bill, the principle behind it enjoys general support in the sense that we need a strategic bank which fills the gap left by the pillar banks and commercial and private banks and so on who appear to be averse in investing in areas which are of benefit to the wider economy and our strategic objectives to develop it on a sustainable basis into the future. That is positive. The focus on SMEs which is the declared priority of the Bill and is explicitly set out therein is right and proper for the reasons, as mentioned by the Minister and other speakers, that the SME sector is the lifeblood of the economy; 70% of people working are employed in the SME sector and if there is going to be meaningful economic recovery we need to help SMEs, which the banks have failed to do. To my mind, there is an unwillingness on the part of Government to tell the banks what to do despite that we own some of them and have bailed out all of them. Given they are clearly not doing what they need to it is right this bank should fill that gap. There are other priorities, which I believe should be explicitly set out in the Bill. The amendments in my name seek the inclusion of two other absolute strategic priorities, including address of the issue of mortgage distress. The committee of finance, of which I am a member, was informed this week of the multiple failings of the pillar banks and mainstream banking system to properly engage with distressed mortgage holders and the MARPs process. At a briefing yesterday with Grant Thornton and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation we were told of the pathetic number of cases dealt with under the insolvency legislation.When it was first put through, the then Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, stated that 18,000 cases would be dealt with in the first year. In fact, only a few hundred cases have been dealt with. The Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation told me yesterday that 10% of those on AIB's mortgage book had to engage with it because the bank would not engage with them. It is not capable of doing so. The banks, therefore, are not doing what we need them to do, nor are they doing what we hoped the insolvency legislation would force them to do. We have got to do something about this, not just because we care and should care about the 136,000 householders and families in arrears but also because it has to be a strategic priority. The Government stated it was a strategic priority to get the people concerned participating in the economy again, but they cannot do so if lumbered with mortgage debts. We will paralyse a very significant portion of the economy's capacity to recover unless we deal with this problem with much more urgency and speed than the banks have proved willing or able to demonstrate. That is why the series of amendments is proposing that a priority should be to offer a way forward for those in mortgage distress where they have been unable to get a decent, proper deal, or any deal, from the banks. It is proposed that their mortgages be transferred to the proposed bank. I talked to Mr. David Hall and representatives of Grant Thornton yesterday after they had given a briefing in the audiovisual room on the whole matter. I asked them what they thought of my amendment and Mr. Hall was certainly very positive about it. He stated it represented a very good idea that could really work. We obviously need to tease out the details, but there are many that need to be teased out in respect of what the Minister put in front of us. Will it really deliver for SMEs? We need to think about how the measure would work. What I believe should be a strategic priority for the new bank is a no-brainer. It is in line with the consensus on the need to make progress a hell of a lot faster and more decisively for those in mortgage distress than has been the case heretofore. I hope the Minister will consider the amendments seriously. There is a clause that refers to providing finance for those seeking to provide social and affordable housing on a not-for-profit basis. The Government has stated it wants to see this happen, but we have not seen much in the way of concrete moves to make it happen. When in the light of the housing crisis we on this side of the House talk about the need for a significant social and affordable housing building programme and the Government states there is a big problem of supply in the market which is creating a property bubble or the threat thereof, it seems obvious that we need a vehicle to provide the necessary finance for bodies that are willing to address this issue, be they voluntary housing associations or otherwise. We should seriously encourage co-operatives. I am always being asked by people in my area about housing co-operatives because they were a feature in the past. Building workers and people on the housing waiting list could band together, obtain some finance and use land not being used by the local authorities to provide social and affordable housing. The proposed bank should have as a priority the financing of such projects. Owing to all the bloody EU rules on financing local authorities, there may be difficulties, but we must find a way, perhaps through trusts set up by or sponsored by the local authorities, to direct money towards the building of social and affordable housing. These are very reasonable suggestions which I hope will receive the support of other Deputies. Others have mentioned in their Second Stage contributions that the mandate needs to be wider. The wider mandate has been talked about a lot in terms of the international banking system. Reference was made to the contrast between the focus of banks in Europe and that of banks in the United States, where the banking system, starting with the Fed, has a mandate that is much wider than just dealing with issues such as inflation and the bottom line. A key part of the mandate concerns employment and housing. These are imperatives for the American banking system as dictated by the Fed. We should follow suit, not that I am saying everything about the American banking system is wonderful. We need a wider mandate, particularly for the strategic State-sponsored bank. I hope the Minister will consider these amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sort of hopeful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will come back in on that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, what is format on Committee Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It might surprise the Minister to hear that I agree with many of the sentiments he expressed at the end of his contribution. I do think we need to look to the future and chart a strategic road ahead. This is essentially what the Minister outlined with regard to prioritising investment and political energy in key areas that can form the foundations of a balanced and sustainable economic future and development for the country and its citizens. I agree completely with the Minister on that point. Karl Marx said: "The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living." Stephen Dedalus made a similar comment in James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. It is true and could not be more accurately applied to what is happening in our economy at the moment, where the past does weigh like a nightmare on the brains and lives of the living. It is preventing us from moving down the road of the future, and this needs to be addressed if we are going to get beyond the current paralysis."Paralysis" is a fairly accurate term for where we are. This is another favourite Joycean term. Dubliners is all about the paralysis of the city and Irish society and culture at the start of the 20th century. For the past ten years we have witnessed paralysis, more or less. The Minister might point to the odd incremental improvement and we may agree or disagree sometimes but things are stagnant and, as a result, there is a great deal of despair and demoralisation and many people are struggling. The reason for that is the Government and the previous Government hoped that if they put the banking system back on the rails and imposed a little more regulation and tried to influence its priorities, it would begin to inject life into the economy, but it has not done so. It is not just about saying the Government was wrong and all the rest of it. We can argue that. I stress that my amendments fall far short of what I would propose. If I had a choice, we would send people marching into Bank of Ireland and AIB and boot the current boards out, take control of them and tell them what to do because we funded them. The Minister will not do that. I can say that but, having said it, we have to move on. I will campaign for that politically in other ways but in so far as there is a consensus regarding a strategic investment bank, which I welcome - it might be short of what I would like but at least it is pointing in the right direction - the question is what is its mandate. It is not only a question about the past, although my amendments partly try to address legacy issues, it is also about the future. I do not know what is the Government's position but the view has been expressed by Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Independents that the mandate of the banking industry in this country and in Europe is too narrow. I drew the contrast with the American banking system whose mandate predates the crash. Housing and employment are key priorities of that system. If we have rightly recognised the need for a strategic bank, surely the strategic priorities should not be only about SMEs. That is fine, although one might ask why it is not called the SME corporation bank if that is its only priority. I am not absolutely clear about the Minister's view on that. I accept SMEs are a priority but is the Minister saying housing finance should not be a key priority of a strategic bank? If so, I disagree with him not just because of the particular crisis we are facing but also, fundamentally, regarding what the mandate of such a bank should be. I ask him to note the fact that KfW, the bank to which he is looking to co-invest in this bank, has housing finance as one of its key mandates and imperatives. The very bank the Minister has involved in this process, and which presumably at some level he is trying to copy or to take aspects of what it does and import into our strategic bank, has housing finance as part of its mandate, which is correct. Why would we not do the same? This should be a priority anyway, regardless of our legacy problems but it should be even more of a priority because of them. They are a dead weight on the economy and on hundreds of thousands of our citizens who are unable to participate and function in the economy properly and that is acting as a serious drag. I raise a slight philosophical point. I do not know whether Minister has ever read the philosopher Jacques Derrida. I will go on a little tour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is. He is the famous deconstructionist philosopher. He pointed out that many of the dichotomies we take for granted are false and they do not exist in reality. That in a way is what Deputy Donnelly, myself and others are saying. Demand and supply are viewed as dichotomous when, in the real economy, they are not opposites or poles apart, as they are mutually interdependent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question of putting a roof over people's heads and not having them lumbered with mortgage debt and so on is intrinsically linked to their capacity to function economically and in every other way in our economy. It is reasonable that a strategic bank should have this as a priority. I do not deny the imperative relating to SMEs, but there are other imperatives and there is a significant overlap between them in respect of what the role, value and impact of a strategic bank should be. I urge the Minister to reconsider his view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, will Report Stage be taken? Will we go through all this again on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 5, line 29, to delete "the private company referred to in section 5" and substitute "a public company". The Minister should not be able to privatise this State bank at any point. One of the features of the bank bailout that drives me around the twist is that we bail out the private banks and, in some cases, nationalise them when they have wrecked the economy, put them back on their feet and, as soon as they start to look as if they can function again, sell them off so that future profits or benefits do not come to us. We do not benefit, notwithstanding that we bailed them out when they were on their knees and at risk of collapse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We take all of the hit, provide all of the protection and get none of the future benefit. I would hate to see that pattern repeated with a strategic bank. This strategic bank should not be open to being flogged off in part or in whole by the Minister at any stage. For that reason, I have tabled a series of amendments which underline that the bank is a public entity with a different focus, mandate and set of priorities and imperatives from the so-called "pillar banks" which have one motive only and seem far less concerned with the strategic priorities and needs of our economy and citizens. The logic behind the amendments is fairly self-evident although I doubt the Minister will accept it. I make the point nonetheless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad to hear the Minister assure us that this will be retained as a public entity. The Minister seems to be arguing that it is for practical purposes and for purposes of transparency that we must set up a private company with the Minister as the sole shareholder. Concerns about potential privatisation of Irish Water led to the Government explicitly including in the Irish Water legislation an insistence that it be retained in public ownership. Some of us remain sceptical about whether that will be adhered to, partly for the reasons referred to by Deputy Peter Mathews. There can be a hollowing out of public ownership from the inside when it is financed from elsewhere. If it is his intention that it stays public and that this is a practical way of organising it, can the Minister include, as suggested by Deputy Stephen Donnelly, something more explicit about it being retained fully in public ownership? This sets it solidly in legislation, lest future Ministers decide on, or are forced in, a different direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like the discussion we had earlier, I simply do not understand why we seem to be taking aspects of the KfW model but not all of it. I forgot to thank the officials for the briefing which was very illuminating. If I understand the position of KfW properly, it provides products directly, but these products are also made available through other banks. It is possible for an SME to obtain a KfW product from other financial institutions. However, if an SME goes directly to KfW, there will be a different product from what it might obtain from the banks, given their narrower commercial focus or orientation. KfW has a different mandate and, therefore, different products. If we are modelling the corporation on KfW, why are we not doing what it is doing also? Perhaps the Minister might explain why we are doing a little of what KfW does but not all of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:"(f) to create employment in the State,".My intention is to broaden this strategic bank's mandate so that we can move away from banks' overly narrow focus and instead focus on the strategic priorities for the economy and our citizens. Creating employment is a self-evident imperative for society. It seems reasonable to insert this imperative into the Bill's list, which currently includes the general and correct imperatives of protecting the interests of taxpayers and contributing to the economic development of the State as well as enhancing the competitiveness of the State. I am not so crazy about competition, but that is the Minister's bias. The list refers to these imperatives and broader strategic objectives, but it does not explicitly state the need to create jobs. The Minister might claim such is implicit in the bank's objectives, but I do not know why it would not be explicit. Sometimes, there can be a trade-off between imperatives if it is not fully understood that we want them all. In particular, some deem a competitive approach to be one that cuts jobs. I do not agree, but this is often how "competitiveness" is interpreted. In having a fully rounded set of objectives for this strategic bank, it is important to include as an informing principle an explicit commitment to create employment. Who knows? Maybe the Minister will accept this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's best instincts initially gravitated towards the value of this amendment, and then it seems the lawyers and officials pulled him back from it. I do not know what exactly happened, but the Minister's response is a little disappointing. Furthermore, it is a slightly contradictory response to say that although this legislation is about creating employment, we cannot put in that category for legal reasons because it goes beyond the remit of the Bill. I do not understand that. It is quite contradictory. It raises the question of why we do not call it an enterprise Bill or an enterprise bank Bill, if the Government wants to focus it so narrowly. That would be a good objective. I was chatting to a Fine Gael colleague of the Minister's outside the House who made the point that this legislation is very important in terms of the need to provide finance to the small and medium enterprise sector which is not currently available, and I replied that I totally agreed but that there are other strategic economic and social objectives which are as important for the economy and our society, and I would have thought that was what a strategic bank should be. If it is simply an enterprise bank, we should call it an enterprise bank or a bank similar to the former ICC, which was mentioned, but I thought this was a strategic bank and that it had a slightly broader remit. That is what the name implies, yet the Minister is narrowing its focus. To narrow it down to the extent that the imperative to create jobs cannot be explicitly stated in this section seems odd. To elaborate on the point I and Deputy Donnelly mentioned, the categories of growth, economic development and competitiveness in the economy are quite general and one could argue they go beyond the priority the Minister is putting on SMEs, because they are quite broad - namely, protecting taxpayers and contributing to economic development. Therefore, why would the category of employment not be set out explicitly as an imperative, as there are things that would significantly benefit from job creation which might not necessarily be ticked under the other categories or imperatives? I am surprised that the Minister will not accept this amendment, particularly when he is saying that it is the intention of the Bill, but we just cannot say so. It is an odd position. Perhaps he could explain that. It would be sensible to accept this amendment and it is what would mark out a strategic bank as opposed to another type of bank whose focus is more narrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to labour this point too much but the more the Minister says the less convincing it is. This is slightly worrying. There are regular engagements with the troika and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council during which we have sight of fascinating tables regarding GNP, competitiveness, investment levels and so on. What probably matters most to our citizens and to people in business is jobs. Leaving aside all of the statistical indicators and so on, the bottom line is returning more people to employment. Everything else flows from that. We appear to be doing things the wrong way round. We are not suggesting that everything should be turned upside down; we are just asking that what is sought in the amendment be included. I do not see how an objective for creating employment is in a different category legally or any other way from the other purposes set out in the Bill, including the economic development of the State. How is that objective legally different from or more important than employment in terms of the objectives set out in the legislation? This does not make any sense. These issues we are discussing and the legal advice which leads the Minister to reject these amendments further supports the claim that we should have had more time on Committee Stage to thrash out this legislation. I would like to hear a serious explanation of the legal advice that has led to the Minister saying we cannot include the creation of employment as one of the objectives of the strategic bank. This does not make any sense. I believe the Minister should reconsider this and, perhaps, interrogate his legal advisers a little more about it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the problem. We do not get the opportunity to interrogate the Minister's legal advisers, which we would like to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, Chairman, but as this is Committee Stage there is no harm in a little interaction. If sufficient time had been allowed for Committee Stage, we would have been able to thrash out this issue more seriously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Three minutes remaining of what?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am absolutely stunned. I am more stunned than I was at the start about the guillotine because I was under the impression that this was at least going to run until the close of business at 7 p.m. today. Now, we discover it is finishing at 4.40 p.m.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely shocking that the Government is doing this. It is cynicism beyond belief. It is bad enough that we would not have got through all the amendments but the fact we have not even got to the issue of the guarantee is shocking. This is €4 billion that we could guarantee after what guarantees did to this country, and the Minister has the right to give these guarantees to foreign and private investors. It is extraordinary that we did not have a chance to debate amendments on that issue and other important aspects. It is a shocker. It really is disgraceful cynicism. I believe cynicism lies behind it, which is even worse when we are dealing with such important matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that information as it helps put the jigsaw of what happened together. The issue of consultation will arise further on in this Bill. I am not a scientific expert. I am open minded on this and do not assume the worst, but I believe one of the things missing in regard to this is consultation, particularly in regard to the cutting down of 16,000 trees in a national park on what appears to have been a preventative basis. Subsequently, there has been some controversy over whether this was necessary. I am sure the labs say it was necessary. However, one thing Coillte is bound by, with its eco badge, is a commitment to public consultation on any significant action affecting the forests in its care and stewardship. As far as I am aware, there was no public consultation about this action, which has had such a huge impact on Gougane Barra, which is one of our most important national forests. Therefore, there are still questions to answer, but we can discuss them when we get on to the issue of the public consultation and the importance of having the most robust system of public consultation for dealing with forests. Much of the Minister of State's response to the proposal made in my amendment centred on the fact that with special areas of conservation and so on, our concerns are covered in terms of the protection of ancient woodlands. However, the point that has been made to me is that what we are missing are specific management plans for the remnants of our ancient woodlands. We need this because of their incredible importance as a crucial part of our heritage and as a genetic bank of biodiversity. We do not have this genetic bank with industrial forestry, which is mostly based on species that are cloned or imported, which are, therefore, genetically weak and more vulnerable to disease. Our native ancient woodlands are a genetic and biodiversity storehouse of our forests. Therefore, we need specific management plans to protect them against possible dangers and threats such as disease. That is the reason for these amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 7, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:“ “Rio Forest Principles” means the “Forest Principles” adopted at The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992;”.From my point of view, these amendments are some of the most important I have tabled. They go to the heart of what I and people concerned with the future protection and development of Irish forestry and woodlands believe to be quite central to this matter - namely, putting in place a proper definition of what constitutes sustainable forestry. Such a definition would inform both the Bill and our overall approach to forestry. The highest standard of definition that has been laid down in this regard is that which is contained in the forest principles adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which took place in Rio in 1992. Those principles make for fantastic reading because they provide a real sense of the multiple values and downright importance of forests and trees. In the day-to-day rush of life, work, stress and pressure, what is happening with our forests might not seem of immediate importance. However, the 1992 principles set out - in a wonderful way - how existence on this planet is dependent on forests, which are the lungs of the world. Our failure to protect them has probably been the single biggest contributory factor to climate change. Forests regulate both climate and weather, and massive deforestation have not helped in that regard. The World Cup is taking place in Brazil at present and the destruction of the equatorial rain forests in that country is a threat to the existence of humanity. An area of trees equivalent to that football pitch is cut down each day by people who either do not understand or do not care about the value of forests not just to the people of Brazil or the indigenous tribes that live there but to the entire world. If we do not do something to protect these forests, the whole planet will be under threat. What I am talking about is not a matter for the long-distant future. The impact of deforestation is apparent in events that are having an adverse impact on people in this country. I refer, for example, to flooding. Our native forests were cut down as a result of successive waves of British invasion and colonisation and we have done relatively little to replant them. This deforestation did considerable damage to the cohesion of the soil in this country. In so far as reafforestation has taken place, it has been industrial and monocultural in nature and the focus has mainly been on planting Sitka spruce rather than native species. That has contributed significantly to soil erosion, to the acidification of soil and rivers and to silting, all of which have an impact with regard to flooding, disease, etc. In general, the fertility of the soil has been adversely affected. I do not really want to do so but if I were to argue the matter in the context of economics, I could state that there would be huge potential - from the point of view of the economy and job creation - to expand activity in respect of the planting of native species way beyond the level that has obtained to date. Up to now, we have been far too focused on a particular industrial model of forestry that has failed on all sorts of levels. We are not meeting our afforestation targets and we were recently obliged to revise them. We are failing to diversify our afforestation activities by increasing the number of native species we could and should plant. The Rio principles set out why all of the matters to which I refer are so important for society and culture and refer to the importance of striking a balance in the context of social, economic and environmental concerns. They are vital to understanding the impact of forestry on many levels. The definitions contained in the principles were developed in Rio and it was a fantastic achievement on the part of all involved that they achieved a consensus about the vital importance of forestry. In such circumstances, it would seem sensible that the definition to which I refer should be inserted into the Bill in order to inform both it and how we deal with the process of forestry. In 2009, Mr. David Gunning, the former CEO of Coillte, when giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts, stated - I stress that it was not me or some environmental fringe group which did so - that, from many different points of view, the traditional forestry model used in this country was no longer viable and had to be changed. However, that model has not been changed in the interim. A major difficulty with the Bill is the fact that the review of Coillte, the largest owner of forestry in the country, has never been completed. This is because the Forestry Act 1988, under which Coillte was established and which predates the Rio principles, has never been amended.There is no review. We have not received the review - it was never completed - of what is going on in Coillte. The Bill that governs Coillte, the biggest owner of forests, does not take into account the Rio forest principles in terms of environmental protection, the importance of biodiversity and the multiple uses and value of forestry. That seems to follow through in some of the thrust and bias of the objectives of the Bill. I am hoping to insert these definitions of sustainable forestry from the Rio forest principles. There is still too much of an emphasis on the narrow industrial or commercial view of forestry. I use the term "narrow" because in arguing for the Rio principles and a more holistic view of forestry development I am not arguing against developing the economic potential or value of forestry. I am trying to explain that we have had too narrow a view of them, with an industrial approach based largely on one species. It has not really worked and is potentially damaging and threatening to the future of the forestry sector overall. If we really want to develop the economic, employment, tourist, amenity, biodiversity and heritage potential of forestry, we need to have a more balanced and sustainable long-term view, rather than a narrow focused industrial view. The Rio forest principles set the balance correctly in the most comprehensive way and better than any other forum. That is why they should be included in the Bill. That is the argument. As we signed up to them, why not include them in the Bill? I do not see any reason not to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not agree with the Minister of State who said there was no agreed international definition of sustainable forest management. I have before me the report on the United Nations conference on environment and development, annex III, non-legally binding authoritative statement of principles for a global consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. It is not legally binding, but we signed up to it. Therefore, there is agreement on the issue. This consensus is unprecedented at an international level on the nature of sustainable forestry. It is the most comprehensive statement on the matter and brilliant. My fear is that there is a reluctance to sign up to it in legislation because it would tie us to the sustainable forest model we need and that this might infringe on certain vested interests who have no wish to sign up to the model. That concerns me. It is not as if everything is well in the forest, to use a pun, when it comes to the forestry sector. We are failing to meet our targets. Biodiversity is under severe pressure. Let us consider diseases such as ash dieback, ramorum and so on which indicate that we have got things wrong. Native species are far more resilient and have an immune system that cloned and imported species do not have. We, therefore, need to change the model. We could develop a sustainable model under the Rio forest principles. I disagree with the Minister of State; it is critical that they be included.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 7, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:" "sustainable forest management" means the management of forests following the definition of sustainable forest management as set out in the 1992 Rio Forest Principles;".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 8, to delete lines 7 to 10 and substitute the following:"(b) to promote sustainable forest management as set out in the 1992 Rio Forest Principles, forest resources and forest lands should be sustainably managed to meet the social, economic, ecological, cultural and spiritual needs of present and future generations. These needs are for forest products and services, such as wood and wood products, water, food, fodder, medicine, fuel, shelter, employment, recreation, habitats for wildlife, landscape diversity, carbon sinks and reservoirs, and for other forest products;".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 9:In page 8, line 17, after "against" to insert "the harmful effects of pollution including airborne pollution and".The reason for this amendment is self-evident, in that airborne pollution is a danger to forestry and it should be explicitly set out that we seek to protect our forests from it. I am taking my lead from the Rio forest principles. Indeed, the amendments' phrasing is taken directly from Article 2(b) of the declaration's principles and elements section. The declaration rightly recognised the need to indicate the various threats to forestry and woodlands against which it was critical to protect. If we are to protect our forests, ancient woodlands, biodiversity and so on properly, we need to recognise this threat when developing forest management, protection and conservation plans and measures. These are sensible amendments that follow an international precedent and I do not know why the Government would not deign to accept them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am afraid that was not convincing.The demarcation lines of bureaucracy and Departments should not be what inform our approach to forestry. We often hear the phrase "we need joined-up thinking" and often people comment of the lack of it in Government and in other areas. Where areas overlap and there are certain demarcation lines, we need flexibility and imagination and to remember that what is important is the issue with which we are dealing and not the pre-existing demarcation lines set by the Government and bureaucracy. If such flexibility and creativity informed the way the Government works, it would work much better and probably alienate far fewer people.  The Minister has not given a terribly good explanation for not being able to accept the first amendment in this grouping because in terms of what I proposed we are dealing with forests and this is the Forestry Bill. Let us get the protections and the approach to it right and let the Government catch up with how it deals with overlapping responsibilities between one Department and another. I am sure they can figure it out. I do not accept the argument he put forward. Principle 2(b) of the Rio declaration states: "Appropriate measures should be taken to protect forests against harmful effects of pollution, including air-borne pollution, fires, pests and diseases, in order to maintain their full multiple value." That is the holistic and right approach. On the Minister of State's response to the second amendment in the grouping, there is a tendency in many of his responses, and it is also inherent in the Bill, to create a false tension between the forest owner, particularly the private forest owner, or the farmer and more environmental concerns. The thrust of all my amendments is to point out that this is a false distinction. What is good for the forest is good for the farmer but it is not always seen that way. The way legislation is often framed is informed by the view that there is some contradiction between those two things and there is not. If we do not understand that and overcome that false distinction, we will do a disservice not only to forestry but to farming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 10:In page 8, line 18, after "species" to insert "in order to maintain their full multiple value".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister accepted this one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister may have accepted it. Did he? I submitted all my amendments from Committee Stage for Report Stage but I note from the Bill, as amended, that paragraph (n) is included. Is the wording of it the same as proposed in my amendment? No, my apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 8, to delete lines 27 to 31 and substitute the following:"(n) to promote and monitor the protection and enhancement of water quality and water status in all aspects of forestry, so as to ensure that forestry plans, operations and forest-based activities regulated under this Act are compatible with the requirements of Directive No. 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 on water policy;".I am a little confused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will wait to hear the Minister of State's response before I speak on the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That might explain it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will submit to the Minister of State's guidance on that one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 12:In page 8, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"(o) to promote conservation, expansion, restoration, and positive management of natural and semi-natural woodlands, including the remnants of Ancient woodland and ensure that management plans are put in place for these woodlands once identified, whether they occur in Special Areas of Conversation or Natural Heritage Areas or otherwise, and that this is prioritised in forest policy;".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 8, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"(o) to promote silviculture based on natural conditions using continuous cover forest planning and management using native species adapted to the site, having small scale operations and by encouraging natural regeneration, ensuring the protection of rare, endangered, and ecologically important areas while maintaining, conserving and enhancing biological diversity in forest ecosystems;".I have made many of the arguments already for what I propose in this amendment and I will not labour the point. As in the case of many of the amendments I submitted, I stress in respect of this amendment the need to develop our native organic forestry which has been massively depleted in favour of deforestation, in the first instance, and in so far as we have started to recover forestry in Ireland, it has been too focused on an industrial and monocultural module and too narrowly focused on the idea of developing its economic potential. This amendment proposes a different model and approach which recognises the multiple values - the environmental value but also the economic, social and cultural value of recovering and regenerating our native species and woodlands. The Minister of State in his last response spoke about wanting to encourage people to take up forestry and to use land that is not being used for other purposes, and I agree with him completely on that point.I do not want to do anything to discourage this. What we need to do is create an understanding among people of a slightly broader view of what the forestry sector can be and how, if we embrace and develop that broader concept, everybody can be a winner, including the environmentalists, farmers, the economy, rural communities and even urban communities which should also develop forestry. Everybody can be a winner in terms of job creation and the development of much more community-based forest-related industries rather than industrial processes and so on. That is the thrust of many of my amendments, including this one. The value of forestry has not been fully grasped. When the case in this regard is presented, people immediately see the value of it. This was evident in the huge outpouring of concern about sale of Coillte's harvesting rights. When people thought about it, they came to the view that our native forests were important to us but that we did not think about them most of the time. The more one thinks about and understands forestry, as I have come to do in the past year or two, one realises we are not getting it right. We need to radically shift what we are doing if we are to make forestry sustainable and develop its enormous economic potential. It will take a more holistic view of forestry to develop that potential.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State welcomes my positive attitude and I welcome his. While there are different forest management approaches and so on, overwhelmingly, the forestry sector has been focused on one system, namely, the big industrial single species clear felling system with sitka spruce. We need to move away from this system. The situation in Gougane Barra is possibly an indication of why we must move away from this approach. What happens if the forestry sector in Ireland which has the potential to create jobs and so on is suddenly hit - it is very vulnerable to this because we are so focused on one species and one approach to forestry - by a serious disease that wipes out a substantial portion of our currently economically valuable forestry? That would be a disaster and it could happen given what happened in Gougane Barra. The point about this approach and specifically promoting and upgrading the importance of developing this type of forestry system is that it is more resistant because it encourages a greater level of biological diversity and, therefore, a type of immune system against threats, diseases, bad weather and so on. That is the reason I suggest we need to recognise specifically the need to develop forestry in this direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 8, after line 35, to insert the following:"(2) The Minister has a duty to provide information to ensure the public and other authorities are regularly informed on the role and condition of forests as well as on all forestry activities.".This amendment relates to the entitlement of stakeholders, communities, environmental NGOs and so on to information on the development, planning and management of forests. It is important that this imperative be provided for in the legislation. This is important for many reasons, one of which follows on from comments made by the Minister of State. In terms of the need to develop forestry and win people over on the huge potential it presents, we should start the process by involving those who are most enthusiastic about forestry. I get the sense from people who spend all of their time worrying about these issues that there is deep alienation from the powers that be, including the Government and Coillte which owns half of the forests in the country, in the planning, management, development and protection of forests. We need to address this issue. We need to unite all of those with an interest in developing forestry. From the involvement of all stakeholders will come better ideas.People will learn from one another. They may also learn to overcome certain suspicions they have about one another. I still believe - it is not the Minister of State's fault - that environmentalists and farmers are still suspicious of one another and that these suspicions need to be broken down. The involvement of all stakeholders, including NGOs and those with environmental concerns, would help to overcome suspicions to the benefit of forestry as a whole. People could learn from one another. A farmer must make a living and an investor in forestry does not want to be burdened with unnecessary regulations that might hamper his ability to make a living. Sometimes, perhaps, environmentalists need to understand that. Perhaps they do not fully appreciate it all the time. Equally, farmers sometimes do not fully understand the knowledge and value environmentalists could bring to developing forestry to the benefit of everybody. Over the past year or two I have been forced to learn a little about forests, given the campaign we are involved in. I learned about agro-forestry and how planting native species on the boundaries of land used for growing crops or grazing cattle enriches the fertility of the soil on that land, thus benefiting the produce. Therefore, there is a double benefit. One is not only developing forestry, because there are also spin-off benefits at all sorts of levels, including for the farmer and environment. The land being used for a more conventional agricultural purpose benefits. Perhaps this is not always fully appreciated. These are examples of where more buy-in and participation from NGOs, concerned community groups and other stakeholders could actually result in the development of forestry to the benefit of everybody. With regard to information, let me return to the subject of Gougane Barra. There is suspicion about this matter. I do not know whether it is justified, but there seems to be a lack of information on the basis for the decision that was made. I submitted a series of questions, prompted by people concerned about the matter, and slowly information began to trickle out. Should a decision as big as this not have been subject to the making available of much more information? Should there not have been much more pre-consultation such that everybody would understand that action would have to be taken if there were a very big threat? On the basis of evidence to prove certain action is necessary, everybody could be satisfied. That has not happened in this regard and, therefore, there is suspicion and a bit of a cloud. I do not know the truth of the matter but I contend that there is concern and some suspicion. If this Bill is to help develop forestry, it must recognise these problems and set out to achieve an improvement by having a more robust regime for giving information to the public on what is happening with forestry. The public should be involved in decisions on the planning, management and development of forestry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are probably on the same page in terms of trying to move the situation forward.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not dispute that matters are progressing and that, hopefully, we have moved substantially from the era when decisions were made at the top and people were seen as a problem and an obstacle. There is improvement, but there is still a way to go in that regard. Some of the suspicions and concerns still exist, so we must move it forward and it would be useful to have a clear commitment in the Bill. Again, this raises the spectre of Coillte. This is not to cast aspersions on the people in Coillte, but there is concern about them being the owner of all of these forests and a concern that when many decisions are being made, people outside do not really know what is happening. That criticism comes from many different sectors. There is an imperative to overcome that and to have real information flow and real participation, not just consultation. Participation in decisions from a broad spectrum of stakeholders is quite important. Finally, with regard to Gougane Barra, was there consultation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about consultation. For example, was there consultation before the decision, justified as it may have been? Was there a consultation process?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an example of the need for wide-----
