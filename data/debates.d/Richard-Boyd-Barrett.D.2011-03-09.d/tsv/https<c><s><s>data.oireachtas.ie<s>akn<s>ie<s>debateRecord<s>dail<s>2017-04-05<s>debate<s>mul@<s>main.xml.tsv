RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am amazed the last meeting took place on 7 March given everything that is happening.There is an unprecedented storm going on in terms of the behaviour of An Garda Síochána, the scandals around the breath tests, wrongful convictions and the questions over the Commissioner, yet the Cabinet committee has not met since 7 March. It is absolutely extraordinary. Even more extraordinary, the Taoiseach does not know when the next meeting will be. I want an answer to a very specific question. In my experience, it is unprecedented to table a parliamentary question and not get an answer within four or five days. I have raised this on several occasions. I tabled a parliamentary question on 23 February - I want to know if the Taoiseach's committee discussed this - asking how many people under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality were suspended on full pay pending investigation. I received an answer stating it was 26. I asked a follow-up question, which was whether the Minister could give a breakdown of the agencies under the Department of Justice and Equality in which these suspensions took place, the grade involved and the length of time the suspensions were in play. The Minister told me that she could not answer me. I find it completely unacceptable that she refuses to give me information. I do not believe that she does not have the information. To be frank, I suspect the information is being withheld because it is relevant to the question of whether Nóirín O'Sullivan should remain in position when she is under investigation for very serious matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like a response on this matter because that is not acceptable. Has the Taoiseach discussed it? Is he aware of these suspensions? Is there one law for Nóirín O'Sullivan and another for other employees under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This was a question of particular relevance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This was not just any question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or not. She has not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Without talking to the principal players. Amazing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not exactly evidence-based decision making.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not about Mr. Justice Charleton but about the Garda Commissioner.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This has nothing to do with the question the Taoiseach was asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Garda Commissioner is moving to subvert the commission of investigation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we get some answers, please?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Community national schools were established under the Fianna Fáil Government and their purpose was supposed to be to provide inclusive schools for children of all religious backgrounds. The former Minister, Mary Hanafin, effectively sabotaged that effort by commissioning a curriculum that required the religious segregation of schoolchildren for a substantial part of the year. Some nine of the 11 community national schools are now refusing to implement that curriculum and are rebelling against it because they consider it to be completely unworkable, unfair and unacceptable, yet the Minister seems to be refusing to commission a new curriculum that would end the unacceptable practice of religious segregation of children in those schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be clear. There has been a rebellion against the religious segregation required by the Goodness Me, Goodness You curriculum that was set. The Minister should confirm the programme was not set by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, although the community national schools' brochure claims it was. In fact, it was commissioned to Dr. Clare Maloney of the Marino Institute of Education, probably under the influence of the Catholic bishops at the time. The Catholic Church was the only religious denomination to intervene in the process.At the time, it said the basic requirement would be that religious instruction and formation of Catholic children in the faith by a qualified teacher during the school day would be a minimum non-negotiable requirement for new multi-denominational primary schools. No other religious denomination wanted to interfere or felt it was even appropriate to bring this into the schools, but the Catholic Church demanded that. At the time, Mary Hanafin took it away from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and gave it to the Marino Institute which came up with a curriculum that required religious segregation. However, those schools are now rebelling, voting with their feet and saying it is not acceptable. Will the Minister rewrite the curriculum or get the NCCA to do it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have great respect for religious diversity and people's religious beliefs, to which they are entitled. What is totally unacceptable, however, is the religious segregation of young children, particularly in a country where one religious denomination dominates. What was supposed to be a curriculum for multi-denominational schools, which was all inclusive, was then given over to a Catholic college that drew up a curriculum which effectively required segregation. The reason it is "evolving", to use the Minister's nice word, is because nine of the 11 schools established have opted out and have refused to implement the segregation that the "goodness me, goodness you" curriculum tried to force on them. We need to acknowledge what has happened here and scrap that curriculum. We should get the NCCA to draw up what should have been drawn up 11 years ago, which is a genuinely all-inclusive, non-sectarian, non-discriminatory, non-segregative curriculum that does not involve segregating children on the basis of some requirement to have faith formation within the school. That should be kept outside the school gates.
