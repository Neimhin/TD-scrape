RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The €3 million offer for retraining is an insult to Debenhams workers. The failure by the Government to ensure justice for these workers is appalling. I remind the Taoiseach that he said he could not put money on the table because it would set a precedent. A sum of €18 million is owed to the State by Debenhams. The Taoiseach did not mind setting a precedent when it came to bailing out banks to the tune of €64 billion. There was no moral hazard there, and no worry about the implications, but when it comes to workers who have worked for decades, who have done nothing wrong, and who are entitled to the two plus two agreed with Debenhams, we cannot underwrite them. We cannot guarantee to give them what they deserve, which is what even now the Government should do, and then it should pursue Debenhams. The Government is just standing idly by while saying there is nothing it can do for these workers, who are the most decent people one could imagine, and who have worked for this company, which has betrayed them cruelly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just sick of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was for the banks-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has had 250 days.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over the past three years, I have repeatedly raised the plight of tenants in the St. Helen's Court apartment complex in Dún Laoghaire. They have faced four attempts by two different vulture funds that bought the complex to evict them using loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Acts. They tried to increase the rent by 60% at one point, they then used substantial refurbishments as grounds for eviction and are now using sale of the property for that purpose. They failed to evict ten tenants and are now trying to evict eight instead to circumvent the Tyrrelstown amendment. This is the shocking, cold and ruthless logic of a profit-seeking vulture fund. I was in the offices of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, with the tenants on Monday. Some of them are in there today. There is a similar case in Rathmines, an area with three Government Deputies, in which a number of tenants were successfully evicted by vulture funds after fighting this eviction for a year. Why does the Government not close these loopholes and legislate to prevent this kind of vicious and ruthless profit-seeking logic at the expense of tenants, all of whom pay their rent? These are working people who will now face eviction in the teeth of Christmas and in the middle of a pandemic. Does the Taoiseach not think that is obscene behaviour which the Government has a responsibility to prevent to ensure that decent ordinary people who pay their rent are not dumped out on the street by vulture funds?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not get an answer to my previous question about vulture funds being allowed to evict people. I would appreciate an answer on that because it is happening in the teeth of Christmas. On public sector reform, the Government has thrown a considerable amount of mud into people's eyes in response to the demands of the student nurses and midwives to be paid for their work on placement, to be respected for the role they played during the Covid pandemic and not to be financially punished with the shocking fees they must pay, meaning they are actually paying for the privilege of being exploited. The Taoiseach's explanations to date have not responded to this point. The majority of the student nurses and midwives are saying they will leave when they finish their training because they have been treated so badly in their four years and because they are facing into an understaffed and under-resourced health service. The two things are directly connected. They regard their exploitation and non-payment as students as a precursor of what they will face afterwards and, of course, that is the truth. That is why the nurses went out on strike last year. Our health service is in a perilous state and our healthcare workers' morale is on the floor. That is why the Government should stop repeating this nonsense that it will somehow compromise their education to remunerate them during their training. It should remove the burden of fees from them. It would actually allow us to recruit and retain these student nurses and stop them flooding out of the country when we desperately need them to stay and work in our health service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Taoiseach to give a brief answer regarding the student nurses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are understaffed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The most pressing and urgent issue that we face on a shared island basis at this moment is the threat of Covid-19. The scenes in the North last night of ambulances lining up outside hospitals and massive overcrowding in the emergency departments because of Covid-19, frankly, had fairly alarming echoes of what happened in Italy early this year. That is a warning. Already, there are signs that in Border counties the high infection rate is spilling over. The parties in the Executive and the Government here should reconsider the importance of pursuing, on an all-island basis, a common, united strategy of eliminating community transmission, rather than the neither one thing nor another approach which is inevitably going to lead to further spikes and lockdowns. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a motion tabled by Solidarity-People Before Profit calling on the World Trade Organization, WTO, to follow the request of India and South Africa to waive intellectual property rights and patents in relation to the sharing of vaccine technology to the world's poorest countries, 25% of whom we are informed today will not have access to the vaccine by the end of the year, which could completely undermine the global vaccine programme. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a number of occasions in recent weeks and again with the Taoiseach today I have raised the issue of access to the vaccine on a global basis being critical to the effectiveness of the vaccine anywhere. If access is not provided to the vaccine for poorer countries, this potentially will create a massive hole in vaccine cover which will allow for mutations and potentially undermine the efficacy of the vaccine. We are literally all in this together. The report from Johns Hopkins University public health school today that up to a quarter of the world's population in the poorest countries may not have access to the vaccine until 2022 is a major cause of alarm. The report goes on to say that pricing issues are a problem. There are also different attitudes. While some are co-operating with poorer countries and with generic producers of vaccines in poorer countries, others are not. What will we do about it? People Before Profit has tabled a motion in this regard but, unfortunately, we do not have Private Members' time, so it cannot be taken until the new year. However, we appeal to the Government to look at the motion on the Order Paper today. It calls on the Government to raise in Europe the need to support the proposals from India and South Africa that aspects of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, relating to intellectual property regarding the vaccines and vaccine technology would be waived so there is no profit inhibitor on the distribution of the technologies that are necessary to produce the vaccine quickly and so generic producers around the world would be able to produce it. Indeed, we hears the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, saying there will be very low numbers of the vaccine here, that it will be perhaps by the end of the year and that the Government is not quite sure when it will have the rest of the population vaccinated, we start to worry even about this country. When will we get all these vaccines? There is massive pharmaceutical capacity in this country. Is there an issue with us having access to the technology, once it is available, and all the data? I ask the Government to support the proposals that have been brought forward, to vote accordingly at the WTO and to raise it in the European Union. All the normal mechanisms through which multinationals protect their profits, and are allowed to do so with laws on intellectual property, patents and so forth, should be waived. If we are serious about us all being in it together and trying to eliminate Covid-19, this is an absolute necessity. The Government must be very vocal and proactive in pursuing it. I also wish to raise the issue of content moderators. It is somewhat Covid-related but has another dimension. I do not know if the Minister of State has read some of the articles in the Business Post, but I have been in contact with some of the people who work in this area, although not directly in the well-paid jobs in Instagram and Facebook. They work for CPL/Covalent and Accenture in badly paid jobs but do incredibly traumatic work. They have to moderate vile content such as suicide and self-harm promotion, terrorist activities, abusive posts, videos and so forth. In one report by Facebook, over a three-month period there were 1.3 million posts relating to the promotion of self-harm and suicide. Human beings have the job of trying to weed these things out, and many of them are suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. They had to sue Facebook and so forth about it, and they did that successfully. Something must be done about this at European level to protect those workers and ensure they have proper counselling support. I also discovered when I talked to these people that, during the level 5 restrictions, more than 1,000 of them were working in the office when they should have been working at home. I believe there were similar situations in East Wall. It must be asked why the infection rates did not go down low. It was because the level 5 injunction that if people could work from home, they should do so was not being enforced and respected in some of these big workplaces that have more than 1,000 people going into them. That must be investigated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two people contributed a very important concept to our understanding of modern society: Hegel and Karl Marx. They spoke of the concept of alienation, which was brilliantly captured by Edvard Munch's famous painting, The Scream. While there are advantages to meetings on Zoom and Teams, the substitution for real human social interaction of endless Zoom and Teams meetings for all time to come with regard to how we interact to discuss the future of society is the definition of alienation. We will have a nation of people mimicking the scream depicted in Edvard Munch's painting. It is a horrible vista which I find fundamentally objectionable. It is an unfortunate reality that, in the midst of Covid, we have to live on Zoom and Teams. Even in a world without Covid, there would be times where such technologies would be useful. We have learnt something from the use of this technology. The idea that such meetings would permanently replace actual public meetings of human beings - although God knows where it will end as it may spread to education and all sorts of other absolutely vital human interactions - is, frankly, a terrifying and borderline dystopian vista. I absolutely object to this. This relates to another issue which has been alluded to. I object to the fact that we are dealing with all of these matters together. There are things in the Bill that are modestly progressive. I do not want to get in the way of these things, but I really fundamentally object to local authorities permanently having the option to replace public meetings with regard to development plans. There is not a shadow of a doubt but that it will set a precedent for issues far beyond those public meetings. It strikes at our fundamental nature as human beings. I mean that very seriously. Alienation is a reality and it has very detrimental effects on human well-being. We need to tread very carefully. To slip this provision into a Bill comprising three or four different disconnected elements at the last minute on the second last evening before the Christmas break is just not good practice. It is a very poor way with which to deal with very serious issues regarding how human beings come together to influence the future of their society. That is what development plans are about. As emasculated as local authorities have become because of policy moves to centralise control over planning and other functions, this is one power they still have and it is an opportunity for ordinary people to get involved. Coming together and interacting in a live environment is absolutely critical. I face a real dilemma. I do not want to get in the way of this Bill but I really object to this measure. I believe amendments have been proposed to address the issue. To be honest, we are a small party and do not even have representation on the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage so we are scrambling even to get our heads around what is in this Bill. There is something about residential tenancies, which is a critically important issue. There is something on the issue I have just discussed, that is to say, development plans, democracy and public participation in development plans. This is also a critical issue. There is also something on the issue of substitute consent, to which I will get in a minute. This is another absolutely critical issue in the context of the aftermath of the development of the wind farm at Derrybrien. In building this wind farm, there was a failure to comply with the environmental impact assessment directives as they relate to public consultation. In that case, the result was that a mountain fell down and slid into a river with disastrous consequences for the environment. Again, I cannot believe the Green Party is involved in this stuff. Its members have seen themselves as the guardians of good planning and so on yet the party allowed this to be rammed through at the last moment. It really annoys me. On the issue of residential tenancies, I would like to alert the Minister to something, but he has left the Chamber. People who fall into arrears as a direct result of Covid, if they can prove that to be the case, will not be evicted during this emergency period. I will not object to that but, to be honest, it is so inadequate it is sickening.I want to alert the Minister to this. This week I went to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, with tenants who are facing their fourth eviction attempt at the hands of ruthless vulture funds. These people really disgust me. They are using the window occasioned by the lifting of level 5 restrictions where a pause button was put on evictions. We could go back to level 5 again in January. As soon as the eviction ban associated with the level t restrictions was lifted, they went in ruthlessly to evict, in this case, eight tenants. They have already driven the previous 12 out through nasty tactics, grinding down the tenants, trying to exploit loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Act such as claiming sale, refurbishment etc. These ordinary people who have always paid their rent are now facing eviction. They are in the RTB and will probably lose the case this time because these guys have found a way around the Tyrrelstown amendment by evicting eight people instead of ten, which is what they really wanted to do. They will then move on to the remaining two who are left in six months, which the law allows. The Government allows this to happen coming up to Christmas and in the midst of a pandemic. Putting an absolute pause on those kinds of evictions should be covered in legislation this week. Instead we have a token measure which we will support, but it will do very little for people who face that kind of ruthless activity. Another example of the same thing happened in Rathmines this week where the same vulture funds were on pause because of the eviction ban occasioned by Covid and they have moved in and evicted the tenants in Rathmines. On substitute consent, again the measure seems to be at the absolute minimum of trying to deal with this. What do we call substitute consent? It is retention for developments that did not really comply with environmental directives, the need for proper public consultation or the environmental impact assessment of what these developments can do. We need to go much further in cutting out the abuse that is being done in this. There may be a place for retention and occasionally for substitute consent in exceptional circumstances. However, in general it is an abuse of the planning process and it is systematically abused by developers trying to get around the planning process, as we have seen in the case of Derrybrien and we are seeing it again in Donegal. God knows, we may see it with the Dublin Array development which is proposed to be built close to the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank. Will there be proper impact assessment of what they will do to the Kish Bank and the biodiversity, marine diversity and so on that exists on that bank? These are very serious issues. I will not get in the way of the measures that marginally improve the situation from what it was. Deputies Ó Broin and Cian O'Callaghan have a good amendment which I hope passes, but this is not a good way to do business. The permanent option to have online and not physical public meetings on development plans is not on and needs to be withdrawn by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a few legitimate points to make.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Five minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Acting Chairman. That is very generous of him. I made my points on Second Stage but I will briefly summarise them because the Minister was absent at the time. I am unsure whether he is aware of the points I made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I heard those comments and I will deal with them in a minute. Actually, I will deal with them now. The Minister should not attribute quotes to me that I never made. I never, ever used the phrase "tsunami of evictions". A very well known housing activist who is not a Member of this House used that phrase. In my opinion, his concerns were just concerns, given the heroic role he plays in dealing with the homeless in this city and his awareness of how most of the people with whom he has to deal were evicted from private rented accommodation. As we are on the topic, it is disappointing, given that the Minister has brought in a number of unrelated issues in one Bill in this completely unacceptable way of doing business, mixing moderately good things with some really not good things, that he did not do something really important, such as address the issue of vulture funds evicting people and using the issue of sale as the excuse for so doing. As I warned the Minister, as soon as the level 5 restrictions and the pause on evictions that goes with them was lifted, the vulture fund that owns St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire moved in on the tenants. This week, I had to go down there with the tenants and face the vulture funds and their heavyweight barristers, who pretty much stated that the evictions may be immoral and driven by profit, but they are within the law. That is essentially the argument made by the barrister for the vulture fund. On a previous occasion, the vulture fund tried to evict ten of the tenants but the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment protected them. The vulture fund got legal advice, reduced the number to eight and it moved to evict those eight tenants as soon as level 5 was lifted. Why did the Minister not close that window? Those tenants will now almost certainly be evicted. They will then rock up at my office and the offices of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, looking for homeless HAP or emergency accommodation. The Minister could have stopped that through this legislation if he had listened to the facts. Similarly, I just heard today that, following the lifting of the pause on evictions, residents in Rathmines were evicted this week in the teeth of Christmas and in the midst of a pandemic. The Minister should have brought in a Bill to stop that from happening. On substitute consent, we will discuss the issue further on Committee Stage. The Bill contains the bare minimum required to deal with the Supreme Court judgment issued in July and the ruling of the European Court of Justice ruling. A lot more needs to be done. I heard the Minister's response to my comment that there is systematic abuse of substitute consent. I say there is systematic abuse because it involves the big guys deliberately trying to do the minimum in terms of environmental impact. It is not the number of applications for substitute consent. Some of these big, profit-driven developers try to do the absolute minimum in terms of public consultation and environmental impact assessment. Substitute consent, that is, retention, is a mechanism essentially to sort of get them off the hook after the fact. I welcome the moderate measures forced on the Minister, but a hell of a lot more needs to be done. This will be a live issue with more developments of giant wind farms and so on, both onshore and offshore.  On the issue of real, physical public meetings not having to take place, that is justified under Covid but it is pretty depressing having to substitute real public meetings for Zoom meetings or Microsoft Teams meetings. It is not good for the human spirit, democracy or planning. It has been forced on us in Covid, but to make it permanent is fundamentally wrong. That wrong move should not have been included in a Bill that we would otherwise support, albeit not with great enthusiasm, for the modest improvements it contains. The Minister should not have included that measure. It is controversial and fundamentally misguided.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to be brief because I am conscious there are many other amendments coming up on other important aspects of this Bill. I ask for a serious response from the Minister on the issue of public meetings. I support amendments Nos. 5 and 6. There are good suggestions in both amendments and they revolve around the importance of public meetings and the involvement of the public in the development of a county development plan. Interestingly, Deputy Mattie McGrath and I do not always agree-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. Here we are ad idem in warning the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien - I am being deadly serious about this - about something that the great revolutionary and philosopher, Karl Marx, called "alienation". It is a very real thing. If the Minister wants to know the modern definition of "alienation" in the midst of Covid, it is "If I have to attend another Zoom meeting, I'll scream." We all know that feeling. Zoom is a good technology. Teams is a good technology. It has its uses and it can even expand public consultation but it is not a substitute for real human beings gathering together to discuss their area, their future and the planning of our society. The idea that an emergency measure, which would allow the suspension of public meetings and is necessary during Covid-19, would become a permanent measure and be described as "modernisation" is wrong. It is wrong-headed. Amendment No. 5 also suggests the inclusion of the word "and". It would be fine if the legislation stated that the local authorities would organise online meetings "and a public meeting". That might genuinely expand participation in county development plans. For local authorities to have the option not to have public meetings is a retrograde step. It sets a precedent, which I would not like to see, and it presents a real danger in my opinion. For all of the good things about Teams, Zoom and virtual meetings and so on, they should not become a substitute for real, physical gatherings of people to discuss things that matter to them, including the future planning of their local areas. The analogy with Marx is a strong one. As the person who developed the concept of alienation and warned how certain modern industrial practices could lead to ever greater alienation of human beings from one another, the first practical campaign he got involved in was in regard to a decision to enclose forest land that had been open to all the rural people to gather wood. That had been the history. The forests were common and the people of rural Germany could collect firewood for their homes. In the 1840s, there was a move to fence off that land so it was no longer possible for people who did not own those forests to gather the wood. There was a huge campaign against that. The modern equivalent of that is rezoning, which is one of the things that happens in county development plans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They discuss plans to rezone lands. They also need to acquaint people with the process, which many people do not understand. There is a huge deficit of participation in these things.On many occasions l have seen last-minute proposals for rezoning of land, sometimes from members of the Minister's party, where there has been no consultation. The public often alert us to such moves. During a Zoom meeting, funnily enough, a young person who is developing technology warned me about what used to be a small pitch and putt course in my area, in Johnstown. I did not know who owned it. It was owned by a community collective and somebody has fenced it off for the last 12 years. I had not noticed it because it was hidden behind other buildings. That individual in that community suspects the council is going to try to go for adverse possession of that site. I will be watching out to see if there is an attempt to rezone that land in the development plan that is being discussed at the moment. It is at public meetings that things like that tend to come out, where real human beings meet each other and chat and discuss what is going on in their area. That is how those things come out. This change is not a good thing. I would say yes to holding public meetings and online meetings but no to online meetings becoming a substitute for real public meetings. The amendment from Deputy Mattie McGrath and his colleagues is good in that it argues for a more proactive approach in local authorities, which would actively seek the participation of the community and the public in the development plan. That does not happen enough. There is enough alienation from these things, there is not enough public participation and both of these amendments are absolutely right. I ask the Minister to respond genuinely. He will say that this only relates to this stage or that stage but I do not see how he can suggest the possible elimination of public meetings at any stage in the development of county development plans. That is a retrograde move which I oppose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nor your good self.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As with many of the things we are dealing with in this final week - we had discussions about the complexity of the previous Bill and the multiple issues introduced, some of them at the last minute - it is worth noting that this Bill deals with a significant matter relating to the financial vehicles through which the Irish and global super-rich get even richer. This very significant Bill being dealt with on the second last day of the Dáil in the dead of night effectively focuses on the enormous investment funds and one of the particular vehicles through which these enormous funds are invested in order to make money for very rich people indeed. The scale of investment funds that are domiciled and administered in this country is staggering. At €4.9 trillion, it is an astonishing amount of money. Based on what I have read, the Bill was written by the investment fund industry. It is to facilitate the investment funds. While the Minister of State might say that the issues about beneficial ownership, in other words, finding out who the key investors in these investment funds are, is a progressive move creating greater transparency about who owns these funds, there is a threshold of 25% of the fund for the beneficial ownership register. As I understand it, we will not have full transparency about who many of the investors in these funds are because most investors in these funds will be below this threshold as they tend to have multiple investors with smaller percentages than that. When the Bill went through the Seanad, Senator Higgins pointed out her concerns that the Bill might fail to align with objectives of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process. That base erosion and profit shifting leads to an enormous leakage of what should be taxable profits for different states because they operate through these multinational investment vehicles, often quite opaque vehicles in which nobody really knows who the investors are and there is very little oversight of these matters. Through various mechanisms, these funds pay very little tax. Our Government proactively facilitates this through various tax measures. Through legislation like this, it tries to encourage this type of investment here which is often effectively a way for the rich to launder their money, avoid tax and make more money. It is worth flagging that because most people do not know about these things. When we say that there should be more money for Debenhams workers, for the health services or to pay student nurses, the Taoiseach often accuses us of economic fantasy, but it is precisely when we look at these areas, which often few people even know about, that we find these opaque financial vehicles the administration of which is located just down the road here in the Irish Financial Services Centre, where trillions of euro are washing through with very little tax paid. It is important to remark on that fact. In that regard, it is worth noting that the Bill was introduced by Michael D'Arcy when he was a Fine Gael Minister of State. Shortly afterwards he went off to work with the body that lobbies on behalf of these investment funds, which was rightly remarked on as completely inappropriate. Despite the seriousness and the scale of money movement that will be facilitated by the Bill, pre-legislative scrutiny was waived at the request of Michael D'Arcy. After being the Minister of State who sponsored the legislation, he then went off to become a lobbyist for the very industry that will benefit from and which is promoting the sorts of measures that are contained in the Bill. For years, successive governments have being promising to legislate to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report and to legislate to change the priority creditors to prevent a recurrence of what happened with Clerys, Vita Cortex and so on, but here we are with Debenhams, and strangely none of that has been done.It has been mentioned and there are promises in the programme for Government, but it has not been done. This aspect has been done and got into legislation on the last night before Christmas. This is a priority. I refer to the legal mechanisms to facilitate more speculation for profit by super wealthy global investors. I certainly have significant concerns regarding this endeavour. Frankly, I do not even fully understand these opaque instruments which are being used. Invariably, however, when we look at things such as section 110, and other similar aspects, such as Irish collective asset management vehicles, ICAVs, these are things touted by big accountancy firms as a means through which the rich can invest their money and pay little in tax because of loopholes provided in this country. It is important to remark upon that concern and to try to ring the alarm bells in that respect, although I am sure that at this deathly hour no journalists, or anybody else, will be watching. Nonetheless, for the record, it is important to signal that this is the dark financial side of how the system really works.
