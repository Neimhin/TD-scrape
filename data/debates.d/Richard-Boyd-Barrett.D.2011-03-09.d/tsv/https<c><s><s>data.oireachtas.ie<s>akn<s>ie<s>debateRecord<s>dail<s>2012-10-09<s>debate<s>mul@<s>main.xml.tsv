RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is if there are any of them left in the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will all still be voting the same way on the budget.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Constitutional Convention not a complete, utter and deliberate distraction from the real issues about which people are concerned? It is mere window-dressing to distract from the Government and the troika careering ahead with wholesale privatisation, cuts and austerity. The Constitutional Convention is supposed to deal with political reform. Given that the Government is privatising, slashing or cutting everything that moves, one is obliged to wonder what will be left for any political structure to govern in the future. By the time the Constitutional Convention has the opportunity to discuss matters, everything will have been either outsourced or privatised. That is, of course, if it ever gets to discuss anything of a serious nature. If there was any serious intent behind what was envisaged, the one action that would have been taken would have been removing all of the political hacks from the equation. In the context of what is supposed to be a serious attempt to engage with the public on the need for political reform, I do not understand why there will be 33 politicians as members of the convention. Why are they needed? Why not have just one or two from each party, North and South? Why is it necessary for politicians to comprise one third of the members of the convention? What is the point in that? If there are sectors of civil society which are not represented at the convention and which want to be involved with it, why not remove some of the politicians and make it more representative of civil society? The criteria for selecting random members of the public from the electoral register are too limited and based on region, gender and age. What about social class and social and economic background, which are extremely important considerations? There is a need to broaden civil representation at the convention. We could do so if we removed some of the politicians and made provision for a broader cross-section of society to be represented. Why will the Government not allow the convention to set its own agenda? Why are politicians dictating what its agenda will be in advance? Why not allow it to meet and then decide - on day one - what it wants to discuss? If it was allowed to do so, the convention might have a very different set of priorities - in the context of what it might wish to discuss - than those set for it by the Government. If the convention was a serious attempt to engage with the people on the need for political reform, the Government would allow it to set the agenda. I urge those opposite to do precisely that rather than having a stage-managed, choreographed, contained and controlled convention which will discuss what the Government wants it to discuss and which will avoid all the substantial issues of concern to people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely not true. The Taoiseach should read the report in The Irish Times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With what? Is the Taoiseach referring to the aggressive behaviour that occurred?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should read the report in The Irish Times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should read The Irish Times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has the wrong party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind the Taoiseach that the State came into being as a result of protest and the mass movement of ordinary people. He should not be so quick to dismiss the idea of ordinary people taking to the stage of history and making vociferous demands for change.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record of the House, if the Taoiseach had read the report in The Irish Times from an independent journalist who was present, she made it absolutely clear that members of People Before Profit stood back, protested peacefully and were not involved in the activities to which the Taoiseach refers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should make it clear for the record of the House. Is it not the case that the Taoiseach is trying to predetermine the agenda of the constitutional convention and steer it away from any of the serious and substantial issues about political reform that need to be discussed by deciding in advance what issues it will discuss and what shall be at the top of the agenda, rather than allowing the members of the convention decide the agenda? I asked the Taoiseach to reduce the number of politicians involved. Why should one third of the membership be dominated by political parties which will have an advantage over just random individuals who are selected, in that they will be organised and subject to political whips? This will allow them to manipulate the debate if they wish in their particular favour. They should be given the same footing at the convention as every other individual who is present. On the question of social class being adequately represented, the fact that the members of the public are being selected from the electoral register will disadvantage people from less well-off and poorer areas because they are disproportionately badly represented on the electoral register. The electoral register is not the best basis from which to select the public members of the convention.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refuted your allegation that we were involved. You should be gracious enough-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it being abolished or privatised?
