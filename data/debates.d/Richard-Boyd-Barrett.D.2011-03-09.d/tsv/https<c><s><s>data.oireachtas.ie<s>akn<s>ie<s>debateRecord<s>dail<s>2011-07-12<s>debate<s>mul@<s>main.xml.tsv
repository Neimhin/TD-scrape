RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the timing of the Bill relating to the JLCs-REOs, why can legislation dictated by the EU-IMF be rushed through but not legislation to protect low paid workers?  Can the Taoiseach assure us, whatever about the timing of the legislation, that it is the Government's intention to ensure low paid workers covered by JLCs-REOs will not be financially worse off than they are now?  That is the assurance the unions and low paid workers in the retail, catering and hotel sectors, hairdressers and so on, who are the working poor, want.  They want an assurance that they will not be made poorer as a result of the legislation brought forward to deal with the issue.  That is what the people and the unions representing low paid workers want to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not an answer.  It was a straight question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's commitment to legislate in line with the Children First guidelines.  The Children First guidelines refer also to neglect by omission, for example the lack of intellectual stimulation, children missing school and the deprivation of intellectual stimulation as a result of that and how that might affect their later development.  What role does the Minister see herself having in implementing Children First guidelines?  The sentiment of legislation in this area may be admirable but how will the Minister apply this to cuts and caps on special needs assistants, the lack of which I know for certain in many cases means that some children will have support for only one hour's schooling a day?  How will she ensure these children's rights are vindicated in terms of the proper provision of the supports necessary for them to attend school?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Government not tax its rich friends?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the one with IMF written on the back?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is Deputy O'Donovan who should return there, I think.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the Deputies opposite recently castigated members of the Technical Group for never being positive.  To disprove that allegation, I propose to begin by highlighting the positive aspects of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are some positive aspects to the legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not, although sometimes this place would drive you to the drink.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The provision whereby those who sell alcohol will be held to some degree of responsibility for the consequences of its sale is certainly one of the welcome aspects of the Bill.  The introduction of a code of practice and the proposal to review licences where there is irresponsible behaviour on the part of sellers are welcome changes.  I equally welcome proposals to impose some type of code of practice on the advertising of alcohol.  It is sickening that large multinational companies in particular bombard the public with alcohol advertising conveying the message that their product will solve all of life's problems.  There should be restrictions in that area.  I also welcome the proposals to enhance equality legislation.However, I have concerns regarding some aspects of the Bill, particularly the proposal on the provision of legal advice to victims of human trafficking.  This crime is one of the most vile examples of a society that needs to do something about its priorities.  The commodification and enslavement of human beings, particularly vulnerable women, and their sexuality for the purpose of trade is a horror that must be dealt with urgently.  The proposal to extend the provision of legal advice to victims of human trafficking is minimalist and seems only to be included in order to bring us into line with demands from European and international bodies.  It is a case of doing the least possible required.As other Deputies have said, and as organisations dealing with the victims of human trafficking and the sex trade have proposed, we must go further on this issue.  The tiny number of prosecutions in this area clearly shows there is a problem in that the victims of these crimes are not coming forward because of a fear of the consequences.  If we want to give confidence to women in this situation we must show a seriousness about offering them support.  This means, at a minimum, giving them legal representation and not just legal advice, whatever that might involve.  In addition, some of our very draconian immigration legislation is part of the problem.  It is so weighted towards getting people out of the country as quickly as possible without giving them a fair hearing that genuine victims of the horrible phenomenon of sex trafficking will be discouraged and fearful of what is likely to happen to them if they speak up about their plight.  The very least this Bill should do is afford legal representation to people in that situation.I am broadly supportive of the proposed amendments to equality legislation.  However, I am concerned that the proposal that certain types of submissions be dealt with in writing only may have adverse implications for employees.  This amendment is being put forward on the basis of improving efficiency, but there is also reference to reducing expenditure.  My concern is that this is merely a cost-cutting measure which will lessen the opportunity for people who are being treated unfairly by their employer to make their case to the Equality Tribunal.  In other words, it is a way of fast-tracking complaints through the system.  I hope that is not the case, but it looks like it might be.On the bankruptcy issue, there is a need for legislative change in this area, but we also need to distinguish between different categories of people who find themselves bankrupt or insolvent.  As for those whose greed got them into massive financial difficulty as well as the country into massive financial problems, I have no interest in allowing them to walk away from their responsibilities.  However, people who find that they are unable to meet their mortgage repayments or to keep their small businesses going and face bankruptcy as a result — and many ordinary people find themselves in that situation — must be given a break.  The measures must be focused on the circumstances of homeowners and small businesses who find themselves in difficult circumstances in the current economic situation.  The big fish seem to be able always to get away with things.  If anything we should take measures to get some of their wealth from them and their wives.
