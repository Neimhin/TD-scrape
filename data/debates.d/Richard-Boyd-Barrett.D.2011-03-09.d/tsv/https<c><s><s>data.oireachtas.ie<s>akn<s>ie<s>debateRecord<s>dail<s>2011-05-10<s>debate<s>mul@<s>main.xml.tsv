RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has been reported — the Government has not contradicted this — that the combined cost of the visits of President Obama and the Queen may run to approximately €25 million. We still cannot get a straight answer as to whether this is the case. Given those reports and the growing number of experts and commentators internationally and domestically who are saying that our economy is ruined, the constant protestations of Ministers that they have no money for anything because we are in the straitjacket of the IMF and that the much vaunted jobs budget, now a jobs initiative which will be fiscally neutral, is looking certain to be a damp squib to beat all damp squibs because we are not allowed——

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the issues the Taoiseach said he would discuss with President Obama not be better discussed in a telephone call, which would be cheaper?If the Taoiseach insists on going ahead with this visit, will he ask President Obama if he thinks it appropriate that his Treasury Secretary, Mr. Tim Geithner, interfered with the negotiations over the debt burden of this country and vetoed plans to burn bondholders? Will the Taoiseach raise that issue with President Obama?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputies on the other side do not want to hear these questions because they are embarrassing.
