RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Newsflash - Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council just confirmed to me in the last few minutes that there are no family placements for people who are in need of emergency accommodation anywhere in Dublin. It is the first time this has ever happened. For Niamh and Anthony, a working couple both of whom are working, and their two children who are just finishing up school this week, this is a real problem, as it is for many others. Yesterday, through no fault of their own, they were evicted by their landlord on grounds of sale. They have nowhere - and I mean nowhere - to go. What should they do? I just want to know, very simply, what the Government is going to do for them and the many others. I have 12 other cases involving people who are due to be evicted in the next few weeks, in my office alone. We need an emergency plan now to provide family accommodation for people who are homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please do not interrupt me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like an explanation from the Minister of State. There is a load of amendments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the Bill that was originally discussed in the Dáil. The expression we use is that they are outside the scope of the Bill. They are completely outside of the scope of the Bill that was discussed here and they just appeared. The Minister of State might tell me there was great debate but from what I have heard from the Seanad, there was not much understanding of where these things came from there either. It is very sharp practice. That is not a comment on any of the particular amendments and, from what I can see, there are some we would support. However it is not good parliamentary or legislative practice to bring in a load of amendments that are way outside the scope of the Bill at this Stage, when we have not had a chance to look at or examine any of them. Will the Minister of State please explain this? This always happens, but I have never seen it quite as blatant as this, where we have a number of things that really belong in totally different Acts, for example, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, the Residential Tenancies Act and the Affordable Housing Act, which are all very distinct and separate things. This is a Bill about building control. Maybe someone else knows more than I do about this, but I think it is pretty extraordinary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a joke anyway. We only have half an hour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we get one amendment done we, will be lucky.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a totally-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to hear the Minister of State first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just find this extraordinary. The Minister of State is telling us he cannot answer the questions about these amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act that we have never debated in the Dáil and that are contained in building control legislation. The Minister of State who is taking the session does not know the answers. That is a joke of legislation. It absolutely makes a sham of legislation. I cannot believe it; well I can believe it actually, from this Government, but it is flipping outrageous. Do not get me wrong, extending the notice period is a good thing but at this point, given some of us have been screaming for the past few weeks that we need emergency measures on the number of families going into homelessness because of evictions and so on, we should be discussing this as part of a residential tenancies amendment Bill to ban all evictions and give greater protections to people in a situation where evictions and family homelessness are going out of control. Some of this seems okay. We do not really know what the rationale is behind other bits and the Minister of State has been sent in here to ram this through because that is what happens when you are ramming stuff through without proper debate. You do not send in the senior Minister because there is no intention to discuss any of this; it is just about ramming it through. All I can say is it is very sharp practice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is sharp practice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not blaming the Acting Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But just for the record, if we try to introduce amendments to a Bill that are outside its scope, we are laughed out of the room. We are not even given explanations. They are just ruled out of order, full stop. We are told this has nothing to do with the Bill. Now we have a whole load of them that are outside the scope of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is speaking on the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is speaking on the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is speaking to the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever you do, do not go outside the scope of the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is playing fast and loose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which amendment is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, this is not Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Acting Chairman. As we have already pointed out, we are discussing the nursing home support scheme and the Residential Tenancies Act. We discovered from the most recent response of the Minister of State that we are also talking about the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Act 2019 and changes being made thereto. We will not even get to discuss the amendments introduced at the last minute by the Government to the Affordable Housing Act.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I was not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure there were objections to this carry-on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure I am sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am deadly serious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes one cannot attend the Business Committee. I had a substitute there, by the way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished. I want the Minister of State to explain the changes to the Affordable Housing Act.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There you go. The Dáil has never discussed the amendments to the Affordable Housing Act.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difference between the "Tá" and "Níl" votes is greater than ten.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Fine Gael Deputies are rowdy.
