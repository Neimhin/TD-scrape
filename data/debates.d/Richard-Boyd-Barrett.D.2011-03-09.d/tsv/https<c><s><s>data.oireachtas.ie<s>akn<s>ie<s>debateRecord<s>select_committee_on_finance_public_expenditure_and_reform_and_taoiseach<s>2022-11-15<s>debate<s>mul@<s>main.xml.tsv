RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The argument that if regulatory measures are introduced, whether that is controlling rents to make them affordable or other measures to protect tenants, it will lead to an exit of landlords simply proves that the private rented sector is incapable of dealing with the crisis we now face. That is the inescapable conclusion. Notwithstanding the specifics of this credit or this or that measure, and I will come to that in a second, if that fundamental fact is not grasped we are not going to deal with the crisis. It is now clearly apparent that we are looking at a catastrophic market failure. The builders cannot build houses at affordable prices. The private rental sector is incapable of delivering affordable rents. Deputy Healy-Rae then says that if we try to do anything about that, all the landlords will exit the market. We hear this from the Government as well. It is a hopeless situation. You cannot win. We had better grasp that. The only medium- to long-term solution is the State, on a massive scale, ramping up its own provision of social and affordable housing, which is not dictated by market conditions or profitability but ipurely by the need to provide affordable housing. If we do not do that, it is not just the left that will be shouting and screaming. I met with representatives of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce today. They would be on quite a different end of the political spectrum from me in many regards. The first issue they raised was housing, the lack of affordable housing in the city and how that is causing massive problems in Dublin and in urban centres across the country. We are facing an existential crisis and we need to grasp that. I understand that this is just one measure but I personally do not believe tax credits are the way forward, or certainly not in isolation. They are just chasing unaffordable rents. It is, in effect, a public expenditure of money to chase completely unaffordable rents. Having said that, if that is all the Government is going to do, it should at least be the case that there is equitable access to those things. I do not agree with them in principle but there should be equitable access insofar as they are being made available. That is the logic of Deputy Barry's amendment.It seeks to ensure that, for example, people who are over a certain age or in full-time education are able to access the credit, along with people whose earnings are so low that they do not have a sufficient tax liability to access it. I will suggest for consideration another group that will not benefit but that needs support. I do not know if there figures as to exactly how many people are in this group but it is a big cohort. I refer to people who are paying housing assistance payment, HAP, top-ups. People who are in social housing or who are in receipt of HAP do not benefit. That is okayish if your rent is limited to 15% of your income but great numbers of people are paying massive top-ups in addition to the 15% of income that social housing or HAP tenants pay to the council, which is a scandal. I have just come from the Raise the Roof press conference where Louise Bayliss from Focus cited an example but I know that many in my constituency are also in this situation. In this case, the person, a single parent, was paying a couple of hundred euros to the council under a HAP arrangement but was also paying a top-up of €790 directly to the landlord. That person is getting no relief. I ask the Minister to respond to that. On the exit of landlords from the market, this is something of a mantra. The Minister has again cited Berlin as an example and so on. There is a way to stop that exit, which is for the State to buy up all of those properties, particularly where people are facing homelessness as a result of the exit although, frankly, I do not see why the State does not just prevent the exit of the properties. If the landlord wishes to exit for whatever reason, and I personally believe it has as much to do with high property prices as any regulatory or tax burden landlords believe they are suffering, the State has money, particularly in the rainy day fund, to buy property. That is a better expenditure of State resources because, if we do not prevent people from going into homelessness, it costs the State a hell of a lot more, even in HAP payments if such people manage to get a HAP tenancy at some point in the future. This is a very significant and ballooning current expenditure as against significant upfront capital expenditure in the here and now that saves the State money in the longer term and saves a lot of people real hardship.  I was dealing with a woman this week whose family, a working family, is over the income thresholds and is being evicted from the home she has lived in since the 1950s with her two children. She and her children were bawling crying in my office. There is nothing available to her because she is over the threshold. There is no emergency accommodation, no HAP and no possibility of social housing. She is absolutely goosed and, on the income she has, cannot afford the unaffordable rents seen essentially everywhere in the Dublin area. The answer to this, in addition to rent controls, rent freezes and so on, is for the State to step in and buy those properties to prevent families being made homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19:In page 59, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:
“Wealth Taxes
21. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the amount of revenue that would be raised if he were to tax the top 5 per cent of households 2 per cent of their accumulated wealth less 1 million for a family home.”.We are looking for a report on the amount that would be raised if we brought in a wealth tax, as we proposed we should introduce, which would be directed at the highest 5% of income earners. That wealth tax should be set at 2% of their accumulated wealth, less an allowance of €1 million for a family home. In other words, this is a wealth tax that is directed at the very richest and not at family homes. We have long campaigned for such a wealth tax. Our proposal is very similar to that put forward by Oxfam in its report. It is not exactly the same but is very similar to Oxfam's proposal that, like us, has identified the absolutely extraordinary accumulation in net household assets that has taken place over recent years. For example, Oxfam pointed out that there had been a €55 billion increase, if I remember correctly, in the net household assets of some of the richest people - billionaires - in this country over the past year or so and net household assets have now reached more than €1 trillion. That is a net figure that excludes household liabilities. I made the point earlier in this discussion, or possibly on Second Stage, that the Government does not compile regular figures, which it should, on the distribution of that wealth and those assets in order that we can see how that enormous figure of €1 trillion is distributed across the population. Who has it? Who has all that wealth? When the Department of Finance did some assessment of that in 2018, if I remember correctly, it indicated that the wealthiest 10% of the population have 53% of all that wealth. When we think about it, it is quite extraordinary that the wealthiest 10% between them have, if we extrapolate to today, more than €0.5 trillion in assets. I often hear the Minister say those assets are mostly property but when the value of their family home or principal private residence is excluded, which we have done, and subtract that from the more than €1 trillion, we are still left with an enormous sum for assets, whether these are property or cash and investment assets, which are not the family home. That is what should be targeted. When we talk about the top 5% of earners, we are talking about a little more than 100,000 households. These are the very wealthiest people. I do not have all the figures in front of me but, roughly speaking, if it is averaged out for that group, it would mean they have approximately €4 million each. It is a lot of money and they could afford to pay 2% on that, in our view. The Oxfam proposal is not dissimilar to ours. A hell of a lot of money could be raised from such a tax. In fact, when people are that wealthy, the value of their assets, whether they are investments, cash or property, would probably appreciate in value way in excess of 2% in any event. These people would not even feel it but it would generate quite a lot of revenue for the State that it could then use for things such as housing, public transport, higher education and all the areas where we need to invest money to provide decent public services, and to address the gap between rich and poor and so on. It is long overdue that we should have a genuine wealth tax - not a tax on the family home as per the local property tax - on those who have quite extraordinary levels of wealth, often in the form of ownership of multiple properties. In other words, these are properties beyond their family homes, where they generate revenue from renting them out, or just have lots of cash because they are very high income earners, or generate wealth and income from shares and investments and so on. That group of people does exist but there seems no willingness to make them pay a greater share of tax in order to try to narrow the gap between rich and poor and generate badly needed revenues for the State to invest in areas such as housing, health, education and public transport. We think that should be looked into. I know the Minister will not agree to it and does not agree with the principle but he might agree - because it would be fair and in the interests of having some sort of transparency about the distribution of wealth - that we should, at least every year, show how all that wealth is distributed, which is identified every year in the quarter 1 report from the Central Bank. That report usually shows the figures on net household wealth and that staggering year-on-year increase I mentioned, which has been going up every year. There was only one year when it went down, around 2012, but other than that it has been going up and up. It is a reasonable ask, if the Minister is not willing to support our wealth tax, to at least on an annual basis provide facts and figures on the distribution of that wealth. Who has it? We should see it broken down by the various income-earning deciles so we can at least assess whether a wealth tax would be a reasonable measure to look at. Most of the time we are kind of in the dark about all that. The elephant in the room is the inequality in distribution of the extraordinary wealth that exists in this country. We are one of the richest countries in the world. While the vast majority of people are struggling, a cohort in our society is very rich. Can we at least have the facts on that, if the Minister will not agree to our proposal for a wealth tax? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 20:In page 59, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:
"Reports
21. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the revenue gained from increasing corporation tax to 25 per cent for corporations with over €800,000 in profits and in closing loopholes that exist that allow corporations to hugely reduce their rate of tax.".I will make a short point because we covered much of this ground earlier. The most recent available figures for pre-tax trading profits are for 2020, and they were €193 billion. This is a remarkable 158% increase on 2012. Profits went up by 158% between 2012 and 2020. I am not sure where they are in 2022 but the Government is projecting €20 billion in corporate tax receipts. If one looks at the proportion of pre-tax profits in 2020 and the amount of tax paid, €193 billion in pre-tax profits brought in €11.8 billion in revenues in 2020. It would be fair to extrapolate that if the Government is projecting €20 billion in revenue in 2022, as the Government is, that would signify that the Government is projecting an even more dramatic increase in profits over 2021 and 2022. I note that €11 billion tax paid on €193 billion in 2020 is neither, as the Government often suggests, 12.5% nor 11%, nor, as the Minister often suggests, 10.8% or 10.9%. It is 6.1%. People can do the mathematics. That is the actual effective rate that is applied on pre-tax profits. It would suggest, if the Minister thinks €20 billion will be paid by the corporate sector at the end of this year, that we have seen a major jump in pre-tax profits for 2021 and 2022. I asked the Minister about this the other day. I do not know whether he has had a chance to look at the figures on how he is projecting that €20 billion but I presume it means he has some projection of what pre-tax trading profits are. I would be interested in the Minister giving us that figure, if he has it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is interesting. The amount of revenue that is coming in is even higher than expected. Given that €21 billion in corporate tax revenue is projected, I presume the Minister at least has a pre-tax gross trading profits estimate for 2021 and 2022. He must have if he can project the revenue amount. All the figures are not collated and there is a bit of a delay on that, which I understand, but he must have some projection for those figures. While he seems to be indicating the rate of growth may slow down a little, the figures suggest that pre-tax trading profits for 2021 and 2022 were a big jump from what we had in 2020, unless the effective rate has dramatically increased. That is the only other explanation for why so much extra revenue is coming in. Workers get some tax breaks, which means their taxable income and gross income are slightly different. However, the extent of the deductions, allowances and reliefs from which the corporate sector seems to benefit is of an order way in excess of what an ordinary workers gets in tax breaks. The figures for 2020 are the latest figures available to me. They show there was €193 billion in pre-tax profits but the taxable income was only €110 billion. That points to a huge series of allowances and deductions before we get to the taxable income. One might imagine a situation where workers had seen an 158% increase in their wages since 2012. They would be flying it. However, they have not seen anything remotely like that. There is an absolute profit bonanza happening. I always make these points because somebody has to remind people of them. This is going on more or less in the background. Every now and again we might hear that this or that company has made super-profits but the sheer scale of it dazzles me. It is extraordinary. There has been a 158% increase in profits between 2012 and 2020 and they almost certainly will go up further in 2021 and 2022. That must be compared with the situation of ordinary workers who, in the same period, might have seen their pre-tax incomes going up by a couple of percent a year, giving a total of perhaps 20%, if that. There is a big difference. This issue needs to be examined and, when one does so, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that these staggeringly profitable companies should be paying a bigger contribution in tax to our society. We must remember that they, as much as all the rest of us, rely significantly for their ability to make those profits on the infrastructure for which ordinary workers pay with their taxes. This includes water infrastructure, roads, the benefit they get from our education system and all the other things that are paid for by us. Workers pay €30 billion in tax every year, whereas out of the profits of these companies, which are far more than what ordinary workers earn, there was a contribution of only €20 billion to tax. There is a fundamental injustice there and I make no apology for highlighting it and suggesting we do something about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 21:In page 59, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:
"Reports
21. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on a levy on energy supply and generation companies to offset the increased cost of heating and energy for households.".As the Minister is aware, one area in which we have seen a significant increase in profits is electricity supply and energy supply generally. In the past couple of years in particular, while everybody has been hammered with extraordinary hikes in the cost of energy and heating their homes, the companies supplying the energy have enjoyed an absolute bonanza in profitability, with jumps in their profits they could only have dreamed of in previous years. While there are many losers from the cost-of-living crisis that is impacting so harshly on working people and those on lower incomes, there is a group that is benefiting from all of this. We have been calling for some time for windfall taxes. In fact, it has gone beyond that now in our view; these companies should be nationalised. I say that not just because of the immediate situation but also because as we start to develop our offshore wind and renewable energy resources, it is unconscionable that the benefits of developing those natural resources will accrue to private companies that will charge whatever price they like for them. We should nationalise them but I know the Minister will not agree to that. As a minimum, windfall levies should be put on these companies in order that we get something back on the super-profits they have enjoyed over the recent period. As a result of the pressure around all this, there were discussions at European level about that being done. Will we see a windfall tax and, if so, when?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not mind responding briefly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be very-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been very economical in comparison with some of what I heard in earlier discussions. How we invest in key areas like developing our renewable energy resources is an important question, even more so as a result of the current crisis. It is a mistake to cling on to the belief that we have to kowtow to international investors in order to get the level of investment we need to do things. I do not accept that argument. I know it is what the Minister thinks and it has been the consensus for approximately four decades since the neoliberal revolution, for want of a better word. We are seeing the bitter fruits of that in the energy crisis that we are now facing. These private companies literally have countries over a barrel - a barrel of oil or a supply of gas. That is a very bad position to be in. It is even more reprehensible that, in trying to respond to the current unprecedented crisis by rightly saying that we have to develop our own renewable energy resources so that we will not be over a barrel to these companies, we are going to do so by handing over all the means of producing renewable energy to private companies. It is utterly reprehensible that offshore wind development is overwhelmingly going to be to the benefit of private companies or, in some cases, state companies from other states. For example, a French state company could benefit more than our own State enterprises. The mind boggles that we could do this, but it is what we are doing. The mind also boggles at the fact that we have achieved no benefit at all for the consumer from the significant increase in the production of domestic renewable energy. Have prices decreased since we expanded to the point of 30% of the electricity produced in this country being domestic renewable energy? Has that reduced the cost of electricity by a single cent? No. Instead, the cost has increased consistently since we deregulated and privatised the market. In fact, when we deregulated and began to privatise and marketise, the ESB had to increase its prices immediately because it would have been competitively unfair on the poor private sector for the ESB to be giving people cheap electricity. That is what happened. Looking back at the speeches and justifications for removing the not-for-profit mandate from the ESB, they were wall-to-wall ideological claptrap about how marketising and introducing competition in the sector would benefit the consumer and reduce prices. Amazingly, I heard the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, repeating this claptrap in the Dáil in recent weeks. Even with the cost of energy going through the roof, he still maintained that competition would benefit the consumer. I asked myself whether this person was living on the same planet as me, given that the exact opposite had been happening. There is no benefit to the consumer from us developing our own renewable energy resources. None. Zero. Zilch. I am for reversing the trend of the past four decades of progressively privatising what used to be called in the old parlance the commanding heights of the economy, those elements that are critical to the functioning of a society, for example, energy, telecommunications, public transport and so forth. I will not go through the entire list, but this trend has been extremely damaging.We are seeing the bitter fruits of all of that in a number of areas right now. That is it. It is just not true to say that if you do it in the way we are suggesting - if the State takes the lead in these things - you will not be able to get assistance where you may need it, either in terms of expertise or some investment from outside. We built Ardnacrusha ourselves. We got assistance from Siemens and it got something out of it, but we did not flipping hand over the whole thing to them. Norway got outside assistance from those with expertise in fossil fuels to develop its oil production but it made sure that it was done through a State company and that those making an input from outside, while being remunerated to some degree, were not in control. Norway used its co-operation with external investment to ensure it built up state industry and enterprise so that the vast majority of the benefits went to Norway. That is not what is happening here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 60, after line 42, to insert the following:“Reports22. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil on the cost to the Exchequer of taxing the disposal of patent rights at the same rate as the disposal of 	patents.”.I would like to put a direct question on the treatment of capital sums for the sale of patent rights to the Minister, in order to hear a bit more about it and about the cost to the Exchequer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will ask the Minister a number of questions. He is saying that if our proposal were adopted and patent rights were taxed at the capital gains tax level - at the same rate as the disposal of patents - it might or might not increase revenue, and therefore he is not going to do it. Can the Minister elaborate on why this might increase revenue and why it might not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I see the gain. I do not see the other side.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister elaborate on those reliefs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, exactly. So we could get more tax if we just applied the 33% in both instances, but we are worried that we might not as a result of the group reliefs under capital gains that can be availed of. The Minister could just get rid of the group reliefs. I think he should do so. The wider section 22 deals with inter-group transactions, to which the Minister has referred. Indeed, they were mentioned earlier. The scale of the reliefs here is staggering, at €35.275 billion for 2020. If the Minister has more up-to-date figures, it would be interesting to see how they have changed. That figure for 2020 is remarkable. I am amazed nobody has remarked on it more. The tax relief figure jumped from €16 billion in 2019, which was in itself an eye-watering figure, to €35 billion in 2020. These companies are charging themselves for the purchase or use of patents, and then writing down their tax bills as a result of the reliefs that are available and writing down the amount of their income that is subject to tax. To my mind, this defies comprehension. It is just profit shifting; that is all it is. In my view, tax avoidance is being facilitated by the tax code. The Minister could just get rid of the reliefs. I do not understand the reason or the justification for them. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. I will briefly comment on the section. We have a concern about this credit, which has ballooned over recent years. It is one of the biggest apart from the one I mentioned earlier. Notwithstanding some of the amendments the Minister is making to benefit smaller companies, the intragroup transactions or group relief and the research and development tax credit, which cost €658 million in 2020, mostly benefit the staggeringly profitable multinational corporations. The public is paying for their research activities through this relief. In recent weeks, we have seen the sort of thanks we are getting from these companies with people being unceremoniously sacked. That may potentially be a harbinger of the big trouble the policy of over-reliance on foreign direct investment from these companies could lead us into. It is certainly folly to spend public money in this way. Tax expenditure is the expenditure of public money even though it is not looked at in the same way as direct expenditure by, for example, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science when investing in Science Foundation Ireland or our universities. However, it is public money and its expenditure should be scrutinised and thought about. Pretty much of all of the economists and people who come before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to comment on the issue of tax expenditure have said we should keep a close eye on these expenditures and whether they are delivering on the objectives we set for them. They say we should always look to see whether a tax relief or direct expenditure is the best way to expend public money to achieve given objectives. The general consensus, not just on the left, is that direct expenditure is better and that we need to not roll over reliefs such as these without carefully examining the benefit we are getting from them. There is a very significant question mark over whether the best way to stimulate research and development to the benefit of our society is to give €658 million, a figure that is rising, largely to small number of incredibly profitable multinational companies rather than giving it to, seeing as it is Science Week, Science Foundation Ireland or our public universities, which could do with a lot of money, or removing fees for postgraduate students or improving stipends for them so that people who are engaging in research in our universities do not feel they cannot go on and complete their research studies or work because they just cannot afford to live. I believe it would be better to expend that money on removing those sorts of financial obstacles and burdens on people trying to do postgraduate study or on stimulating and investing in publicly oriented research rather than research that only benefits a small number of companies that are already making enormous profits. That is our view. It is worth articulating rather than just letting these things roll on unquestioned year after year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We heard a call for humility or an acknowledgement of the mistakes that were made, are still being made and have led us to an absolutely disastrous housing crisis. There is nobody out there who does not think this is a disaster. The Minister must have clinics, the same as the rest of us, and he meets the people who are affected by the housing crisis. The situation that people are facing is utterly shameful and intolerable for those involved. This week, I met a woman with two children, part of a working family, who he is being evicted by her landlord from the house in which she was born and her family has lived since the 1950s. The family are not entitled to social housing because they are over the income threshold and they are not entitled to the housing assistance payment, HAP. If they are made homeless, as they may well be because there is nothing available, they will be on the street. The couple are in their late 50s and have two children. I underline that they will not even be entitled to emergency accommodation because their income is over the threshold. People need to grasp what it means, and I am sure the Minister knows what it means, to have people stand in my clinic bawling and crying and asking what will happen to them and their children. The family attended one of the protests that took place over the weekend. While the issue was being talked about the mother and her two children started bawling and crying, just thinking about their situation. Sadly, such cases are repeated again and again. This week, another woman came to my clinic. She spent five years living in direct provision and now lives in a hostel with her young son who is very seriously traumatised. I could see that because he came in to my office with his mother.He was carrying a little bag which he brings everywhere since he does not know where he will be living and will possibly have nowhere to go, so he has to have his bag. This is disturbing stuff that is being done to children. That story is being repeated again and again. The mother cries and the child has clearly been damaged by the experience. This is what we are dealing with. If some of us get a bit exercised by all this, it is because people cannot take this any more. Somebody should admit that we did something wrong to have got to this point. We need to understand how we got here, otherwise we will learn nothing and keep making the same mistakes. If the Minister does not accept some of the points that some of us are making and he is railing against the alternatives that we are proposing, does he have any analysis of how we got here? How did we get to this point if it was not through mistakes being made? My understanding is clear. If the Minister's understanding is different, I would love to hear it. Cherrywood, in my area, is the biggest residential development in the State. We had that in our hands. After the property developers helped to crash the economy along with the bankers, for a brief moment, we had that site and many other sites in our hands. We could have delivered the affordable and public housing when we had all that, but a decision was made by the Fine Gael and Labour Government at the time to encourage investors to come in to buy all that up. They were offered that and they were made aware of tax breaks that were available on capital gains tax and rental revenue. That was a policy. Ten or 12 years later, is there any recognition that that was a mistake? To my mind, when the history books are written, it will be considered one of the greatest mistakes that was ever made in this country. We unloaded €40 billion. What is that worth now with the appreciation of property values and so on? It may be twice that or more. It was given to these investors. They will walk away after paying little or no tax in the form of capital gains tax or from the extortionate rents they are charging. We had it and we could have delivered affordable and public housing on that land. Instead, we incentivised them with tax breaks and encouraged them to take all that property. Look at what they have done with it and landed us with. The Minister still defends the idea that we will keep doing this and states that they have a role to play. I am baffled. Is there any acknowledgement that that policy failed us disastrously and contributed to the current situation? Is there any recognition on the part of those who were in government in that period that it may have been a mistake and there may have been a better alternative? If there is no recognition of that, we are really goosed and this will go on and on and get worse. The figures relating to housing output are not hopeful. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has stated that the Housing for All targets will completely fail to meet the housing demand that is projected. There are serious questions about whether Housing for All will deliver on its targets. The Department is saying internally that it is not good enough anyway. I know that from my own area. I have seen the Housing for All targets for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. We will have more people on housing lists in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown at the end of the Housing for All strategy than we have now. That is not a policy that is working. In the meantime, the people who bought Cherrywood will make a fortune. They will charge extortionate rents and the State will still be paying through housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing arrangements, insofar as we get any of that property. They are huge, ballooning amounts that will continue to increase. Is there any recognition that that may not be a good idea and that we would be better off if we had that stuff in our hands rather than these profit-driven investors having it in theirs? They have us over a barrel with the rents they charge and the power to evict people into the sort of desperate situation that I described. Does the Minister recognise this? It is a genuine question. I am sure he sees all this hardship and misery. Does he recognise that policies have contributed to creating it and that we should maybe learn a few lessons from what has gone on with housing in this country over the last ten or 12 years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Quite genuinely, I am long since past just wanting solutions for people who are in those situations, experiencing the trauma and hardship I have described. I could go on listing the examples I am dealing with now for many hours. The list of equally horrendous cases is endless. The misery is endless. Notwithstanding political debate and all that, I just want to see solutions because this has got worse during the time I have been in this House since 2011. Like Deputy Doherty, I genuinely do not want to be saying "I told you so". I really do not because the situation is too serious for that kind of nonsense. On the other hand, it is difficult not to be incredibly frustrated and angry when it was obvious at the time that decisions being made would have this consequence. We were saying this. It was not rocket science to see that this policy was going to have such an effect. Deputy Durkan and the Minister, to some degree, have tried to justify all that on the grounds that we had no choice due to the deficit and the borrowing we had to do, and the conditions attached to that borrowing. Even if they want to present that as a justification for what happened, surely the beginning of wisdom is to say the troika was wrong on that front. Some recognition is becoming apparent, at European level, that the troika was wrong. Interestingly, things like the fiscal rules on state aid have all disappeared. All the things we were told were completely sacrosanct, such as that we must work within these strictures, that we could not have state aid or that we could not distort the market, are on hold now.We realised, when we were faced with an emergency around the pandemic, all of those rules were a straitjacket which had to be discarded if we were to meet the challenge. I would be surprised if they came back any time soon because we have surely learned some lessons, surely. One even hears the IMF and all these people talking - it is ironic because I sat at those meetings with the troika when it was shoving this medicine-poison down our throat - now and often producing reports saying we really want to start investing in housing when I am thinking some of its policies are the reason we are in this mess now. It realises, to some degree, this was all a big mistake and it is beginning to shift. It does not openly admit it made a big mistake but one can see the goalposts are shifting because the policies failed disastrously. That is why the beginning of wisdom would be, at least, to say that was a mistake. The Minister said we did not have the money. We had the money because we paid for it. We borrowed the money to take that property into State control. We had the borrowed money but we then decided to sell it back which was a big mistake and to incentivise investors with tax breaks which is what this amendment is about. It was a policy. To be honest, we all know there was another element to that, and Mr. Michael Noonan was very clear at the time, in that we needed to refloat the property market to improve the asset position of the banks because property prices collapsing to the degree to which they did was seen as a major problem for the banks. We had to refloat the property market. The policy was directed towards that end and it was a big, disastrous mistake. It was a conscious decision to drive up property prices and incentivise investors to come in to take control of the housing sector. I remember the language at the time. Michael Noonan said we were going to professionalise the rental sector. He said it would be much better with these guys who were professional landlords and much better than the mama and papa and ad hoc landlords. We were to have a professional rental sector. It was going to be utopia with these people coming in. That was said at the time and it was so, so wrong. Directly related to that was the decision, which I remember trying to highlight and even explain to journalists in 2011 who at that stage had never heard of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payments, HAP, or leasing, to stop completely the capital investment programme in social housing and to outsource the provision of social housing to these entities. That was the thinking. We were not to build our own social housing but get these professional investors in who would take control of the NAMA portfolio, build all these apartments and lease them back to the State to create a professional rental sector which would replace the old-fashioned construction of social housing with HAP, RAS and leasing stuff. That was the plan. The plan happened and it was an unmitigated disaster. I want solutions, but I know the Government will not contemplate them and will think it is off the wall even to do this because lefties are always talking off the wall. However, just for a moment, people might ponder the fact that on this issue, if not on anything else, we had a point way back then when we said this would be a big mistake and a disaster. The Government might just ponder the possibility that on this issue, if not on any other, we might have a point. If we want to help the families I talked about, every single thing that has been built by or for these entities should be taken into our hands. It was a mistake to give it to them and should be taken back. The proposal is radical but, interestingly, when Berlin had a referendum on expropriating the vulture funds, the majority of people supported it because they realised how damaging these people were. The language and thought are radical but it makes sense. The funds should be expropriated because I do not see the point of what one sees going along the N11 - I am sure this is true when one goes out to where Deputy Durkan lives or out the Minister's direction - with all of these apartment complexes being built of which we are getting 10%. The rest of them will be rented for €2,500 per month or we might lease a few extra, paying them an absolute fortune. They are making extraordinary profits and the apartments are totally unaffordable. It would be better if we had the apartments and charged affordable rents. Would it cost a lot? Yes, it would. Would it, in the long term, be better value for the State and taxpayer and solve a problem right here and now for the people I was describing and the many others like them? The answer is yes. The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, report argued this. It is not just me. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said ending up having to pay all of that money in RAS, HAPs and leasing would cost us billions more in the end. It is a false economy to say we cannot afford to do this now because it is just too much when, in reality, we will end up paying a hell of a lot more down the line as well as the social and personal misery and hardship if we do not do it. I put that to the Minister. If the Minister has a better solution I would like to hear it so that when the people I am talking about come into my office next week, I can tell them not to worry and they do not need to start crying, because I have a solution to give them. If the Minister has the answer, that is what I want. I want to be able to give that woman an answer and say that her kids do not have to cry and her child does not have to go through this. I want to tell her I have asked the Minister how he will solve this and he has given me the answer. If the Minister does not agree with our thoughts, I ask him to tell me what I will say to these people. The question is not rhetorical because they want to hear a solution. I and everybody affected by this housing crisis wants to hear it. What do we say to people in that situation? I will finish on this. I apologise, Acting Chairman, but this is the biggest issue in the whole country. Everybody knows it. What do I say? Across the road from my office where these families are coming in, there is a multi-unit apartment complex owned by one of these investors. The investors bought it from a receiver when a landlord went bust. They tried four times to mass-evict everybody and eventually drove most of the tenants out. A few of them are left who are resisting. We are trying to get the local council to buy the complex. I do not know how many times I have raised it with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and negotiations are finally going on. While I am talking to those people, week in and week out, 17 apartments in that complex sit empty. Some 15 of them have been empty for two and a half years. They are perfectly refurbished and absolutely livable. Families in my office right across the road are bawling crying and saying they have nowhere to go and do not know what they will do when right across the road, an investor is sitting on an appreciating asset that is empty and on which they will not pay tax on the capital gains they will make on it. It is more profitable for that company to sit on the empty property than for the woman and her child to be put in it. Is it not disgusting that that can happen? I think it is disgusting.

Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil into the amount of public subsidyfor Knowledge Development Box and if it would be better as a direct investment in research in public universities.".For the same reasons, I will come back to this amendment at a later date.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 53:In page 84, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:
"Reports
34. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on amending the guidelines in relation to section 481 (Film Tax Relief), to clearly define the requirement for producer companies in receipt of the relief to be the legally responsible employer for all those working on film productions funded by the relief as against the DAC which only has a temporary existence; and further to guarantee the full vindication of workers rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; and further to ensure genuinely equitable remuneration for performers and actors in relation to their intellectual property rights and full compliance with the EU copyright directive.".This amendment relates to an issue that we have discussed in the context of quite a few Finance Bills, namely, the section 481 film tax relief. It is also an issue that I got the agreement of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to look at. I am glad that committee is looking at it and that examination is under way. Section 481 is a film tax credit which, according to the latest figures - although I am open to correction by the Minister - is running at almost €100 million. The stated objective in respect of the relief is to stimulate the Irish film industry and, specifically, to create quality employment and training. It is stated in the statutory instrument arising from the section 481 legislation that it is supposed to create quality employment and training, and to contribute to Irish culture.It is also worth noting that this relief is a form of state aid. As the Minister will be aware, when state aid is given, under EU rules, it is supposed to comply with EU directives that relate to state aid and, in this case, it is supposed to relate to arts and culture. The EU is quite particular about those sorts of matters and about them being the conditions under which such relief is given. I stress, as I always do when I discuss this matter, that I want to see even more investment in the film industry and in arts and culture generally. Our investment in all arts and culture is far too low for a country that has so great a pool of creative talent in a range of arts and cultural disciplines and endeavours and such an incredible, unparalleled international reputation for these fields such as literature, acting, art, theatre, poetry and music. Across the arts and cultural disciplines and endeavours we have, deservedly, a fantastic reputation, tradition and history, but we do not match that with the level of investment we should, generally speaking, and overall, investment amounts to 0.1% of GDP whereas the EU average is 0.6%. The EU average investment in arts and culture is six times what we invest, so we do not do enough to invest in the arts and we should honestly think about that. We often pay lip service to arts and culture, particularly when we have an international success or success in a given area, but it is then sort of forgotten about and it drops to the bottom of the list of priorities. That has improved somewhat over recent years, although not, interestingly, in this year's budget, where the arts and culture budget was cut, not by a huge amount but it was cut nonetheless. I hope that is not a reversion to type and to the sort of disregard we have shown, at least in terms of money and investment, in arts and culture in recent years. I want to see us get up and I want to see much more investment. It benefits us, spiritually, personally and culturally, in areas such as employment and in the wider economy. It could contribute even more in all those areas if we took it seriously but - there is a big "but" in respect of section 481 - is section 481 meeting the objective we have set for it to contribute that high-quality employment and training, to contribute to our culture and to comply with all those sorts of EU requirements on aid of that sort, which echo the requirements within the legislation and the statutory instruments that govern it? To give a flavour of the EU directive on state aid in this area, it states it should aim to "generate the critical mass of activity that is required to create the dynamic for the development and consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience." That is the requirement of state aid in this area. I underline that it refers to "soundly based production undertakings and ... a permanent pool of human skills and experience." What actually happens, given that is what that section is supposed to achieve and, indeed, what it is required to achieve under EU directives? Quite honestly, my next step, if we do not move this forward, is to go to the European Commission because that is where it will have to go if we do not start to meet these objectives. The evidence that it is not meeting those objectives involves quite a long saga. For me, it began in 2018, when representatives of the film industry groups such as Screen Producers Ireland and the body now known as Screen Ireland appeared before the then Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs
and outlined that there were 17,000 jobs in the Irish film industry, that section 481 was brilliant and that we should not change a thing. In fairness to the Minister, he responded to some of the arguments I made. I was no expert on this; information was brought to my attention by film crew people who worked in the industry, through evidence given at those arts committee hearings in 2018 by Irish Equity, which was asked questions such as whether there was blacklisting, the answer to which was "Yes", and by film crew to the effect that there was not high-quality employment and training. They stated that, in fact, what happens if people do not toe the line in the film industry is that they are not re-employed and are blacklisted. They argued that the DAC structure set up for film productions by film production companies, which receive the section 481 tax relief, had become a mechanism behind which producer companies and the recipients of section 481 relief could evade their responsibilities and obligations to people who worked in the film industry, thereby denying them the high-quality employment and training that are a requirement and ensuring there would be no "permanent" pool of human skills and experience, because the DAC appears for the film production and, like a mushroom, disappears shortly afterwards, 18 months later. I want to underline this point to the Minister after hearing all the evidence given by both the defenders of the status quo and the critics of section 481, whether aspects of it or all of it, in any shape or form, including Irish Equity, whose representatives appeared before our scrutiny committee recently. That structure means that if somebody works or is a trainee on a film production that is funded in this way, the recipients of section 481 relief, namely, the producer companies, can deny the existence of an employment relationship between the producer company that receives the relief and the people who work on the film production. They can deny, and do deny, any existence of it because they, who receive section 481 relief to create high-quality employment and training, are not the employer, or at least they say they are not.This was confirmed both by the critics and the defenders of the status quo. It is the DAC. How does someone vindicate their rights, which they are required to do, including by the declaration that the Minister brought in? In fairness, he brought it in on foot of some of the representations that were made. The declaration that section 481 recipients are required to sign is there in front of us, and it refers to undertakings in respect of quality employment, the name of the company, the name of the qualifying company and the requirement to meet all of the relevant legislation, EU rules and regulations around the organisation of working time, employment equality, payment of wages, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Working) Act, and so on. If a person is unfairly dismissed from one of these film productions, given the particular nature of the Irish film industry, or maybe any film industry, it works slightly differently from how it might in the context of any other employment. In any other employment, a person is told “We are sacking you” and the person can then take a case to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in the following weeks or months. However, if someone is unfairly dismissed from a film production, this is the way it works. Most likely, the person works for the entirety of the film production and they are dismissed because they have perhaps been a bit troublesome or have been giving out about the excessive hours - because they are working 60 or 70 hours a week - or because they are not getting their holiday pay, sick pay or whatever. If some of the person's rights are being breached, the production company just will not employ him or her on the next film production, which might be a year or a year and a half away. That person does not know they have been unfairly dismissed until the next time, when that same film producer, but now with a different DAC, makes the next series or episode of a series. The worker goes back to that same film producer and because the next series is being made, they expect they are going to get a job, but they are just told that they are not getting a job, or they are ignored. However, quite a long time will have elapsed and although it is the same producer company, it is a different DAC. When that person goes along to the WRC maybe a year and a half later and says “I have been unfairly dismissed”, the producer company comes in or, as is often the case, refuses to come in, and says “I am not coming into the WRC because I am not the employer”. It is the same producer company for series A and series B, and the same recipient of section 481 relief, but a different DAC. However, when a worker on a production says “I was unfairly dismissed” by the same production company that is now doing production B, the company says it is not the employer and that the DAC is the employer, but that DAC is gone. The person has no employer and there is nobody to take a case against for unfair dismissal. Therefore, the rights which this declaration says must be vindicated cannot be vindicated. That is a problem, and there is nothing to protect workers against it. Many workers say that this type of blacklisting goes on. We heard about this from Equity in 2018 and from the Irish Film Workers Association. The vast majority of the people in the latter have not worked in the film industry since they came before the joint committee. They are taking case after case to the Labour Court and the WRC, where the producers involved do not bother to turn up and simply deny that they are the employers. If they do turn up, they say that they could have no possible employment relationship with the person involved because the relationship was with the DAC, not them. Even though that individual set up the DAC, they can say that they set it up but now have nothing to do with it. This is allowed to happen even though the requirement relating to this relief involves the provision of high-quality employment and training. These two things are not compatible. We cannot say that we are giving someone money for quality employment and training and then have the type of scenario to which I refer play out again and again. The Minister might say it is up to the WRC to sort out, but the problem is the structure of the relief, which was confirmed even by the representatives of the producers. When I put this to them at the joint committee, they said the structure of the relief requires this and that it was not their fault. I do not buy that, but they do have a point about it being structured like that because it is not clear that the person who gets the relief, that is, the production company, has and should have legal responsibility. That should be clearly defined by the Minister. Even if the DAC is gone, the producers have legal responsibility because if they do not have legal responsibility for quality employment and training and the vindication of the rights of the employees who worked on it, who does? The answer is that if they do not, no one does. Therefore, it is not possible to meet the requirements set down in law and in the EU directives. There is no protection against the situation I have described. The Minister can explain to me how there is a protection, but this is not about the Minister or I adjudicating on particular cases, and I want to stress that. People can say that this is or is not the case, but it is clear that we cannot adjudicate on the matter. The point I am making is that there is nothing to stop it happening. We have to rely purely on the submission of film producers who say “We would not possibly do that. Ours is a lovely industry. We are all a big family.” That is what one of the producers said: “We are a big family and we would never treat other people like that.” Yet, we had evidence in 2018 and we had it again at the Committee on Budgetary Scrutiny both from Equity and the film workers that it does happen. That is in terms of the film crew. I will conclude my point on that aspect of my amendment, in which I am asking that the Minister would have a review of this film credit that ensures the film producers who get the credit cannot hide behind the DAC structure and that the Minister would issue a directive to make it absolutely clear that the recipient - the standing company - is legally responsible even after the DAC disappears. This would apply under the fixed-term work Act, which then leads on to all of the other requirements, because if people do not have recognition under that Act, all the rest of it becomes pretty much meaningless. This is in order to create that permanent pool of skills which, I repeat, is required under the EU directives. My amendment refers to the need to address the issue of the actors and performers, another group of people working on film productions who allege that they are not being properly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property in terms of their performance on a given film production, and are being required to sign buy-out contracts in order to get a job, where their rights to future royalties and residuals on their portion of the performance, which is their intellectual property, are essentially waived, or they agree to a completely inequitable remuneration for their performance.I repeat that film producers are being funded with public money. They have testified that without section 481 these film productions would not happen. We need to understand that point: film productions in Ireland would not happen without section 481. That is how dependent they are on public money. Those film producers are telling performers, dancers, actors and so on that they must accept a contract where their rights in terms of their intellectual property and many other things relating to pay and conditions generally are dramatically inferior to what their brothers and sisters who are performers and dancers in the North of Ireland, Britain or in most other jurisdictions in the world get.  I had a phone call with the president of Equity and what he said was really quite dramatic. He was particularly referring to dancers in a recent film production. He said the buyout payment given to performers in an Irish film production needs to be disentangled from their rights to residuals and royalties from their intellectual property. If the one-off payment that performers get for these things is taken out, when they then waive their future right to royalties, the actual wages being paid to these was less than the minimum wage. That is how bad it was. There are two components to how they are getting paid. They are paid wages and then they get a buyout payment for their residuals. In one case a film was partly filmed here. There was a bit of an outcry about the conditions and the situation here. Some of the scenes for the same film were then reshot in the UK and the contracts were dramatically different. There were much better pay and much better rights to future royalties and so on. The president of Equity outlined a really important part of the difference. A performer may be required for one day's shooting, not required for two days and then back for another couple of days. Here that person is put on the dole for the two intervening days. They are signing on for social welfare, requiring more public money whereas in the UK, those performers are paid those days. Even if they are not being used, they are paid enough to ensure they do not have to sign on the dole. This is how inferior the contracts are here. It then gets really bad. As well as the performers losing out from all this, there were certain questions raised from the Equity submission which we asked. The president of Equity wrote me an email afterwards stating that the questions had not been fully answered. It is complicated but I really hope people will start to get their heads around this stuff. It has taken me quite a few years to get my head around it. The Equity submission referred to potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of purchases practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies. I would like the Minister to think about that phrase. It does not sound good, does it? It continues to refer to the flaunting of national and international copyright legislation creating an absurd situation where one arm of Government is supporting organisations in breach of the State's own legislation. I want to read an email that came in response to some of the questions the president felt we had not answered. It stated:I have realised, having watched the recording of our conversation, that we did not answer, clearly, some vital questions. Specifically the questions around internal pricing and income depression, and how the Designated Activity Company structure operates. These questions were asked at least three times in the course of the meeting. I would like to take this opportunity to answer those questions clearly here, as they are at the heart of the risks associated with the design of Section 481.An Irish Production Company has a film project. They make an application under Section 481. The film project is deemed to meet the criteria and Section 481 Film Tax Credit is approved.The Production Company then registers a Designated Activity Company for the sole purpose of producing this film.The DAC is primarily an accounting tool, as all monies in and out of the DAC will be in connection with the production of the film.The DAC can apply for and draw down 90% of the value of the 481 tax credit before the film is actually made or sold. Essentially this is an advance on the corporate tax that would be due if the Designated Activity Company makes a profit.Within 18 months of completion of the production of the film the DAC is wound up. At this point the actual physical film (which exists probably on a hard drive) and all underlying copyrights are moved elsewhere for the purposes of Sales and Distribution. In other words the Designated Activity Company is incapable of making a profit, as it exists only to make the film, not to distribute or sell the film.That is where the money comes from because it is from distributing and selling the film that the production company makes some money. However, that is moved elsewhere. I hope the Minister is getting this. Now we are not only talking about the performers, but we are also talking about a public investment where we cannot get a return on that investment and the company is designed so that it does not make a profit. It is not in its interest to make a profit and certainly for there never to be a return to the State. The email continues: Within this kind of structure, and from a tax planning perspective, it makes sense to ensure that the film and the DAC make a loss. If it makes a profit then the tax credit which was advanced as a cash payment in the course of production would have to be repaid. The DAC structure makes it possible for the tax credit (which is paid out in cash) never to be reclaimed by revenue.The final accounts for the DAC will clearly demonstrate that the company has broken even or made a loss. The finished film (the hard drive) and the bundle of underlying rights [belonging to among others the performers] will have been moved/sold into the Production Company or further on to a third company or a distribution/streaming company.That company will get all the revenues and meanwhile we have advanced all this money and the company is designed to make a loss. I could read on, but it is a long piece. I will probably send it on to the Minister. Does he see a problem here? I really hope he does. This means that both the taxpayer and the artists and performers are losing out. Public money pays for the production for these performances and so on, and then all the rights, royalties and residuals accruing to that are moved elsewhere so that the production company gets them. The production company has a vested interest in ensuring that transfer of those rights is for a knockdown price. If the production company were to get a large amount of money, it would make a profit and money would have to go back to Revenue. It would need to pay some tax on the profit, but it is never going to do that. Of course, the film crew would say that sort of price depression or whatever was also happening even at the most basic level on the film production. When they make a film, they buy all the wood and other material for the sets. They buy machinery and apparently they do not pay VAT on any of this which is also quite interesting and needs to be investigated.Where does all that stuff go at the end of the film? It belongs to the DAC, which, as we know, is going to disappear shortly. Where does it all go? Is it sold? We had testimony that it is, in effect, given away. The public pays for it with taxpayers' money but it is, in effect, given away to the group of people who are running the DAC. Not only that, when the same group of people are working on a new DAC, they will come back with all the stuff they got from the last film production and will charge the next DAC for the use of the stuff paid for by the public on DAC No. 1. One could not make it up. Something must be done about this in order that our artists and performers get the sorts of conditions and rights to benefit from their intellectual property at least at the level of what people get in the UK, France and so on. We must ensure employers have to vindicate the rights of workers and cannot escape and hide behind the DAC structure and, therefore, that those workers accrue some rights as people who have worked in the industry over time and cannot be thrown out of it at the whim of a film producer or head of a department who does not like them or because they kicked up and said the hours are too much, the trainees are being treated badly or whatever. If we did that, we would have a better film industry, we would make better films and we would get more, not less, investment. It would be good all around. I am sorry for going on so long but the Minister knows how seriously I take this matter. There are a lot of issues unresolved and if there is any doubt as to whether this was just coming from a few disgruntled people, which is what some of the defenders of the status quo have tried to imply, we now know it is coming from more people than that. We are getting the same critique coming now from Equity. None of the substantial questions that were asked has ever been answered in terms of how people can be protected against this sort of thing. I will leave it at that. I really would like to see some movement on this issue.
