RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the officials to the committee. I will echo Deputy Donnelly by saying it is a pleasure to meet the real Government, the power behind the throne.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the officials can give us some insight on some of the big issues facing us. We are being told there is progress being made on the banking resolution regime. When did the big shift in policy take place? From my point of view it seems to have happened as a result of what occurred in Cyprus when the initial move to raid the savings of people with under €100,000, which had been put forward by the EU, was defeated because of popular protests. Then, there was a shift to a new approach whereby bondholders could be burned and depositors with over €100,000 hit. Now, a new policy has emerged on foot of that which proposes to deal with banking crises in a very different way. It is a progressive shift but it seems to date to that moment. Is that a fair assessment of the new shift in policy when it comes to dealing with banking crises?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Mr. Carrigan be more specific? Naturally, banking resolution has been on the agenda for some time. However, something fundamental occurred which coincided with events in Cyprus. The European authorities' first reaction to that crisis was essentially to pursue what the Government has pursued hitherto in Ireland and elsewhere which was to say that we cannot burn senior bondholders. Then, lo and behold, within three days of protests the issue of burning senior bondholders came on the agenda and was accepted and agreed. Now, we seem to be discussing a banking resolution regime which is rather different and under which it is possible to burn senior bondholders, something we had been told for the past four years was not possible. My question is not about whether there was a proposal to have a new banking resolution regime - I know there was - but about the shift in terms of what that banking resolution regime would be and whether it would and could involve the burning of senior bondholders. That is what I am asking. When did that come out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If that was the case, does Mr. Carrigan know why the Commission's first proposal to deal with the crisis was to state it needed to protect the senior bondholders and that ordinary savers had to take the brunt, a policy which then shifted? I would like to know about the process that led to the shift in policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not pursue the issue any further because time is short, except to say statements came not from the Cypriot Government but other EU member states, including our own Minister for Finance, that the initial proposal was good for Cyprus and Europe. That does not quite tally with Mr. Carrigan's account. Given that there has been a change of policy, whenever it dates from, on how to approach banking crises, how far have we progressed in our attempt to secure retrospective recapitalisation of the banks through the ESM or some other EU mechanism?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Mr. Ó Brolcháin elaborate on the obstacles involved? We know what we are told we are looking for; therefore, what is the reason for the hold-up? Is it a legal or a political matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The theme of the Irish Presidency has been stability, growth and jobs. Reading the dossiers to which the delegates refer in their introduction and hearing their comments today and the Minister’s comments yesterday, most of them seem to relate to what is called financial stability, banking union, supervision, economic surveillance and so on. Will they be more specific about where we are pursuing the latter two priorities of the Presidency, jobs and growth? What exactly have we discussed with our European partners in these two areas? When we talk about the metrics of economic surveillance – I tried to make this point to the Minister yesterday – is unemployment examined, or is it all about deficits, debts and the so-called stability of the financial sector? Are there metrics to do with unemployment or employment levels when we are pursuing the jobs and growth agenda? It is talked about, but I cannot see much hard evidence that it is being taken seriously as an agenda item at these various gatherings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the European Presidency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to tease out this issue briefly. I understand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is supposed to come up with specific concrete proposals about how we might create jobs, but that is not what I am asking about. I am asking about unemployment and employment as a macroeconomic category, as a metric by which to measure the viability and health of the economy overall. Is that not a key metric in examining whether the medicine is working, whether the surveillance and macroeconomic oversight are working? Is Mr. Carrigan telling us the process is concerned only with supervision and the stability of the banks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is unemployment one of the 11 metrics by which we judge the economic imbalances in economies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any indication on the basis of Britain’s challenge to the FTT?The UK is now taking a legal challenge to stop 11 other countries doing it, which indicates that it is worried that the FTT might adversely affect it. This seems to suggest the opposite view from the UK about what the FTT might do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses.
