RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment was tabled by Deputy Barry but, unfortunately, he is tied up with Leaders' Questions in the House. While the amendment is in our names too, I should have said that People Before Profit holds a slightly different position, namely, that of raising the tax rate to 25%. I nonetheless think that the spirit and thrust of the amendment, in focusing on this issue, is correct because, as I suggested last night, the effective rate is much lower than 12.5%, which relates to gross trading profits. The total profits for the latest available figures are €182 billion, whereas the taxable profits are only €96 billion. I do not accept, therefore, the Minister's claim that it is straightforward. The fact that, in most cases, large corporations can write down their taxable profits using myriad reliefs, deductions and allowances available to them - loopholes, in layman's terms - means they are not really paying 12.5% on their profits. They are paying 5.7%, less than half of that. There is no need for that and I reject the claim that if they were made to pay the actual 12.5%, they would all go flying out of the country. I refer the Minister to a recent interview on "Morning Ireland" with US Representative Brendan Boyle, a Democratic Congressman from Philadelphia, where he was asked about this issue. He was categorical and there was no equivocation. He said bluntly that Ireland's tax rate was not the key issue with the location of US multinational investment in this country but rather that it was our involvement in the EU market and the fact that Ireland is an English-speaking country. Critically, he emphasised the fact that we have a highly educated workforce. There is a suggestion that if these multinational corporations were made to pay 12.5% - which, if they did so on gross trading profits, would deliver double the sum we are getting now, or an additional €10 billion in revenue - they would leave. Brendan Boyle, however, in putting forward arguments from the point of view of an American politician, stated that they would not leave. There is simply too much profit being made here by those companies and, even if they had actually to pay 12.5%, they would still make very considerable profits and pay a very low proportion of those profits in corporation tax. We should not, therefore, take this kid-glove attitude to the corporations. We need money for housing, water infrastructure, health infrastructure and so many different areas. Indeed, those companies depend significantly on that infrastructure, not least the education infrastructure. As Brendan Boyle pointed out, with that educated workforce from which they generate so much money, why on earth would we not at least make them pay 12.5% in order that the money could be redirected into further enhancing our education system and other key public services and infrastructure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 127:In page 40, after line 35, to insert the following:
“Report on compliance of producer companies in receipt of section 481 tax relief
22. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, produce a report on the extent to which producer companies in receipt of section 481 tax relief are complying with requirements to provide quality employment and training, with employment legislation, taking direct responsibility for their employees and trainees, and acknowledging the service of employees who have worked for them over many years and in productions similarly financed through section 481 relief.”.The amendment seeks to have a report produced on the section 481 relief within three months of the passage of the Bill. Section 481 concerns the film tax relief, which amounts to approximately €80 million a year, although the figure varies from year to year. This is significant public financing of the live action and film industry. I stress that I support public funding of film and the arts generally, and I would like arts funding, including for film, to increase from its fairly low levels, by European standards. Currently, 0.1% of GDP goes to the arts, whereas in the rest of Europe, it is 0.6%. That is six times less than the average in a country that has a significant international reputation based on it arts output. My call for a review of this relief is not because I want in any way to obstruct - indeed, I want only to see increased funding for the arts, including film. As I have outlined on numerous occasions in the House, and the Minister will be aware of this, there remain significant problems with section 481.As spelled out in the Taxes Consolidation Act, the purpose of that section is to generate quality employment and training. I will add a point that I did not make yesterday. Under EU law, state aid to the film industry - I want this aid to be provided - is predicated on it generating companies of scale and creating a permanent pool of skill, talent and creativity. That is not happening, though. The film producer companies that receive the money do not want to acknowledge the rights of those who work in the sector or take responsibility for them as employees. Therefore, there is no permanent pool and there are no companies of scale. The largest film producer companies in this country might have ten or 15 permanent employees. Some have no permanent employees at all. As such, the number of people who are recognised in any way as employees in the industry is tiny. Most of them are employed on a project-to-project basis. Even if they have worked in the industry for 20, 30 or 40 years, which is the case for many of them, when the next film comes up, it is as if that is the first time they have sought employment in the industry. They have no pension rights, there is no proper system of accreditation for trainees and there is no acknowledgement of the service that people have given to the industry over many years. This puts the workers in a very weak position. Despite the fact that the Government has acknowledged some of these points and sought to introduce reforms to improve the workers' situation, there has been no change on the ground. To a large extent, the situation remains the same because the film producers, in what I can only describe as a bloody-minded refusal to acknowledge the intent of the Government's reforms and an attempt to ignore employment law and the conditions placed on state aid by the EU, refuse to acknowledge their obligations to their employees. They even refuse to acknowledge that they are the employers and that their workers are employees. We must press home the fight in order to end this situation and give people rights and acknowledgement as workers in the industry, with pensions, proper training pathways and so on. This has still not been achieved. I will not elaborate on the arguments further, but there is more to be done in this regard. That is why I have tabled this amendment. While I have acknowledged the Government's willingness to listen and make some improvements, the situation has still not got to where it needs to be even in terms of meeting our obligations under EU state aid rules.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, Chair, but may I respond briefly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely appreciate the Minister's engagement and his statement that he would examine this matter further if needs be. We have had an extensive debate on it. However, I will make a few final points to him. A key aspect of quality employment and training, particularly as set out in the fixed-term workers legislation at European and national levels, is recognition of service. The Minister cannot make commitments on it now, but I ask that he and his officials examine this issue carefully. The film producers, who receive significant amounts of money year in and year out and employ largely the same people year in and year out, refuse to acknowledge the service that those workers have given them. They have done that by hiding behind designated activity company, DAC, status. In other words, they are implying that it is not them but a series of different companies when the fact of the matter is that it is the same producer companies. This essentially allows them to evade their legal responsibilities to employees. In doing so, they are in serious breach of EU directives and our national legislation. This behaviour must be clamped down on seriously. If the Minister's officials read the submissions being made by the producer companies in receipt of section 481 relief in various cases that have been before the Labour Court and the WRC in recent times, they would see those companies explicitly stating that they are not the employers and that the DACs are.That is in breach of the declaration they are signing and the clear intent behind the section 481 relief and the conditions surrounding it. This matter needs to be looked at carefully and those companies need to be told that what is happening has stop. It is an abuse, a failure to comply with the law and those companies must be told that they will have the section 481 relief removed from them if they continue to make those arguments. The state aid rules also need to be examined as they apply to support to the industry. They are explicit in stating that one must build companies of scale and create a permanent pool of employment and talent in this sector. That is simply not happening at all. There is no such permanent pool for the same reason, that is, the producers do not want to accept that they have any responsibility to the people who work in the industry. I will leave it at that but I ask the Minister to look at those particular points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to speak to the section. In that context, I seek clarity from the Chair. I have an amendment which relates directly to this section and I am not sure why it is not being taken now. I am a bit confused as to the process. There is another amendment we tabled which relates directly to the knowledge box and research and development. Could somebody clarify the position?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not talking about either of those two amendments. There is another amendment that deals directly with section 21 and the knowledge development box. I do not understand why it is not being taken now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly it. Could somebody clarify why it is not being taken when we are dealing with the relevant section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just have to be careful. One never knows.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I speak briefly to the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a point that I have made to the Minister before and it is a serious one. We all want to expand knowledge, see innovation and research to improve our society, develop technology and advance enterprise and industry that is beneficial to society. That is a no-brainer and a noble objective. However, I put it to the Minister that the mechanisms by which we do that, including the knowledge development box and research and development grants with which we will deal later, are largely benefiting a very small cohort of companies. The major objective of those companies is to make money, largely in the IT sector. I am not saying they have not contributed to the advance of technology, and useful technology, but there is a hell of a lot more out there in terms of scientific and technological advance than the small number of social media and IT companies that are dealing with smart technology and are the major beneficiaries of reliefs and grants. We should be carrying out a cost-benefit analysis as to whether the significant amounts of money which, in the main, go to a small group of multinationals would not be better directed into our public universities. This may be a better time than ever to make the argument in this regard, given Covid-19, because we all now see the value in, for example, research into things such as vaccines and medicines, and across the whole health area. The research capacity of our universities for testing and tracing and of our health system for researching medicines is way below what it should be, faced with the sort of crisis we are in. I seriously suggest that we need to weigh up whether we would be better off giving direct funding to our public universities, health service and so on in the areas of research development and innovation, rather than giving reliefs such as this which benefit a small number of wealthy multinational corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 11, after line 34, to insert the following:
“Report on abolition and replacement of Universal Social Charge
11. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, produce a report on abolishing the Universal Social Charge for all those earning less than €70,000 per year and replacing it with an emergency Covid-19 Solidarity Tax on the incomes of those earning in excess of €100,000 per year and on the profits of companies whose net profits exceed €1,000,000 per year.”.Every year that I have been in the Dáil we have made the case in our pre-budget submission for wealth taxes as against taxes that impose a further tax pressure on low and middle income workers that we should look at wealth taxes. That is something the Government has resisted but Covid-19 creates a new context for the case for wealth taxes because we are borrowing huge amounts to finance income supports and other increased expenditure in areas such as health and so on to sustain us through Covid-19, and particularly the incomes of those who have been hit by the pandemic. It is worth saying that many of the people who have been hit had precarious incomes and circumstances in the first place or would have been low paid people in areas like bar work, hospitality, the arts, about which we have talked a good deal, music, live entertainment and taxi drivers. These would not be people who had very high incomes to start with and they have been hurt very significantly by the measures. While there has been some income supports for them they are people who are really suffering as a result of Covid-19. There are other sectors of our society who are not suffering but actually doing extraordinarily well. The report of the Central Bank for the second quarter of this year that came out in the past few days underlines that in spades where the net household wealth has now reached the highest level ever in the history of the State at €817 billion. That is a jump of approximately €60 billion on the year before. It is an extraordinary accumulation of wealth. As the Central Statistics Office, CSO, demonstrated in its studies on the distribution of wealth, that wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in a small number of very wealthy households. For example, the richest 1% of the population have more wealth than the bottom 50%. That is an extraordinary fact. The richest 1% have more wealth than the combined household wealth of the 50% at the bottom. The wealthiest 10% have half of that wealth, 50% of that €817 billion. That is extraordinary, and it is growing every year because once we reach a certain threshold of wealth the money begins to make money. Against the background of many people being hurt in the Covid-19 pandemic and us clearly needing very significant additional investment in key public services more so than ever after Covid-19, for example, in our health service, to reduce class sizes in education and to invest in key infrastructure projects, surely there is a serious case for wealth taxes or, in this specific context, for a Covid solidarity wealth tax. These are measures that have been introduced in a number of countries since Covid-19 or are being actively discussed around the world if countries have not yet introduced them. I refer to the idea of imposing Covid solidarity wealth taxes on those with the very highest incomes and those who have very significant accumulated wealth. That would save us from having to borrow as much as we are having to borrow and it would be an important measure, underpinning with real action, the principle of "we are all in it together", which has very much provided the framework for the public attitude towards the sacrifices and hardship they have to make to deal with Covid-19.That is why we press the case for removing more aggressive taxes on working people and replacing them with wealth taxes, in particular in the current climate a Covid solidarity wealth tax.
