RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The evidence is piling up to the effect that the cutting of rent allowance caps by the Minister is leading directly to homelessness. On three occasions before the summer I was contacted by dozens of families who were threatened with homelessness or had been made homeless as a result of the rent allowance cuts. Since then Focus Ireland, Threshold and other Deputies have raised the issue, but the Minister has stated there has been no incidence of homelessness due to these changes. Again, today, I have presented the Minister with two concrete cases. One involves a former council worker who had worked for 40 years. He had a heart attack, followed by heart surgery during which stents were inserted. He had to leave his job as a result and is now being denied rent allowance. When he met the rent allowance officer and explained that the rent for the place in which he had been living for many years was €800, she laughed at him and suggested he need not bother applying. He is now threatened with homelessness. The other man was a barber who lived in the place where he worked. When he lost his job he was made homeless and is now living in a hostel in Bride Street, although he is from Dún Laoghaire, because he cannot get a place within the rent caps. I went on the www.daft.ie website today to look for accommodation at or under the rent allowance cap in Dublin. Not one place of accommodation in south Dublin was available at or below €475 per month. These people are facing homelessness. One of them has been made homeless, along with dozens if not hundreds of others. What will the Minister do about it? Will she raise the rent caps back to sustainable levels or introduce rent controls if bringing down rents is the real agenda? At any rate, she should stop this policy, which is making people homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was referring to a single person. The figure is €475.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If that is the Minister's concern she should introduce rent controls rather than make people homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying the Minister should introduce rent controls.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should introduce rent controls. She should get out of the bubble.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here is a man with a heart condition who will be homeless as a result of the Minister's policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should go on daft.ie and find somewhere for €425 in south Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a choice. That is the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While the merry-go-round of futile EU summits that continue to yield nothing and the hot air about recovery and reform spews out of this building-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----ordinary, innocent people are being crushed by the austerity the Government and the troika are imposing. The latest victims of this austerity are young people and students who are being driven into poverty and despair. Thousands of students who desperately need grants to survive in third level education remain without them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are unable to pay the registration fees which the Government is ratcheting up every year, access hardship funds or pay rent. Many of them are now being forced to make a choice between paying their rent and paying for food.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, I attended a meeting with USI, at which we were told about a student whose breakfasts, lunches and dinners for the week were one packet of pasta and a bottle of tomato ketchup. That is outrageous. If the students manage to survive through college, they will be faced with unemployment and emigration when they finish. Will the Taoiseach admit this crisis for the young people and students who are the future of this country is not an administrative hiccup? It is the result of his so-called reform of the public service, cuts in staffing and resources and the centralisation of the applications process. Just as we saw a litany of refusals and a backlog of appeals for the domiciliary care allowance and social welfare applications, we now see the same crisis being visited on desperate students. Anybody who wants support and assistance from the State is being denied or left on waiting lists for months. Will the Taoiseach provide the staff and resources required to deal with this crisis? Will he commit to reversing the cuts in students' grants? Will he stop the constant ratcheting up of the registration fees which are already unaffordable for many? Will he allow students the opportunity to study and contribute to our society, an opportunity he is denying many of them at present?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I listened but there was nothing in it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach think the students who are taking to the streets to protest in Cork or are mobilising in colleges across the country are making it up? They are in a desperate situation because of the inadequacy of grants, student poverty and now the crisis in the processing of their inadequate grants. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge on any level this is connected to the so-called reform of the public service? This pattern has been repeated in applications for medical cards and the domiciliary care allowance. Whenever citizens seek support and assistance from the State they are faced with the same refusals and backlogs of appeals. It is because of inadequate staffing and resources and the centralisation of this process. It is not working.He can dress it up as reform, but in reality it is cuts. It is not working and is plunging students into a desperate and unsustainable situation. The Government should provide the resources and the funds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Taoiseach to address the issue of student poverty as a result of inadequate grants and the racheting up of registration fees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it is the students' fault.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Clearing House Group and its unprecedented relationship to Government and top civil servants, as described by the Taoiseach, begins to look like Ireland's dirty little secret when taken together with our extremely low corporation tax and the Taoiseach's unwillingness even to look at the issue of financial transaction tax. Is it not amazing that although the Taoiseach slavishly submits to every dictate for austerity made by the troika, when it comes to hitting public sector workers and pensioners, privatising public services, attacking low and middle income people and the vulnerable in our society, the one line he draws and stands against the troika is on the financial transaction tax and corporation tax? These are taxes that would hit the speculators and financiers, the very people who caused the crisis. However, the Taoiseach draws the line there and protects them. It seems we have discovered the reason.Essentially, these are the speculators who caused the crisis and they have been given unprecedented access to the Taoiseach, the Government and top civil servants. They are writing the script for the Taoiseach - in some cases, as we have discovered, literally word for word - when it comes to his policy on these matters. How is it possible that these people can have seven or eight meetings with the Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just used the term "How is it", which implies a question. How is it that these people can have seven or eight meetings-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the third time, how is it that the financiers and speculators to whom I refer can have eight meetings at the highest level with the Taoiseach and with top civil servants while the representatives of the 450,000 people who are unemployed cannot do so? Why are the representatives of hundreds of thousands of workers not invited to such meetings in order to discuss the problems those people are facing or their ideas for job creation and the protection of their incomes? It is only the bankers and speculators who gain the level of access to which I refer. Should we not just remove the Tricolour from above all State buildings and raise the Jolly Roger instead? What the Government appears to be doing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----is facilitating tax piracy and financial pirates at every juncture, while the ordinary workers of this country are continually hammered when austerity is demanded by the troika.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is already doing a good job in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since September. I am concerned with the position for the entire year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach indicated that it met on six previous occasions earlier in the year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of those who work in it did so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a pirates' cabal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not forget Loughlinstown.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment. When this compact was first presented, the emphasis was almost entirely on debt and deficit reduction. These are the key targets defined in the treaty. However, pressure from popular opinion, protests and alternative analyses by economists has slowly but surely started to shift the powers that be from their sole focus on debt and deficit targets while ignoring the impact on economic growth, unemployment and public services. The Government has claimed that it is among the leading advocates in the European Union of emphasising growth and jobs in order to counterbalance the austerity required in meeting these targets. In developing the Fiscal Council's role, is it not reasonable to require it to consider the matters set out in the amendment? Even the IMF has now acknowledged that the impact of austerity was much worse than initially anticipated and that it will ultimately affect economic growth, thereby increasing the difficulty of meeting the very targets set out in the treaty. If growth does not occur we may not be able to meet the targets. In that context, it is reasonable to widen the role of the council to include a focus on the impact of financial and economic policies on these areas. The resource argument is not compelling. The fiscal advisory council was at pains to tell us that its costs were not significant. I do not think its members receive any payments other than certain expenses. What are the resource implications of broadening its mandate or even bringing other organisations onto the council to offer a closer focus on growth and employment than the particular economists chosen by the Minister might bring? The amendment appears to be minimal in terms of expanding the council's mandate to include assessments of growth and employment. I do not see why the Minister cannot accept it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Same here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The way in which the Government is dealing with the credit unions and the way this debate is being conducted is both telling and instructive, particularly when one considers how it deals with the banks, other financial institutions and the IFSC Clearing House Group. The latter ensures the policies of big for-profit financial institutions are translated, almost word for word, into Government policy. The Bill before the House has the potential to do serious damage to the ethos of the credit union movement, which is deeply ironic. We must ask whether credit unions should be made to look more like the banks more or whether the banks should be made to resemble the credit unions more closely. Do we not need a financial system which operates much more along the lines of the model offered by credit unions rather than on the basis of the for-profit ethos of the banks and major financial institutions which caused the economic crash? Most ordinary and sensible people would say the credit union movement offers the sort of model we require. It was not the credit unions that got us into the current crisis. They offer an alternative model for a financial and banking system, but some of the measures contained in the Bill seriously threaten to undermine their ethos. These measures will also give rise to the possibility of some credit unions either being forced to close or merge with each other. Furthermore, they will undermine the democratic principle which lies at the heart of the credit union movement. As a result of the fact that a guillotine is being imposed on Second Stage, we do not have the time to elaborate on the issues involved. That is outrageous, particularly as we were only informed about the use of the guillotine at the last minute. The term limits being imposed by the Minister seriously threaten to undermine the volunteer basis on which credit unions are run and will be particularly detrimental to small credit unions. The prohibition on family members serving on the boards and committees of credit unions also seriously threatens to undermine the volunteer basis on which the movement operates. The move to abolish the position of treasurer will shift the balance away from members controlling credit unions and towards full-time managers doing so. The imposition of decades' worth of banking legislation on the credit unions is a serious mistake. It is also a misapplication of the type of regulation needed for the out of control banking sector but which is not required for the very sensible and functioning credit union movement. The regulation to which I refer may well threaten to undermine that movement. Credit unions only lend approximately 40% of the money they hold. Rather than being obliged to deposit that money in the banks or send it to other countries, they want to be able to use it to finance valuable community projects. They also want to lend it to the Government in order that it might initiate job creation projects, etc. However, the credit unions are not being facilitated in this regard. As the previous speaker indicated, credit unions want provision to be made for the sharing of services in order that their members might access such services in their own credit unions but also at others throughout the country. It was promised that the legislation before the House would facilitate the sharing of services. However, it does not contain specific provisions in that regard. There are many other issues which arise. I urge the Minister to listen to the credit unions and their members and pay heed to their ethos. Credit unions offer a model that the for-profit banks have completely failed to offer.
