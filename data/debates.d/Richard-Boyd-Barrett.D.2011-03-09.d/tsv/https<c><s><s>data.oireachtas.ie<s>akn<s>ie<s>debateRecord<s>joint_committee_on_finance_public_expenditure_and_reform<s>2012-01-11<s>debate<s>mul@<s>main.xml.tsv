However, a large number of pensioners had extreme anxiety caused to them by the Revenue Commissioners because of a systems failure on its part and a failure to properly communicate.  I am educated to third level and yet I find tax forms and other related documents complex and difficult to deal with.  How much more difficult must it be for the elderly and the frail, some of whom may have literacy or numeracy problems?  Consequently, the Revenue is responsible for this matter and it owes a profuse apology for the handling of it.  The onus is on the Departments in question to make it clear to people what their tax liabilities are.I still have not received a clear explanation of how letters can be sent to people categorically informing them they have tax liabilities when they have none.  One case was brought to my attention of a man who was informed he had extra tax liabilities because he had a Department of Social Protection pension when in fact he did not.  When he pointed this out, Revenue informed him it was his responsibility to get the Department to confirm this.  When he asked the Department to inform Revenue that he had no pension from it, he was told the Department did not do that.  Eventually, after many rows with the Department, it informed Revenue he had no pension from it.  Is it not reasonable to ask for a bit of joined-up thinking between different Departments and for people to be told what their tax liabilities are instead of having to work it out for themselves?Two years ago the Revenue Commissioners stopped sending people their tax credit certificates.  If people do not get these, how are they meant to know their tax position?  In the case I referred to earlier, the gentlemen in question inquired of Revenue why they did not send out tax certificates anymore, he was informed it was due to cost cutting.  Is it true cost cutting is partly responsible for this debacle?
