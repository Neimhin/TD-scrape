RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, are we dealing with the Title or with the definitions section also?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will refer to the Title of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point I am making is that the Title section refers to this Bill being in the public interest and the stability of the European Union.  Is that not a farcical suggestion given what we now know, particularly in the aftermath of the unravelling of the Spanish attempt to recapitalise its banks and separate that aspect from its sovereign debt.  There will be a consequent liability imposed on ordinary Spanish people and the consequences will almost certainly mean that Spain will be locked out of the international bond markets and that €100 billion will turn into €200 billion, €250 billion or a lot more once it has to borrow to roll over its debts, manage its deficit, which will balloon, etc.  The evidence that this approach does not work is definitive.  Fianna Fáil have more excuses at this stage than the Minister and European leaders because one could argue that at the outset of this crisis people were bumped along by events and panicked into giving bank guarantees wrongly believing that could stem the crisis.  In some ways it was difficult for anybody to get their bearings on what was happening but the jury is out now in terms of the possible consequences of giving blanket guarantees to the banking system and forcing the citizens of this State to pick up the tab for that.  It is a disastrous strategy because the direct effect of recapitalising the banks and putting the sovereign on the hook will be to immediately force countries out of the bond markets, make them unable to finance themselves, lock them into a spiral of ballooning debt, ballooning deficits and then force them into further austerity programmes to pay for that, with all the negative consequences in terms of contracting economic growth.  The evidence for that is piling up across Europe.I do not understand the reason the Minister and others who represent states that are the victims of this are not screaming from the rooftops at the madness of this approach.  How can it be justified when it is clearly not producing the stability this approach claims it will bring about and when is clearly not in the public interest?  It is counter to the public interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see the difference between that and what the other speakers did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask a specific question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a specific question.  At the outset the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, said the bank guarantee would cover only a few billion euro for the banks but it got worse and we ended up paying €70 billion, with all the desperate effects of that in terms of deficit and debt for the State.  Initially, Spain was talking about €40 billion.  It is up to €100 billion now.  If it is locked out of the markets we do not know where it will end.  It may involve hundreds of billions of euro.  Italy will have to roll over approximately €1 trillion in debt.  If it is locked out of the markets as a result of similar action we are talking about an enormous hole, so to speak.  Is it not the fact that this cannot work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not have the Spain issue then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The picture is becoming clearer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A veto.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is difficult to know where to start.  One feels like one is signing up to the economic death warrant of the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is what I think it is.  The Government has done its very best to downplay the real consequences of this.  For the record, we did not discuss this during the referendum campaign.  Some of us on the "No" side attempted to discuss it and we got disingenuous responses from the Government about the potential liability for the citizens of the country with regard to ratifying the ESM.  When I tried to raise the issue of the potential consequences of ratifying the ESM during the referendum I was told by the Minister, and certainly by the Taoiseach, that we were not discussing the ESM, we were discussing the fiscal treaty and that we would discuss the ESM later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was €1.2 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister always referred to the figure of €1.2 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not.  This is cute hoor politics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  When I directly tried to quote Article 3 in the Dáil and stated that the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, was putting the people of this country on the hook for €11 billion, the standard response was a denial by the Government and a claim that we would only invest €1.2 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.  It was disingenuous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a rhetorical point.  I am stating that this matter was not discussed despite the Minister's claim that it was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us clarify the matter.  This Bill puts ordinary Irish citizens on the hook for €11 billion.  The Minister suggests this amount might not be called in and he cannot say what the circumstances might be in which we would be called upon to make these payments.  The Spanish process is only beginning.  As a result of Spain's request for €100 billion to recapitalise its banks, it will apparently be locked out of the international markets-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on, this is feta cheese stuff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not casting aspersions on the people of Spain.  God help them.  Europe is forcing ordinary citizens to bear responsibility for the determination of the European Central Bank, ECB, the Spanish Government and the European authorities to bail out the banks at all costs.  By signing up to this Bill, we would be on the hook for it as well because the ECB, Angela Merkel and company are determined that all of this must be routed through the sovereign and guaranteed by ordinary citizens.  Otherwise they will not bail out banks.  We are paying with massive austerity for the privilege of bailing out the banks.  This is the reality.  I do not know why the Minister is trying to claim otherwise.  The point I am putting to him is that in addressing Article 3 and given that the Bill's passage would put Irish citizens on the hook for up to €11 billion, it is the responsibility of the committee and the Dáil to ask about the likelihood of the €11 billion being called in and from where we would get that money.  This does not require catastrophic predictions or speculations.  It requires a reasonable assessment of what is occurring in Spain and Italy and what might occur in France.  One need not be a prophet to work out the likely sequence of events.As Spain will almost certainly require €100 billion in the first instance to recapitalise its banks, it is already facing the prospect of being locked out of the markets and may not be able to fund itself, in which case it will need even more money.  We do not know the exact figures, but there have been speculations about €200 billion, €250 billion and more.  Italy's bond yields are increasing and it may not be able to finance itself.  The ESM would be called upon to bail it out as well.  During the coming years, Italy must roll over a debt of approximately €1 trillion.  We do not know how large the problem in the French banks is, but they are likely to need assistance.  Is it not fairly likely that we will need to make the full contribution of €11 billion to the fund?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If that is a possibility and to repeat Deputy Doherty's question, from where might we get that money?  We should know the answers to these questions.  Is it not the case that, irrespective of whether we get the money from the markets or the ESM, the people will pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we borrow or take the money from our own funds, which the Minister seems to believe are lying around,-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to go around the houses on stuff that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister just went around the houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I deserve the same latitude as other members.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is another question I want to ask.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to respond briefly to the point just made.  I reject completely that the Government was upfront about the fact that the Irish citizens are on the hook for €11 billion.  Phrases like "contingent liability" which were muttered by the Minister occasionally in response-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach stated, when I raised this in the Dáil, that we were not discussing the European Stability Mechanism but rather the fiscal treaty.  When the €11 billion issue was raised, the response was always to say that only €1.27 billion had to be put-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not distributed.  People did not know of it and the Minister did not talk about it.  In reality, the Government did not want a debate.  I have made my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did our very best and the Government completely downplayed it.  In some cases, it misinformed or misled people about the real consequences of the ESM.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In plain language - not accountancy language - the reality is that we are committing to pay up to €11 billion into the ESM if we are asked to do so.  There is a very strong likelihood we will be asked to do so.  It is not simply a matter for Spain what happens there because in signing up to this, we are taking on the responsibility to bail out Spain, Italy or any other state signing up to the ESM.  Therefore, it is our business what goes on, what is likely to happen given the significant hole that has emerged in the Spanish banks, and the likelihood that Spain and Italy will need a massive bailout.If I understand the Minister correctly, he has said we will not be required to increase the amount of our contribution to the ESM unless we go through national procedures, or that it will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That implies we have a national veto but I must take the Minister's word on that.  It seems to be the interpretation of Article 10.  Will the Minister clarify there is no veto on the €11 billion if the ESM requires us to make the contribution?  If a simple majority of the board of governors requests we make the additional contributions up to €11 billion, we will have to do it.  There is no veto in that regard and we are seriously on the hook for the €11 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought we had gone over this ground.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not answer my question about the board of governors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a direct question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one increases the lending volume-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand the Minister's suggestion that if, as is quite possible, the European Stability Mechanism were required to significantly increase the amount it lends, Ireland would not have to pay in more and increase its contingent liability.  Is that not the reality?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one question to which I did not receive an answer.  Will the Minister confirm that the ESM can require us to increase paid in capital, up to the €11 billion figure, by a simple majority decision of the board of governors and that Ireland would not have the power to prevent such a scenario if the board were to make that call?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have not dealt with it.  The Minister did not confirm that the scenario I had outlined was correct.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am referring to Article 9.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, Article 9 states: "The Board of Directors may call in authorised unpaid capital by simple majority decision to restore the level of paid-in capital".  I ask the Minister to confirm that the amount Ireland will have to pay in may be increased up to a figure of €11 billion by virtue of a decision by a simple majority of the board of governors and that were such a decision to be taken, the Minister could not do anything about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Calling in authorised unpaid capital means increasing the actual amount we pay over.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am not.  I am reading from the treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not deal with it.  He referred to Article 10, whereas I referred to Article 9.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ESM is potentially going to be one of the most powerful bodies in Europe that might literally hold the fate of states and the eurozone in its hands. It seems absolutely extraordinary that it would seek immunity from any sort of legal oversight by the governors or its staff as to its activities, its decisions and how it came to make those decisions, and that its archives should not be subject to scrutiny.  Essentially, it would be a law unto itself.  Why on earth would the people who are involved in negotiating the establishment of the ESM want to create this enormously powerful financial institution and ensure that it is above the law and subject to no scrutiny whatsoever at any point now or in the future?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They can make decisions that will have very far-reaching, fundamental and potentially devastating impacts on millions of citizens in Europe, and yet they will not be subject to any legal scrutiny.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They might do to us what they did to Greece.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why would it want legal immunity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an extraordinary statement.  To throw out the red herring that the People Before Profit Alliance could be the real threat to the future of Europe-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and millions of its citizens is pretty extraordinary.  The likelihood of legal action preventing the ESM from doing anything is minimal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is minimal.  Can the Deputy give me an instance in which that is likely to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is he seriously suggesting that if an institution holds the key to the future of millions of citizens, making decisions that could devastate their lives or fundamentally affect them in one way or another, those citizens should not have some right to legal recourse against that institution?  What possible reason could there be for inviolability of the offices, documents and archives of the ESM?  They can never be looked at, so we will never know how decisions were made, the reasons or motives behind them or the arguments for making one decision rather then another.  It is like something out of a James Bond movie.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the Minister's rhetoric about small parties threatening the fate of Europe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are marching towards 1984.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, indeed, and the Minister is dragging us there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not know what they are doing, so how could we make them accountable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister clarify that the staff of the ESM will pay no tax whatsoever?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to clarify why the staff of the ESM should not have to pay tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is how the ESM is going to work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are the ESM secrets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say either of those two things.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No one actually said that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a lighter note, we wish the Minister well in trying to get a better deal for Ireland in terms of the banking debt but we are somewhat gloomy about whether the approach and tactics he is employing can deliver that result.  To make a topical analogy, we are all hoping that Ireland will beat Spain tonight but we are not sure if the strength of the team or the tactics of the manager are likely to deliver that result.
