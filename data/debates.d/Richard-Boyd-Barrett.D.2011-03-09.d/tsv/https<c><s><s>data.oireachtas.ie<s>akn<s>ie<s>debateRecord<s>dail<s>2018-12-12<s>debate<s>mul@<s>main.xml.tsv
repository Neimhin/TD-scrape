RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of Solidarity-People Before Profit, I extend my sympathy and condolences to the Harte and Barnes families. Both of the deceased were a bit before my time and I would not have been that familiar with Paddy's record but it has been very impressive to listen to it recounted here. I congratulate the Harte family and pay tribute to them for putting up with the travel Paddy would have done up and down from Donegal to here for 30 years. If I stayed in here for 30 years, my young fellas would absolutely kill me. The family must be very proud of such a record. To stick at it for that long shows extraordinary stamina if nothing else. The Island of Ireland Peace Park in Belgium is an extraordinary achievement for which the family should be very proud. I know that Deputy Seán Barrett will have a lot more to say about Monica Barnes. I am not sure if I ever met her. It is quite possible I did because my aunt Janet Kinsella, who was a stalwart of the Fine Gael Dún Laoghaire branch certainly would have known her and known Deputy Barrett also. It is very possible I met Monica at family occasions. As a young fella, up to no good on the streets of Dún Laoghaire and before I took any great interest in politics, I would have certainly been more than familiar with the names of Barnes, Barrett and Cosgrave as they were emblazoned across the lamp posts of Dún Laoghaire. Although I would not have shared the Fine Gael affiliation, and I had many robust debates with my aunt Janet on politics, I was aware of Monica's central role in the fight for women's rights in this country, her opposition to the 1983 wording of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, her support for the right to divorce and her historic role in a broader social movement to achieve rights and equality for women. With the tremendous changes that have happened with the recent vote to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, we cannot say anything other than we owe a debt of gratitude to trailblazers like Monica Barnes, and many others who are not still with us and who fought against the tide in those early days when it was neither profitable nor popular to do so. Her family deserve to be very proud of that. It is sad that she is not here to see the great victory that has been the long-term impact of a struggle that people like Monica Barnes started many years ago. My sympathy and condolences go to her family.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tory Party is in a mess of its own making. Its members have played with the fires of xenophobic nationalism, of anti-immigrant sentiment, of nostalgia for some imagined historical imperial glory and whatever else motivates these rather strange people in the Tory Party. They are tearing themselves apart currently. Frankly I am not sorry to see them do so given the dangerous politics they play with and the damage that successive Tory governments have done to working class people in the United Kingdom. One hopeful sign from this mess is when Theresa May starts talking about the real possibility of a united Ireland. Even though she desperately wishes to avert it and while others speak of "my precious union" one has to acknowledge the possibility of a united Ireland. It is time for us to take it very seriously. While all of us would prefer some sort of resolution to prevail in the situation, if it does not prevail and Britain crashing out of the EU is on the agenda, then it seems that the issue of a united Ireland also comes very seriously onto the agenda. It has to be completely unthinkable for us to consider for even one moment the possibility of a border being erected for any reason by anybody in that context. This is not just the possibility that the Tories or the DUP might wish to erect a border in the circumstances of a hard Brexit: the European Union might insist on it to protect its precious Single Market. The Tories want to protect the precious union and the EU leaders want to protect their precious market. Ireland's position has to be to insist that from no direction and for no reason are we willing to accept or co-operate with the installation of a border between the North and the South. We should argue publicly that in the circumstance where that might become a possibility or threatened from any direction the people north and south of this island should have the right to express their will democratically in a referendum on Irish unity. Democracy and a commitment to the unity of the island should require that. Another interesting aspect of the currently unfolding debacle in the Tory Party, members of which are quite happy to tear each other part, is that the one thing the Tories are capable of uniting on is their fear of a Corbyn government and their fear of a left wing government. This is the reason Theresa May will survive politically, if she does. As much as they are taking lumps out of each other they want to stop at any costs the possibility of a left wing Government. It is worth considering the significance of that, especially given the events unfolding in France at the moment. Among other considerations that would have been discussed at the European Council, the upheaval and elemental social explosion taking place in France is a welcome counter blast to the rotten politics that have been played out in the Brexit debate and it has been a very welcome counterblast to the terrifying development of the rotten rise of extreme forms of nationalism and the far right taking place all over Europe. Although the yellow vest movement is somewhat incoherent, and while there are certainly some dodgy elements operating in certain places, overwhelmingly this is a mass movement of the poor, the dispossessed and the working people who are angry at social and economic inequality and the misguided, unfair and unjust priorities of the Macron government. These priorities were best characterised by the attempt by the Macron government to on the one hand get rid of a wealth tax and reduce taxes on the rich, and at the same time unload the cost of that measure onto the poor in the form of regressive taxes under an apparently environmental guise that would hit the less well-off. This is at the base of the yellow vest explosion. As I said earlier, there are some far right elements in certain places trying to take advantage of this and turn it in a nasty right wing direction but overwhelmingly one can see in the pictures of the protesters that faces are black, white, north African men and women. The demands they make are for economic and social justice, for an end to precarious work and for fairness in how the tax system works.The anger over those issues runs right across Europe and into this country and elsewhere. In respect of the revolt that is taking place, there are now protestors in Iraq wearing the yellow vests. In Egypt, where I note this conference referred to in the Council is taking place and where the al-Sisi dictatorship is digging the grave of the Arab Spring, they have banned the sale of yellow vests out of fear that on the anniversary of the Arab Spring, the Arab masses might take to the streets wearing them. There is an internationalism - the internationalism of the poor, the downtrodden, the vulnerable taking to the streets and demanding economic and social justice. That is something we should consider strongly for this country, the world and Europe, as the counterblast to the rotten Tories and the far right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will start by referring to what the Taoiseach stated earlier and the use of the term "extreme". This has become a familiar trope of the Taoiseach when referring to the socialist left and our policies. It is part of a wider, quite worrying, narrative that is taking hold in the mainstream political establishment across Europe, which says there are extremists on the right and extremists on the left and then the nice, sensible, pragmatic centre. An issue such as this tests that narrative in a concrete way and refutes it in the strongest terms. For Elaine, who I have mentioned here previously but whose case is still on my desk, the situation is extreme. It is now past the date when she must leave her house. The landlord is evicting her and her four children on the ground of sale. She is now overholding. Although she did not have legal grounds to appeal she appealed just to delay the process because she had nowhere to go. Now, days before Christmas, she is faced with having to overhold or put herself and her four children into homelessness. It is worth pointing out what homelessness will mean for Elaine. She has been pleading with the local authority and the various agencies and bodies to try to find a solution. She does not want to overhold or to be in a confrontation with her landlord, who has told her he is going to the District Court to take out a summons to evict her.She went to the council and she was told the place finder service could not find anywhere for her. There is no emergency hub accommodation available for her and she tries every day to look for housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies but cannot find them. Most of the time she does not even get a response. The only response she received, after checking with multiple landlords, was one who asked her to send a landlord reference and a work reference. She had a good landlord reference, which she sent on but as a mother of four kids she was not in a position to work and did not have a work reference. She has not heard back from that landlord, who was the only one who even bothered to reply. It is because she is a HAP applicant. She literally has nowhere to go. She was asked if she could find bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel and self accommodate. She is looking every day and cannot find one. The place finder service cannot find one. There is none. That is extreme. In the past few days, she has found herself in another dilemma. As we are approaching Christmas, her young children pleaded with her to put up a Christmas tree. She debated on whether or not to put up a tree because she did not know if she was going to be in her current place with her kids for Christmas. Eventually she submitted to please her children and the Christmas tree was put up, but she does not know if she will be in the place in a few days' time. The question for the Minister is, "What is Elaine to do?" If she has to get out of her current place, that is extreme. Everything about Elaine's circumstances is just about as extreme as one could get. How can the Minister claim that a Bill that prevents that from happening is extreme? The Bill would provide the ability to say to the landlord, "Sorry, it may be inconvenient and a bit of a problem for you, but given that Elaine has nowhere to go, we are not allowing you to evict her." What is extreme about that? It is a very reasonable thing for the law to say in the teeth of a crisis such as the one we currently face. As Deputy Barry pointed out, the provisions in the Bill are quite common in other jurisdictions in Europe. One would hardly accuse those countries in Europe, which have already been detailed, of having extremist regimes. We are just trying to stop the flow into homelessness. That is the point. Unless the Minister can provide an answer for Elaine, then morally he has not got a leg to stand on, and neither has any Deputy in this Dáil, in opposing this Bill. The Minister must respond to Elaine's situation, and there are many more people like Elaine who are facing that same dilemma coming into Christmas. I want to make another point about the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the contribution the State's social housing policy is making to the extreme situations people are facing. At this morning's Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, attended by the Minister, I asked about HAP tenancies, or what the Minister calls social housing solutions. I asked how many people have had to leave those social housing solutions because the landlord has pulled out. The Minister sent the figures to us after the meeting, which in fairness he promised he would. The number is 2,624. This are 2,624 Elaine-type situations. What the Minister described as a social housing solution has actually turned out not to be a solution but has resulted in people being plunged back into the extremity of Elaine-type situations. It is not a housing solution and the Minister should stop calling it a housing solution. The Minister should certainly not massage the housing waiting lists by taking people who get HAP tenancies off the housing list. Until HAP was invented if a person was housed while on the waiting list he or she would not face an Elaine-type situation. A person was housed for life, unless he or she failed to pay the rent or did something terrible. That is the difference between a council house and a HAP tenancy, and I put it to the Minister that it is all the difference in the world. Some 90% of the Minister's social housing plan, Rebuilding Ireland, depends on those kinds of tenancies. The Minister can say 17,000 HAP tenancies work, but if 2,624 have unravelled, how many more will unravel? The answer is that thousands will unravel. We just have to look at the figures. For years to come - well beyond 2021 and Rebuilding Ireland - the State will be responsible for plunging thousands of people, including children, into Elaine-type situations. It is not right. The Bill seeks to address this so that the State will not allow that to happen and people cannot be put into that sort of extreme situation. Add to this the absolutely shocking and extortionate rents currently being charged in the private rental sector. Some weeks ago I held up a newspaper property supplement to the Taoiseach showing the unbelievable rents such as €2,000 and €2,200. IRES Reit has tried to charge €2,800 for three bedroom apartments. Who can afford that? Everyone in those places is literally one pay cheque away from an Elaine-type housing emergency. We are not in control of the private rental sector and we are not building the social and affordable housing that is genuinely secure and which will not lead into those Elaine-type extreme situations. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to support this measure, even on a temporary basis while we are faced with this emergency. If we get out of this emergency in five or ten years, we can look at it again. As of now there is simply no moral justification for people like Elaine and her children, and thousands of others like them, being put into that sort of extreme situation. It is not right and it is not just. It is shameful and the Bill seeks to address it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not. I said it could have been public housing.
