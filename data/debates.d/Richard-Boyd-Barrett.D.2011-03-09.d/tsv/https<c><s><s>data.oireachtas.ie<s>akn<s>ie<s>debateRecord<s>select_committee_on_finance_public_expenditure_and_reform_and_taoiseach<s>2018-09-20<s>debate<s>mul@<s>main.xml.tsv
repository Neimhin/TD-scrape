RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this the local property tax, LPT, stuff?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from that and a point I made in the debate yesterday, according to Revenue's own figures, 96% of those who seek deferrals do so because their income is insufficient. I believe the income threshold is €15,000. The Minister of State can correct me on the figures but the vast majority - 96% - of those who seek deferrals do so on income grounds, that is, they cannot afford to pay it. In addition, regarding the deductions made by employers, if I read the figures from Revenue correctly, they indicate that 63,000, and another 22,000 on top of that, which is 85,000 people, have it directly deducted. I assume many of those, and the Minister of State might be able elaborate on this, do so for reasons of having difficulty paying it but it is taken from them anyway by their employer. When all of that is added together, 48,000 people seek deferrals and 85,000 from whom it is taken automatically, probably in most cases because they find difficulty in paying it. That is a huge number of people who just are not able to pay. Does the Government consider the unfairness of that is something that needs to be addressed and that deferring it does not resolve it? It simply pushes it down the road and leads to accumulated debt, and the interest on that debt, when that debt arises from the fact their income is not sufficient to allow them pay it. Has the Government considered that? Does it believe it is fair?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of information, does the Minister of State not know the number of those deductions that are as a result of non-compliance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister of State know what I mean, that it is a mandatory deduction? Do we not know that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There you go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, 96,000 is mandatory-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----so the vast majority of the 160,000 is the State saying it is taking it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When 46,000 or 48,000 - the Minister of State might confirm that figure - are seeking deferrals, 96% of whom are seeking those deferrals because their income is not sufficient to pay, is it not reasonable to deduce that if that percentage seeking deferrals are doing so because of their low income, that a very high proportion of those who are not complying and have it mandatorily taken from them are doing so because they cannot afford it or have extreme difficulty in paying it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister of State comment on the 48,000 we know do not have sufficient income?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is my last question. One of the justifications for the tax at the time was that it was a sort of fair wealth tax. It certainly is not in the case of the 56,000 who seek deferrals because their income is less than either €15,000 as an individual or €25,000 as a couple. Is that not low income? At least in terms of that cohort, is that not fairly harsh?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has increased.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the facts, the Minister of State has indicated that the non-compliance rate has increased steadily for the last number of years, now standing at 97,000. Will he confirm that deferrals, 96% of which are based on insufficient income, have also increased? In other words, there are people whose income is insufficient to enable them to pay and, therefore, they are seeking deferrals? The Minister of State said that the figure for deferrals is 56,000. As far as I am aware, it is 48,000. There has been a leap in the number of deferrals being sought on the grounds of insufficient income, which is pretty significant. Will he confirm that is the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State gave us the figures for 2016 and 2017. We also need the figure for 2015. From my read of the Revenue statistics, the figure for deferrals started at 48,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has increased from 46,000 to 57,700. The Minister of State said that it is not possible for us to deduce why people are not complying but likewise he cannot deduce that those who are complying are doing so on a voluntary or enthusiastic basis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Never.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are into a political ideological debate on which the lines are clearly drawn, and it might be useful to get factual information on it. I had one final question but it has slipped my mind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remember the question I had.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask a one-line question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister of State a figure for the administrative costs of collecting the €470 million in property tax, and if he does not, could he supply it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked for the administrative costs of collecting the property tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a figure for that online cost?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we dealing with section 7?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every opportunity must be taken to highlight the scandalous suite of measures being introduced by this Government to provide a form of corporate welfare to private developers to enable them to profit from the current housing crisis of which Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, is another component.Every opportunity must be taken to highlight the scandalous suite of measures being introduced by this Government to provide a form of corporate welfare to private developers to enable them to profit from the current housing crisis, of which Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, is another component. The suite of measures, when taken together, is shocking in the extreme. It includes NAMA's policy for disposal, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, HBFI and the Land Development Agency. When one thinks about how they add up, it is beyond scandalous. The Mafia could not have dreamt up a scheme like this. What we are doing is selling land to private developers at massive discounts via NAMA or giving developers cheap land via the Land Development Agency. We are then using public money to provide the services infrastructure - roads, sewers and so on - via the LIHAF. Then we are going to lend money to developers, to whom the banks will not lend, to build on that land. The public is doing everything for these people and at the end of this process they will sell the properties they build at unaffordable market prices. We are handing to these people the means of making enormous sums of money, courtesy of the public and, at the end of it, we will have housing that no one can afford. The people who need that housing will not be able to afford it. I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight which engaged with representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, yesterday. They pointed out that while there is no immediate threat of overheating in the economy, the one area where overheating is possible is in the housing sector because rents and property prices are too high. This is creating pressure and could cause economic overheating by fuelling wage demands and labour shortages, thus reducing the capacity of the economy. This Government scheme is going to fuel this further. It is not going to supply housing to the people who need it and will create an overheating pressure within the economy, and yet the Government is going ahead with it. It is beyond belief. The only beneficiary from this will be the developer. I do not understand how the Government can possibly justify this. I am keen to hear the Minister of State's response, but without an absolute condition that no finance is extended to anyone to do anything other than build social and affordable housing, then HBFI is a scandal. If it had the conditionality that finance would be extended to build only social and affordable housing, there would be some justification for it, but other than that, it is outrageous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State has made a very interesting and accurate admission. This will not be of any use in Dublin.We could probably add Cork and other places where not only the crisis is most acute but the different elements that have produced this unprecedented housing crisis, including property prices, are most acute. We are going to put €750 million into an initiative that will have no impact in the areas worst affected by the housing crisis. That is a serious admission.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State said it himself - he was right to do so - it is not going to impact in areas such as Dublin. There is, by the way, an obvious reason for that. The smaller builder cannot access finance or is not building because site values have gone through the roof.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is certainly what Mr. Mel Reynolds is arguing. He is correct, even as it relates to some of the large sites. Firms such as, for example, Hines in Cherrywood will parcel their sites and offer them for sale to smaller builders at extortionate prices. Those prices increase constantly. If planning permission is acquired, for example, the price will increase. If the Government changes the law to reduce standards, the value increases.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A property does not need to have a southern aspect or something can be built higher. All of these little changes, including strategic development zone designation, mean that the value will increase. Therefore, the little builder who buys a site is doing so at an inflated cost. It is not viable for a builder to build without charging astronomical prices. A bank in looking at this situation would not believe it added up and many builders are not getting involved because it does not add up. Arguably, even the larger builders are not building. They are just sitting on land because it does not add up to build. The Minister of State is saying this initiative will not resolve that issue and clearly it will not in places such as Dublin. It will only be effective in places where the crisis is not acute. What is the point of that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem with all this is it is predicated on the idea that if one increases supply it will help resolve the crisis. If we increase supply but the supply is unaffordable it will not resolve the crisis; it will make the crisis worse. That is the basic point I put to the Minister of State and he did not really answer it. We had supply at a very high level before the crash but it was unaffordable supply. At a certain point it became clear that the people who borrowed the money could not pay it back because there was no market for that number of unaffordable properties. Yet we are going to do it again. The banks are saying "We are not doing that again" because they can see where it is heading and they see where it headed last time but the Government is going to step in and do what the banks will not do to repeat the mistakes of the past. I do not see why the Government would do it. It is crazy to do it.Mel Reynolds in particular has been arguing very strongly that housing output will start to decline and will not gradually increase as the Government believes. Developers and builders know that because they know there is not a market for large-scale housing at current prices. However, they have to sell at current prices to recover their costs. They will, therefore, sit on developments or drip-feed housing to keep prices high. It is now proposed to facilitate more of that through House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI. This will not solve the problem we are trying to solve, namely, the housing and homelessness emergency where large numbers of people are locked out of the market because of unaffordable prices. It will also contribute to doing what we did prior to 2008. I am not the only one highlighting overheating in the housing market. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has also highlighted the issue. It is driving up the cost of accommodation to unsustainable levels with all the dangers that creates for the economy. The Minister of State has said nothing that answers that fundamental question. Does he believe that simply by increasing supply, house prices will come down at some point? If he does, he is living in cloud cuckoo land. The evidence shows clearly that as housing supply increased, so too did house prices. They did not go the other way. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State saying that prices went down pre-2008?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pre-2008, housing supply and house prices went up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the question. Does the Minister of State acknowledge that as supply ramped up in the years prior to 2008, prices went up rather than down and we then went over a cliff?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The sector took the rest of the economy with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make pretty much the same point. I find difficulty even at local authority level for the same reasons of trying to find out the details of Part V arrangements between the local authority and the private developers in terms of the 10% or, as it was previously with the affordable element, the 20%. One cannot get sight of these things. One does not know exactly what the arrangements are, which is completely unacceptable when we are talking about public money but is just an extension of the folly of this entire scheme. If one wanted to help a small builder, one could just put out a tender for the small builder to build on public land. By doing it in this way, however, one gets into having to compromise with the market, with all the commercial sensitivity and commercial secrecy stuff, which means public money goes out and there is no real accountability in respect of it. As well as the reasons Deputy Ó Broin outlined, there are myriad reasons this is totally unacceptable and folly, and we will certainly oppose it.
