RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, line 18, after “Oireachtas” to insert “and if in employment in a recognised school, shall be informed in writing immediately”.The first amendment relates to the section of the Bill which amends section 30 of the principal Act and concerns cases where a person is taken off the register of the Teaching Council, which results in them not being paid by the Oireachtas. While I accept that people should be registered and that their subscriptions would be up to date, in many cases it can and has happened that people do not know they have been taken off the register and they continue to work and only discover subsequently that they have not been paid. I believe some cases are before, or have been before, rights commissioners in the context of the Payment of Wages Act where people are contesting loss of income for periods during which they worked but because their subscription to the Teaching Council had lapsed, they were deregistered but were unaware that was the case. There is no dispute about the need for people to be up to date with their subscriptions to the Teaching Council to be on the register, but they should be notified if their salary is to be suspended in order that they can move immediately to rectify the situation. That is the purpose of the amendment. We discussed the issue on Committee Stage but it is a fair amendment and the Government should take it on board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Life is difficult and stressful for all of us. It is difficult to keep up with all of the correspondence we receive, the bills we have to pay, the forms we have to fill in and cope with all of the stresses, strains and complications in getting through the week. I am sure the Minister knows all about this, as I do, and it is no different for teachers. As the Minister said, people might change addresses, have family crises, be away for a few weeks or there could be an illness in the family. There could be all sorts of reasons somebody who generally keeps up his or her payments and ensures he or she is on the register might, even once in a lifetime, let his or her registration lapse by failing to make payment. It seems rough that a person who has been working away, believing he or she will be paid, will discover that he or she is not going to be paid, forfeit a few thousand euro and have to fight to recover a salary for work he or she has done. I do not see why there is a problem in going the extra mile by including in the legislation a requirement that if somebody has been suspended from the register and consequently will not be paid, he or she would be told immediately, giving him or her the opportunity to rectify the matter at the earliest opportunity. This is reasonable and teachers have raised the matter with me. As I mentioned, although I do not know the details, there are cases in which people have had to go to rights commissioners to contest the issue and fight to receive money owed to them. The amendment is fair and reasonable and I do not see why the Minister cannot include it in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 6, line 26, to delete “fit and proper” and substitute “qualified”.The amendment relates to the circumstances in which the Teaching Council would not admit a teacher to the register. A teacher must meet certain criteria, including the council being satisfied that he or she is a "fit and proper" person to be admitted to the register. My amendment proposes to delete this provision and replace it with the word "qualified". The reason is that the term "fit and proper" is too vague, amorphous, subjective and open to interpretation and implies a desire for homogeneity of teachers, that we want robot teachers. We do not. The rest of the section deals in great detail with the need for vetting and vetting disclosure, all of which is entirely legitimate. There is no question but that teachers should be properly vetted in order that they are not a danger to the children they teach. Why, when all of that is in place, does one have to throw in a term such as "fit and proper", given its subjectivity? Arguably, the best teachers are those who are not very proper. During my school days some of my best teachers were the improper ones. I will never forget an English teacher I had, Mr. Kelleher, who inspired my love of English literature such that English became my favourite subject. He used to do crazy things such as jump up and down like a chimpanzee on the teacher's desk to get the attention of students and make a point. He did all sorts of funny, humorous and odd things that one might describe as a little improper. It was often the improper and slightly quirky teachers who captured the imagination of students and inspired them, rather than those who might be thought of as "fit and proper". The term is too vague, amorphous and subjective and smacks too much of conformity, which is not necessarily a good qualification for teaching. This is the basis on which I propose we remove it and insert the more precise term, "qualified".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point because we discussed these amendments on Committee Stage. Even the word "suitable" which the Minister used would be preferable to "fit and proper". As I noted when first proposing the amendment, there is no question of challenging the validity of the vetting process. We need to ensure those who are registered with the Teaching Council are properly vetted and suitable to work with children. However, the term "fit and proper" is inappropriate language. I suspect use of the term elsewhere in legislation dates back to an earlier era when notions of hierarchy and propriety prevailed. It is archaic language which carries the wrong connotations and, more importantly, is too vague and amorphous as a criterion for determining whether an individual is suitable and qualified to be a teacher. The Minister's response does not address my concerns about the terminology and its connotations. Something more precise is required.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	"Appropriate" is a good word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am open to alternatives if the Minister is willing to consider them when the Bill goes before the Seanad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 7, line 4, to delete “fit and proper” and substitute “qualified”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 9, to delete lines 19 and 20.The Bill provides for a matter that is more suited to the industrial relations sphere, namely, the requirement that teachers complete programmes of continuing education and development. This matter deserves greater consultation with teachers instead of making it mandatory for them to engage in continuing professional development. Teachers recognise the need for professional development, but the question of whether training programmes are relevant and useful needs to be discussed in greater detail with them. Teachers have already been forced to work additional hours under the Haddington Road agreement and have lost approximately 20% of their pay. There should be further discussion with them and their union representatives before we introduce an ill-defined requirement for them to complete further work under the guise of continuing professional development. We should not be imposing it on them by law. That is the reason for my amendment which proposes to remove the relevant section. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response, but the amendment is reasonable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the argument has largely been made. As the Minister said, there had been a consultation about the whole framework, although it has not been agreed or finalised. It is a bit of a pig in a poke in terms of what is actually required. This signs it into law and then makes something that is ill-defined into a mandatory requirement. If teachers do not match up they could be de-registered, but I do not think that is the right way to approach these matters. As I said, and Deputy Coppinger has underlined the point, there is no doubt that teachers are committed to the idea of CPD. However, there are questions about what, where and when it is, as well as what conditions are attached to it. In addition, is it useful and relevant? Teachers have relayed stories to me about things they have been required to do which were ridiculous and patronising. They were of no benefit whatsoever in terms of what they had to do in the classroom.  Teachers are very committed to meaningful CPD but how and what it is needs to be agreed with the teachers themselves. They will then no doubt embrace it enthusiastically. It is pre-emptive to put it in the Bill as a requirement when we do not know what "it" really is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 15, line 21, after “constitutes” to insert “serious”.This group of amendments and the next group are the most serious ones. In fact, they revolve around the word "serious". The thinking behind this amendment was not simply dreamt up by me. It arises out of a judgment in the Supreme Court, the Corbally judgment. In that case a doctor, Dr. Corbally, was admonished by the Medical Council but appealed the decision of the Medical Council to the Supreme Court. The judge made a ruling in favour of Dr. Corbally and there is a connection to this amendment and those which follow this group. The judge was absolutely clear in saying that only serious cases should be brought to fitness-to-practise hearings. He said that qualification needed to be included in the types of cases involving hearings about people's fitness to do their job. It is fairly obvious why this should be the case, because there is of course potential for trivial, vexatious, unjustified or disingenuous complaints or allegations to be made. That is not to say we should not also have something that is receptive to real, serious, genuine and legitimate allegations or complaints. There is an important balance to be made in this regard. Certainly, we want to exclude cases that are obviously trivial or lacking in seriousness. The particular language the Supreme Court judge used was that it had to be serious. The Bill has simply not reflected the important caveat put in by the Supreme Court. Indeed, it could make this legislation possibly open to legal challenge as a result. Any hearings that arise from the legislation could be open to legal challenge because it does not have the important qualification about complaints being serious or being about serious misconduct. This series of amendments attempts to rectify this weakness in the legislation. I did not get a chance to attend the relevant meeting but I understand the ASTI, the INTO and the TUI were in the House yesterday making similar points, although they have proposed somewhat differently worded amendments, which will come up in the Seanad. They address precisely the same issue and require the condition of seriousness when it comes to complaints being made. I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say. I believe this is important. Certainly, the teachers and their representatives believe this is an important amendment and that it is required in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Having listened to all the arguments, I am not satisfied with the Minister's response. If she acknowledges the point we are making, then she should accept the amendments. The Corbally case in the Supreme Court underlines the need for a requirement that any complaint in such cases be serious in nature. It is an important threshold which a complainant should have to meet. Any reasonable person will acknowledge there is a potential in a profession like teaching for vexatious, trivial and unjustified complaints. As Deputy Coppinger noted, "poor professional performance" is a very broad term and one that is much too subjective. Unless it is qualified significantly, we will have a situation where all the onus is on the teacher for failures that are not his or hers. As I understand it, the Supreme Court found in the Corbally case that systems failures had to be taken into consideration in adjudicating on any complaint, that is, issues such as the resources available, management issues and all types of other factors that could potentially contribute to instances of poor performance which are not, in fact, the fault of the person against whom the complaint is made. Otherwise, the subject of the complaint might become the fall guy. Against the background of swingeing cutbacks and austerity policies which have led to overcrowded classrooms, special needs assistant caps and so on, the potential for teachers to be accused of poor professional performance when the problem at hand is not really their fault is considerable. Deputy Coppinger, who has direct experience in this regard, has underlined that point clearly. There is an overwhelming argument, backed up by the Supreme Court, that we need to be much tighter, more precise and fairer in dealing with teachers in situations where serious allegations which could be very damaging to their reputation, character and future career are at stake. We must be much more precise as to the thresholds that have to be met for making a complaint which might lead to a fitness-to-practise inquiry. The amendments I am proposing are fair and reasonable and would provide some safeguard for teachers by introducing that threshold of seriousness. I reiterate that all the teacher unions, the ASTI, the INTO and the TUI, have made similar points. The wording they propose for discussion in the Seanad will probably be slightly different from mine but the intention will be the same. I am obliged to mark the Minister's card on this because it is a serious issue. I hope she will reconsider this proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As Deputy Coppinger just pointed out to me informally, there is a certain irony in the Minister for Education and Skills saying that only serious complaints will be looked at but the Minister does not want to put in-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister can use that phrase and sees the necessity for such complaints to be serious, I see no reason for that not to be provided for in the legislation. The Minister has not really responded to the point on the Corbally judgment. I do not know about the legislation governing the Medical Council but I presume the same promises and commitments about it applying to serious complaints only were made, yet it still managed to happen. The issue had to go to the Supreme Court to be rectified and the judge was very clear about the matter. The word he used was "serious". He said these things had to be serious to get to hearing. That was the threshold that had to be met. If it required the Supreme Court to state and assert that requirement, is it not logical for the Minister to insert that qualification or threshold? Otherwise we may end up with cases like the Corbally case where this could be challenged legally. We may end up with an uncertainty that could lead to hearings on things that are not really meeting the threshold of seriousness and the resultant damage that could cause to someone's career, reputation and so on. Everyone is asking for this qualification in the legislation and I do not see why the Minister will not insert it. Nor do I accept the point made on other factors that are outside a teacher's control and that a teacher could not be, under certain circumstances, scapegoated for other issues such as system failures that go beyond them. In fact I would say it happens all the time. Perhaps not all the time. That is too strong, but I would say it happens quite a lot. It is likely to happen more frequently when there are big resource and funding shortages, overcrowded classrooms and resultant stresses. We all know they exist but it is not just about whether they exist now. At any time in the future factors can come into play. They can cause big problems and individuals can be scapegoated because someone does not like them. Someone wrongly blames them for things that are not their fault. They might consider it very serious but any independent observer would say it is clearly not their fault. It is very reasonable to put in a threshold or qualification requiring the matter to be serious. The contraventions or instances of professional misconduct should have to be serious. The whole issue needs to be addressed in a much more precise and qualified manner. It is far too open and vague. I will press the amendment. I know the Minister will not accept it but we will press it. Similar amendments are being tabled in the Seanad. Those amendments will have been worded by people more eminent in legal matters than myself I suspect - probably senior counsel who represent the unions. I hope that if the Minister is not going to accept the amendment that we will press now, she will accept it in the Seanad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 6:	In page 15, line 22, before “poor” to insert “serious”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 15, line 23, after "engaged in” to insert "serious”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 21, line 26, after "inquiry” to insert the following:", and such an inquiry will be held in private although any findings made against a registered teacher may be made public,”.The last group of amendments and this one are the ones teachers are most concerned about. Amendment No. 8 relates to whether inquiries should be held in public or private. The Minister indicated at the outset of this discussion that she intends to introduce amendments in the Seanad that will make the inquiries public. It is poor form to introduce the amendments at a late stage in the Seanad rather than giving us a chance to debate them here in the Dáil. I do not see the case for it. If there was a hint of pandering to a certain prejudice about teachers in the refusal to take on board the last set of amendments, there is an even greater hint in this case given the requirement that the hearings be in public. The Minister has refused an amendment that would ensure only serious complaints would be covered in the legislation. There may be cases in which a hearing should be public if there is a public interest but in many cases, probably the vast majority, there would be no public interest associated with having it heard in public.There might be a voyeuristic, media sensation or scapegoat interest, but there is no public interest. Before we put somebody in a public star chamber, we need a very good reason to do so because it could have lifelong consequences for the person concerned and his or her reputation and career. The potential for this to happen in the case of teachers is very significant for obvious reasons.  Let me make myself clear. I am not saying we do not need a rigorous mechanism through which legitimate serious complaints can be made because we are dealing with a profession that deals with children and young children and their rights must be protected. There is no question about this and we need a very rigorous system to do so. However, because of the nature of the profession, there is, undoubtedly, the possibility of complaints being made that are not well founded and that are purely vexatious, but they could be very serious in nature. Once these complaints are made and put into the public domain, the mud will stick, regardless of whether there is subsequent vindication. Let us be honest. Some elements of the media are scrupulous and conscientious, but others are not. They might be very quick to cover a sensational allegation against a teacher, but they are a lot slower to cover the subsequent vindication of the person concerned. They might be very happy with trial by media of the teacher - the victim for the week in the school of paparazzi journalism - and not give a damn about what the consequences might be for the individual concerned who is deeply immersed in the community.  I know that the Minister will say other professions have these public hearings, but nobody interacts with the community on a day-to-day basis and is an organic part of a defined local community in quite the same way as a teacher. Therefore, we need to be sure we will not put them in a public media star chamber or a kangaroo court where serious and very damaging allegations are made that may not be true but that could be tremendously damaging to someone, unless it is necessary to do so and where there is a genuine public interest in the case being heard in public. This is of the utmost seriousness in terms of the need for justice. Of course, I do not dispute the fact that there is a delicate balance to be struck in this case, but the Minister will need to do a lot to convince me that there is a public interest in having hearings such as this which essentially deal with individuals and their dealings with possibly quite a few others under the gaze of the media in a very public way.  It is set out clearly in the amendment that should there be a finding against a person, it could and should be made public, particularly if there was a public interest at stake, and that there could be serious consequences for others that would require the findings to be made public. These issues need to be looked at and weighed up specifically. I do not agree with the idea that the default position is that hearings would be held in public. It is the case for nurses and midwives - I am not even sure that is a particularly good idea - but, to an even greater degree, we are heading into dangerous territory if we apply it to teachers. People's lives and reputations could be damaged unnecessarily and besmirched in a such a way that they might never be able to recover from it. We should not legislate for this to happen unless we have all of the necessary safeguards in place.  That is the argument to be made. Hearings should be held in private, but the findings could be made public. There are other qualifications regarding where there might be a very definite public interest in an issue. The Minister could insert these qualifications to allow for public hearings to be held in certain narrowly defined cases, but as a general rule, it should not be the case. I will be pressing the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The nub of the issue is the default position. The Minister has made it clear that she favours the default position being that it be held in public without making any serious case for it except what she calls transparency. She needs seriously to consider the possible implications for people against whom there are serious allegations that could permanently affect their lives, careers and reputations and where there is the potential for that to happen frequently without those allegations necessarily being justified or having foundation. Even in cases where they might have justification and foundation and where someone needed to be de-registered or disciplined, what is the public benefit in humiliating them? I do not see the case for it. If anyone wants to make the case for it to be held in public and there is an actual public interest in doing so, there should be provision for that case to be made, but other than that we need to be cognisant that we are dealing with people's lives and reputations where the vast majority of teachers are good people doing their best. I accept that in some cases they might not be doing the best job, but even then it is not about publicly humiliating them and feeding the potential tabloid frenzy that could surround these things. The Minister should row back on this. She should also consider the witnesses, including pupils or anyone else who might be called. Is it really a good idea to hold these things in public? The Minister has said people could be represented. We are not talking about people such as Mr. Denis O'Brien. We are talking about people who are average earners and are already struggling to pay their bills. They cannot do what Mr. Denis O'Brien can do and get high-powered barristers to defend their so-called privacy when we are dealing with hundreds of millions of euro of public money. These are just teachers. On the distinction I made between teachers and nurses, I do not think it is appropriate that nurses, including public health nurses, should have a default position that they would be brought before public disciplinary hearings. It is wrong for them. It is slightly different for public health nurses, but teachers are very identifiable in the community because of the nature of what they do. A public health nurse might fit into that category, but the nurse in the hospital is not quite as identifiable as the teacher in the school who is known by hundreds or possibly thousands of people. There is a very significant potential for a person's reputation to be besmirched when it may not be justified and for it to have an effect on him or her, and the Minister should reconsider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Socialist Party and the Anti-Austerity Alliance for putting forward this Bill. There is no doubt that the "Yes" vote in the marriage equality referendum was a watershed in Irish life and is hugely welcome. Much of the time, we in this House debate issues that are not so positive or fight over what is good or bad, so it was nice to see the political parties in this House united and to see the overwhelming body of opinion in the country demand and succeed in achieving a significant and progressive change. The Yes Equality slogan brilliantly captured the mood. There is no doubt that the resonance Yes Equality went way beyond the issue of LGBT rights. It is phenomenal that we got to a point where the overwhelming majority of people, young and old, supported marriage equality. There may have been a generational aspect to the issue, but I was inspired by the fact that right across the generations people embraced the "Yes" vote and the need to see people as human beings, regardless of their sexual orientation. The victory for the "Yes" campaign was mammoth, but the point is that the notion of equality resonated far further than LGBT rights. It is a logical follow-on from the sentiment that drove the "Yes" vote that the desire and demand for equality should now run through every aspect of life and endeavour in society. This Bill is part of following through on that sentiment and demand for a society where equality is a reality and where discrimination on grounds of religion, sexual orientation, race, Traveller status, disability or any sort of discrimination or prejudice is anathema. It is part of the demand to sweep out any discrimination and to legislate for that. In this case it is in the area of employment and the right for all citizens to be treated without prejudice, regardless of their status. As some Members have mentioned, this Bill speaks to the insistence that a demand or slogan that has been around a long time - the separation of church and State - must be translated by this House into reality. This is what people want and it must happen. It is unacceptable that this policy would persist in any shape or form. I was talking to a teacher earlier and asked to what extent he believed discrimination in this regard persists. He told me that because of the change in sentiment and in the views of people generally, he could not think of many instances of discrimination being persistent, because such is the tide of popular opinion and sentiment that discrimination is being swept aside. That is great but our laws must now reflect that change. It is telling that the political system is always behind and always catching up with the progress that is being made by ordinary people demanding change. The conservative mentality of looking over the shoulder that often persists in conventional political life is slow to make change, even when the tide of public opinion and sentiment has long since decided such changes are necessary. This Bill is a catching up exercise as much as anything else in seeking to pass legislation and demanding that our laws reflect the wishes, views and sentiments of the people for equality. It is important to reflect the left wing point of view, that in demanding this equality and in demanding an end to any discrimination in this regard, we are not - as we are often portrayed - anti-religion and seeking to snuff out people's right to their religious beliefs and ethos. On the contrary, it has never been true of the genuine left tradition that it has sought to deny people the right to express their religious views. I will divert slightly, but since we are all in agreement on this, it is worth making the historical point that the Bolsheviks in Russia had a surprising view, but perhaps not so surprising if one understands their politics. One of the key arguments made by Lenin in his famous pamphlet - What is To Be Done? - was that the job of revolutionary socialists was to defend the rights of religious minorities in Russia against, at the time, the vicious persecution by the tsarist regime which had orthodox Christianity as the dominant religion. Lenin was at pains to defend a religious sect, called the old believers. Similarly, the Bolsheviks defended the rights of Jews who suffered horrendously from pogroms under that regime. This was not because they had any belief or commitment. By and large, they supported a secular society, where there would be separation of church and state, but they were adamant that people should have the right to freedom of religious expression.On the one hand, the Bill demands an end to discrimination on religious or any other grounds but, on the other hand, it demands that people have the right to preserve their own ethos and develop organisations or institutions which promote that ethos. They should be allowed to discriminate in favour of that ethos only where it is absolutely necessary for the specific promotion of that ethos and it should not cross over into other areas in terms of the delivery of services. The obvious examples that have been mentioned include schools and hospitals, for example, where it is utterly unacceptable that preserving a particular religious ethos, or any other ethos, should cross over into the preservation of the ethos becoming an excuse to discriminate against people or to deny them vital services to which they have a right, for example, a woman’s right to choose or whatever else it might be. The Bill strikes a vital balance in that regard. I am pleased the Government has welcomed the Bill. It is entirely in line with the sentiment that came from the referendum. I hope the Government will progress the Bill beyond Second Stage to ensure the legislative changes being sought become law as soon as possible. The demand for equality is not just in regard to social issues but at every level of society, including economic equality. On that front, we have a hell of a long way to go. In fact, economic inequality has got worse not better under the Government. That is the next big crusade.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will. We need economic equality too.
