RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the representatives.  MABS does great work and it has been very helpful to many of my friends and constituents.  It is welcome that people are dealing with the position at the coalface and the human reality of people who find themselves in these circumstances.Dramatic examples were given of the unsustainability of people's debts and while the representatives talked about them having several debt streams, the examples all included a substantial mortgage debt element.  They might not state it explicitly but it strikes me that what they are describing is unsustainable debt for huge numbers of people and no matter how much in terms of resources they might be given, it still does not deal with something that is utterly unsustainable.The representatives may not be in a position to say so but is it not abundantly clear that unless this unsustainable debt burden is relieved by a write-down of some of kind an impossible situation will arise regardless of the resources available?  Do they agree that is the fundamental problem we must deal with, not just in terms of mortgages but that it is a significant part of the extra problem they now face?  I invite them to comment on that proposition.The level of debt people have on their shoulders is unsustainable if huge numbers of them are without work.  What is the representatives' view of the fact that unemployment is a massive contributory factor to that?Much of the discourse around this issue is about moral hazard and so on.  In their experience of dealing with the problem at the coalface, do the representatives accept the proposition occasionally put forward that the majority of people are culpable for their debt position or is it to do with factors such as the behaviour of the lenders, the unemployment crisis and so on?Representatives of the Irish Bank Officials Association appeared before the committee last week and gave a very different perspective from that of the bankers at the top of the banking system, which was that if the people at the bottom, both in terms of the workforce, the debtors, the customers of financial institutions, and public interest voices had more input at the top of the banking and financial institutions they might behave differently.  Given that the banks are now effectively financed by us, would the representatives agree with me that it might be a good idea to have more public interest voices - people representing the debtors or groups representing their interests such as MABS - on the boards of banks to ensure that when they examined these issues they had the perspective of the people in debt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the representatives of all the organisations.  It is very refreshing to hear the perspective from the bottom as opposed to the perspective of people primarily concerned with balance sheets and maintaining the institutions responsible for all this mess.  I read the excellent New Beginning submission before I came in.  If these principles inform the Government's approach to the problem, we would be a long way towards solving the problem in a fair and sustainable away.  I particularly commend New Beginning on restoring some faith in the legal profession by actually giving assistance to people in difficulty.The main point I want to put-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question - I thank the Chairman.  All the suggestions are reasonable and should be implemented as a matter of urgency, regardless of the current situation.  In other words we should have debt resolution legislation.  We should have had it a long time ago.  While the mortgage-to-rent scheme might be suitable for some people, it should only be voluntary and in no circumstances should that involve carrying the debt over, as the Keane report proposes, which is outrageous.  Under no circumstances should the lending institution retain ownership of the asset at the end.  It should be the local authority, as Senator Hayden said.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.Mr. Maguire may have already alluded to the answer to my main question.  While all of that must be done and should have been done long ago, are there not two separate issues of what should have been done and should be in place as a matter of course, and dealing with the exceptional circumstance of what happened during the period of the property bubble?  Another set of measures - effectively emergency measures - need to be put in place for that period, involving write-down.  New Beginning shies away from that, claiming it is politically impractical and so on.  I do not accept that we should defer to the argument that it is politically impractical.  NAMA has just agreed to only go after the cost it paid for the loans.  In other words the big developers and borrowers will get a massive write-down.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I please finish?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If there can be a write-down for the developers as NAMA has indicated it will do, why should we shy away from demanding in the particular and exceptional circumstances that gave rise to the current crisis a write-down to current market value of the mortgages and loans that relate to the period of the property bubble?  Morally and in every other way we should do that and it would begin to free up the economy for the future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I read Mr. Keane's report and listened to his presentation.  How would he respond to the view that I am developing that his approach to this is a microcosm of what is happening in the bigger macro-economic picture in that while he talks about restructuring the debts of people who are in difficulty, the bottom line of what he is doing seems to be to protect the financial institutions and give them the decision-making when it comes to how people's distressed mortgage situations are ultimately dealt with?  That is not acceptable, as some of the previous witnesses before this committee today indicated.  The balance is just wrong.In the recommendations, what jumps out is that those who can discharge their mortgage obligations must do so and blanket debt forgiveness is not recommended.  That does not seem to take into account at all the culpability of the financial institutions in creating this situation.  Is it not arguable as to whether these are legitimate obligations at all, in so far as a very substantial proportion of the debt arose from a situation that was manufactured by the financial institutions, the Government and by developers, and that it is not the responsibility of people trying to put a roof over their heads, were in a difficult situation created by others and are now landed with the consequences of it?Why does Mr. Keane set his face against write down to the level of current market value - in other words, to the real value of these properties?  The figure being bandied about is €14 billion, that that would be too costly and so on.  I do not accept the moral hazard argument but in terms of the costliness, could Mr. Keane tell us a little bit about that figure of €14 billion?  What is it based on in terms of what the cost would be so that we can assess whether write down is a possible and reasonable solution?On the mortgage-to-rent proposal, as I said at a previous committee meeting, it is a reasonable proposal in so far as people wish to do that but it is not a reasonable proposal - perhaps Mr. Keane will clarify if I have misunderstood it - if the person who engages in this scheme still has the debt hanging over him or her.  I am not quite clear what Mr. Keane is proposing in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That must be left behind.Everybody seems to agree that personal insolvency legislation and so on is required.  There is no dispute about the general principle of that.  Will Mr. Keane say a little bit more about what precisely that legislation should involve and how it will shift the balance, as I think he referred to it, towards the rights, concerns and circumstances of the borrower as against the current situation where, essentially, the banks can enforce their contract regardless of the circumstances of the borrower?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Keane is above master Noonan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A suggestion was made by Mr. Ross Maguire of New Beginning that, notwithstanding the need to do all these things that may take time, a provision could be included in the current laws.  If a simple insertion into the current laws on insolvency and bankruptcy that would require the judge to take into account the personal circumstances of the borrower, such as the ability to pay, it would change the game in the courts and give discretion to the judges.  Notwithstanding the need to do all the rest, that is something which could move things on quickly.  I would like Mr. Keane to comment on that.I will use Deputy Mathews's analogy of the car crash.  If we have a big pile up, then we need to reduce speed limits and put in place speed cameras, but most importantly, we need to remove the crash from the road.  What seems to be missing in the group's approach to this is a proposal to deal with the huge pile up in the middle of the road.  By that I mean that the report ignores the loan sharking behaviour of the banks in a particular period, and nothing will be done about it.  This is about the issue of writing down a debt bubble that occurred at that time.  I accept Mr. Keane's point that it does not solve all problems, and that is why we need the speed cameras and the new speed limit, which is the personal insolvency legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is there no reprimand or recommendation to do something that holds to account the loan sharking of the banks during a particular period?  Why is there no recommendation to absolve the borrowers of responsibility for what they did during-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did Mr. Keane set his face against that?
