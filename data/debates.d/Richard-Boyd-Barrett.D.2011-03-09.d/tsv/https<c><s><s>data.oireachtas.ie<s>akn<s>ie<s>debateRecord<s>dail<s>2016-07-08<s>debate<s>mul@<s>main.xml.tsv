RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the debate about again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not hear Deputy Donnelly's speech yesterday but I received an e-mail from somebody who did, who had e-mailed me last February about her mortgage and engagement with the financial institution that used to be Irish Nationwide and became IBRC. It is telling about what is at stake in all of this. I will read out a little of what the person says:I am an IBRC mortgage holder with a performing (just about so far) loan that has just been sold to Mars Capital No 3 Ltd. An unregulated fund. I have stood outside the Dail with other mortgage holders trying to get this government to see sense but no, Michael Noonan had no regard for me or any ordinary person caught up in the Government's liquidation of IBRC. So I wanted to know who will I be dealing with. Who is Mars Capital No3 ltd? I did some research on CRO.ie and discovered that Mars Capital No 3 Ltd had until January 15th, two directors one of whom had the same name as a person who held a senior position in IBRC in the past and who was also in the past an employee of KPMG the firm of liquidators. That surprised me but I am an ordinary person unused to looking at company documents. In recent days that director stood down and another is appointed per new documents lodged with the CRO. The other fact I discovered is that the company has three share holders - all of them charitable trusts which I googled and are associated, I think with a Dublin legal firm. They are named Badb, Medb and Eurydice. What in the name of God has charity got to do with it??? Who would use charitable trusts? Why charitable trusts? Who owns my loan? I am still none the wiser ... I believe this has to be examined. Why hide behind charitable trusts? I took my loan out with a building society not a charity. I stand to be corrected but the charitable trusts concerned may have been in the news in the past. I think I am entitled at least to know who owns my loan considering my government has done the selling.I will inform people, if they do not know, that the charitable trusts were owned by Ireland's biggest corporate tax firm, Matheson, which has been in the news because it was using these three companies to help international hedge funds avoid tax. The Central Bank has reported on the use of these charitable trusts. They are apparently registered to relieve poverty and distress but actually help hedge funds and banks pay billions less in tax in the area of high risk assets. The Central Bank has warned that these structures are potentially extremely dangerous because we do not really know anything about them. This says everything about the web of connections between corporate accountancy firms, the financial institutions that we bailed out, and handing over the mortgages of ordinary people to vultures engaged in aggressive tax avoidance. That same institution gets a write-off but the person who e-mailed me does not get a write-off. They do not get a discount and do not even know who now owns their loan but we discover that the people who own the loan are a legal firm assisting people in tax evasion - I should say "tax avoidance," as I have to use the technically correct term. This same institution can write off €119 million to the benefit of the richest man in Ireland, Mr. Denis O'Brien, who is not tax resident in this country. Apparently he does not live here, although his kids go to school here and he has a yacht in Roundstone, County Galway. Deputy Murphy and I have said these things. In the middle of 2012, when I made some of these points and suggested the Mafia would have something to learn from some of the dealings of the rich in this country, I had the privilege of receiving a letter from Mr. Denis O'Brien castigating me for abusing my Dáil position, with a thinly veiled warning that I had better stop doing it. That is what goes on. Ordinary people like the woman who wrote to me, and thousands of other mortgage holders, some of whom lost their homes, are screwed to the wall by unsustainable mortgage payments and all the devastating consequences beyond that. Some €34 billion of the €64 billion total went into Anglo. All this devastation wrecked the lives of ordinary people, yet this stuff is going on where tax refugees like Denis O'Brien benefit. What was the other write-off he got? Independent News & Media, in which he had a major shareholding - I forgot about it - also had more than €100 million written off. He has done well out of IBRC. That is the sort of stuff that goes on. I support Judge Cregan's request and the legislation here to give him the powers to look into all of this. As Deputy Murphy asked, why did it take us this long to get here? These points were first raised back in 2012 and the Minister and Government had to be dragged along kicking and screaming, obfuscating and resisting at every point the sort of investigation that was necessary into this sort of stuff. It appears to the innocent observer, such as the person who sent me this e-mail and the majority of citizens in this country, to be simply that there is one law for the rich and one for everybody else. The economic crisis was produced by the greed of a tiny network of super-wealthy people positioned in the banks and accountancy firms, often with quite strong associations with some of the major political parties in the country. I remind people about the Moriarty report and its findings on Denis O'Brien's relationship to a former Fine Gael Minister and a transaction in which he got the second mobile phone licence that enriched him overnight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an absolutely fair thing to do, although I am sticking quite closely to the subject matter of it, as opposed to certain previous speakers who managed to stray into discussion of the Brexit vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. It is legitimate, and I will explain the connection if it is not clear. I think it is fairly clear. This is about the disposal of its assets by Anglo Irish Bank and IBRC and huge write-downs it gave to the benefit of one person we know, at least, who happens to be Ireland's wealthiest and most powerful businessman - somebody who had a record of past connections with a previous Fine Gael Government and had adverse findings made against him.My point is this stuff still goes on, it needs to be investigated and it has taken us this long. Therefore, although I support the Bill, I ask why it has taken us this long. Why must we now have a judge tell us that the initial basis of the commission was inadequate and could not do the job it was set up to do? It is not difficult to be a little suspicious and conspiratorial. I would like to think I am wrong, but one looks at the record of this saga, of how long it took us to get to the point where the Government even accepted that it was necessary to have an investigation into it, and then we have an investigation set up which we subsequently discover simply did not have the teeth to get to the sort of answers that it was set up to get. Added to that web of connections is the fact that at the centre of this is a look at a deal with the aforementioned Denis O'Brien, and meanwhile the ordinary mortgageholder is shafted. That is what ordinary people see, that is what I see and that is what needs to change. I will respond to probably the only relevant question Deputy Joan Burton raised when she spoke about our attitude to the banks and how we could avoid this. Of course, something we must learn out of all of this, the debacle of the banking crisis and IBRC, is how all that happened and how we ensure it does not happen again. I am not sure this investigation can give us those answers. This is more specific, and rightly so. As Deputy Paul Murphy stated, if the commission throws its net too wide, it will be like Jarndyce and Jarndyce, for those who have ever read Charles Dickens' Bleak House, the legal battle that goes on for so long that nobody remembers what it was all about in the first place but a lot of lawyers get rich. Indeed, how pertinent that remains today in so many cases. We do not want a Jarndyce and Jarndyce. We want a short, sharp focused investigation into the particular transaction in relation to Siteserv, Denis O'Brien etc., and maybe a few of the other big write-downs that happened, and whether that was all above board. That is what we need. I hope this investigation can get those answers. I remain somewhat sceptical, given the saga of all this to date. Even beyond that, and with the terms of reference of what this can achieve, we need to ask how we prevent all this happening again. Contrary to what Deputy Joan Burton and sometimes the Government suggest, we are not naysayers who do not have a proposal. We have a definite, simple proposal, that is, that banks - all of them - should be taken into public ownership and their mandate should change in order that it is not primarily about making money but about lubricating the economy and having particular social and societal objectives. That is what banking should be about. If banking were about that, we would not have had IBRC and this sort of stuff. Where does that culture come from where, if this person's e-mail is correct, somebody who was working for KPMG was then working for IBRC and then ended up working with this charitable trust that has taken over some of the loans sold to it by IBRC? The sort of culture that produces that is simply one of greed that is deeply entrenched in the logic of a private for-profit banking system. It is the nature of the beast. It cannot be regulated out of existence and it is a fantasy to believe it will be. Signs on it that we are correct, because after the crash, in 2008, that was the big mantra. There was a general acceptance, even from those who had been the cheerleaders for all this madness prior to 2008, that maybe we needed to look at a bit of regulation, in Europe and in Ireland. The story moves on to where we are now and it has to be asked whether anything has changed when, once again, the property market is going crazy and we are selling off these banks that we bailed out just as they get to the point where they can generate a bit of revenue which we could possibly put back into areas such as housing. Deputy Joan Burton and the Labour Party were involved in starting the flogging off. It is extraordinary. When we are asked where we will get the money from for the big social housing programme that we are always talking about and which it is claimed is the stuff of fantasy, my answer is, simply, the banks. We probably have the best capitalised banks in Europe at present. There are enormous amounts of capital in them and they will not lend it for the sort of things we need. I went to the consultation of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, yesterday on the issue of housing and, of course, the debate was circumscribed by a debate about finance and the complete failure of the market to deliver the investment we desperately need to get it off the ground. It simply does not occur to the Government or the political establishment, which is hard to understand after everything that has happened, that maybe we should take control of the banks we bailed out and direct their lending and investment decisions towards things that would be beneficial to society. To boot, we would have oversight of those banks, of their priorities and of their internal structures and we would have power to do something if anything went wrong, none of which we have in either these privatised bodies or these bodies that are set up and ring-fenced with commercial secrecy in order that detailed questions cannot be asked or five or six years of criticism, demands and pressuring the Government must be gone through eventually to get to some kind of investigation. Surely we can do a bit better than that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party Deputies are not here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is still no one here from the Labour Party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not 15 minutes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I listened to the Minister's speech earlier. He implied that those of us looking to completely abolish FEMPI legislation essentially have no plan to finance such a move. He implied that we were reckless and that the calls amounted to the politics of permanent protest and so on. First of all, let me state what we are talking about. We are talking about money that was stolen, mostly from low-paid public sector workers. I will underline the point that they were mostly low paid. In the disgusting demonisation and witch hunt that occurred at the time this legislation was brought in, public sector workers were made out to be public enemy No. 1 and the view was that they deserved to have their pay slashed. That was one narrative at the time. They were robbed with this narrative ringing in their ears. They were blamed for an economic crisis they had not created. It had been created by bankers and developers and the two major political parties in this State who cheered on those interests for many years. The scale of the robbery was extraordinary. I will underline the point that the majority of these workers were underpaid. Fully 83% of public sector workers earn less than €60,000. Indeed, the vast majority earn less than €40,000. The scale of the robbery was extraordinary. If a worker earned €30,000 in 2009, his income dropped to €28,500 as a result of FEMPI legislation. Therefore, between 2009 and 2015 such a worker would have lost €16,000 or that amount was stolen from him. If a worker earned €40,000 in 2009, that worker had €27,000 taken off him cumulatively in subsequent years. If a worker earned €50,000, he had €38,000 taken off him in those years and so on. They have been robbed since 2010. Under the Government's Lansdowne Road proposals, even by the end of 2017 they will still be earning less in take-home pay than they were getting in 2009 before this completely unjustified robbery of their income took place. That is what we are talking about. We believe it was wrong to do it to them then. It was wrong to make them the scapegoats for the crimes of others year after year since 2010. There is absolutely no justification for continuing this theft of their income - we are not talking about pay increases, we are talking about giving them back what was taken from them wrongly. Can we afford it? The Minister mentioned a figure of €1.8 billion as the cost. Let us bear in mind that approximately 30% will come straight back in tax. The Minister should factor that into his calculations and be honest about the figures. Furthermore, we know where the rest of their money would go. It would not into offshore tax havens. It would not go into the pockets of people who pretend they do not live here and act as tax refugees - some of the richest people in this country. It would be spent in the high street shops and businesses that are struggling at the moment and that have been struggling ever since we slaughtered the income of ordinary workers with devastating consequences for our economy. It would fuel economic growth and generate revenue, employment and so on. It amounts to sound economics to give these workers back what was stolen from them. I also wish to mention new entrants because of the scale of the problem. The fact that this debate took place two hours sooner than it should have has meant 40 teachers who had planned to come to the Gallery to hear the debate will now be unable to hear it. To my mind, that is rather tragic, although perhaps the Government knew that. Anyway, I will tell the Minister about two of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government did not provide a quorum. Anyway, Joanne was in the House recently and was due back today. As a result of the pay apartheid and the two-tier pay structure for new entrants, over the course of 40 years she will lose €240,000 that she would have earned otherwise. That is the price of a house. Alison, who started in 2011, was hit by the earlier FEMPI legislation and will lose €100,000 on the same basis. I was at the consultation provided by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on how there was no investment in housing. The economist explained that one of the reasons is because no one believes that people have the money or can afford to buy houses. Why can they not afford to buy houses? It is because we have taken the equivalent of the price of a house out of the pockets of these young teachers, nurses and public servants and intend to continue to do so. That is wrong and it is also fuelling the ongoing housing and accommodation crisis. The Government should give them back their money. We can afford it and it would actually be good for the economy.
