RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since the cost of living crisis erupted and ordinary people face being crucified by energy and heating price hikes and rising accommodation and rental costs, we have sought to point out that this is not some natural phenomenon but that some people are benefiting from the misery and hardship that others are suffering. Last week we pointed out the enormous jump in profits for energy companies, electricity suppliers, oil companies and so on. The latest evidence for the argument we are making, which the Government is determinedly ignoring, comes in the form of IRES REIT's accounts. It is the biggest landlord in the country, a property investment fund that saw its profits jump in 2021 by 15.8%, up to €67.5 million. Its investment properties grew by 6.7% up to €79.7 million. A figure I find really shocking is that its net rental income margin was 79%. The corporate landlords, the property investors, are absolutely creaming it on the back of the cost of living misery and absolutely obscene rents that are being charged to their tenants. We can just see it. The daft.ie figures at the beginning of this month showed rents were up by 10.3% year on year for the last quarter. It had been 7% during the pandemic, already dramatic increases, rising as soon as the pandemic ends. In some parts of rural Ireland rents are up by as much as 22%. Average rents are now €1,524 a month. In south Dublin the average is €2,258 and across Dublin city it is €2,145. This leads directly to more people facing homelessness. During the pandemic when the Government was forced, under pressure, to introduce an eviction ban and a ban on further rent increases, the number of families and individuals in homeless accommodation dropped to about 7,000. It has steadily risen since those bans were lifted and is now up to 9,000. We do not have the figures yet for the beginning of 2020 but I can tell the House they are going to go up. We will be back towards the figure of 10,000 individuals and families who are homeless. Will the Taoiseach finally do something about the profiteering and price gouging of landlords and introduce actual rent controls similar, for example, to those that have been introduced in the last two years in France, where they are now setting maximum reference rents above which landlords cannot go?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Seriously, the Taoiseach's arguments are utterly threadbare. He mentioned HAP. I just told him rents in Dublin are over €2,000. The highest HAP payment anyone can get is €1,950. Someone looking for a HAP tenancy in a housing crisis might as well just walk up to the nearest homeless hostel. That is the reality of what is going on. The biggest fantasy the Taoiseach is peddling is that the Government is delivering additional social housing in any substantial numbers. In the first three quarters of last year, actual construction of new social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies was 1,084 in the entire country. The Government is getting the rest from the same build-to-rent private developers who are creaming it and charging extortionate rents. They are not only charging extortionate rents to tenants; they are also crucifying the public coffers with the long-term leasing arrangements. The Government is not building the social housing. The Taoiseach should just walk around Dublin, around my area, and look at all the cranes and apartment blocks. I guarantee him that virtually none of them is social housing. All the construction workers that should be building affordable and public housing on public land are actually building housing to make profits for property investors. That is why we have the housing crisis and the Taoiseach will do nothing about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Walk around the city. Check how many are public housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just do not think the State should be facilitating its profiteering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Zero council houses-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to add my voice to the appeal on behalf of the Stardust families for the Taoiseach to ensure that legal changes are made so we have transparent jury selection and that it is independent of the gardaí who are a party to the case. The jurors should be remunerated for the period during the inquest because it could go on for months. For the Taoiseach not to do so at this stage would be to add to the trauma and abuse the families have suffered. The only reason we have an inquest is because these families have never given up in their quest for truth and justice about the deaths of their loved ones. I was talking to Antoinette Keegan over the weekend. I saw her speak yesterday. This is what she said. She said to do this to them after all they fought for over the past 41 years is unacceptable. The Taoiseach needs to rectify this and ensure the inquest can deliver the truth and justice these families have long deserved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Leaders' Questions earlier, I asked the Taoiseach to consider imposing rent controls as is being done in France. The problem of rising and unaffordable rents is worse in Ireland than pretty much anywhere else in Europe, but it is happening everywhere. The Taoiseach gave me what was, no doubt, his scriptwriter's pat answer to fob this off, that it did not really work in Berlin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Berlin imposed a totally pathetic form of rent control, which only controlled rents for apartments or houses built before 2014. Anything built after 2014 they can charge what they like. So what happened? Rents for apartments and houses built before 2014 were stabilised and everything else went through the roof. I asked the Taoiseach to look at what they have done in France, which is working. They did it in July 2019, in Lille and Paris, where they set rents at affordable levels. These were reference rents and you cannot put rents above these certain levels that are considered affordable. Since then, 20 other French cities have applied to the minister to impose the same form of rent controls because they are working. Why will the Taoiseach not to do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Vladimir Putin is a thug, an autocrat, a despot and a warmonger. His military aggression in Ukraine is completely unacceptable and he should get his troops out. There is no doubt about that and he should be roundly condemned. This is not new for Putin or the Russian state. It has a long history of treating its neighbouring countries as a prison house. In fact, famously, tsarist Russia was the prisonhouse of nations and denied independence and self-determination to those nations. More recently we have seen the Russians commit horrors in Afghanistan, there was a horrendous war in Chechnya and we saw the Russian-dominated version of NATO sending troops into Kazakhstan to help the Kazakhstan Government put down a workers’ revolt against rising energy prices.  All or most of the people who are condemning what Putin is now doing never condemned what he did in Chechnya and Kazakhstan. They are condemning what he is doing in Ukraine but not those things. They are selective in their standards when it comes to Russian warmongering and, indeed, as many people have pointed out, many of the nations condemning him for what he is doing now are more than willing to launder Russian oligarch money in the IFSC or in the City of London.  We are, therefore, not going to go along with the one-sided double standards that have been deployed by many of the speakers in this debate because the people of Ukraine have the right to self-determination and territorial integrity. Putin should get out. To pretend that NATO has no responsibility for this and that they are somehow the good guys in all of this situation is to be utterly dishonest. NATO has relentlessly expanded eastwards since the end of the Cold War, recruiting and moving 800 km eastwards and doing military exercises on an annual basis on the Russian border. The Defender Europe exercises, which take place every year, involved 28,000 troops last year, including naval military exercises in the Black Sea. That is also militarism. That is military provocation. These are two big military political blocs vying for spheres of influence. My very strong advice to the people of Ukraine, from a country that is militarily neutral and that established itself as a State in opposition to the disaster of the First World War and to the oppression of empires, is not to align itself with NATO because it is a warmongering military alliance that is also headed up by military thugs. Have we forgotten what the United States did in Iraq? We have the same justifications there. Saddam Hussein was a dictator, absolutely. He was a brutal murderer of his own population. He was somebody who was willing to attack neighbouring countries. All of this is true. That was used by the United States to launch a war which was a disaster with 1 million people killed. It was an utter disaster for the Middle East. Does the hypocrisy of the United States continue? It absolutely does. As we speak, it is arming the Saudi regime, a brutal dictatorship, to the teeth, as it conducts a war in Yemen where tens of thousands of people are being killed.  We raise as an alternative to the banner of warmongering, and as an alternative to siding either with the thug that is Putin or the military-aggressive alliance which is NATO, the banner of internationalism and of opposition to war. War or militarism will not solve the very dangerous conflict in Ukraine. We need to oppose war and to build a movement of international solidarity against warmongering, whether it is from the thug Putin or from the NATO-US-dominated military alliance.
