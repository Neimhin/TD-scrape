RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want it noted that it is not true that the order in front of us is exactly what was agreed at the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle agrees with me. I was going to be rapporteur this week and I decided not to do it because we agree certain things and then other things appear both for next week and for this week. If we are taking seriously working on a consensual basis at the Business Committee, then the Government should not be pulling surprises and having things appear the day after the meeting, which change all that was agreed. That suggests the Government is playing games. If we are serious about new politics, I ask that we would get agreed at the meeting of the Business Committee what will be the business for the following week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today, the Taoiseach and the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, were touting their support for the CETA agreement, an agreement that could result in thousands of job losses, fundamentally undermine workers' rights, subvert environmental protections and, crucially, undermine the sovereignty of the legal system and the Constitution in this country and countries across Europe. Bizarrely, much of the coverage of the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau focused on things like the pattern of the Taoiseach's socks and his youthfulness when this deal has hugely significant and potentially very damaging consequences for our economy and the sovereignty of our legal system. A wide range of NGOs and legal experts are saying that, effectively, this deal is illegal for European states because it will undermine their legal systems. Does the Taoiseach not think that it is wrong for us to go along with the provisional application of this corporate, globalisation-style agreement without a democratic process - a referendum - and some democratic input into whether or not we sign up to this agreement rather than just provisionally applying it, as the lingo goes, over the heads of this Parliament and the people of this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Wait until it happens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about CETA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Notwithstanding that there have been policy failures in multiple areas by this Government, the principle of Cabinet subcommittees is a good one because it allows for joined-up thinking between different Departments. I want to ask again about the need for a Cabinet subcommittee in the area of education. We did not have one in the previous Government and it is critical that we have one for multiple reasons. There are a lot of controversial issues emerging. Education, it goes without saying, is a very important area. In particular, as I have said to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Skills, there is a very serious threat to the facilities of schools throughout the country because of religious control of schools and school lands. To my mind, playing pitches and recreational areas around school are not an optional extra. They are critical for all sorts of health reasons and to allow for the expansion of schools, and yet we have discovered in many schools, such as Clonkeen College in my own area, religious orders are flogging off their lands at the expense of the quality of the education and amenities provided to school students. The Government is letting it happen. There needs to be a serious policy discussion at a high level within the Government about the threat this represents to school facilities. I have said I believe that compulsory purchase powers have to be used to prevent the religious orders, which are accountable to nobody, flogging off playing fields and recreational areas for schools all over the country. I would ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider that instead of merely saying it is nothing to do with the Government, the religious orders are private entities and the Government does not have any control. This is what we are getting and it is a threat to the quality of the education that is available to our young people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are on Cabinet committees.
