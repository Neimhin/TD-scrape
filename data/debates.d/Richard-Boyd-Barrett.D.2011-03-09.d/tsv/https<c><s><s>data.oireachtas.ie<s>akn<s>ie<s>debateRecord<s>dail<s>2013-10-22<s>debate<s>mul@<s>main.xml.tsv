RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	 Unlike the wealthy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach not believe that he should give a straight apology for-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the suggestion that he made at the weekend that there was something called a welfare dependency culture? He has just made the same implication about people languishing on the dole as if there is some voluntary element to it and that forcing them into what he laughingly calls labour activation measures by cutting social welfare payments for 22, 23, 24 and 25 year olds is actually the way to get people back into work. The implication is that these young people - or anyone on the live register - are on it through their own fault. The Taoiseach should admit that a welfare dependency culture is not the problem. Unless, that is, we are referring to the welfare dependency of bankers and the super wealthy. They have a serious dependency. They know that they can wreck an economy and rip people off royally for years and years, yet the Government will come along and bail them out at every turn. How does that stimulate the economy, enterprise and creativity? Some of the people in question are still in the most senior positions in the Irish banks despite having promoted madcap development plans and bankrupting the country in the process. They are still running our banks. That is a dependency culture that we want to root out. We must take serious action to deal with it. It is clear that the overwhelming majority of people are forced - let me emphasise that word - to sign on because there are no jobs. Why does the Taoiseach not admit-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that fact? Some 40,000 people are leaving the country every year because there are no jobs, not because they are lazy. Is the Taoiseach not ashamed to be in a Government that oversees 40,000 of our best and brightest people leaving per year? Does it not have an obligation to make the investment that would create real jobs, not pretend jobs or a massaging of the figures? Department of Finance officials last week told the finance committee of an interesting anomaly in the public finances. There used to be something called jobless growth. We now have growthless jobs, that is, virtually no growth while the Government claims a decrease in unemployment and a great deal of job creation. The officials could not quite explain this anomaly. Has the Taoiseach examined it? The only explanation is mass emigration and the Government's massaging of the unemployment figures by putting people into schemes. This is the reality - not jobs, but schemes with no real jobs at the end in most cases. Why does the Taoiseach not admit the truth about the scale of emigration and unemployment? Let us deal with these issues in a real way for those who are languishing in that position involuntarily. They do not want to be there or to be demonised or stigmatised by the Taoiseach or anyone else. What they need are real jobs, not pretend jobs, scam jobs or Gateway jobs, in which people will do the work of local council workers for â‚¬20 on top of their dole, thereby replacing full-time and properly paid jobs. It is a disgrace.
