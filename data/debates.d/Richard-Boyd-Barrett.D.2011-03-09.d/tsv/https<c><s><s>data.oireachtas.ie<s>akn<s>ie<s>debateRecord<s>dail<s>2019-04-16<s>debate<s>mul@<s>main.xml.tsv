RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following the publication of the Social Justice Ireland report yesterday, do the Taoiseach and the Government feel ashamed that 760,000 of our citizens are living in poverty and approximately 250,000 of them are children? This is in one of the richest countries in the world and, as the Taoiseach keeps reminding us, a country that has nearly full employment. A huge cohort of those living with their children in poverty are working. They are the working poor. This is utterly shameful. There are many contributory factors to this obscene level of poverty, including low pay, precarious work and the extortionate cost of childcare. There is no doubt that probably the major contributory factor at the moment is the obscene and unaffordable cost of housing and rent. Average housing costs nine times the average income. Rents in Dublin for a three-bedroom home average an astonishing €3,400 per month. I will give the Taoiseach two instances of where the failure of his housing policies is directly contributing to driving people into poverty. Many working people whose incomes are slightly over the income threshold for social housing have been completely abandoned by the Government in terms of housing support. A recent report showed 20% of households pay more than 40% of their income on rent and 10% pay an incredible 60% of their income on rent. Most of them get no support from the Government. The Government will not raise the social housing income thresholds to give these people social housing support and it provides no affordable housing. There is another cohort, namely, housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants. I was shocked to discover in a response to a question to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council this week that 70% of HAP tenants in its area make top-up payments over and above their normal council rent contribution.Threshold has said that some 50% of HAP tenants are paying top-ups over and above their normal rent contribution, which is driving them directly into poverty. To give an example, Elaine, who has four children and an income of €1,400 per month, is paying €350 per month on top of her council rent of €182 per month. This leaves her with €900 per month for herself and her four children. There are many more examples. Does the Taoiseach accept that the failure of the Government's housing policies is directly driving families, in particular children, into poverty and deprivation? Will he commit to abandoning the failed HAP policy and guarantee in the meantime that no HAP tenants will be forced to make top-up payments that drive them into poverty? Will he raise the income thresholds for social housing supports? Will he also tell the House where the affordable housing is to be found because there is none?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When I need the Taoiseach's help in formulating questions I will ask him for it. I will cite the recent Social Justice Ireland report on these so-called incorrect facts. It states that approximately 230,000 children in Ireland are living in poverty today. That is one in five children under the age of 18.The group the Taoiseach refers to is the 110,000 people who are living in consistent poverty. There are 230,000, or a shameful one in five, children living in poverty. It is clear the Government does not feel the shame, but it should. Followed by children under 18, who form the biggest cohort of those living in poverty, the second biggest cohort, at 14%, is people who are working, also shameful. The working poor are the people who get up at 7 a.m., earn a pittance and cannot afford the cost of putting a roof over their heads. I asked the Taoiseach two specific questions. First, will the Government raise the income thresholds so that these working people can access social housing support?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said it is under review. It has been under review for a year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the Government raise the thresholds instead of, as is currently the case, culling people from the housing lists and abandoning tens of thousands of others and failing to give them housing support?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Second, will the Taoiseach commit to end the practice of people on HAP tenancies being forced to pay top-ups, because if they pay those top-ups, by definition, they are their children are driven into poverty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That seriously is splitting hairs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who is sitting alongside the Taoiseach, has made several very welcome commitments to deal with the issues of bogus self-employment and the failure of employers to vindicate employment rights. Approximately five minutes' walk from Leinster House, there is a public contract job to refurbish the Irish Stock Exchange building. The main contractor is Duggan Brothers. If an official of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection were to go to the site and meet the workers, he or she would discover that 11 workers have been sacked without notice - which is against the law - and are at the loss of several weeks' pay because a subcontractor upped and left and the main contractor is refusing to take any responsibility for this omission. This is occurring under a public contract worth approximately €10 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public works contract for building workers specifically states that the main contractor is responsible for ensuring the rights of all employees. I would appreciate if a representative of the Department could go to speak to the workers and tell the contractors that they cannot throw 11 building workers out on the street without pay. The workers are owed money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have finished. It is very important to vindicate the rights of workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The list of threats that Donald Trump poses to the world is too long to go through, but I will ask about two. Trump's sabotage of the Paris climate change agreement is an open declaration that he does not care about the existential threat to humanity and life on the planet that is facing our children and grandchildren. In the aftermath of the school students' climate change strike and their call for radical and urgent action to save their future, did the Taoiseach raise this issue? More importantly, does he believe it to be appropriate in that context to invite a climate saboteur like Donald Trump to this country? Will the latter not inevitably be met with fury from those young people and many more who are concerned about the climate? I also wish to mention the issue of Palestine. Donald Trump has endorsed and legitimised the effective illegal annexation of East Jerusalem by moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, which is a breach of international law, the annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights, and the ongoing administrative detention and subjection to military law of hundreds of children, which I discussed last week. Does the Taoiseach really believe that someone who poses this kind of threat to peace in the Middle East and the wider world should be welcomed to this country by him?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He will be waiting a long time for that with Jared Kushner.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a simple question. Does the Taoiseach think it immoral that somebody who receives the devastating diagnosis of cancer but who happens to be a public patient who does not have or cannot afford extortionate levels of private health insurance, may have a less chance of surviving cancer because he or she may not be prescribed drugs that others who have private health insurance would get to improve their life chances? That is immoral. A two-tier health system is outrageous but two-tier cancer treatment is obscene. What will the Taoiseach do about it? It is just not acceptable. Professor John Crown expressed his disgust at how he will have to provide different levels of treatment, which will have consequences for people's chances of life and survival. It is shocking. Does the Taoiseach accept that it is immoral and share the sense of shock?What will he do about it to ensure that people who receive a diagnosis of cancer have an equal chance of survival and equal treatment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer my question, which was simple and specific. Does he believe it is immoral that a person who receives a cancer diagnosis would get a different level of treatment and access to potentially life-saving drugs depending on whether or not he or she can afford particular private health insurance plans? I believe this is medical apartheid. It is as simple as that. Whatever about the general debate around a two-tier health system, which is unacceptable, does the Taoiseach believe it is acceptable in cancer care? If he does not, does he think it is immoral? If so, what is he going to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are clinically approved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today, the Taoiseach stated he did not know how much the biggest infrastructural project to be undertaken in the State in a very long time, which the Government committed to deliver, will cost. It is €3 billion and rising but he is not actually sure how much it will cost. We do not know when the plan will be decided, how it will be delivered or by whom it will be delivered. It is an absolute mess. I wonder whether lessons are being learned by the Government in all of this when we take into account the children's hospital fiasco. The lesson that needs to be learned is this. Once upon a time in this State if we needed public transport - trains and buses to go to every single part of the country - we had a State company to deliver it. If we needed telecommunications, we had a State company that delivered telecommunications. If we needed electrification throughout the country, we had a State company that delivered electrification. If we needed a postal service to get post to every village, town and house, we had a State company to deliver it. What we have done is dismantle those State companies bit by bit and allowed vultures, domestic and international, to asset strip those companies to the point that we cannot deliver anything. We are then dependent on vultures coming in, putting us over a barrel and dictating to us how much it will cost. They do not want to do it. They drop out if they cannot make a profit so we are left with one bidder and then that one bidder, a US investment fund, has us over a barrel. We have to go to dinner with them to see what we can possibly negotiate to deliver a plan that is of critical State importance. It is pathetic. Could we get the ESB to do it, please?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is unacceptable that a US investment fund should have the State over a barrel because of the fiasco of the process. We should draw a line under it, learn the lessons and start talking to the ESB or renationalise what is left of Eircom.The idea that a US investment fund would charge €3 billion and then own the network is just beyond appalling. This is an absolutely predictable market failure on a massive level. I agree, and we have said much the same as Fianna Fáil, about the need to use our semi-State bodies. I hope that Fianna Fáil will be humble enough to say that it made a mistake when it privatised Eircom. Let us admit that it was a mistake and recognise that "commercial operators will only invest so far", to quote the Minister of State. That is the key to understanding this fiasco. Unless we learn this lesson, we are doomed to repeat it over and over again. Let us get the State and its agencies and companies to deliver this essential infrastructure for rural Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept that.
