RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry, in accordance with the questions-and-answers format agreed by the Business Committee. Today, People Before Profit and Solidarity Deputies launched an online petition calling on the Government to abandon plans to cut or taper the €350 pandemic unemployment payment, at least until the pandemic has passed and all the employment losses and economic impacts of the pandemic have been overcome. We also call in our petition for the payment to be extended to groups that have been unfairly excluded, most notably those over 66, those under 18 and those in the gig economy and precarious work. Furthermore, we call for a review because we believe the figure of €350, to which the Government was forced to increase the payment, was an admission that it really is impossible for people to live any kind of dignified existence on a payment below that amount. As Social Justice Ireland have pointed out, a great number of pensioners, jobseekers and people on disability are effectively living on poverty payments. I am looking for that commitment, particularly in response to the clear hints that have been coming from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Regina Doherty, about cuts or a tapering of the Covid payment. Would it not be completely unjust to cut further the income of workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own before this pandemic and the full economic impact of job losses are overcome? Will the Taoiseach agree that there will be no cuts or no tapering until we have overcome this pandemic?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has not given a clear commitment that there will be no cuts or tapering until the pandemic is over and until all the employment lost as a result of the pandemic has been restored. The Taoiseach should give a commitment, and I am asking for a commitment, that the over 66s and the under 18s who are being unfairly discriminated against get the payment also, and that many workers in the gig economy who did not happen to be working at the time but might have been working a week or two later would also get the payment. Will the Taoiseach also give some sort of serious response to the plight of the Debenhams workers and other workers who could face cynical exploitation by their employers, who might try to throw them on the scrapheap using the Covid-19 emergency as a cover, and intervene and protect their jobs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was over time. That is why I was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why the Taoiseach should give the commitment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Trump-like buffoonery and recklessness of Boris Johnson have been fairly evident to most people in this House and country for some time. If there is something of a silver lining to the grim public health emergency and pandemic that we face, it is that the buffoonery and recklessness on Johnson's part has been further revealed. For most people, Brexit and everything else are being seen largely through the prism of this unprecedented Covid-19 emergency. The buffoonery and recklessness on his part have undoubtedly contributed to a worse situation developing, tragically, for many British people through his slowness and reluctance to impose public health measures and his dismissal in the initial stages of the seriousness of the pandemic. I hope that both in Britain and in the United States the sort of recklessness and buffoonery that Trump and Johnson represent has been exposed in the eyes of more and more people. I hope and believe that is also true in the North and elsewhere. Given the sort of recklessness they have displayed, which is continuing with Johnson essentially raising the spectre of a crash-out Brexit with the disastrous consequences that would have, North and South on this island, it seems to me that we must use this opportunity to show ourselves to be so much better than the recklessness and buffoonery that Johnson's politics represent. If the possibility of a crash-out Brexit emerges because of his attitudes and policies and his plans for a race to the bottom, we must make the case to people in the North in particular for a break and move towards a united Ireland. The case, for example, for an all-Ireland response to Covid-19 is very apparent to people North and South. That is something that has been resisted by Johnson and some in the Northern political system. It is very apparent to large numbers of people North and South, regardless of their community background, that it makes sense to have an all-Ireland response to a public health emergency, but it also makes sense to have an all-Ireland response to the threat of a no-deal Brexit. If we are to make that case and talk about the possibility of uniting the North and South of this island, we must show ourselves to be better than Boris Johnson in every single regard. Notwithstanding differences of opinion and emphasis, there is no doubt that the response by this State to the public health emergency has been better than that of Boris Johnson, but we must continue to be better in everything. It is blatantly obvious that if we are going to make the case to people in the North that we should unite this island, we must at a minimum have an all-Ireland national health service which is properly resourced, with the necessary capacity, where we treat our health workers properly and well. People in the North will not be attracted to a united Ireland if it involves a two-tier under-resourced, under-capacity health service. One thing that we could and should do now is indicate our determination to move immediately to a proper national health service, something that has become apparent in the response to Covid-19. A united Ireland where the State runs a proper national health service on all parts of this island is something that could win over people in the North who might retain allegiance to the UK.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There have been some positive measures taken in the face of the health emergency, such as freezing rent increases and stopping evictions, something the Minister previously said could not be done, and some decongregation of emergency hubs and allocations. Why could it not have been done before if it can be done now? Is it going to be permanent for those people? Will people who have been given welcome own-door accommodation stay in that once the pandemic is over? I really thought about this today when I saw a really obnoxious video about the tale of two Covids in this country when it comes to housing, a video of Johnny Ronan, a Celtic tiger property developer who got all his NAMA land back from us and whose name is plastered over development sites all over this city who is making an absolute fortune-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----while people are suffering from homelessness and mocking people with Covid and making light of the work of our nurses. He is enjoying himself in South Africa while I have to deal with people like Brian who is 70 and is living in a shed. He should be cocooning but the only accommodation he is offered is a hostel in town, when he is living in Dún Laoghaire. There is Anthony, who is living in a tent in Stillorgan because he does not meet the criteria to get his own-door accommodation. I met another woman whose partner did get own-door accommodation in Temple Bar and is delighted with it, but she did not meet the criteria and is in shared accommodation in a hostel with four other people she does not know, which is contrary to the advice of the Chief Medical Officer. That is the contrast for me, a Cheann Comhairle, that is highlighted vividly in this crisis. There are people in South Africa who are making money from the housing crisis and mocking the pandemic, and then there are the people at the sharp end of all of this. I just want to know that the policies are now going to change, that this has changed the Minister's attitude towards housing provision. It should not be about people like these Celtic tiger developers and speculators. There should be permanent measures to eliminate the housing crisis and things like co-living.Imagine if some of those co-living developments were in place now, built by some of those same Celtic tiger developers. Are they going to stop? Just stop building them because they are unsafe and only built for profit. Are we going to build housing for the people who really need it at affordable prices? That is what I want to know.
