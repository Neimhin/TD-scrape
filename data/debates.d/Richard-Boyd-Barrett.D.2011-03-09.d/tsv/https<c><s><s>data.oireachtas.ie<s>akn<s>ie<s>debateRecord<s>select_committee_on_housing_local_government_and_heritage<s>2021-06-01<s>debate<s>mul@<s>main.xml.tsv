RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My thanks to the Minister for acknowledging the point about undue segregation. There should be no segregation whatsoever. My point is not simply about the wording, although I acknowledge the Minister is willing to look at that. The issue is also that we have de facto segregation by virtue of the fact that the income thresholds for social housing have not increased for more than ten years. Bit by bit, the people who qualify for social housing are people on ever lower incomes. These are working people - the bus driver, the nurse, the bank clerk and so on - whose incomes used to qualify them for social housing but no longer do. They will continue to be moved into a different category unless we significantly increase the income thresholds. I do not know how many times I raised this with Eoghan Murphy in the last Government. We were told of a mythical review of the income thresholds. Every few months we would be told it was coming but it never came. To me that was a deliberate policy to cull numbers on the social housing lists. People were literally thrown off the lists. Whenever a person got the slightest pay increase, he or she was thrown off the list. This was a source of great distress for people who had been on those lists often for ten or 15 years. All that time waiting was simply gone. They have been in limbo since then because there was no affordable scheme in reality and no cost rental scheme in reality. My point is we are now saying that we need a different category for that group of people. We end up with de facto segregation. I believe that is why the drafters of the Bill referred to the word "undue". They knew in fact there will be segregation in the way we are doing things. We are going to have different categories of affordable or social housing delivered to different people based on certain thresholds. I believe we should be looking for ways to genuinely get rid of that segregation by saying that social housing and affordable housing should be available for everyone. I wish to make one last point. We see this in reality and it is not unfair to call it housing apartheid. I know of developments in my area where the 10% social housing is all segregated into one block of a development. Even different finishings and different quality building materials are used for the social housing parts, which is disgraceful. In the same development a building that may look externally the same has different finishings internally and different features because it is social housing. It is as if they are doing it on the cheap. In most cases such dwellings are segregated from the private ones. It makes something of a lie of the notion of the somewhat patronising term "social mix". If that is what we actually want, if we want a mix of people with different incomes and backgrounds, then it really should be a mix. It should not be segregated into one block.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I will be pursuing it on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 14:In page 8, line 19, after “public” to insert “and relevant private”.All of these amendments are related in their logic. They propose that references to the Land Development Agency having powers in respect of public lands be extended to include private lands. I made many points earlier on about what a land development agency should be. It should not be a body that essentially opens the door and gives access to the public land bank to private capital. Rather, it should go in exactly the opposite direction. It should be a body that takes over the building land bank currently controlled by private speculators and developers in order to use it to deliver housing to meet housing needs, particularly the need for social and affordable housing. What I would like to see, and what these amendments aim to bring about, is an agency that essentially does what the Kenny report talked about. It should, in an aggressive way, take control of the bank of land for building that is currently largely privately held in order to deal with outrageous site costs and the hoarding of land and empty properties. This would be an agency which takes over land and property so that it cannot be hoarded or used for speculation and which would force that land and property into use with the social objective of delivering the housing that people need. The logic behind all of these various amendments is to include that emphasis on going in and taking control of the land bank that is currently privately held.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made the point, so I will not labour it. It just shows a fundamental difference in approach. There is a lot of unutilised public land but, in my opinion and that of many members of the committee, that land is underutilised because central government has refused to give local authorities the money, resources and so on to develop public land. Rather than seeing the problem being addressed by allowing private finance in on public land, the problem would be addressed by the Government giving the resources and money to local authorities to build public and affordable housing on public land. I take the point about semi-State land and so on and that it is something the agency could usefully do but, again, I think it should be transferred to local authorities. The big gap and problem is that property developers and land speculators and so on control too much of the land bank. They manipulate the market and land prices and so on and they drip-feed housing according to what makes the most money for them. They are fundamentally not interested in solving the housing crisis and, for the most part, they actually benefit from the housing crisis and from keeping suitable building land as a scarce resource that they control. That is what needs to be addressed and what this agency should be doing, but it is obvious that is not what the Government wants to do because it is dancing very significantly to the tune of the speculators and big property developers. We know the arguments and it is a fundamental difference of opinion.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My understanding is that you are allowed to do that, Darragh - or Minister, should I say - and that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is part of a series of amendments explained by Deputies Cian O'Callaghan and Ó Broin which seek to exclude what the Bill seeks to include, which is essentially to bring in private investors to develop the public land bank. This is a point I have made to the Minister before, and Deputy O'Callaghan has just made it too. I would love to hear the Minister's response on this. To me, it is not even an ideological comment; it is just a basic statement of fact about a private business. The private developer has no interest, objectively speaking, in solving the housing crisis - none. That is not what it is in business for. That is what the Government is in business for. That is what the local authorities are in business for. That is what not-for-profit housing associations and co-operatives are for. Private investors have one sole purpose and that is to make money. They do not do anything that does not make them a profit. If it is not profitable for them to increase supply, on either public land or private land, they just will not do it. If you needed a lesson in this, you could not get a bigger one than the 2008 crash. At the point at which the cannot make money, private investors are quite capable of crashing an entire economy because they have no interest in building. The idea, therefore, that these people who are interested only in money would not only control the private land bank but also then have significant influence over whether public land gets developed for the public and affordable housing we need is, to my mind, tantamount to madness. I would honestly like to hear the Minister's response. Does he not remember how the public private partnerships, PPPs, that had been set up with certain developers in this country collapsed because the private developers just decided, "This is no longer a good deal for me so I am just not doing it". Plans to develop part of the north inner city just collapsed because the private developers had no interest. This Bill gives the public land bank over as a sort of hostage to private investors and private developers, who, let us be clear, and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has alluded to this point, have no interest in the price of housing or rents dramatically decreasing. We do. Renters do. Ordinary workers looking to buy have a big interest in having rents or house prices they can afford. Private investors have no interest in that. The last thing they want is for rents or house prices to drop dramatically. It is madness. Finally, as soon as these PPPs, for want of another term - that is what they are - come into play in one form or another, then accountability and all sorts of secret commercial sensitivity issues come into play such that it is impossible to get to the bottom even of how things are financed and so on. Rather than all that, we are trying to say that while these private interests borrow money, the State can borrow money too. It can tax in order to increase the revenue, but it is more effective and less hostage to market forces for the State to do this itself and, of course, in the long run it will save the State money because we will not be leasing property off these guys further down the line.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 47:In page 9, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:" "affordable housing" means housing that is sold or let by a local authority/Approved Housing Bodies, and can only be sold back to the local authority;".We want affordable housing to stay affordable in perpetuity. In other words, we are in favour of affordably purchasable housing on public land as long as it always remains affordable and is never marketised. Therefore, we are including a provision which would mean that if affordable housing is sold on by somebody who was eligible to purchase it in the first instance, he or she would have to sell it back to the local authority and would not profit from it. In this way, the property would not become marketised or commodified. We fully agree with people's aspiration and desire to have security regarding their home. Given the associated security, it is entirely legitimate that people would decide at some point to move from renting a home to owning their own home. The State should provide a stock of affordable housing but we do not believe that this housing should later become marketised. The amendment is a very simple measure stipulating that if an affordable property is sold on at any point, it should be sold back to the local authority. While reasonable inflation might be taken into account, nobody would make a profit from it. It would not be difficult to come up with a formula to achieve that. Amendment No. 219 implies that we need to define "affordability" having regard to people's income. We are saying the amount should be 25% of somebody's income. That is a reasonable amount that people would have to expend on either affordable rental or affordable purchase. It should not be more than that. The Government and others may argue that the proportion should be increased to one third but people are in some cases spending 50%, 60% or 70% of their after-tax income on rent or a mortgage. Even with the affordability caps the Government is talking about, it is almost Orwellian to suggest one could still define as affordable a home whose worth is as much as €450,000, or €400,000 in other areas. It is quite bizarre. Setting that point aside, we want a reasonable proportion of people's income to dictate the definition of "affordability" with regard to State-provided affordable housing. Those are the arguments in favour of our two amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had my hand up to speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not really explained his resistance to what I am trying to do in my amendment No. 47, which is to ensure that affordable housing funded through the LDA and through direct State investment would stay permanently affordable. Why on earth would the Minister not want to support that? I accept Deputy Ó Broin's addition. My amendment proposes that, if sold, it could only be sold back to the local authority. I accept we could amend that if the principle was established that it could be traded with other people, but as affordable housing. There would then be a stock of housing that remains permanently affordable. The Minister has not given an answer as to why he has a difficulty with that. If he does not do that, then after the first generation of purchasers of affordable housing, the housing on public land will have been turned into unaffordable housing. As soon as market prices kick in after the first purchase, those houses will revert in my area to €450,00 or €500,000, having been built at the affordable level. There is no way to describe the consequence of not accepting this amendment other than marketising public land. Ultimately, we are fuelling the conditions that have given rise to this crisis. The Minister keeps making references to the Affordable Housing Bill but, as we will discuss in the following grouping, the Bill is littered with references to the market being taken into account and being the reference point for the setting of affordability, rather than being based on people's income. Neither did the Minister come back on the point I made and Deputy Duncan Smith echoed. Why has the Government not raised the income threshold for more than a decade? Most of the responsibility for that lies with Fine Gael but the Minister is conspicuous in his refusal to answer that question. I think the secret answer that the Minister will not give is that, slowly but surely, the agenda driven by somebody - I am not sure who but I suspect elements in the permanent government - is to turn social housing into housing that will effectively only be available to people on social welfare. That is why we have not moved the thresholds upwards so, year on year, working people who used to be able to apply for social housing for no longer able to do so. Slowly but surely, working people are being excluded from eligibility for social housing. One has to be on the lowest of incomes, barely above social welfare rates currently, to qualify. If the Minister wants to do something about avoiding segregation in housing, he should address that problem. The way to segregate housing is to make only people on the lowest incomes eligible. Here is a radical idea: why could anybody at all not be allowed to apply for social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking to the group and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate if the Chair would extend the right to the tabler of the amendment that he did to others to speak twice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not answer the point put to him, which is why I am looking for an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I consider this one of the most important amendments we have put forward. For anybody who can go through the tedium of watching 225 amendments, or whatever the number is, being dealt with by an Oireachtas committee, I recommend they look at page 48 of the Bill as initiated. Under section 76, Price under agreement, the Bill sets out two provisions that show the fundamental flaws in the Government's approach in trying to address the housing crisis through the use of the public land bank. It links the price it will charge for either affordable purchase housing or for rental property that will be built on public lands to the local market specifically. Section 76(2) states: "the Minister may prescribe the price, or a method of calculating the price...and may prescribe different prices and different methods in respect of agreements relating to different geographical or administrative areas". Section 76(3) states:For the purposes of prescribing a price or a method of calculating the price in relation to an area...the Minister shall have regard to the likely future demand for cost rental dwellings and dwellings for sale in the State...(a) the prevailing market price and market rent;Why would one have that in the Bill? If the Bill's purpose is to provide housing to people who are currently priced out of the market, either the affordable purchase market or the rental market, why on earth would one link the price that the Minister could set to local market conditions? It totally defeats the purpose. It guarantees that, in the areas which are at the epicentre of the housing crisis, the very reasons for the crisis will be woven into the structure of the Land Development Agency instead of undermining the dysfunctionality of the market. It is not setting prices according to the actual affordability criteria for those income groups, now the majority of working people, who are excluded by market prices or market rents. Why are these sections in the Bill? They are there because the private developers and so on who have lobbied the Government around all these matters would be horrified at the idea that, in an area where they are selling property from €450,000 to €550,000, or renting property out at between €2,500 or €3,000 a month, the State might, on any sort of substantial scale, build properties that cost €200,000 or could be rented for €800 or €1,000. These measures have been inserted essentially in order to protect the property developers. There is no rationale behind these measures. If the Land Development Agency was actually to develop public and affordable housing on public land, one would have no references to the market or different prices being set dependent on the area in which they were located.If the Minister can prove I am wrong on this, I would be happy to listen to his argument, but I doubt he can do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There seems to be something of an admission on the part of the Minister the section my amendment is trying to delete needs to be deleted. That is a good start. However, he cannot tell us what it will be replaced with, only that it will be broadly aligned with the Affordable Housing Bill. I would like the Minister to tell us as much as he can about that because it is not satisfactory we are now on Committee Stage of this Bill and we do not know what the Government will do on Report Stage. We have not seen the Report Stage amendments the Government will make on this critical point of whether the LDA is capable of delivering affordable housing on public land. The Government appears to be acknowledging the point of my amendment, which is to say there should not be any relationship between how you price affordablility and local market conditions. Is the Minister accepting this is correct, that local market conditions should not be criteria for setting the price of affordable housing or affordable rental? That would be an important step forward by the Government. I am happy to admit when the Government puts its hands up and says it was wrong and will change things. Is the Minister saying we are right that the benchmark against prices and rents at the local market level is not an acceptable way of defining affordability? If that is in any way a criterion, I put it to the Minister that he essentially will have undermined the attempt to deal with the housing crisis and the affordability crisis in the areas where these crises are most acute and where the response is most badly needed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 49:In page 10, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:“ “public housing” means housing that is owned and operated by Local Authorities and/or Approved Housing Bodies; and is let in line with the differential rent scheme and each local authority’s Allocation Scheme;”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 50:In page 10, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:“ “relevant private land” means land that is owned privately but has lain unused for more than three years, or has building(s) that are unused for more than three years on it;”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We nearly had one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The last point there was the one I wanted to make. I will underline it. Even if subsidiary DACs are subject to freedom of information law, the commercial sensitivity issues kick in as soon as we involve private commercial interests. In negotiations between State bodies and local authorities and publicly owned agencies or entities and any form of private commercial interest, those commercial sensitivity issues come in to play. As a result, we do not actually get to see the financial detail. I have been through this saga. I will cite as an instance in this regard the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. We successfully campaigned to get the company dissolved and reintegrated into the council. For the years it was in operation, however, we could not find out anything about what it was doing. Notionally, permission had to be sought from the Minister for Transport but in actuality the board of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company decided everything and got everything rubber-stamped from the relevant Ministers. The truth is that the local councillors or Deputies could not get any information. Commercial sensitivity was wheeled out for everything. We were told we could not be given certain information because it was commercially sensitive. That is what will happen here. It is one of the key flaws and follies of the whole enterprise as conceived by the Government. Once we bring in arrangements with private business through these DAC structures, commercial sensitivity issues will kick in. The Minister may claim some credit on amendment No. 184 for requiring ministerial approval for the disposal of land by the DACs but it does not take away from the fact that the cardinal problem is that the DACs will be able to dispose of public land. There are some safeguards but to my mind the safeguards against that are not adequate to protect against the slippery slope or the fact that in reality the driver will be the LDA and not the Minister. Councillors will be last to know. It will be the LDA driving things and getting them rubber-stamped by Ministers. That is my experience of these bodies. To be honest, I do not believe that as time goes on anything will be different with the LDA and these DACs.
