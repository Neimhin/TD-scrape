RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do visit such punishment on everybody else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I might as well comment at this stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am still trying to figure out which amendments we are discussing.  Are we discussing what has been tabled by Deputies McDonald and Donnelly listed on page 5?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I slightly disagree with Deputy McDonald on this point.  For whatever reason, perhaps after attempts to remove their automatic entitlement to medical cards or, as may possibly happen soon, to remove certain benefits that pensioners receive, these pensioners might decide they want somebody aged 75 or 80 to represent them and they would be quite entitled to do so, or to elect such a person as President.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a different category and we must accept it.  I am coming at this from a somewhat different angle.  This is part of facilitating the upward push with regard to the retirement age and I find it all regressive.  As a society we have been fighting to relieve people of the burden of toil-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not catch with the Minister said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a society we have been fighting to relieve people of the burden of toil imposed on the vast majority of people.  It was generally held that the progressive move was for people to be able to retire earlier not later.  I still hold to this traditional left-wing socialist view that we should allow people to retire earlier and enjoy their old age.  It always sticks out in my mind that when I studied geography in the early 1980s it was in all of the curriculum books and it was standard for the teachers to tell us the big problem we would have in the 21st century was people would have so much leisure time.  At the time it was thought the advance of technology and the reduction in the burden of work would mean people would be able to retire earlier and would have a huge amount of leisure time, and because more wealth would be generated we would have the resources for people to enjoy the latter part of their lives. This was a logical argument but now we are moving in the opposite direction and it is regressive.  The attempt to spin it by talking about giving people the option to work a bit longer if they like is nonsense.  It is justification for a regressive cut.As well as those under pressure to work longer when they should be retiring and enjoying their old age, the other big losers are young people looking to come into the jobs.  The longer people work the longer younger people are crowded out from jobs in the public service.  At a time when we have so many unemployed young people the idea we would in any way encourage or facilitate people to work longer in the public service makes no sense at all.  I reject the entire logic behind increasing the retirement age and facilitating people to work longer.  The retirement age should be 65 years or lower.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Deputy Donnelly have to be present for the whole debate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister not think there is a problem in terms of young people seeking these jobs?  That is the other side of this equation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know this will go through but this is a rationalisation for another imperative.  We are providing interesting arguments to justify what is another imperative of the so-called pensions bomb.  There is pressure from the troika, including the EU authorities, to reduce the cost of retirement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All this other stuff is gloss on that fact.  There is another way to address the issue about which the Minister is speaking, which concerns older people wanting to contribute to society and not becoming depressed because they reach retirement age.  The first action would be not to cut pensions, which we are doing, as those people will have fewer resources after they retire to do what they want.  The impact of cutting people's pension entitlements, which this legislation also does, means people will be under a certain financial pressure to keep working on a full salary instead of retiring when they may want to.  Similarly, if we provided greater resources for community, voluntary and local services so people had other avenues to engage in meaningful activity after their retirement, the prospect of retirement might not be so bleak.  It seems this is just pressuring people to work longer to save money, which is why I oppose it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise a point of clarification.  Let us take the case of a former Member, who was in the old pension scheme but lost his seat during the last election.  Were he to be re-elected in the next general election, would he plug into the old scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That seems very unfair.  Did I not see another provision in the Bill for former public servants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Staff have built up an entitlement under the old pension scheme but should they rejoin, having left the public service even for a period of six months after the enactment of this Bill, their subsequent service will be in the public service pensions single scheme.  However, they will retain an entitlement to the benefits in the old scheme built up during their period of service under that scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, the person continues to be a member of the old scheme, if he or she severs employment but rejoins the public service within six months, but if they are out for a period greater than six months, his or her entitlement is based on the portion of their service under the old scheme and then their remaining service is reckonable under the new scheme.  Why does the Minister not apply the same provision to elected Members?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not really understand it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Politicians' pay and expenses are a different issue.  That is not the point we raise.  For the record, it is not about flogging politicians or saying they should not be paid anything but it is a legitimate opinion that we believe the salaries of Deputies, ministerial salaries and the salary of the Taoiseach are too high by comparison with European levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know, but I am just responding to the Minister's point.  I accept it is not the point we are dealing with in this case.  It is nothing to do with flogging politicians; it is trying to understand what seems to me a big inconsistency, namely, why politicians that happen to be elected and have certain pension entitlements prior to the date that the new scheme is introduced carry those benefits or privileges forward after the scheme is introduced where everyone coming in after them - politicians or public servants of any kind - are going to have a less favourable pension?  Why would it not be the case that they would retain whatever entitlements they built up previously when the old scheme applied, but as of the introduction of the legislation, they would be subject to the new scheme and that would put them in the same boat as everyone else?  I do not see why at what some level is an arbitrary date for the introduction of the scheme that everybody who is an elected Deputy before that point will be exempt from a disimproved scheme in the future.  Surely they should be subject to the same pension regime as anyone else.  It seems to be protecting the old guard and having a two-tier scheme as long as the old guard continues to be in political office.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I do not propose to discuss the section at length, I oppose it because it facilitates the entire Bill.  By creating a distinction between those who are subject to the new scheme and those who are subject to the old scheme, the section facilitates the new scheme, to which I am opposed.  It creates a distinction between those to whom the new scheme will apply and those to whom it will not apply because they were working in the public service previously.  The United Left Alliance opposes the new scheme because it disimproves the pension entitlements of ordinary low and middle income public servants.  I oppose the making of this distinction because it facilitates an overall attack on public service pensions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am consistent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does this change the way in which allowances are treated in the scheme in this Bill when compared with the way they were treated before?  That is what I would like to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That decision will be taken later.  It is not taken as a result of this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For clarification, in the legislation that governed the previous scheme, did the Minister designate pensionable allowances?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So how was that governed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I am trying to figure out is whether there is anything new in this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it new that the Minister will have the ability to designate in this way?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is along the same lines.  We can only understand whether this represents a significant concentration of power in the Minister's hands if we compare it to how this matter was dealt with in previous legislation.  Then we can know whether this is a change.  How was the subject of allowances and whether they were pensionable dealt with in previous legislation, and what were the powers of the Minister in that regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could be controversial, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister say that again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The more I listen to the debate, the less I am convinced.  I am afraid I disagree with Deputy Mathews on this, as much as I agree with him a lot of the time.  For example, the section states that the allowance should be permanent in nature, but without having a list of the actual allowances, we do not really know whether that is a good distinction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The legislation states that for an allowance to be pensionable, it must be permanent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but without having a full list of the allowances-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister does not mind, I will continue.  Without a full list of allowances, we cannot see potential grey areas between once-off and permanent allowances, which almost certainly exist.  It may be precisely in these grey areas that controversy and conflict will arise over how workers see certain allowances; they may see them as permanent while the Minister sees them as not permanent.  I am concerned that we do not have the full list and the only reason we do not have the full list-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly, because the Minister has not negotiated them nor designated them because he is still involved-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  I understand but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, that is probably the case.  However, in my view, we should have a list in conjunction with this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my view the list should be there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the power that is being vested in the Minister to designate or not to designate, the Minister stated earlier that these would be subject to negotiation and to the public sector conciliation service and so on.  Why is this not referred to in point four?  This does not make that power vested solely in the Minister, subject to those things.  It does not specify it.  We just have it on the Minister's good word that he will ensure that proper consultation procedures will be used.  However, we only have the Minister's word for this and another Minister might choose not to do so.  The legislation proposes that the Minister may simply designate with the stroke of a pen whether certain allowances which workers currently enjoy, will be pensionable or not and it does not have that qualification by caveat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the points have been made now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are just teasing it out.
