RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I add my voice and that of People Before Profit and the United Left Alliance in offering our condolences to the family of Ronan Kerr following this terrible tragedy.  We join other speakers and parties in condemning absolutely this despicable act.  There is simply no justification whatsoever for this kind of atrocity.  As Deputy Martin said, these are not dissidents fulfilling some sort of authentic republican strategy.  It is an utterly brutal, barbaric action that leads nowhere except back down a road which has failed in the past and which we do not want to go down again.However, it is important to look at the deeper politics, as Deputy Adams said, to allow us to address this problem and the danger of things moving back in that direction. We all must acknowledge that there has been a worrying growth, albeit among a minority in the North, in the organisations associated with this kind of activity.  We have to ask ourselves why that is happening and what we can do about it.  The peace dividend was much talked about at the time of the Good Friday Agreement.  Many people placed their hopes in the Agreement that there would be a dividend in terms of prosperity, improved quality of life, better living conditions — all that people hoped would come with it, not just peace but a social and economic dividend.  Does the Taoiseach agree this has not been delivered and that, in such a situation, there is always a danger of alienated young people moving towards twisted, warped or misguided ideas which they think can somehow address it?  We must look seriously at that.  In that context, the economic austerity being imposed in the North as well as here and across the world, in the interests of protecting bankers and bondholders across Europe, is part of the problem and will fuel it.  We have to resist an austerity which leads to that sort of alienation and which fails to deliver on the social and economic aspirations of ordinary people.  We must also ask whether, despite best intentions, the political structures that were set up as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, which sought to bring about a political dispensation that could end conflict, may perhaps at some level have institutionalised communal identity in the political structure of Northern Ireland.  The Agreement has corralled people into community identities instead of developing a politics that breaks us out of communal identity and where we begin to talk about the social and economic issues that unite people rather than the communal identities which divide them.  That is something we must address in a serious way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The petroleum affairs division, as mentioned by the Minister, estimates that 10 billion barrels of gas or oil equivalent are out there.  We should be clear what is at stake.  If that is anywhere even close to the mark, at current oil prices that would amount to €900 billion of gas and oil just off the west coast.  One can consider that we have just borrowed €100 billion to bail out toxic banks and NAMA in a deal that will enslave this country to austerity, cutbacks and an unsustainable debt burden.  Would it not be better to instead invest in developing resources and establishing a regime where we can get a reasonable benefit from the development and exploitation of those resources?Is it a fact that we have one of the most pathetic arrangements for licensing, as we will get next to nothing?  We have an arrangement where no royalties will accrue to this State from the development by multinational companies of our gas and oil resources.  For all the bending over backwards we have done to facilitate Shell in its activities in Mayo etc., there is no security of supply.  It does not have to supply to us if it does not want to.Why do we not act like the Norwegians?  That country has a 78% tax on profits made on oil resources in its territory and it owns 67% of Statoil, the national oil and petroleum company.  The state jointly participates with multinational oil companies in the development and exploitation of those resources.  It is shocking that the people of Norway will benefit more from the development of our gas and oil resources off the west coast of Ireland than we will.  Should we not do something about it urgently?  There are now reports of significant finds in Dublin Bay in the hands of more private companies but why are we giving away gas and oil resources rather than developing and exploiting them ourselves?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Shell has found some.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Colreavy asked the question I wanted to ask: what exactly is a non-essential or non-strategic State asset?  This must be defined.  This group of 17 illustrious people, whoever they are, although I know they are all very wealthy, with significant business interests——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——is recommending the selling of ports and harbours.  Are those non-strategic assets?  I ask this question because a mantra has been repeated by Fine Gael representatives in the debate on how to deal with unemployment that the State does not create jobs.  What then are Bord na Móna, ESB, the health service or the ports and harbours?  They create useful employment.  The State can and should create jobs.  Perhaps the Minister of State can give us an idea of what a non-essential or non-strategic State asset is because I am worried any of these things could be considered non-strategic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Minister of State get that from the Minister?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Order of Business not refer to the shocking revelations in today's edition of The Irish Times concerning gardaí abusing and threatening with rape individuals they had detained at protests in County Mayo?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the reason it does not feature on the Order of Business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a serious issue which should feature on the Order of Business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surely I can ask the reason certain matters do not feature on the Order of Business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise another matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand legislation is required to hold a referendum.  Is the Taoiseach aware a debate is taking place today on a motion put forward by the Technical Group that we should have such a referendum?  Whether the Taoiseach or the Government agree with that, I invite him and a few more Members of the Government side than often turn up at Private Members' time to do us the courtesy of having a discussion on an issue that is of such grave importance, namely, the economic future of this country.  This would allow for a proper debate on whether this country should be allowed to decide whether it wants to proceed with the bank bailout and the IMF deal.  Will the Taoiseach instruct a few of the troops to come along, and perhaps he could also come along, and participate in a real way in that debate about——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not do splits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Joan Collins, Stephen Donnelly, Luke Flanagan and Finian McGrath.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That Dáil Éireann:recognises that:the bank bailout and the EU-IMF loan package arrangement imposes a hugely onerous debt burden on Ireland which will have profound consequences on the Irish economy and Irish society for years to come;there is widespread and justified outrage felt among very wide layers of Irish society that ordinary citizens, and most particularly those on low and middle incomes and the vulnerable in our society, are being forced to pay for the speculation and gambling of bankers, bondholders and developers by way of swingeing cutbacks and austerity;a wide body of civic, political and expert opinion, both nationally and internationally, believes that the debt burden arising from the bank bailout, the EU-IMF package, and the conditions attached to the package in the memorandum of understanding, are economically unsustainable or potentially will become so, and will damage rather than enhance our country's prospects for future economic growth;EU treaties signed by this country, with arguably far less grave or immediate effects for our economy and society than the EU-IMF package, have been put to referendum;faced with a similar crisis to that in this country, the people of Iceland demanded and won the right to a referendum on a proposed IMF loan package;recent developments in Portugal confirm that the financial and economic crisis now facing Ireland is very much a Europe-wide problem and that wide layers of society in other European countries are questioning the current EU approach to dealing with the banking and financial crisis;the Pact for the Euro agreed at the recently held EU Council summit and the strengthening of EU powers for monitoring the economic and fiscal policies of member states, particularly those involved in the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the proposed European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), have potentially profound effects on the ability of EU member states and their citizens to decide their own economic policies; andthere is an overwhelming democratic case for putting the continued bank bail-out and an agreement with such profound implications for the economic and social future of our country to a referendum of the people; and resolves to call a national referendum providing the Irish people the opportunity to accept or reject the bank bailout and the EU-IMF loan package arrangement.I appeal to the one member of the Government who has turned up for this debate——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies, I did not see Deputy Keaveney.I appeal to the Government to withdraw its amendment to the motion and allow, as the motion calls for, a referendum to be held on the continuing bailout of the banks and the EU-IMF deal.  The Government will be aware, as is I am sure everyone in the country, that we are facing the most grave economic crisis in the history of the State.  Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs, while tens of thousands have been forced to emigrate.  Brutal austerity measures are being imposed on ordinary families, working people and the poor and vulnerable in Irish society whose incomes have been savaged, while services have been cut.  Many families are threatened with repossession of their homes.  People are not able to pay their bills or make ends meet.It is important to point out that the people suffering the consequences of this austerity which is being dictated by the IMF are not bankers or speculators but individuals who have worked and reared families and are now trying to enjoy their old age.  They did not cause the crisis, yet they are being asked to pay for the criminal greed of bankers and speculators.  This is often obscured in technical economic argument.  It is often suggested this is a complicated matter, one above the heads of ordinary people.  However, it is a simple one.  It is about whether ordinary working people, families, communities and the vulnerable in our society, including the young and the old, should pay for the crisis created by the reckless gambling and speculation of bankers and bondholders or whether the bankers and bondholders who caused it should pay for it.Before entering government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were unequivocal about on which side of the debate they stood.  In February Fine Gael stated it was morally wrong and economically unsustainable to ask the people to beggar themselves to enrich speculators and profiteers.  What has changed?  With another €24 billion being pumped into the banks, the case for saying we should not beggar ordinary citizens country to enrich bankers and speculators is even greater than it was when Fine Gael made that statement.  If it was morally wrong and economically unsustainable to pour €46 billion into the banks, surely it is even more morally wrong and economically unsustainable to put €70 billion into them.It is a pity the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, is not here.  He went further in stating his view of the case when he said for the second time earlier this year that the previous Government was guilty of economic treason for continuing to bail out the banks at a cost to taxpayers.  It is worth quoting what he said: "If your Government [talking about the previous Government] knew that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent and you asked the Irish taxpayers to bail it out and to pay the cost we are now paying for it that was and is economic treason ... I stand over that."  If it was economic treason to bail out an insolvent bank at the expense of taxpayers, is it even greater economic treason to bail out all of the banks at greater cost to ordinary taxpayers?I put to the Government the charge which the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, put to the previous Government, namely, that it is guilty of economic and political treason for saying one thing before the general election and something quite different afterwards and continuing with the same policies.  It is shocking for ordinary people to hear Fine Gael and the Labour Party, given all the rhetoric about change and ohow they would do things differently, sound exactly the same as the previous Government.  They are using the same phrases, justifications and arguments for defending a continuation of the failed policy of bailing out the bankers, speculators and bondholders.  Whenever these points are put to the Government, it states there is no alternative.  We believe there is.  If we were to threaten to default, this would put the ball back in the court of the IMF and the European Union, the ones who are trying to dictate to us who should pay for the banking crisis.  We must put it up to them that if they wish to save the euro and the banks, they should pay for it and unload the cost of so doing onto the banks, bondholders and speculators guilty of causing the crisis in the first instance.  By standing up to them and threatening to default we would at least force the ball back into their court and put it up to them to come with a fair, just and sustainable package to deal with the crisis.It is important to point out that other countries have defaulted and that the sky has not fallen in on their heads.  Iceland defaulted.  As a result of campaigning by ordinary people for months, the Icelandic Government was forced to concede default.  The Icelandic people, because they were outraged by the thought of this type of package being imposed on them without their having any say, took to the streets, surrounded their Parliament and demanded a referendum on whether to accept a similar package from the IMF.  In a referendum they voted by a figure of 93% against a similar deal and the sky did not fall in on their heads.  The IMF was forced to consider the outcome of the vote and reduce by a significant amount the interest rate it was charging Iceland.  I am not suggesting that is the end of the story for Iceland, but the referendum outcome forced a change and debate.  Other countries that defaulted, including Ecuador and Argentina, are still alive and kicking.  The sky has not fallen in on their heads.  If we leave the European Union to its own devices, as the Government is proposing to do, it will squeeze us.  It will use the debt burden it is imposing on us to squeeze more concessions out of us in terms of the agenda it is pursuing.  That is clear from what happened in the case of Greece.The Government states it will negotiate a 1% reduction in the interest rate charged on this unsustainable package.  To achieve a 1% reduction in the interest rate applied to its loan, Greece had to agree to a €50 billion programme of privatisation.  Will such a programme be the  quid pro quo required of the Government in the event that it manages to wangle a tiny concession from the International Monetary Fund and European Union in the forthcoming negotiations?  The Government has already been forced to agree to sell State assets worth €2 billion.  What will the IMF and EU demand at the next round of meetings if they are not satisfied that Ireland is doing enough or believe it will not be able to repay its loans?  What will they seek in return for a small reduction in the interest rate on our loans?  How many more privatisations of State assets will they demand?  How many more cuts in social welfare and the incomes of ordinary people will they require?  Is the Minister aware that at its most recent meeting with the IMF and EU, the Greek Government was told by the IMF-EU representative to start selling beaches and islands.  Is this what the Government wants for Ireland?While some of the Technical Group may differ from me on what are the alternatives, there are other options available.  It is unconscionable that the Government refuses to reverse budget cuts which took €6 billion from ordinary people and the vulnerable given that just a few weeks ago we discovered that the 300 richest people in the country are €6.7 billion richer than they were last year.  Why will the Government not consider introducing a wealth tax?  Why will it not even agree that such a tax would be fair?While the Government and even some members of the Technical Group will not agree with many of the points I have made, surely they accept that it would be democratic to have a referendum on the bailout.  The purpose of our call for a referendum is to enable people to debate the options and allow everyone to set out their stall in order that the country can make a decision on the issue.  Does the Government not trust people to consider this matter objectively and make the best decision for the country?  This is what democracy and the motion are about.  I ask the Government not to move its amendment and instead allow citizens to vote on the bailout package which will determine their social and economic future for many years to come.
