RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Generally speaking, the legislation is to be welcomed. There has been some acknowledgement of concerns raised at earlier Stages in the debate. All of this is to be welcomed, but it quite simply does not go far enough, particularly in the area of young people. It is a pity that the Government is still lagging behind on this issue, given the absolutely fantastic sentiment for equality expressed in the marriage equality referendum, the fact that our society has grown up and the people have led the way in demanding real equality and have thrown off many of the shackles which have held the country back so badly and have done such damage to young people, women and other groups. Deputy Collins has indicated to us that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has indicated the Minister of State should have accepted the amendments to change the medical hoops being put in the way of young people between the ages of 16 and 18 and deal in a fair way with people aged under 16, but the Minister of State is still refusing to do so. I do not really understand why, because everybody, including the UN, the ISPCC, TENI, all of the groups and anybody who knows or cares about this issue is saying the Minister of State needs to go further and accept the amendments, and clearly it is the expressed will of the people in the country. It is a bit difficult to understand why the Minister of State is failing to do so, even when people in Cabinet are stating privately if not publicly that he should do so. It is not too late and the Minister of State should take on board these amendments and make the Bill all it should be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also support this amendment. It is entirely sensible and appropriate. The Minister of State has acknowledged that elements of this Bill will have to be changed but cannot be changed at the moment for purely legal reasons, as Deputy O'Dea mentioned. The main explanation given to us on Committee Stage of the debate was that the marriage equality amendment had not yet been passed. Therefore, now that the referendum is over and the amendment is passed, once any legal problems are cleared out of the way, it logically follows that the Government will immediately amend this Bill, if it is still in government, or that any future Government would do so immediately. The Minister of State made a point earlier in response to me about the significance of the marriage equality referendum in setting a context in which the Government could go further than it is going in this Bill, particularly in the area of dealing with young people aged between 18 and 16 and people under 16, and the other issues that need to be dealt with. I am sure this was discussed before, but the requirement for a person to declare a solemn intention of living in the preferred gender for the rest of his or her life also should not be there. We should be supporting gender self-determination. I do not see why one has to give a commitment to stay in a particular gender forever in order to get a certificate. We should have gender self-determination. All these things need to be looked at, most importantly the situation for young people. My point about the referendum was not that it forced the Minister of State to make some of the changes he has made. That is largely down to the advocacy groups, who have educated us all on these matters during the course of the debate. I accept his point on that. It is the advocacy groups, TENI and others, that have helped us to understand the issues. My point is that the referendum indicates that the people are way ahead of politicians on matters of equality. Any political hesitation that might stop the Government from going further in this Bill is unwarranted. The people have stated their belief in equality in these matters. The statement made was not just about marriage equality; it was about the need for equality more generally, including in matters to do with transgender people. There is no political reason to lag behind where the people are - something we have done, sadly and at a terrible cost, in this State for many years. The political system has lagged behind. Big, powerful institutions have held us back and lagged behind where people are. A year is a long time in the life of a young person. Things are pretty tough for young people, generally speaking, and if a year is a long time, two years is a very long time. The Minister of State has spoken about the need for more consultation on these matters. We have had the consultation, we have had the best advice and we have had an extensive discussion. I do not see why he will not accept the amendments, but given that he is not going to, I do not see why he could not agree to the review in a year and making those changes in a year's time, rather than stringing it out for two years, because that is a long time in the lives of young people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The full Dáil is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I concur strongly with this amendment and the previous comments that were made. The points have been well elaborated in recent times, particularly with the Dunnes Stores strike and the manner in which those workers highlighted, through their action, the utterly scandalous situation of low pay and the intolerable conditions they and workers in many other employments have to put up with. Is there a radio on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To establish this right and link this legislation to what is a human right is a very positive, progressive and necessary step. We must raise the standards and counter the pressure and drive towards the race to the bottom. I would point to another dimension to this issue which we discussed at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday and I was very pleased to get a positive response from economists who were there. We were debating the issue of quantitative easing, which is a technically dense, complicated, barely understandable process that is being engaged in by the European authorities, the ECB and so on, essentially to counter the impact of austerity. I, and others, put it to that group of economists, Stephen Kinsella, Dan O'Brien and Constantin Gurdgiev, who are quite a mixed bag from the political and ideological spectrum, that with respect to all the economic crisis, quantitative easing, austerity and the problems the European and global economy are facing, that the big problem is low pay and that all of those measures were symptoms of the fact that the share of income that is going to labour has dropped by about 10% since the Thatcher-Regan era and there has been a corresponding increase in the national economic cake or wider European economic cake going to profits. There has been a significant and consistent transfer across Europe and the world of wealth from the pockets of workers, in the form of wages, into the pockets of the rich in the form of profits and that transfer lies at the base of the economic crisis we are now witnessing. There is an economic imperative, from the point of view of the whole economy, to address the issue of low pay, not only for the low-paid but for the stability of the entire economy. If workers do not have enough money in their pockets, they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads and they cannot afford to pay for goods. If they cannot do that, it causes a big problem for the economy and there is only one way that can be resolved and that is by them getting loans - many loans - they cannot afford to pay back. The result of that is credit bubbles and the financialisation of the entire economy. That is what has happened during the last 25 years.  The question of radically redressing the race to the bottom, the issue of low pay and the transfer from wages to capital which has essentially taken place during the past 25 years is really a matter of economic urgency for our economy and the global economy, not to mention for the people who are really struggling. Some 19% of those working are living in poverty, which is an extraordinary situation. Stephen Kinsella said yesterday that this is a Marxist argument but Marx was right; he actually said that. I was amazed by that comment. Constantin Gurdgiev did not quite agree with him all the way but he nodded to indicate that there was a very significant element of truth in it.For various reasons we have to shift the narrative on the question of fair remuneration, a living wage and a decent income for working people. Otherwise, the crisis our economy has just gone through will recur and on the current trajectory, it is increasingly likely that will happen. We have to address this and one way to do that is to say that decent remuneration is a human right to counter the relentless narrative about competitiveness, which becomes the justification for attacking pay and conditions for workers. That sounds good on the face of it but when we examine it closely, it is a disaster for the economy when it is viewed in its entirety.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the issue of bogus self-employment, the response of the Minister for Finance on this issue is shocking. There is no acknowledgement of the serious level of wholesale tax fraud that is going on in this area. The State is not interested in dealing with it. There is an interesting parallel between current events in Greece and the attitude of our State to the issue of bogus self-employment, which is rampant in the construction sector here. There has been much talk about the biggest problem for Greece being that the Greek people do not want to pay taxes. In comparison with Greece, Ireland is a legally compliant state where people play by the rules and the State is very serious about going after people who play fast and loose with the tax system. Public sector and PAYE workers in Greece pay their taxes in the same way as people in Ireland. It is taken out of their pockets. In so far as there is a problem with regard to tax in Greece, it revolves around the self-employed sector. It is true that there is a large self-employed sector in Greece and that there has been an expansion of that sector in Ireland. This is a sector which Fine Gael in particular would like to see expand even further. Self-employment in the construction sector has expanded significantly from what it was in the good old days. While previously workers in that sector would have been employed directly as PAYE workers, there has been an exponential expansion of self-employment in the sector and, with that, wholesale abuse and exploitation of that category of self-employed construction workers.  In regard to the amount of tax collected from the self-employed in the construction sector, as against that collected from PAYE workers in the sector, the numbers of which in each category are similar, while hundreds of millions are collected from the PAYE sector, a minus is often recorded in respect of those categorised as self-employed. Even where an amount is collected, it is derisory. Any cursory examination of the number of people who are supposed to be self-employed in the construction sector would indicate that not all of them could be, in reality, self-employed. This sector has expanded massively and direct employment has reduced in tandem, the result of which has been a very significant loss to the Exchequer. We hear constant and entirely credible, confirmed in many cases, examples of tax fraud and abuse and exploitation of the RTC-1 system. It is clear to me that the Minister for Finance and, in my view, Fine Gael, because it is ideologically committed to this whole notion, are not interested in dealing with this issue. They choose to turn a blind eye to this because it enables the State to have public contract work such as school buildings construction done cheaply, even if it means workers are being exploited and the tax system is being abused. In their view, they are promoting competition. This abuse is taking place on a widespread basis. While the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is not willing to address this issue, one would expect a Labour Minister to avail of any opportunity to address it and this legislation presents such an opportunity.  I was contacted again this morning by one of the Rhatigan's workers, for whom address of this issue is now a crusade. Fair play to him because week-in, week-out he provides me with details of where this is going on. I have not had time yet to have a proper discussion with him but he left a message on my phone this morning about another site where this is going on. He said that contractors from the North have come up with a new scam, which has something to do with invoicing of the main contractor, to get around Scope or NERA on the issue of compliance in the context of self-employment. This is rampant and the Minister of State knows it. We need a specific mandate for the commission to address this issue in a serious way.  Deputy Tóibín made some important points on the wider issue of the minimum hourly rate. This is of critical importance when it comes to the issue of accommodation. The ability of people to access affordable accommodation is at crisis point. While this is obviously a serious problem for the people, it will soon be a major problem for our economy if people cannot afford accommodation because their wages are so low. The question of wages being sufficient to allow people to put a roof over their heads is critical. This requires serious consideration. It is untenable that some people are paying 50%, 60% and sometimes 70% of their income on keeping a roof over their heads. It is shocking. Various bodies across Europe recommend that people should not be paying more than a quarter or, at most, a third of their income for accommodation. Otherwise, they will get into serious financial trouble. People here are spending virtually all of their income on accommodation. Sometimes even that is not enough to keep a roof over their heads. The Low Pay Commission should, as part of its work, examine whether the level of pay here is adequate to ensure that people who are working can afford to pay for accommodation. People should not have to fork out every penny they have to do that.  The proposed amendment is very good in that it points in this direction. Even if the Minister of State will not accept it, the issue of affordability of accommodation and its relationship to wage levels must be the focus of this or any future Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was interesting that the Minister of State suggested David Cameron was playing a bit of a game, by committing to a living wage but taking it away with the other hand through tax credits. He stated wages are rising here and that we are trying to deal with low pay. Is the Government not doing exactly the same thing? Is that not the whole point of these amendments? I am very glad to say a motion was passed at the ICTU conference, against some resistance it has to be said by the unions generally associated with the Labour Party, but, nonetheless, the majority of unions, headed up by the right to water trade unions, stated that ICTU should oppose water charges because they are another regressive tax which reduce the real income of workers and therefore it is an issue for the trade union movement. They are absolutely right. I am sure it was for political reasons that certain trade unions with a strong association with the Labour Party opposed the motion. It speaks exactly to what the Minister of State just rightly accused David Cameron of doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is exactly what is going on here. We are speaking about rising levels of wages in a situation where the cost of accommodation has gone out of control. What is the real actual money workers have? What is the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin these days? Is it €1,600? How many workers only earn this a month? These are serious issues and we are asking that the Low Pay Commission must have them stitched into it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has two minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	IBEC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would trust the Central Statistics Office first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to add my support to these amendments. The expression about lies, damned lies and statistics is certainly a relevant idea when we are talking about low pay. We can bandy around statistics, as the Minister of State did earlier when he said that pay levels are increasing. We can debate whether the JobBridge and Gateway schemes are licences for exploitation or, as I suspect the Government would argue when cases of abuse are highlighted, otherwise good programmes that are being abused in a small number of rogue instances. Similarly, there is an urgent need for rigorous monitoring and enforcement levels to end the abuses associated with bogus self-employment. We can debate things at theoretical, legislative and statistical levels, but the devil is always in the detail of the individual real cases. That is how we discover what is really happening and what needs to be addressed, tightened up and changed. If the Low Pay Commission is to become an active force in addressing the scourge of low pay, the abuse of schemes like JobBridge and the question of bogus self-employment, it must be given a real, tangible and concrete watchdog role. I have nothing to add to Deputy Paul Murphy's points. I agree that we need something that is responsive to the changes in the cost of living, etc. As such changes often happen over relatively short periods of time, we need to be able to review these matters on a more frequent basis. I believe these amendments are sensible and practical.
