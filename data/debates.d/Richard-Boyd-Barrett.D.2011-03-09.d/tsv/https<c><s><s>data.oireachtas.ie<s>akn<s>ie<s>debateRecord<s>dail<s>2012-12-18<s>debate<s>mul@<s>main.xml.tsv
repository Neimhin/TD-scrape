RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears, did this committee meet with the troika and discuss its demand that legislative impediments to banks repossessing family homes should be a priority for the Government? It is difficult to tally the Taoiseach's soothing words about the low level of repossessions in the country and his assurances that the personal insolvency agency will protect home owners from the loss of their family homes with the simultaneous demand by the troika that legal impediments to the right of banks to repossess family homes should be a priority. Did this committee discuss that with them and could they explain their rationale in making this demand? Is it not the case, consequently, given this demand, that those with mortgages, particularly distressed mortgages, should be fearful because our troika masters are demanding that banks should be able to repossess more homes? On the Economic Management Council it is clear from the protections, in terms of low corporate tax rate and a refusal to impose the financial transaction tax, that the submissions of the banks and groups such as the clearing house group were listened to by the Economic Management Council. Is it equally obvious that the Economic Management Council did not listen to the plethora of civil society groups and groups dealing with poverty, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland and the trade unions, which were representing the least well off and struggling sections in society and which made submission after submission asking that the burden of austerity in the budget should not fall on those who are already struggling to survive? Is it the case that the Economic Management Council, the inner cabal of the Government, listened only to one section of society - the troika, the banks, the very wealthy - and simply refused to listen to and ignored the civil society and other group organisations that represented ordinary citizens - low and middle income earners, the unemployed and the vulnerable in society? Is there something radically wrong with the way this inner cabal of the Government is deporting itself, in listening only to one minority section of society and not listening at all to the voices of the majority?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rubbish. It is not 11.9%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know from where the Taoiseach got 11.9%. That is a fantasy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This extremely cynical and undemocratic attempt to ram through the property tax will not save the Taoiseach, as he hopes it will, from the popular revolt next year when people have this unfair tax imposed on them. The level of popular resistance and boycott that we saw concerning the household charge last year will be even greater and far more terrifying for the Government. Despite the forlorn effort on the Taoiseach's part to try to forestall protest, none the less this is an extremely cynical exercise. There are 159 sections in the property tax Bill. By anybody's standards this is among the most important legislation this Government will ever put through the House. It will affect virtually every citizen in the country. There are a hell of a lot of details involved in the new powers it gives to Revenue to seize money at source from ordinary workers and social welfare recipients. It will have significant economic implications in terms of the burden it will impose on low and middle-income families. It will also potentially have a very damaging effect on the domestic economy, in addition to many more details, complexities and potential anomalies. Despite this, the Taoiseach intends to forestall that debate and squash those 159 sections into a couple of hours. We will be lucky if we get through seven or eight of them. It makes a farce and a sham of democracy, of this House and of its role in legislative scrutiny. It is cynical and dictatorial in the extreme. The Taoiseach should lift the guillotine and at least allow for a debate on this measure. He should allow all amendments to be discussed. It can easily be done early next year because the property tax does not come into force until the middle of 2013. There is simply no excuse for this guillotine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I elaborate Deputy Higgins's point? The amendments are to section 1, which is the definitions section of the Bill. The basis of my amendment is that we believe the Title we propose is, objectively, a more accurate description of the Bill. I do not see how it could possibly be out of order. In a telephone call from the Department, we were told the amendment was declaratory in nature. It is not. It simply says we believe the Title we propose is a better, more appropriate and more accurate name for the Bill. It tells us more correctly what the Bill is and what is in it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In so far as this section deals with the title of the Bill, in many ways it gets to the heart of the dishonesty and cynicism that lies behind it. It is simply an abuse of language and meaning to call this a property tax, particularly in the context of the unprecedented popular campaign of resistance and boycott against the unjust household charge. The Government claimed repeatedly it would bring in this tax as a replacement to the household charge, which it was forced to abandon, and that it would introduce a fair and progressive system, effectively implying it would be a wealth tax. We on the left had consistently called for such a tax in recent years and thought it was about to be introduced. That, however, is not what this is at all. It is absolutely clear at a range of levels that it is not a property tax in the sense of property being real wealth held by what most people understand to be the wealthy, those with lots of property, the men and women of property, as they were called when people like Wolfe Tone tried to organise the men and women without property. It was understood what that meant. It meant that there were some people who had lots of wealth and property and there were some who had little or none. This is not a tax being imposed on those who have huge accumulations of wealth and property. This is a tax being imposed on every ordinary citizen in this country regardless of their ability to pay. It is a tax simply on the roof over their head, which is effectively a tax on the right to live in a civilised way. It is an obnoxious attack on ordinary citizens, utterly disregarding their capacity to pay it, to survive, to pay their bills, to educate their children and to manage in this extraordinarily difficult situation in which so many find themselves. Earlier today in the Dáil the Taoiseach effectively admitted this. When Deputy Higgins asked him, given that four years ago he railed against any attempt to put a tax on the family home, why he is now imposing just such a tax, he said that things had changed and that we are in an extraordinarily difficult situation. He was referring, of course, to the financial collapse caused by developers, bankers, speculators, bondholders and all the rest of it. In other words he was acknowledging precisely the point we were making in referring to it as a bondholders' tax and that is what it is. There was no morality or progressiveness to it - it was simply an austerity tax being imposed in order to satisfy the troika and ensure the protection of the bankers and bondholders and to make ordinary people pay for that fact. It clearly confirms what we and everybody else in the country knows and believes to be the case. That the Government persists in trying to pretend it is progressive or a property tax in any sense that ordinary people would understand is pure dishonesty and spin on its part. Another piece of evidence of how dishonest the attempt to call it a property tax is illustrated by what is happening in the local authorities. I presume what happened in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council this week is being replicated everywhere else. The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county manager was asked why the budget going through the council this week makes no mention of the property tax even though Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will be required to pay €7 million to the central government to meet its obligations under this property tax. The county manager was asked where he would get the money if he is sent such a bill by the Revenue Commissioners and he said it would go onto the rents of council tenants. So people who have no property will have this imposed on them by the local authority, which clearly indicates this is just a tax on ordinary people. It is not a property tax and the bill will be paid by local authority tenants. Similar points have been made about people in negative equity. This is taxing the ball and chain around people's legs. This is like attaching a ball and chain to somebody, throwing them into the river, asking them why they cannot swim and threatening menaces and punishments because they cannot swim. It is outrageous. The homes of people, whose mortgages are like an albatross around their necks, some of which are damaged by pyrite or have major structural problems such as in Priory Hall cannot in any meaningful sense be described as property - as a form of wealth - on which it is legitimate to levy a tax. The real giveaway which totally exposes the lies being used to justify the Bill is that it is being collected by the Revenue Commissioners, the people who collect income tax, and not by the local authorities. It will not increase in any way the provision of services or the funds available to local government. In fact, as I have just explained, local government will have to give money back to central government, having less money for services and punishing their tenants. That it is being collected by the Revenue Commissioners exposes the implication that somehow ordinary people have a different pot of money. The Minister is guilty of using the sort of mythology we tell children when they ask where we will get the money and they are told that it is on the money tree in the back garden. Does the Minister believe that hundreds of thousands of citizens, who are unemployed or have had their incomes savaged and are in mortgage distress, have money trees growing in the back garden and that they will be able to go and pick the money from the tree on their property in order to pay this tax? It is ludicrous. Why does the Minister not tell the truth at least in the title of this tax and call it what it is? It is a tax to satisfy the greed of the bankers and bondholders being imposed on the roofs over the heads of ordinary citizens of this country regardless of whether they own that roof, regardless of their ability to pay it and regardless of their ability to keep food on the table for their children. It is shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The truth the Minister does not want to hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was guillotined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or Deputy Bannon could tell us where the money tree is?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take it if the Deputy wants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to hear it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a tax on assets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a tax on assets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Along with Deputy Mitchell.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is Groucho Marx now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought we were told the troika was ruling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The troika has slipped the Minister's memory.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was called to speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is ironic that the Minister would ask for five minutes to reply, when he has ruthlessly guillotined the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has it within his power to give himself and every other Deputy time to debate the Bill, and he has refused to give us that time. Why would we give him the time? When I heard the Minister's response, I thought I was looking at "The Mario Rosenstock Show" or "Irish Pictorial Weekly". The Minister should audition for them-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----because he would be better off working for them than designing taxes like this. This is farcical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments highlight how farcical, how unfair and how full of anomalies, holes and injustices the Bill is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier this evening, the Minister revealed the prejudice that lies under his humour and intelligence, because he is funny and intelligent. Underlying his earlier comments was a deep prejudice. He said some people get up for work in the morning and walk past houses where other people do not get up for work in the morning, and why should they not make a contribution too? That gets to the heart of the prejudice within Fine Gael to which the Labour Party is giving cover. The people who do not have work in the morning are not staying in bed out of laziness, because they do not have to contribute or would not like to be in a position to pay their taxes and contribute to the functioning of our society. They are out of work through no fault of their own.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are out of work through the reckless behaviour of bankers and speculators and the mismanagement of the State by Fianna Fáil and by the Opposition which did not raise a voice against Fianna Fáil's facilitation of those developers, bankers and speculators. That is why they are out of work, not in a position to pay this tax and in negative equity. They had to pay enormous sums of money in stamp duty. If they have to pay this property tax, they will be doubly taxed. This is more than an injustice. The Minister has not answered the question. How can people who are in mortgage distress and barely able to keep up with their mortgage payments be expected to pay this tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This point has been raised with the Minister time and again. He gives us a comic routine in response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not funny for the people who cannot make these payments. Government party Deputies do not like it now. They put the guillotine on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is breaking our economy and families and destroying lives and livelihoods. They do not like it when they cannot give a smart answer back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister also made an erroneous comment about funding local government. He did not answer the point that local government will be charged. Local authorities will get nothing from the property tax this year but they will be liable to pay for every council house in their ownership and they will load that cost onto the rents of local authority tenants. Even if they get money, they will pay back every penny they get. The Minister said this is the alternative to what he calls a tax on work. If the property tax is to be taken out of pay packets and social welfare payments, is that not a tax on income? Of course it is. The Minister must think people are fools if they cannot figure that one out. People are not fools. The Minister's history is wrong. He was wrong when he referred to Lenin not supporting property owners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The revolution in Russia was spurred on when the peasants joined up with those in the cities who were faced with injustice.
