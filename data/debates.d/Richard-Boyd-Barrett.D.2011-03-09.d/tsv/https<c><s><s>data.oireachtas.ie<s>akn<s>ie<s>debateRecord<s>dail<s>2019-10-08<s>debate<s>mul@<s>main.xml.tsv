RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We needed a radical budget to deal with the threat of a no-deal Brexit, the disastrous housing and homelessness crisis, the crisis in our public health system, the climate emergency, the astronomical cost of childcare and the woefully inadequate disability and respite services, among a whole range of other areas. We did not get a radical budget or radical action on any of these crises, threats or emergencies that face us. We got a deeply conservative budget that will address none of these crises or emergencies. Working people, pensioners and young people who are dependent on social welfare got absolutely nothing. By getting nothing, they have in effect taken cuts. That is the reality. By imposing a freeze on the incomes of the poorest people and on working people, giving them nothing, the Government has in effect cut their incomes. The Government may believe that is prudent in the face of the threat of a no-deal Brexit. In fact, it repeats the folly of the Government that reacted to the last major crisis, the crash of 2008, where austerity and keeping a clamp on or cutting the incomes of working people made a bad situation a hell of a lot worse. We are still paying for those mistakes with the housing crisis that we face, the mess in our public health system and shocking levels of poverty, with 720,000 people in the country living in poverty, including 230,000 children. Some 100,000 people who are working in the country are officially living in poverty. The Government has given no increases in social welfare or relief on the austerity USC that was imposed on workers all those years ago, which effectively cut their incomes. That is a big mistake and one does not have to be a radical socialist to think so. John Maynard Keynes made this point a long time ago. When one is facing a potential downturn or disruption in an economy, one should spend more, boost people's incomes and increase investment in infrastructure, key sectors of the economy and in services. The Government has done the opposite to that. The so-called prudence is conservatism in reality and will potentially make a bad situation worse. It is important to underline the point about workers getting nothing. One only has to walk out to the canteen to talk to workers. They are already saying there and on the streets that workers got nothing out of this budget. That is against a background where the productivity of workers in this country has gone through the roof in recent years. Workers are working harder and longer, effectively for less and making a bigger tax contribution than they ever have before. The tax contribution of ordinary workers has gone from €13 billion in 2007 to €21 billion. Workers are working harder and longer for less and paying more tax and the Government wants to impose a carbon tax on top of that. It is more aggressive taxation to cut further the real incomes of working people and the least well off. Let us not forget about our students, who got nothing from this. They asked for a break in student contribution fees or for an increase in maintenance grants, in effect driving more and more students into poverty, while they also face astronomical rents and the failure of the Government to build cheap, affordable student accommodation on third level campuses. The students asked for that and got none of it. Meanwhile, all the big tax breaks continue for the big corporations. We have carbon taxes for the poor and struggling who are not to blame for the climate emergency but there is no mention of the big polluting corporations. Even the EU has proposed that there would be an aviation fuel tax. If it was imposed on the Ryanairs of this world, this country would raise hundreds of millions, but the Government never talks about taxing the massively profitable aviation industry and the other polluting corporations. The Government always wants to hit the working people, the poor and the little people, who are asked to pay the price for the crimes of the rich. The issue with housing is unbelievable. Does the Government not understand that its policy is failing? It is eight years since Fine Gael came into government and this Government has been in place for more than three years. The housing situation gets worse. Rents are at astronomical levels. Average rents in Dublin are way in excess of what one pays for a mortgage and ordinary working people cannot afford a mortgage either because house prices are so high. I even heard Tom Parlon, hardly a firebrand on the left, on the television before I came in here, reminding us that one has to be paid €90,000 or €100,000 a year to have a prayer of buying a house at average prices in Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mortgages are cheaper than the rents being charged in Dublin. How wealthy does one have to be to pay the average rental price in Dublin of €2,000, or €2,200 in my area, or even €2,400 a month? Who can afford that? Of course there is a group of people making money out of it. What is the Government doing to tax them? It includes the vulture funds, the cuckoo funds and the big corporate landlords who as we speak are moving to evict people in my area and several places in the city. I have to go to the Residential Tenancies Board tomorrow with tenants from my area who are facing the fourth attempt in two years by a vulture fund to evict them. Threshold believes that the fund will finally succeed in getting all these people out. They will then arrive to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, presenting as homeless. It is shocking. Loopholes the Government has left in the legislation allow the vulture funds to do this. There is breaking news for journalists and so on about a €27 million cut in central Government funding for local government in the budget estimates book. That is a 13% cut. It is on page 53. When the local property tax was introduced by the Government, we opposed it and said it was regressive. One of the seven points of the local property tax was supposedly that there would be more money for local government. That has not happened. Local government resources have been reduced along with its ability to provide services and so on. Funding from central Government has been reduced by another 13% in this budget.That is in line with Fine Gael policy on housing and the whole thrust of this budget. It is about giving more money to private landlords in the form of the housing assistance payment, the local infrastructure housing activation fund and the rental accommodation scheme etc. We are having quibbles about how much social housing is being delivered but the figures being quoted by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, include those units built to satisfy Part V rules. They are built by the private sector before being sold to or, more often, leased to local authorities at an astronomical price, which again benefits cuckoo funds. At a development called Cualanor in my area, approximately five full apartment blocks have been sold en bloc - with hundreds of units in each block - to vulture funds in the past year or so. I made a point of saying this to a Minister at Leaders' Questions one day. Many of these apartments are now occupied with housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies. These cuckoo funds are also benefiting from big section 110 tax breaks. If they invest in Irish property for a certain amount of time, they do not pay tax on the rental income or capital gains being made while the value of a property goes through the roof. In a triple whammy, the properties are leased from those companies by local authorities at an astronomical price.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is where all the extra money being crowed about by the Minister of State is going. The number of real council houses being built is abysmal and everything else is money going out the door into the pockets of NAMA developers that have been rehabilitated, vulture and cuckoo funds and big corporate landlords. They are making a killing. This budget has nothing about rents. What has been done to control the out-of-control rents? Nothing. The Government refuses to do it. It has refused to impose rent controls, which are a standard practice all across Europe, with local authorities or rental sector regulators setting rents at affordable levels. It means landlords cannot charge more than a certain level for a property. That is how rents can be controlled instead of rent pressure zones that landlords can find their way around in any event. They have completely failed to address the rental crisis. There are many victims of the Government's failed policies but we should single out young people in particular as a group that has been failed at so many levels with this budget. They have been failed on climate change, as the planet is burning and the Government is doing nothing about it. The cost of accommodation is absolutely out of control and completely unaffordable. The cost of educating oneself is beyond reach for many young people. They are being shafted and nothing is being done for them with this budget. What are the positive actions that could have been taken with matters like climate change to protect the future of our young people? Instead of implementing a regressive and unfair carbon tax, the Government could and should have introduced free public transport. It should have brought the level of public subsidy for public transport in this country at least to the average level of the European Union, as we are well below it. Luxembourg has already introduced free public transport and, again, it is hardly a bastion of radical socialism. It is available in Estonia and certain cities in Europe. In almost every part of Europe, public transport fares are far below what they are here. We are an outlier, along with the United Kingdom. Somebody told me recently that a person could go anywhere in a particular eastern European country for approximately 50 cent. I cannot remember the country but it was somewhere like Czechoslovakia. It was dirt cheap compared with here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It may not have been. I may have the country wrong. It was Russia, and it is not a bastion of anything good but at least it can provide cheap public transport. Instead of punishing people with carbon taxes, we should reduce people's fuel bills with a major national insulation installation programme. The current system is grossly unfair for people living in public housing as they cannot retrofit their own home and they must wait for the council to do it. The council is doing approximately 2% of the housing stock per year in my area and I suspect that rate is similar everywhere else. People in public housing have no control whatever over the building energy rating of their home or the capacity to microgenerate electricity. It is completely regressive and unjust to impose carbon tax increases on people like that. The Government could have invested in developing renewable energy and in universities so they could develop new forms of renewable energy. Our universities are chronically underfunded and most of the research and development resourcing from the Government goes to the big multinational corporations through the research and development tax credit. It runs at approximately €700 million per year and it will mostly benefit the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple. That is public money just as much as anything declared today. That €700 million in tax relief, which is mostly used by those types of companies, will not boost the domestic economy or our universities. It will not help to develop renewable energy resources. It goes to Apple when it devises the iPhone 11 upgrade and then an iPhone 12 after that. Is that what we need or do we want money to be put into developing renewable energy or afforestation, which we discussed last week? We are consistently failing to meet our afforestation targets when we know there is a benefit to all these things. For every tree planted, we would pay less in fines to the European Union but we consistently fail to hit our targets in afforestation and in developing a sustainable forestry industry. Disability services should be close to the Minister of State's heart. Various disability groups asked for a package of €211 million extra per year over the next five years for community disability services in particular. In the budget, €25 million has been provided for those services, which is a tenth of what was requested by the disability community. That is pathetic, especially against a background of us ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. Where is the extra investment for universal accessibility? Where is the funding for special needs assessments for people with special needs? It was not mentioned, as far as I can see, in the health section of the budget. The Government is in breach of the law when people are waiting two or three years for assessment of children with special needs. The law stipulates that such assessments should be done within six months. The Government has failed to support people with disability in this country. There is a pathetic amount allocated for housing adaptation grants and there has been no increase in the disability allowance or carer's allowance. That is absolutely shocking and, again, it is effectively a cut for people with a disability. There is an extra €29 million in funding for Tusla, which sounds good for the children and youth affairs sector. However, I have raised the plight of a service in my area, the Cottage Home family support service, which provides vital and needed interventions for families and children at risk. It closed this week because it could not get €200,000. I have raised this case repeatedly with the Minister and the service begged for the money. It will cost the State much more money if those kids and their families do not get that support. They will turn up somewhere else in the system with much greater needs for the lack of €200,000. Even at this point, on behalf of that service, I ask for this funding. It needs €400,000 to keep the service running and it will raise €200,000 itself. Will the Government give €200,000 to the Cottage Home service in order to keep that vital service going? We always speak of early intervention, etc. with children but does it mean anything at all? All the referrals to that service come from Tusla.As it is, in effect, a branch of Tusla, I ask the Government to give it the €200,000 it needs to keep going. What about childcare services? The national childcare scheme was announced in 2016. The Government has announced it every year for four years and it is still not open. That is typical of what the Government does; there are great headlines and statements along the lines of "we are doing this, that and the other". In many cases people are now paying childcare costs equivalent to almost two mortgages, yet the scheme the Government announced four years ago is still not open and when it does open, what people will get will be pretty derisory and certainly not compensate for the dramatic increase in childcare costs that have ensued in the period since the initial announcement of the scheme. It is asked whether it is possible to do all of these things for which the left, the socialists, are asking and whether the money is available. The answer is "Yes" because, against all the threats and difficulties, the reality is that Ireland is richer than it has ever been. National household wealth has increased by €300 million in the past five years. The problem is that all of that wealth is concentrated in the hands of the richest 10% in our society who are getting wealthier and wealthier but pay derisory levels of tax and the big corporations which benefit from a myriad of tax loopholes. The committee on which I sit has been studying these tax loopholes and estimates that there is €10 billion to €15 billion worth of what are called tax expenditures but which are, in fact, tax loopholes to give money back to corporations which then make a lot of profit. If we were to introduce a minimum effective corporate tax rate, we could receive €4 billion, €5 billion or €6 billion extra a year in revenues which we could use for housing, Brexit protection measures, the public health service, children and youth affairs and to meet all other dire needs. We could use it to give workers a little increase in their incomes and a break on USC. We could introduce a financial transactions tax on the billions of euro worth of trading in derivatives and shares through the IFSC every year. However, the parties to such transactions will not accept even a 0.1% tax on that trading, which is what the European Union proposes. We could introduce many other measures in a very wealthy country to redistribute some of the wealth towards the less well-off, working people, the provision of affordable housing, a decent public health service and the just transition to the climate action we need to prevent a climate disaster.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, are we debating Financial Resolution No. 1 only?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the feedback I have got from outside this House, people are saying that this budget gave nothing, or less than nothing, to workers, pensioners, students or social welfare recipients but it hit people with increased prices on cigarettes and a regressive and unfair carbon tax. That is the truth. Punishing people for having an addiction is not the way to reduce smoking. Perhaps giving out free Nicorette patches, or whatever, might be the way to do that. Moving on to the carbon tax, there was another protest outside Leinster House today, as part of rebellion week, which was about a just transition, which is a central pillar of the climate movement. There is nothing just about a carbon tax that hits the pensioner, or the person on a low income who cannot afford to retrofit their home, or who live in a council house and must wait for the council to do it. The budget did not bring in the real climate measures we need but the Government has made another grab at the pockets of ordinary people.
