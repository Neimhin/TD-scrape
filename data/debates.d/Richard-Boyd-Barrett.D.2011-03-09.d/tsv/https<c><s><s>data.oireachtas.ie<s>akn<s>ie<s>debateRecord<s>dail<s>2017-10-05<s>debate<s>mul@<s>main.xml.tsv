RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also extend my sympathies and condolences to Liam Cosgrave's children, to all his extended family and to the Fine Gael Party. Obviously, I did not know Liam Cosgrave personally and his period of political activity predates my own but as somebody who has lived all my life in Dún Laoghaire, one could not but be familiar with his name and indeed the Cosgrave family name, which, for as long as I can remember, was a name that was synonymous with the politics of Dún Laoghaire. Deputy Barrett probably knew Liam Cosgrave well.It is fair to say that my aunt, Janet Kinsella, or Janet Boyd Barrett, who is now deceased, would have been a prominent activist in the Dún Laoghaire Fine Gael branch-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----although I am sure it was in a way that none of them would have particularly approved of. Anybody who lives in Dún Laoghaire has a passionate love for the area, which I believe Liam Cosgrave shared. Notwithstanding our very strong political differences on other things, anybody who has had the privilege to represent Dún Laoghaire would share that. I would not adhere to what I see as the very conservative, Catholic political and social viewpoint of Liam Cosgrave. I am at the other end of the spectrum but, of the little I know about him, what I understood and what rubbed off on me was that, while he might have had a different political view, he had a great belief in public service and that is to be commended, notwithstanding the need for robust disagreement and debate from people at different ends of the political spectrum. There is no doubt that he played a major part in the history and development of this State and I would, therefore, like to pass on my sympathies and condolences to his family and friends.
