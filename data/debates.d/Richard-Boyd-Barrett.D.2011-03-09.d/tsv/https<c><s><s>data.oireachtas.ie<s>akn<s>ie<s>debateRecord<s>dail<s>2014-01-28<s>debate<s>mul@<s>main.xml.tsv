RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People would like to see an inquiry into the banks and to see the main players in the crisis brought into a public arena and questioned. From that point of view, I welcome the idea that this House be involved in attempting to do that. That is part of what we are here for and what democracy is. It involves opening issues of public concern to public scrutiny, for questions to be asked from all points of view and for the public to make its judgment. There is, however, an insoluble problem, and it is the reason for the defeat of the Oireachtas inquiry referendum: such a committee is not capable of making findings of fact. Anybody who knows what the Oireachtas committees are like knows that is the case. How the hell can a political committee made up of different political perspectives, with all the inevitable political manoeuvring and competition that goes on at these committees, seriously come to a finding of fact on the banking crisis when we know that there will be different perspectives, judgments and so on? I am not even sure it is possible to have what one could meaningfully describe as an objective, definitive analysis of the banking crisis. What the Government could do is put the main players up in front of the public, ask them all the questions that people can think of from all the different perspectives and let the public make its judgment. The proceedings can be summarised in a report which people can study and analyse but the Government cannot come up with a definitive position on it. I understand why Fianna Fáil is set against the inquiry. It is afraid that it will be a chance to bash Fianna Fáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The real problem is the question of bias and trying to define it. In his opening remarks Deputy Stagg spoke of the reckless mismanagement of the economy by Fianna Fáil. He followed up by saying we need an objective inquiry. I agree with him that the reckless mismanagement of the economy by Fianna Fáil was a huge contributory factor to the crisis. He has prejudiced himself. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The idea that we can find anybody who will consider this objectively and who does not have a prejudice is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I say that Deputy Stagg was solely and singularly responsible for the entire banking crisis, that I blame him for absolutely everything, no matter what he tells me, no matter what evidence I hear, and hold to the view that it was all Deputy Stagg’s fault, one could call that bias. If I happen to say I think it was Deputy Stagg’s fault but I am interested in hearing the evidence to see whether it was his fault that is not bias, that is opinion. Everybody has an opinion. I am deeply worried by the question of who will decide who is biased and who will exclude them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government will. That is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us face the fact that everybody has an opinion, and perspective. No such opinion or perspective should be excluded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has a wry smile on his face tells its own story. He wants to set this thing up in such a way that it works to the political advantage of the Government. That is the reality. Let us not pretend otherwise. This business of excluding people on the basis of supposed bias has to be taken out of the proposal; otherwise, I cannot accept it. I want the inquiry to take place. I do not really understand why we have a different system for choosing the chairperson from the one we normally use. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is the appropriate committee to inquire into banking. That is what it does. If it puts forward a proposal to do so and we consider it acceptable that the committee examines areas connected with finance and banking all the time, why the hell do we have to have a special procedure? In this case it may turn out to be the same person, which is sort of immaterial. I do not quite understand why there is a different procedure except that I smell a certain political rat at work as people try to manipulate things.
