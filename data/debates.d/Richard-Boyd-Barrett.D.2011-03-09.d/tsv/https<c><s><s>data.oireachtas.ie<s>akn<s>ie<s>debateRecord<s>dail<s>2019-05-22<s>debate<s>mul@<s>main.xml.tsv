RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I noted the Taoiseach's response on the issue raised by Deputy McDonald, which I raised last week, concerning the Bartra Capital Property Group's plan for 200 boxes with fold-out beds in Dún Laoghaire. Today is the last day for submissions. Given the Taoiseach's response, I suggest that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government make a submission to An Bord Pleanála saying that this development would be completely out of order and is an abuse of the strategic housing development, SHD, process. That is a direct appeal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The unscrupulousness of property speculators in Dún Laoghaire seems to know no bounds. The latest ruse, which I would also ask the Minister to examine, sees property agents in the Cualanor and Honeypark developments, which were in NAMA before being sold to vulture funds and so on, using a very obscure calculation of people's income in order to rule out housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants. Even when the council has said that, in respect of two cases that I have received, the incomes of the HAP tenants, who are working, are sufficient to be able to rent these properties, the property agents are doing another obscure calculation in order to make an excuse for telling the tenants that they cannot rent the properties to them. The real reason is because they are in receipt of HAP. As a matter of urgency, will the Minister examine this issue as well?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an abuse of the system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Infrastructure is necessary for the proper functioning of our society but the Taoiseach and Cabinet committee D have failed in this elementary task. They have failed on housing, the children's hospital, broadband and the provision of schools. As a follow-up to the question I posed yesterday on Dún Laoghaire Educate Together, what does the Taoiseach have to say about the fact that more than €100 million is being spent on prefabricated classrooms? In many cases, students and teachers are in such classrooms for years and years. Specifically with regard to Dún Laoghaire Educate Together, the Taoiseach said that a site would be identified by the end of quarter 3. When that site is identified, will money be made available immediately so that the school community is not waiting, like many others, for a decade or more for the physical buildings to be placed on site in order to get them out of the completely unsuitable and inappropriate prefabs that they and many others have to put up with? On the question of social housing, I will put a very particular point to the Taoiseach. His objective is to achieve social mix and deliver social housing through 10% of private developments being reserved for such under Part V. In light of this, does he think it is acceptable that developers are building that 10%, the social housing element, of their developments to lower specifications than those of the other apartments in the same development? This is what we discovered happening in a major development in Dún Laoghaire called Cualanor. The buildings look the very same on the outside but, when one goes inside, one finds that the specifications are dramatically worse. Soundproofing, the quality of finish, the quality of the kitchens, and the layout of the buildings are to a lower specification. So much for social mix and integration. Does the Taoiseach approve of that? If he does not, what is he going to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Taoiseach and Deputy Micheál Martin in all seriousness that President Trump is a threat to our national security and global security. Any sane and sensible person would say that is true. He is brazen in his attempts to sabotage efforts to deal with climate change. He is brazen in his campaign to arm brutal dictatorships like the Saudi regime. He is brazen in legitimising the illegal annexation of territory which belongs to the Palestinians in Jerusalem and land that belongs to Syria in the Golan Heights. The list of Israel's crimes goes on. Is it not the case that at every level President Trump is a danger to the world? Is it not simply giving licence and legitimacy to his toxic politics which encourages the growth of the far right across the world? Is the Taoiseach not concerned that elements sympathetic to that far right agenda in Ireland and to President Trump will be emboldened by his visit? If the Taoiseach cannot see that, he is not being honest in looking at the impact of President Trump globally. I protested outside the Russian embassy when the Russians were engaged in bombing the hell out of Chechnya, and I did not see Deputy Micheál Martin there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So have I. Please do not have backhanded or dishonest-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Similarly, I would be very critical of the measures taken by the regime in Venezuela. That does not mean I think President Trump and the US military are part of any solution-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to dealing with the problems that exist in Venezuela. It is up to the Venezuelan people to sort out the crisis in Venezuela and not President Trump and the US military.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If this House has any purpose at all - I suspect the public sometimes wonders whether it does - it is to see crises coming down the line and act to prevent them. This month in 2013, at a meeting of the finance committee, I suggested to representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Government that the moves to bring large global property investors into Ireland pursued by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, would very likely lead to the return of the boom–bust cycle in property and to more property bubbles. The council and the Minister dismissed this as very unlikely at the time. Yesterday, the OECD, which is not a left-wing think tank, confirmed that bringing in those investors has recreated the conditions for the property bubble that we warned about six years ago at that meeting. What does the Taoiseach think about that warning? Does he believe the Government might put up its hands and say it may have made a mistake and that inviting the investors in may not have been the best idea, that the investors may not have assisted in having a sustainable housing sector, and that they may be, as the OECD is suggesting, contributing to the housing crisis and the unaffordability of housing, which is now an economic problem? It is not just a social crisis; it is now an economic problem and an existential threat to our economy in terms of our not being able to house our workers. We do not have anywhere to house the additional workers we need. A large number of people, never mind those rotting on housing lists and those whose incomes are just above the threshold under which they must be to get on a housing list, are totally lost. Their rents are more than the repayments on an extremely high mortgage, and getting a mortgage is completely impossible. As the OECD pointed out, the only way out of this is credit, which would be dangerous. We are in a complete cul-de-sac. The only way that cul-de-sac can be unblocked is if the State intervenes heavily in the housing sector to provide not-for-profit housing that individuals can afford.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not calling for more credit.
