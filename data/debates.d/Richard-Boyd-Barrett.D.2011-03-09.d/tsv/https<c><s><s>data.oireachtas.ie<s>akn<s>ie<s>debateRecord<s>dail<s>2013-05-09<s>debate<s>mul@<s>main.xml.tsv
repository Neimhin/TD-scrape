RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for her reply but it is disappointing. I find many of the cuts that are being imposed as part of the Minister’s austerity regime cruelly unjust and senseless. There are few cuts, however, that could be more unjust and senseless than the cutting of funding to youth community services for some of the most vulnerable young people. The reason I have raised this issue is because those young people affected from Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Dublin’s north-west inner city, Finglas, Coolock and Darndale were protesting outside the Dáil last week. They put it simply that if these cuts go ahead, in many cases they will be forced out on to the streets with nothing to do. It will lead to more confrontation with the police, more temptation to get involved in drugs, drinking and, ultimately, it will cost them, in terms of their lives, and the State to pick up the pieces afterwards. These cuts are utterly counterproductive. It is particularly regressive when one considers Ireland has more young people at risk than any other EU member state. Up to 37% of our young people are at risk as against the European average of 27%. These cuts will disproportionately hit young people who are in no way responsible for the crimes that led to the economic and financial crisis. I am appealing to the Minister on their behalf to reverse these cuts and find the moneys elsewhere. These cuts make no sense and are cruelly unjust. There can be no justification or time to soften up the real impact of these cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister referred to projects which took small cuts, a point acknowledged by some of those on the protest, but others have taken 10% cuts. Some were initially looking at a 14% cut to funding. All the organisations involved said that any cuts against a background where we have a disproportionate number of young people at risk will have an enormous impact. No cuts are acceptable in a situation where more young people in this country are at risk than in any other European country and where more young people are being hit as a result of the impact of the recession. These young people must be protected. Whatever else the Government may think it has to do to pay off the debts of bankers, these cuts are cruelly unjust and will have a disproportionate effect, as well as costing the State more in the long term. The Youth Council of Ireland report suggested that for every €1 invested in youth services, the State will save €2.20. In other words, the Minister’s cuts will double the cost for the State. They do not even make sense from a book-balancing point of view. Whatever else the Government may think it should do, these cuts are regressive and should be reversed.
