RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Irish Film Workers Association and the GMB for further educating me about the nature of the industry. For many people, it is an industry that is about the glamorous stuff. It is a very important step forward that the people behind the scenes, who do critical work but are rarely seen, get a chance to speak up about their situation. The picture they paint, as I said at the last committee, is a fairly bleak one in terms of the treatment of workers in the industry. I will ask a few questions to allow the witnesses to elaborate on some of the points they have made. From our point of view as a committee, some of the allegations the witnesses are making are very serious and I would have thought we, as a committee and as Members of the Oireachtas, have a serious responsibility to look into them. If I understand Mr. Arkins, he is saying there is an illegal agreement in place currently in the film industry, which is an agreement between some unions and Screen Producers Ireland that sets down conditions of employment and hours of employment that are illegal. Is that correct? Obviously, if that is correct, it would be very serious indeed and we would have a responsibility as a committee. Mr. Arkins has obviously spelled out that this is the case but I would like him to confirm and underline that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What Mr. Arkins is saying is quite technical but, to summarise it in language we can understand, according to Mr. Arkins, specifying hours of between 55 and 66 hours as normal working time directly breaches the working time legislation. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for interrupting Mr. Arkins but I will run out of time if I do not do so. I want to touch on a few other things. In very simple terms, he says this agreement breaches the law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very serious matter into which this committee has a responsibility to look. The issue of bogus self-employment and people being employed as contractors rather than direct PAYE employees is widespread in the construction industry as well. Is it the case - it is certainly the case in the construction industry - that if people in the film industry ask for PAYE employment, they are told they will not get the job and, in some cases, are blacklisted for asking for direct employment? Is there a similar picture in the film industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, it is something for the committee to bear in mind. Perhaps Mr. Arkins or Ms Walker or some of the others would know about this practice in the construction industry. One of the ways in which those of us in the Opposition have been raising bogus self-employment, and quite a few of us have been doing so, is to ensure that Revenue is checking whether people meet the criteria, particularly in cases where people may be being bullied into declaring themselves self-employed out of fear that they will not get work unless they do so. However, there are objective criteria as to what a contractor is as against what an employee is. There are certain requirements, such as a premises. There are a series of requirements. I will not go through them now - in fact, I do not have the list with me - but one is supposed to meet a set of objective criteria. Where we have indicated in the Dáil or got word about particular building sites on which people are being misclassified as self-employed, raids on those sites by the Scope section or Revenue have quite easily ascertained whether or not people were legitimately self-employed or whether they should in fact have been categorised as PAYE employees. Does Mr. Arkins believe Revenue and the various other bodies should be checking this and seeing whether people meet the criteria? Would that begin to start to address the matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is up. Can we have a second round of questioning?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are a couple of issues that have been alluded to. It is probably important to spell them out here. How many people are actually employed in the industry? Is ask this in light of the tax arrangements relating to the industry and the more than €70 million in grants from which it benefits? Either Screen Producers Ireland or the Irish Film Board, I cannot remember which, referred to 17,000 full-time equivalent employees. The witnesses are suggesting that the number employed in the industry is actually a fraction of that and that those people essentially have no recognition of their employment. They have no continuity of employment. In many cases, there is no recognition of their qualifications as a result of the abuse of the trainee category. I was very struck when I met some of the workers to whom Mr. Ward and Mr. Neville introduced me. There were people who had worked in the industry for a long time - 30 or 40 years - but despite that long service, they had no pension entitlements whatsoever. Indeed, on foot of their lack of proper employment status, they were working well into their 70s when they would rather be retired.Would the witnesses like to comment on that issue? How many people are actually employed in the industry, and what does their career look like, where those issues are concerned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is my last question. Obviously, the issue of the law applying to the witnesses is a no-brainer. Our responsibility is to make sure that happens, and any money that comes from the State should be conditional, at a minimum, on the application of the law where workers' entitlements are concerned. That is critical. At the level of oversight of the industry, and worker participation in it, what would the witnesses recommend? Would they propose representation of the workers and of the different grades on the Irish Film Board? How many representatives would be appropriate? How would the witnesses envisage the industry being properly monitored, and genuine diversity of the different stakeholders being represented?
