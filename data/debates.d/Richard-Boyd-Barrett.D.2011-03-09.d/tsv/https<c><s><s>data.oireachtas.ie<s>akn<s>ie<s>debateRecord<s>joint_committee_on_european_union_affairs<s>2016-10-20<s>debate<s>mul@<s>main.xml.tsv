RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will. Is it not a fact that the European Union is now facing an existential crisis of its own making and that the deep alienation felt by millions of citizens across Europe, which is growing, is due to the European Union's failures on a range of fronts? The most obvious one is the role the European Union played as austerity boot boy for the financial sector which was responsible, with the assistance of the European Central Bank and not without the active collusion of the political establishment and property developers here, for creating bubbles in this country. The European Central Bank, through its interest rate policy and then in its response to the crisis by essentially protecting the banks and the finance industry, inflicted cruel and unjust austerity, by any standards, on people who bore no responsibility for that crisis, be they in Greece, and the things done to the Greek people are beyond obscene, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and so forth. That is one of the primary reasons the alienation in the European Union is so intense. One instance of that, which the Commissioner has intimate knowledge of, is the issue of water charges. I hear members of this committee yet again stating that we must stand up for Ireland's right to set its own corporation tax rates, but when the European Union wants to bully us in a particular direction on water charges and our right to decide democratically how we pay for water services, suddenly the voices for democracy from certain quarters over here go silent. I put it to the Commissioner that if Europe engages in boot boy or bully boy tactics when there is a clear democratic mandate in the House to get rid of water charges it is making a deep mistake that it will rue.It will increase alienation. I cannot understand the Commission's view about the established practice when it comes to water charges. There is a big legalistic dispute-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Commissioner tell us how on earth the EU can construe that charging for water is supposedly "established practice" when it is clear that when the water framework directive was introduced, established practice here was to pay for water through central taxation and not through user charges? By no stretch of the imagination could anyone conclude that it has since become established practice because nobody is paying the charges and the electorate made its view very clear in the most recent election. If the Commission fails to grasp that, is it not deepening the democratic deficit that is growing between citizens and the EU? My next question concerns fortress Europe and foreign policy generally. Again, I hear the one-sided and partial criticism from voices here and throughout the EU of what is undoubtedly the appalling behaviour of Russia in Ukraine and Syria, where its actions in Aleppo in supporting the Assad regime are beyond disgusting. However, are member states of the EU and, in the case of Ukraine, Europe itself not responsible as well for interfering in that country and, essentially, reigniting the Cold War with Russia by having ambitions in eastern bloc countries? Members such as France, the UK, Denmark and others, including its big ally, the US, are also responsible for bombing Syria and killing innocent civilians, have been involved in staggering levels of arms sales to regimes like the Saudi regime and continue to treat with the Egyptian regime, which tramples on human rights on its country, and say nothing about that.  Is it not an appalling vista for the EU, which claims to be an attempt to ensure that we do not have a return to the horrors of the 1930s, to have concentration camps with razor wire and barbed wire surrounding them penning in the most desperate and vulnerable people at Calais and on the Greek islands? There is no other word for them. They are concentration camps. When one thinks about the numbers the EU has talked about accepting - 160,000 people - in light of the millions displaced in Jordan or its attempts at outsourcing the issue to a Turkish regime the human rights record of which is beyond disgusting in terms of its treatment of its own people, one must ask whether it is developments of this type that have led to the deep and growing disillusionment with and alienation from the EU?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is an EU Commissioner who is talking about water charges-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and legal action if we get rid of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was perfectly respectful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not more dramatic than concentration camps that are full-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said it was a concentration camp.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it a concentration camp?
