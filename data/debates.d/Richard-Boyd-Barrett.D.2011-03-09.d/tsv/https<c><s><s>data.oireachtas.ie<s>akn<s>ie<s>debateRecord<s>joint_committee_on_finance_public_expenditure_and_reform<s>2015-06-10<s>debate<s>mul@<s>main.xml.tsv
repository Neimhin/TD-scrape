The principle is reasonable. Banking systems can collapse in big as well as small countries. In the event of a banking collapse in Germany, could Irish banks be put in a very difficult position as a consequence? If the fund were to be used up entirely to prop up banks in a big country, the money would have to be replenished, an extra call would have to be made on the banks here and, consequently, the costs would somehow find their way back to the customers of these banks. Is that correct? Such a situation would be far more difficult for us than the other way around because big countries could absorb this better than relatively small ones with relatively small banking systems.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand Mr. Carrigan's response. Is there any end to how much we would have to put in to replenish the fund if there was a systemic collapse, if the banks here were dragged down by a big collapse elsewhere in Europe? Would we have to keep pumping money in?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was going to ask about the bail-in. Will Mr. Carrigan answer my question directly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From where will the backstop come?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Theoretically, there could be no end to how much by which we would have to replenish the fund if the cost of the collapse in a particular part of the banking system was to far exceed the size of the fund and any bail-ins that preceded it. Potentially, we could have to keep replenishing the fund. Am I right? Mr. Carrigan might say that is unlikely to happen and that it tends to be the smaller banks that go bust, but I want to know if it is a possibility. I do not think a very big banking collapse is impossible to imagine. Is it possible that the money we put in is exhausted quickly and we are being asked for more and more? Is there any end to how much we might be asked to put in if the draw on the fund was big enough?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the order of the bail-in and the conditions around it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can protected people under â‚¬100,000 be bailed in before this mechanism kicks in?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who has to pay into the resolution fund here? Obviously, the pillar banks will pay, but will the credit unions or the English banks with subsidiaries here have to pay?
