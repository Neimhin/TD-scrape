RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not really get the Minister's reasons for not adopting Article 12. I know Christian Aid, among others, is very unhappy that the Minister is not doing so. I cannot remember all of the detail but broadly speaking, its concerns are that, if adopted, this measure would tackle some of the disadvantages that developing countries face relating to profit shifting and base erosion; that our failure to do so hurts developing countries because profits that should be booked in these countries are not booked because of profit shifting manoeuvres by multinationals; that this measure is an effort to address that; and the fact that Ireland and others are not willing to adopt Article 12 is because we do not want to do anything about this unfairness. Could the Minister explain his reasons?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As an absolute minimum we need this report. The profits and revenues being generated by these IT companies are absolutely staggering and they are not properly taxed. These companies are leading the charge on aggressive tax avoidance and we must find a way for them to pay their fair share. In the Minister's comments on this yesterday, he stated he is concerned that if fewer profits were made because of the imposition of a digital tax on sales that may happen elsewhere in Europe it would mean fewer profits declared here and less tax revenue. There may be some discussion about what type of digital tax would be applied and how it would be fair and would not overly disadvantage a country such as Ireland, but the general principle that these people should be taxed to a far greater degree than they are is, to me, a no-brainer. It has to happen, it will happen and it is right that it should happen. We need at the very least to start to have a detailed debate about it. The proposal for a report in these amendments is entirely appropriate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 161:In page 142, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:
“Report on tax revenue forgone
60. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the actual or estimated tax revenue forgone, specifically in the area of property investment, as a result of section 110 tax relief on such investments, dating back to investments made since 2012 up to the present and in any future year where the benefit of this tax relief might still accrue.”.I brought up this issue on Second Stage and have spoken about it quite a few times, as have others. I am sure the Minister is familiar with the concern raised in the amendment about section 110 tax relief which I see as a national scandal in that foreign companies essentially came here to speculate on Irish property having been invited by the Minister's predecessor in 2013.A total of 65 meetings were held by the Minister and officials with Cerberus, Apollo Global Management, Lone Star, Kennedy Wilson, all those guys who came as bottom feeders to cash in in a distressed property market and who were actively courted by the previous Government to do so. They availed of a tax break, which means that if they maintain their investment for a few years, they will not pay tax on rental income or capital gains, which is quite extraordinary. If people really understood what was going on, they would be shocked. What happens is that, apparently, small items in Finance Bills pass a lot of people by because they do not understand what is going on. For that reason, it is important to shine a light on the issue. When one considers by how much rents have increased since those guys bought into the Irish property market and by how much property prices have increased, the value of their investments has gone through the roof. That is the other side of the coin in dealing with the housing and homelessness crisis that such entities are making obscene profits and will walk away without paying almost any tax. That is something about which they boast when they produce their annual accounts. Every year they record bigger profits than in the previous year and pay negligible amounts of tax which, to my mind, is shameful. It is equally shameful that when the Minister is asked parliamentary questions by me and others about how much tax is forgone through this tax relief, we cannot get answers, which is beyond extraordinary. We need a detailed report. We need to know how much tax revenue is being forgone to the benefit of the property speculators who have come into the country to profiteer on the back of the housing crisis. Over and above what is in the amendment, even at this stage, given what has happened in the property market and the extraordinary profits being made by the people concerned, any Government interested in fair taxation and generating revenues to perhaps be put into areas such as public housing would be looking at how we could increase the tax paid by such entities and put the revenue into public housing and other areas to address the housing crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A little bit like the debate that we had on intangible assets, the changes that were introduced do not deal with the window that was opened through which those speculative entities jumped. They were effectively invited in by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Department in the meetings which were held. I think there was an understanding that if they came here and bought into Irish property that they would pay very little tax. The logic at the time, which was fairly explicitly expressed by the then Minister, was that we needed to reflate the Irish property market. I think he argued at the time that it would professionalise the rental sector because we would have corporate entities as opposed to the small-scale landlord. We were going to bring in the big guys. It has self-evidently been a disaster. It has not done anything to make the rental sector better. It has done a hell of a lot to make it worse. The Minister said in his response that if we did not have this relief certain activities might not have happened. Yes, exactly. I am sorry those activities did happen. It is a matter of extreme regret that we brought such entities in here to gain such an important foothold in the Irish property sector.It is obscene that those who benefited from the window that was opened in terms of section 110, even if it was closed subsequently, will continue to benefit from it and will walk away paying little or no tax on their investments. I do not understand why Revenue cannot estimate how much tax is foregone. When one looks at what has happened to the property market, the value of the investments that these persons made has gone through the roof. The Irish property market, including the rental market, is generating staggering profits. We know from the announcements of annual profits that they are going up and the companies in question are paying pitiful amounts of tax. It is a scandal. I do not see how it could be justified at any level. There was something the Minister did not answer in his response. If we were to debate what was done in the past, why it was done and whether it was good or bad, it would be self-evident given where all of this has led that the Government made a bad and disastrous mistake. One does not have to be a tax expert or a financial whizz-kid to conclude that those who invested in property are making a fortune because it is obvious. When one considers the 60% or 70% increase in the value of those investments and similar increases in rents, one would expect the Government to think of some way, perhaps through a levy or tax, of clawing back some of the money these companies have made on the back of a dysfunctional property sector. This could be used to deal with the costs of the housing crisis that their activities helped to generate. Given the housing crisis and the direction in which the property sector has gone in recent years, would that not be a fair and reasonable course of action?
