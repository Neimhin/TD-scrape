RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. Will the new strategy statement acknowledge the disastrous failure of the housing strategy pursued during the past six years? That is not a rhetorical use of the word "disastrous". It is a self-evident fact that the strategy that has been pursued has failed to an extraordinary level. It has resulted in almost 3,000 people being homeless and 7,000 people in total, an enormous number, rotting on housing lists for close to two decades, in some cases, and there is no sign of any of this improving. It would be refreshing for anybody in politics and certainly for a Government to acknowledge a mistake, to say we got it wrong and that we need to radically shift focus and strategy in this area and, in particular, to recognise that the plan to lure in real estate investment trusts, vulture funds, property speculators and developers, through various incentives and tax breaks, has been an utter failure. I do not think we will ever grasp the extent to which it has been a failure in terms of the taxes forgone, but there can be little doubt of the enormous amount of money that has been made by those people. If we consider the results in terms of housing delivery, there was a 0.4% increase in the quantum of housing during those years and the situation has been disastrous in terms of housing and the homelessness. Will there be a recognition of that in the strategy statement and a consideration of a radical shift in strategy towards public provision of housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the Taoiseach's predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, a question that gained a lot of publicity at the time. I asked if he thought the election manifesto and policy promises of Donald Trump were racist and dangerous and he agreed that they were. I ask the Taoiseach the same question now that Donald Trump is President. Are the policies he is pursuing racist and dangerous? If the answer is yes, will the Taoiseach state this clearly and publicly and what it means for the stance we adopt vis-à-vis those policies and his Administration? The Taoiseach has said he does not agree with the travel ban. Is it racist to impose a travel ban on people from six particular countries, tarring all people from these countries who happen to be Muslims as somehow being undesirable to enter the United States? On the dangerous front, does the Taoiseach recognise that the policies being pursued by Donald Trump, particularly in the Middle East, of massively increasing arms sales to Saudi Arabia, supporting that brutal dictatorship and arming it to assist it in its vile actions in Yemen, the dangerous escalation of the conflict with Qatar which is also an escalation of the conflict with Iran, have dangerous implications for stability and peace in the region? Does the Taoiseach recognise that this is dangerous and that the President's talk at the the beginning of the year about sending an armada to North Korea was also a dangerous escalation? Notwithstanding the horrific nature of that regime and what it has done in the last few days, does the Taoiseach recognise that Donald Trump's policies are dangerous and racist and that something must be said about them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Repeat it now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is more important.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should not separate it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is much speculation on the mystery of why income tax returns are coming in lower than projected. I put it to the Minister that the reason for this is because of the extent of precarious work, low-paid work and, something that has not been mentioned enough in this regard, bogus self-employment, particularly in the construction industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nonetheless, €214 million is a significant shortfall, with €51 million of that from income tax. I particularly want to concentrate on the issue of precarious working conditions and, specifically bogus self-employment. There are now approximately 140,000 people working in construction. There is talk about how construction work is gathering momentum. I got another call in a series of phone calls I have had over recent years from building workers about the regeneration of Dolphin House and Fatima Mansions. Purcell Construction is the main developer down there. Rapid Developments is the bricklaying subcontractor. This is a firm that has had a lot of State contracts. It built St. Patrick's College in Maynooth and there were similar issues there. It is very similar to Rhatigans in that it has men taken on seven or eight weeks beforehand who are employed on PAYE but have not heard a word from Revenue. When they telephone Revenue to ask if they are in the system, Revenue states that it has not heard a thing about it. This is still rampant in the construction sector. If it was done properly and if they were on PAYE, the State would be getting very significant extra income tax revenues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 220,000 to 230,000 people who are classified as self-employed with no paid employees. I put it to the Minister, as construction workers and others in this House have been putting it to him for a long time, that the reason for that, particularly in construction, is bogus self-employment. One of the workers I mentioned is a labourer. When he telephoned Revenue to ask if he was down on the PAYE system, because his employer said he was taken on as a PAYE worker, he was told that he had probably been classified as self-employed. He is a labourer. How could he be self-employed? It is ridiculous. This is rampant in construction. From a tax point of view, if we look at 2008, for example, when there were 126,000 self-employed relevant contracts tax, RCT, workers, there was a minus figure in tax revenue of €67 million. This tax head loses money in many cases or gives no tax revenue compared to similar numbers of PAYE workers who brought in €700 million in tax revenue in that year. Is the same thing going on now? Is the Minister looking into it seriously to investigate these kinds of abuses?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not for the first time, it was reported in the newspapers at the weekend in respect of REITS and vulture funds, which are co-investors with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which is the State investment fund, and which are involved in real estate and the SME sector, that two of them, Cardinal Capital and BlueBay, paid €250 in tax each in 2015. Does the Minister not think this is a scandalous indication of tax evasion by a very profitable sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the central justifications for these extraordinary tax breaks for REITs and vulture funds - the section 110 structure allowing these companies to benefit from it and the REIT tax breaks introduced by various Finance Acts - was encouraging investment in property in Ireland and resuscitating the property sector, presumably to do something basic like provide housing for people. To this day, the Government cannot even tell us how much tax has been forgone via section 110 and will still be forgone in terms of capital gains and rental income under these schemes. Incredibly, ISIF is working with these people who have sucked vast amounts of profits out of the country. What has it delivered in terms of housing? It has delivered nothing. In all of the years in which these things have been in operation, according to the CSO, we have had a 0.4% increase in housing stock and, of course, a disastrous situation in social housing. Can the Minister tell us how many billions we have wasted in forgone tax revenue to get that failed result in terms of a thoroughly dysfunctional housing sector, which is dysfunctional precisely because the Government gave them tax breaks instead of using the State's resources to invest in social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It amazes that the Minister does not acknowledge the scale of the damage and distortion the movement of these funds into the property market has caused. I ask him to tell us, although I know that he will not, how much tax has been forgone as a result of section 110 and the REIT tax breaks. We can never get an answer to that question. They are still benefiting from them and, as we know, they just sat on properties and jacked up rents, worsening the housing crisis. I even logged onto PricewaterhouseCoopers' website today to see what it had to say about section 110. It is boasting, stating one should invest here because one would not have to pay any tax. "Tax neutral" is the wording used and what is being touted by these accountancy firms. They state people should get involved in the property market in Ireland because one would not have to pay any tax, there will be flexible and favourable domestic tax law reliefs and that Ireland allows for neutral treatment of corporation tax, provided certain conditions are met, blah, blah, blah. The Minister shows no interest in looking at this scandal, given what has been done to the property market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the accountancy firms.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like Deputy Barry and many others who have spoken or commented on this Bill, I believe we would all welcome a globally important sporting event such as the Rugby World Cup to the country for a range of reasons. Obviously, significant numbers of people in this country appreciate the sport and many people play and love the sport. There also will be potentially a significant economic benefit to the State in terms of the event being hosted here. Arguably, the international attention the country would receive as a result of hosting an event like this would be beneficial. All of those are reasons to be supportive of the bid and of the Government supporting the bid. However, I also have concerns about this issue. Given the speed with which this has been pushed through, I have not had enough time to even fully go through in my mind what are all the potential downsides, dangers and problems we need to look out for. It is important to flag some of them and as has already been noted, to push all this through in one night, as it looks as though will happen, is problematic in that regard. Crucially, we need to be sure that with State funding going into this, we come out on the plus side. That means having financial projections, budgets, costings, etc., in order that we can look at the financial arithmetic of it all if it comes to pass and be fairly confident that there will be a net benefit. Unfortunately, I did not hear the Minister's speech. I am scanning through it. No doubt he alluded to the potential benefits. In particular, he refers to the 450,000 high-spending visitors. I have heard figures, such as €1.2 billion, floating around. The Minister, Deputy Ross, might indicate whether that is the figure that is floating around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the estimate referring to expenditure by people who would come to visit. That is obviously significant and would generate employment, spin-off activity and tax revenue. I note in passing, because it is relevant, that we need to look again at the 9% VAT rate. The rate was brought in because the economy was on its knees. There was an argument about the need to resuscitate tourism, retail and so on when those sectors were on their knees. Those sectors have picked up significantly. I believe they have gained significantly from an economic recovery that, to say the least of it, is uneven in terms of who has benefited. In fact, many people are not benefiting. One group that is not benefiting is made up of low-paid, precarious, zero-hour or banded-hour contract workers. Many of these work in the hospitality, hotel, retail and bar sectors. Yet those sectors have benefited and gained a significant boon from the 9% VAT rate. I believe the case for that VAT rate has expired. I do not believe they need that boon anymore. At the least, it needs to be examined. I am keen to see that considered when we are thinking about who would benefit from the additional expenditure in the context of the Rugby World Cup taking place. It is one thing to say that the State may get back revenue. However, I believe we must be absolutely certain that the State covers its investment from various sources - primarily, I would have thought this will come from areas like VAT – and that we would expect to cover any investment we put in or perhaps make a profit for the State out of it. I believe we should look at the issue of VAT. More generally, we need to be confident that we have a plan to recover any public moneys invested in this event. I do not believe it would be acceptable, although I do not believe we are in danger of it, to repeat some of the scandals we have seen in big sporting bids in some countries, whereby billions were put into projects that, after the events were concluded, were effectively massive white elephants. Such projects included stadia and infrastructure built but never to be used again by anyone. When I was first asked about this six or eight months ago, the first thing I said was that if we are talking about building stadia then I would be against it, as much as I would like to see a sporting event. We are not talking about that, which I welcome. Therefore, we can be more confident that this event can work and not cost us. However, I would like to see and hear as much detail as possible about how the public interest and public moneys and so on are going to be managed and secured such that we do not lose out as a result. I wish to echo the points made about free-to-air television viewing. That is critical. There would be rage, frankly, if public money was spent underwriting and supporting this bid only for a position to come about whereby not everyone was able to watch the tournament on television. There would be absolute anger. I warn the Government not to cause a problem for itself and everyone else and to ensure that does not happen. Otherwise, the Government will endure a backlash. The point about ticket prices is critical. We need to ensure this is an event for everyone and not simply for an elite few. Rugby is not as it is sometimes presented, that is, purely an elitist sport. People from a vast cross-section of Irish society play rugby and they come from all different social backgrounds. However, let us be quite honest. Historically, there has also been in the Dublin and Leinster regions in particular an association with the more privileged sections of society. To some extent that has reflected the reality of the game in certain parts of the country. It is different in other parts of the country but we need to acknowledge this is a fact. Consequently, it will grate badly with people if we do not ensure that this event benefits everyone, that everyone is included, that everyone has an opportunity to go and that no one is prohibited because of the cost of so doing. We need to ensure that the benefits accruing to rugby and the rugby bodies and any benefits that accrue to the State go back into disadvantaged areas to enhance access to sport, rugby and so on. The benefits should go to clubs that perhaps are not part of the elite of the rugby world. They should go to the grassroots game and not only to what might be perceived as the more elite elements of the game. These are critical matters and we need more detail from the Government about how all of this will be managed. We need to be sure that some of the more concerning outcomes – I am not saying they will transpire but they could and have done in other countries – do not transpire in the context of this bid. I am broadly supportive and will not oppose the Bill. I support some of the amendments put forward by Deputy Eamon Ryan. I am keen to hear the Minister's response to those issues and the other issues of concern that have been raised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a difficult argument to sustain.
