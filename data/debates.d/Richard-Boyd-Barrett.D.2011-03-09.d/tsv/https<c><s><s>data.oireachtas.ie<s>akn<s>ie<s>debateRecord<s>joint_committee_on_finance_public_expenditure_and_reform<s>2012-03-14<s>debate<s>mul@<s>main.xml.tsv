RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the representatives of NAMA.  This session has been very enlightening and we have gathered much useful information in trying to understand more of what is going on in NAMA.  There is still frustration at the lack of transparency and our inability to get detailed information about what is going on in particular cases within NAMA.  The witnesses seem to be saying that NAMA's inability to be, if one likes, more transparent in the way some of us would like, relates to the fact that it is competing with the commercial banks, which poses a difficulty for NAMA.  Is that not a fundamental flaw with the concept of NAMA, which would logically lead one to think we should not have NAMA but should have a nationalised banking sector?Given that both NAMA and most of the banks are financed by the State with the State as a majority shareholder in those banks, why do we need these two entities competing against each other with the consequence that we cannot have the same level of transparency and scrutiny of NAMA's activities and its decisions on the assets of which it might dispose as we would have with fully publicly-owned assets as is the case, for example, with the State enterprises that are up for consideration for sale at the moment?  While that is not NAMA's call - it needs to do what it is mandated to do - is that not the logical conclusion one would draw about that difficulty?  If we did not have these competing entities, all of which are essentially underwritten and financed by the public, we would not have that problem and would have more transparency and oversight.I believe Mr. McDonagh indicated NAMA generated €6.6 billion in revenues and this year will incur just under €200 million in operating costs.  I do not know what last year's operating costs were, but let us assume they were similar.  This means approximately €400 million in operating costs.  Some €1.1 billion has gone out in working capital development costs.  Would it be true to say that of the €31 billion NAMA is mandated to recover as a minimum, it has got €5 billion after operating costs are taken out?  As the witnesses have indicated, that €5 billion would represent the easiest pickings in terms of getting money back on the loans and assets it has taken over.  Mr. McDonagh has indicated that most of the money NAMA has got back has come from the UK where conditions are obviously far more favourable for generating revenue from sales.  That would lead one to be very pessimistic about NAMA's assets and loans in this country.  If 80% is coming from the UK, would it be fair to say we are doing extremely badly in Ireland?  I believe Mr. McDonagh indicated that €11 billion out of the €18 billion of assets and loans are in Dublin, which indicates we are doing extremely badly.Given that, from where does the confidence come that NAMA will reach the €31 billion target?  Most of its success to date is in the UK and is mostly the easy pickings.  The property market in this country is in the doldrums, with no real indication that property prices have bottomed out.  In addition, given the downgrading of growth projections for the economy that we have seen recently there is no real reason to believe there is any likelihood that things will pick up in any significant way.  I am somewhat baffled as to why Mr. McDonagh would not believe that we are a hell of a long way from recovering the €31 billion.  Many of us would believe that we should be looking to get considerably more given that the original loans were €76 billion and the balance went into the banks in the form of recapitalisation.I would like to hear more about the Irish assets and loans.  I take the point that many of the properties involved - hotels, ghost estates and so on - are not actually NAMA's, which was enlightening information.  Nonetheless €11 billion in Dublin is still a lot.  My perception and that of many people is of large numbers of empty apartment blocks, empty office blocks, and half-developed or undeveloped lands that are just lying idle without any prospect of generating any revenue from renting or selling.  Of the €1.1 billion NAMA has put out for development and working capital, 45% has gone to the UK and one might argue that NAMA has got or is getting good return on that.  Half of it is going into Ireland, with presumably a very significant amount going into Dublin, and we are not getting a return on that.  What is happening with the money?  What is it doing?  Is it simply spent on maintenance on buildings and sites that are sitting empty and which we have little prospect of selling?  On what basis is NAMA extending working capital to the developers who are still managing these assets, when there is little, if any, prospect of NAMA realising a return on those assets?This leads me to my last point.  This is the sense I have - it is shared by many people - about the assets and loans in Ireland and in Dublin and it raises the question about what better use to which we could be putting these properties and assets.  There is considerable, widespread frustration as a result of empty apartment blocks throughout Dublin given that there are tens of thousands of people on the social housing lists.  I realise NAMA has identified 2,000 properties that could be transferred in lease arrangements.  Will NAMA confirm that these are lease arrangements and not a transfer of ownership to the local authority?  This seems like a small amount out of a portfolio of €18 billion.  Will NAMA explain why this makes up such a small amount of the €18 billion portfolio?  On what basis is NAMA making decisions about what is and what is not suitable?Will the delegation comment on the wisdom or logic of NAMA, the Government and the local authorities entering into leasing arrangements and the transfer of properties to social housing for leasing arrangements?  As I understand it, this will require local authorities to lease the properties concerned and it will require tenants to pay rent, all of which will go back, in most cases, to the developers who are still managing these properties.  If and when they can repay their loans to NAMA, they will own the assets rather than us.  This does not appear to represent good expenditure of public money.  Would it not make more sense to transfer these properties fully to local authorities and for the value of the transactions to be written off against the targets that NAMA must achieve?  After all, it is all State money.  At the end of the process the State would then actually own the assets and properties and be in possession of valuable assets rather than the properties returning to developers, who are essentially bankrupt.The same question arises in the case of community and small enterprise initiatives.  To what extent can we discuss good management of this vast portfolio which NAMA appears to hold in Ireland and Dublin when many small businesses and community initiatives are desperate for space to develop either community projects or small enterprises?  This is despite all of the office property sitting there empty.I refer to the maintenance of NAMA properties and assets.  In many cases, including several in my constituency such as those involving Dún Laoghaire Golf Club and the Iceland site in central Dún Laoghaire, issues arise and there is considerable concern, frustration and annoyance among local residents about the general upkeep of these properties.  There has been a lack of response from the developers who are still managing these properties and the local authorities in terms of dealing with the maintenance and upkeep issues of these sites.  Health and safety issues arise in many cases.  What does NAMA believe can be done to improve this situation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it fair to say that if NAMA was one entity rather than several entities, we would not have this problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the chairman of NAMA running a State bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the local authority that identifies the need?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figure of 2,000 seems an extraordinarily low figure.  Why is it so low?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very briefly, Mr. Daly has still not answered the question as to why, given that most of NAMA's liquidity comes from the United Kingdom, it is confident about its ability to realise a return from the Irish and Dublin portfolio.I have one other brief question.  It was mentioned that €74 million is paid annually to the banks to employ 500 staff within them to manage the assets.  Why the hell are we paying the banks to pay their staff?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can I make an enquiry on behalf of some constituents in respect of a now derelict shopping centre that I believe is in NAMA's portfolio?  It is of concern to the community.  A shop owner and prospective developer wants to know who to contact to discuss a possible and welcome development of the shopping centre.  Who does he contact?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope I am not breaching the rules on lobbying.
