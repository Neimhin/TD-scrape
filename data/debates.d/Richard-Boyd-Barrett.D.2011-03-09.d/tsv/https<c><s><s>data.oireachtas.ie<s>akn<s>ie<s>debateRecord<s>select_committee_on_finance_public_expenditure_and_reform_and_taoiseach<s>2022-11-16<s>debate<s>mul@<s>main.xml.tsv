RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will remind the Minister of the amendment I have proposed. It is worth reading into the record. I am looking for "a report on amending the guidelines in relation to section 481 (Film Tax Relief), to clearly define the requirement for producer companies in receipt of the relief to be the legally responsible employer for all those working on film productions funded by the relief as against the DAC which only has a temporary existence; and further to guarantee the full vindication of workers rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003; and further to ensure genuinely equitable remuneration for performers and actors in relation to their intellectual property rights and full compliance with the EU copyright directive." Last night, I explained as best I could-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there is a technical problem with sound? I am coming in in stereo.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. Are we okay now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I tried to explain the reason for this amendment last night. In response, the Minister pretty much said that I was painting a very grim picture of the Irish film industry and that I had not acknowledged that we produce wonderful films. I will respond to that first because it is important. Anybody can look at the transcript of what I said yesterday and will see that I began my contribution by arguing at length that we need to put more money into arts and culture, including film, and that we are undervaluing the extraordinary talent we have in this country and our incredible tradition, unparalleled for a country of our size, of poetry, art, writing, acting, theatre, film, music and so on. I said all of that so it is unfair to suggest for a moment that I do not recognise this. It is quite the contrary. The reason I am putting this forward is because I recognise and greatly value the creative people we have in this country and want to see arts and culture valued more. I want to see more investment in them. I believe there is a lot more potential there. However, critical to that is truly valuing the people who make those films. The Minister said that I should "come up with a better metaphor" than the one I used, which was that the designated activity companies, DACs, are mushrooms that pop up and then disappear. He suggested that they flower. Whether it is a mushroom or a flower, the issue is the rights of performers and actors over their performances, the contribution they have made to a film, their writings and so on. All sorts of contributions go into making these flowers of cultural endeavour. As it was put to me this morning as I chatted to a member of Irish Equity, the DAC structure separates the performer, the artist or the creative from the benefit of his or her endeavour and creative ability. That is how he described it to me. That is exactly what the DAC structure does. It ensures that creatives do not benefit from their input into the making of a beautiful, wonderful thing. That is a problem. I hope the Minister recognises this if it is true. As Irish Equity representatives stated at the hearings of the Committee on Budgetary Scrutiny, it is contrary to the EU directive on copyright. The directive implies that buy-out contracts should be the exception, not the rule, and that it is critical and a requirement that the creatives, performers and actors get equitable remuneration for their artistic contribution and intellectual property. They are not getting it. Under contracts in the UK, including Northern Ireland, and other jurisdictions, they do get it. That has to be addressed. Those affected say that the DAC structure facilitates what is happening. When all this is being funded with public money, the Minister should be concerned about ensuring the creatives' rights are vindicated. They are not being vindicated. The people the Minister is talking to, the screen producers, are happy with this situation because the rights are being signed over to them. The intellectual property rights of the artists, performers and others are being signed over to the producers. Needless to say, Screen Producers Ireland is saying this is great and good for the producers. It is not surprising that Screen Ireland believes it is acceptable. That is because it is largely populated by producers. There is a revolving door involving producers in Screen Ireland who are making movies funded by that organisation under section 481. It is a relatively small group. A writer who emailed me described what is happening in scathing terms. He stated he has ultimately come to the conclusion that the Irish film industry is effectively a scam, a branch of the public sector that has craftily positioned itself to operate completely by its own rules and without any accountability to the taxpayer. He went on to provide details. I am only getting my head around all this because it is such a complex industry, given the input of writers, actors, performers, crew and so on. The writer's remarks are pretty scathing. He explained how by comparison with other jurisdictions, writers in Ireland are paid an absolute pittance for options on scripts. The scripts are sat on by producers, who do not try to obtain finance. A writer signs over the rights to his or her script to producers who sit on it, do nothing with it and pay next to nothing. I could elaborate on some of the issues the writer who emailed me mentioned. Some of the headlines concern duplicity, low pay, vested interests, contracts being drawn up for writers by a particular firm of solicitors that I believe has a relationship with some of the key people inside Screen Producers Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely fine. Once I have got this amendment out of the way, I will be flying through the rest. I will probably not even speak to most of my other amendments. On this one, however, I want to get all the relevant points across. These are serious charges. They are coming precisely from the people who are the creatives. The whole point is to support the creative industry, which, in this case, is the film industry. Writers, performers and actors are making serious charges. It is incumbent on the Minister to investigate them seriously and not just talk to the people he gives the funding to, who are obviously very happy to keep it. Of course they are. The Minister mentioned Screen Guilds of Ireland yesterday. That body is wholly funded by the State. All its funding comes from Screen Ireland. It has been suggested to me that Screen Guilds of Ireland represents the self-employed contractors who hire and fire people on film productions. That does not really tell us about the people we need to be looking after. Of course, Screen Guilds of Ireland is going to say things are okay. In order to elaborate on the points on the DAC, intellectual property rights and what happens to the latter, let me refer again to the email I read yesterday. This relates to my metaphor of the flower, which has died but still exists. Importantly, it is when a film is put on a hard drive that it starts to generate revenue. It does not generate revenue when it is being made. It is when it is put on a hard drive, sold, distributed, downloaded and so on that the money starts to come in, but that money never shows up in the DAC. The revenues accruing from the flower, with the production now on the hard drive, do not go back to the people with the creative input or DAC. That should be of concern to the taxpayers as well as the performers because they finance it. Where is the money going? Let me explain why it should be of concern to the taxpayer. In England, where Irish performers sometimes perform and where they get the right deal, the residuals that come in over the years for downloading, distribution and performance go back to the performers, writers or others and they pay tax on it, meaning the state gets something back. In Ireland, however, that does not happen. The artists and performers never get anything back. They have to sign it away. Screen Producers Ireland says it front-loads the remuneration. In other words, it gives the creatives a payment up front, but this payment is nowhere near comparable with what would be obtained if they had access to the revenues that accrue, often for years, from the performance and downloading of the work they have contributed to. Insofar as there is a back-end deal - this is the lingo - it is linked to the profits of the producer, not the sales, distribution and revenues flowing from the intellectual property. That is a big difference. Elsewhere, the revenues from sales and distribution, or the revenues flowing from the intellectual property, are what remunerate the creatives, artists and performers. Here, the remuneration is linked to the profits, but, as I explained, it is unheard of for the producer companies we fund to make a profit.Here, it is linked to the profits. As I explained, a profit being made by the producer companies that we fund is unheard of; it does not happen. I hope the Minister sees the difference. There is a consequence as well for the taxpayer. Anyway, I will read what he wrote:It should be noted that when the finished film (the hard drive and the bundle of underlying copyright) is transferred/sold from the DAC to another company its price, and the terms of the assignment of the rights, will be well below the market price to ensure that the DAC accounts register a loss.  With this kind of structure the tax credit can never be reclaimed as the potential for profit has been removed. Any profit that accrues as a result of distribution and sales will be experienced by a different company. If that company is outside Ireland’s tax jurisdiction then the section 481 taxpayer investment never re-enters the Irish tax net and the investment is effectively lost. There is an additional opportunity for Production Companies within the DAC structure.  "Internal pricing" is a common practice between companies with common owners. It is possible, for example, for the Production Company to invoice the DAC for certain services. For example, the Production Company might take on certain management and financial services on behalf of the DAC and invoice the DAC for those services. At this point it is possible to inflate those costs to the benefit of the owners of the Production Company. Or in the case of animation, the Production Company can invoice the DAC for the services of its ... animators at a significantly increased rate that does not reflect the actual cost of the animators. These are common internal pricing practices. Our point is that these practices are possible within the current design of Section 481, and therefore more transparency and regulation is required.  The final point of course is that the DAC structure means that Production Companies employ only a smaller number of full time office staff on anything like a full time basis. The majority of performers and crew are contracted by the [DAC] which, by their nature, have a limited [time] span. It is difficult to take action [i.e. to the Labour Court or the WRC] against such transient entities. Section 481, as it is currently designed is open to ALL of these risks. We know from the recent cost benefit analysis that it has a net cash cost in excess of €70 million. That is the cost-benefit analysis referred to yesterday. He continued, "It is possible that this could be reduced if not reversed, if these risks inherent in the design, were removed." All of that is quite telling. I will move on to perhaps the last point and elaborate on that in terms of the ability of workers, because that relates to the other part of my amendment. I was asked to put this question to the Minister. Can he produce a single PAYE worker who has a contract of indefinite duration acknowledged by the production companies to which he gives money to employ people in the film industry? Can he find one? He referred to 3,000 full-time equivalent people last night. That is a new figure, by the way. It should be noted that these figures fluctuate. This is very important because this is what the relief is for – to create employment. Mr. Hickey, who was in here at the budgetary scrutiny committee the other day, claimed back in 2018 there were 17,000 full-time equivalents. When that figure was challenged and the Minister’s Department looked at it, we discovered that the correct figure was 2,000 rather than 17,000. Now we have a figure of 3,000. Those are amazing fluctuations, are they not? There is a big difference. My challenge to the Minister is not whether he can find 2,100, 17,000, or 3,000, but can he find one? Can he produce one PAYE employee on any of the film productions funded either with section 481 or, as I believe it was called, section 35 before that? If one adds up all the public money that has been invested through section 481 or its predecessor since the 1980s, it is probably in the region of €4 billion over all those years. That is going back to the 1980s. Can we find one person who actually has a job as a result of the money we have given to create jobs? My challenge to the Minister is to suggest that he cannot. This makes a mockery of the declaration that the recipients have to sign where it says that they have to; for example, that they have to comply with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and, of course, the EU directives surrounding that, which require that people on fixed-term contracts do not enjoy conditions lesser than those on normal contracts of employment. That is what the directive states. It is precisely to protect people in what you call “project-to-project”. That is purpose of the fixed-term workers directive and the fixed-term workers legislation. It is to protect people who work on project-to-project employment to ensure they acquire these rights by law. If they work for the same producer, as it is in this case, or the same employer successively over a number of years, even if there are gaps or if they work for some other people in between, they acquire these rights. However, those rights are not acknowledged. While I challenge the Minister to find one PAYE worker who has an acknowledged contract of indefinite duration, I could bring in 30 or 40 people, many living in the Minister’s constituency, who could demonstrate their record as having worked for 20, 30 or 40 years in the film industry, who should have contracts of indefinite duration but have not got them, and who have been put out of the industry because they have asked for such contracts. I refer not to people who say they represent this, that or the other, but the actual people who worked in the film industry. That is a very serious problem because it means the objective of this relief is not being met. The requirements for such state aid under EU law are not being met. Somebody else I was talking to this morning noted the big question in this regard: who is the employer in the film industry? The Minister mentioned the Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, agreement, which has not been registered, as I understand it, with the Labour Court. Normally these agreements are registered with the Labour Court. Why has it not? I suggest it has not been registered because it cannot be - because an agreement in the Labour Court has to be between an employer and an employee. SPI is not an employer. Therefore, that agreement has not and cannot be registered. The only people SPI could register an agreement for are the people who work for SPI. However, they cannot sign an agreement for employers who do not exist. When I say they do not exist, it is not me saying it - it is the so-called employers – the producers companies - that are saying it. Is that understood? An agreement between employers and employees can only exist if there is an employer. The people the Government gives the money to explicitly said in this committee room that they are not and cannot be the employer. Therefore, how can it make an agreement with employees? Now we have a big problem. There is no employer or employee. That is a big problem when the Government is spending €100 million a year to create quality employment and training. Finally, I had another phone call this morning with another person who has been working. This person is not blacklisted, unlike some of those who came in here in 2018 who have not worked since. He has been working and he is saying this stuff is still rampant in film productions. By the way some people in section 481 work are not even doing the trainee stuff or pretending to do it. There is willy-nilly firing of anybody who says, for example, that the scaffolding is a bit unsafe and something needs to be done about it. In that scenario the person who mentions that is fired. If someone argues with the producer or says people are working unsafe or too long hours they are fired and they will not be employed again. There is nothing to protect people against this stuff. Whether the Minister accepts that those allegations are true or not, I am asking him to do this because I put it to him - and I ask the Minister to respond to these things - that there is no protection against that stuff. It does not exist and it cannot exist because of the DAC structure. I will leave it at that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely welcome the Minister's response, particularly his commitment to meet all the people to whom he referred. It is critically important that he meets not only the people who think everything is okay but also those who are raising very serious concerns and questions in order that we get a balance. Indeed, there are other people. We obviously mentioned the Irish Film Workers Association and Equity as groups that had the confidence to come in, if you like. One of those groups would say its members have suffered very dire consequences. That needs to be looked at. The other group represents without question the actors and performers who maybe have the confidence to come in and raise questions. If the Minister is open to it, however, there are other individuals working in the industry who do not have the confidence to go public but would probably welcome private engagements with the Department to be able to give evidence of what they know and see in the industry. I ask that of the Minister. These are people who would have absolutely clear credentials, if you like, as players in the film industry. We need to hear from everybody. As part of that, I hope this might conclude with the once promised but subsequently abandoned film industry stakeholders forum, which the Government wanted to happen and that was recommended by the then Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2018. Certain elements within the film industry simply vetoed it, however. They said they were not involving themselves and the thing fell apart.It never happened. No group should have the right to veto a stakeholder forum in an industry that would not exist without public money. It is important that we keep reminding ourselves that it would not exist without public money. That is different from the non-funded arts sector. That is a distinction I only fully got into my head during Covid-19. We discovered there are a great many people in entertainment, music and so forth who are not funded. There should be good employer-employee relations in that situation but there is something different between a sector that is not publicly funded and how it would deal with employee-employer relations and something that is publicly funded, depends on public funding and would not exist without it. I ask members to think about that difference in how we approach this. I believe that makes the sector different. It is also different precisely because the film relief is about quality employment and training and because of the EU directive. That slightly changes the pitch. That is my point. If it was not funded, we might well say to someone who experiences a problem that they can go to the WRC or the Health and Safety Authority because that is what those bodies are for. However, this is slightly different because the funding is all public money, from section 481, Screen Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, RTÉ and so on. Those are other revenue streams that are not even counted in some of the figures I have referred to. There is all this public money going into the sector and even the producers acknowledge that without this money, there would be no industry. It is entirely dependent on public money. Therefore, the Minister, whose response and engagement I genuinely welcome, and the Government need to think about the fact that this is the public's money.  I hope the Minister will discuss this issue with those who are expressing concern, the contrarians. As the Nyberg report produced after the economic crash stated, we need to listen to the contrarians. One of the lessons of the crash in 2008 was that we did not listen enough to the contrarians. It is important that we listen to them so that we have a balanced view. I ask the Minister to note that this project-to-project system does not exist in the animation industry, which is also funded by section 481. It does not exist. There are different animated films that are done project to project, but they are standing companies with employees and a production line. I have no doubt the producers will come in here and say that is different but it is not necessarily different and it was not always different. Once upon a time in the film industry, people were employed by studios. People will say that was the "olden days" and it is different now but they will not say why it is different or better. The people who say it is different now and we cannot go back to the way it was say that because they are doing quite well. I fully understand they would want to say that. An issue raised with me, which I ask the Minister to look into, is producer fees and how big they are. I have heard of shocking figures of €250,000 each for producers on films that have a total budget of about €8 million. The same productions then skimp on overtime payments and allowances, whereas the producers are getting €250,000 each. These issues need to be looked at because this is public money. It is obvious that those people have little interest in questioning the current model. That is self-evident but it does not mean they are right.  As one person put it to me, a live action film is a production line. It is different in the sense that there is a creative aspect, if we can put it in those terms. That is important. On another level, a film is a production line with trades, builders, transport workers and so on. There is no need for those people to exist in complete precarity and insecurity. One might well argue that on creative grounds the same writer cannot write every time for the producer company, which, by the way, does exist all the time. That is the one area that is not project-to-project. A producer company to which public money is given does not have an episodic existence. It exists all along the line. We can name the companies. I again welcome what the Minister said. It was suggested to me that one thing we could do is to phone up the ten or 15 major recipients. That number could be narrowed down to six or seven. We should phone them up and ask how many employees they have. Those companies have existed for ten or 15 years so they are not episodic. They also decide the disposal of the intellectual property rights of the performers and so on. That is who they are transferred to and they are then transferred on elsewhere - we do not quite know to whom. Are they transferred on to the big American companies? Are they put into another DAC? I believe that was alleged in a German case where the revenues accruing to a particular film, a co-production with a German company, had been put somewhere else and there was a legal case around it. Where do they go? Who gets those revenues? It is not the State or the artists. I ask the Minister to seriously examine that and question this mantra that because a film is made on a project-to-project basis, nobody can have any security or recognition. It is slightly different, but all industries are slightly different. Does that mean all rights go out the window? Does it mean someone who has been in the industry for ten, 20 or 30 years has no right to have some expectation to be employed on the next film made by the same producer company that made the last film he or she worked on? Can those who made the sets, did the transport work or worked as the stage hand have no legitimate expectation to be on the next production when it is the same producer? The Minister should ask himself those questions because as soon as we ask them, we realise there is a problem there.  In regard to the agreements, again I ask the Minister to look into this and possibly get legal advice from the Attorney General on these agreements. My understanding is that there cannot be an agreement covering an industry if there is not an employer and an employee. That cannot happen and is not legal. That needs to be looked into because it is meaningless. When I say there is no employer it is not a case of me just alleging that. The Minister should listen to what SPI says when it goes in front of the Labour Court or the WRC. The previous CEO of SPI said she would give further evidence before the court that there was no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment could be said to have existed between the parties. The parties were the film company and the people who worked on a publicly-funded film production. That is who she was referring to. Whatever the specifics of that case, we should listen to what she is saying. That was on the basis of clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in the sector, including the operation of section 481. There is no possible basis for a relationship of employment because there is no employer and no employee.There cannot be an agreement with anybody else other than an employer and employee. I am genuinely asking the Minister to get legal advice on this issue because those agreements mean nothing if we do not have the basics of an employer and an employee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will respond in two sentences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, I will be really quick.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This will be my last word on this, honestly. One of the people I was talking to this morning told me that the UK had just introduced a measure where there will be someone on film sets to address the problem of people being afraid to go to their line producer because of a fear of repercussions or going to the producers. That fear exists over there as well. In the UK, a special independent person is now on each film set to whom crew, performers and workers can go if they have concerns. That is completely independent of any of the operators, stakeholders or anybody else in the film industry. It is a good idea to have somebody that people can go to based on the fear of reprisal. I welcome what Deputy Matthews said but that fear is very serious. We have heard it from multiple people giving evidence. A good, simple way by which we can begin to address that issue is to have someone whom people can go to and say that maybe they are being bullied or told to do things they feel they should not have to do. That person would be completely independent of producers, management and the people who hire and fire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mean loads of people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I withdraw the amendment on the basis of what the Minister said and I may resubmit on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I made the point on budget day that we would vote against this. We understand smoking is not a good thing for public health. However, we do not think it is fair to simply financially penalise people who are cigarette-addicted. The better way to address public health issues around smoking is through education, rather than financially penalising people who are victims of an addiction. That is the reason I am opposing the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a question going back a long way. Like Deputy Doherty, we have questioned section 110 and how it allows some of these companies to reduce their tax liability. Are there figures available for the amount of tax forgone in respect of section 110?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister could, I would be grateful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we suspend the sitting now or later?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For clarification, this is only in relation to where there was an illegal or incorrect registration. All of the stuff that Deputy Doherty has been asking about is already the case for biological and social parents. That is correct, is it not? It is already the case and all those things already apply in the case of adoptees. There is a threshold exemption up to €365,000 combined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And then after that they are subject to capital acquisition tax. This is extending it to those who were illegally adopted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister elaborate somewhat on exactly what change is proposed with this section? I understand it relates to double taxation agreements and assessments on taxpayers in situations where, I presume, double taxation agreements are relevant or apply, and where claims are being made for loss relief, group relief or similar reliefs. Will the Minister explain, in layman's terms, what exactly we are doing here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Minister say the reason reliefs might be delayed is because, for example, there might be some examination of transfer pricing? Is that right? Once the examination is completed, it might delay the relief being provided to somebody because the claim was being looked at in the context of transfer pricing. Is that it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This adds to the list of territories with which we have double taxation agreements Guernsey and the Isle of Man, both of which have something of a reputation as tax havens. What safeguards are in place to prevent agreements such as these with places that have reputations as tax havens being exploited for tax avoidance by corporations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for that clarification.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I second the proposal that Deputy Doherty take the Chair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 70 is out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. It was not already discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One Deputy has spoken.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 71: In page 153, line 39, after “Act).” to insert the following:“653AQ. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil into the implementation of the Vacant Homes Tax.”.My other amendments were ruled out of order, presumably because they involved a charge on the Exchequer. This amendment is looking for a report on the implementation of the vacant homes tax. It allows me to ask certain questions about how this will operate and whether it will be adequate. It might bring vacant homes back into use, which is what the purpose of it obviously is and should be. To get a portion of the 160,000 houses identified in the census back into use could be useful to help to house people and deal with the dire housing crisis we are facing.  On the last conversation and Deputy Matthews’s questions, I never accused the Minister of being naïve. I mentioned a multi-unit apartment complex across the road from my office where at least 15 but up to 17 units have been sitting empty now for about two and a half years. The vulture fund that bought it is busy trying to drive the tenants out and has succeeded in driving most of them out, which is why those properties are empty. One thing that is going on there is that throughout all that period, there were very slow refurbishment works going on. These refurbishment works have been going on for as long as those places have been empty - since they drove the tenants out with threats of evictions and so on that just eventually led the tenants to give up and go. Some of the tenants stayed and resisted. Hopefully, their resistance will bear fruit in that the long campaign has meant the local authority and an approved housing body are now trying to purchase the block. I hope that goes through and we end this awful situation and the scandal of those empty apartments. Meanwhile, those places have been vacant. Everybody who is left living in that block knows that they have been perfectly well refurbished for quite some time. However, they maintain to pretend that there was work still being done to them. To be honest, I do not know whether they are being charged anything or whether they are identified as vacant properties or would be. However, the point is there is an exemption in the vacant homes tax if substantial works are being done, is there not? Therefore, I would be worried that that exemption can be exploited and one would get precisely that. There is this case, but I can see this situation being repeated in Tathony House, where there is a massive eviction threat, and in other places where they want to get the tenants out. In this case, I think they just wanted to make them empty long enough that then the rent pressure zone rules that limited rent increases would expire and no longer apply and they could then jack up the rent or just increase the value of the property by getting vacant possession, but kind of justifying all that on the grounds that they are doing substantial refurbishments to the place. I would like the Minister to address that concern. I could see that being done and in the case I am referring to it looks as if something like that was going on. It would not take long for the unscrupulous to figure out whether there are things they could do to benefit from exemptions or loopholes in the tax and manage to evade it. In addition, three times the property tax is just not enough to put any serious pressure on those sorts of people who do that kind of thing. Does the Minister know what I mean? I refer to the kind of people who are happy to sit on a property and watch its value appreciate and are ruthless enough to throw people out and intimidate and bully them out of a place because they want to maximise the value of their investment. In fact, I went with the poor tenants who were being threatened with eviction to the RTB. I remember so well the high-powered barrister representing that particular vulture fund who said that this is not pleasant - it is ugly - but their client has to maximise the value of their investment.It was as cold and as ruthless as that. They knew what they were doing was not nice but they had to maximise the value of their client's investment. There are people like that out there. People as calculating, profit-hungry and ruthless as that will do the calculations. They will work out that, even if they have to pay three times the property tax, they would make a hell of a lot more by letting a place sit empty and therefore maximise the value. We need a much more punitive vacant homes tax than the Minister is suggesting to make it really work, so it becomes painful for people to sit on empty property in that way. We would like to see the tax kick in if a place is empty for six months or more. The Minister is suggesting a lot longer. If I understand him correctly, somewhere could potentially be empty for a year before the tax would kick in. I ask the Minister to clarify that. That is my understanding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will consider what the Minister said. I welcome the fact he is considering those concerns and has considered them in the drafting of the legislation. Regarding the rate, is it not fairly self-evident that properties are appreciating to a degree that is multiples of what the Minister is talking about? If average property taxes are a few hundred euro and the tax is three times that, say €1,000 or €1,500, based on the appreciation of property prices at the moment, it would still be very profitable for someone to pay that because by the end of the year the property they have been sitting on will be worth 10% more than at the beginning of the year. That might be €30,000, €40,000 of additional value in that property. That €1,000 or €1,500 is nothing compared with the benefit they may perceive to have gained from to sitting on it empty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Matthews made the bulk of the point. I was curious when he said there might be people on lower or middle incomes who had a vacant property who, for whatever reason, have decided to leave the property vacant. I am struggling to imagine a person on a low to middle income who can afford to leave a property vacant. I just cannot envisage many such cases. I am not saying the odd such case might not exist. One could qualify the tax with some provisions which would state that if there is a good or exceptional reason, it can be appealed if a rationale can be provided, such as a personal or family-related reason. I cannot really think of one. That does not seem a terribly credible argument for not addressing the far big danger that it will continue to be profitable, from a capital gains point of view, for people to sit on empty property. The level of the tax will be a fraction of the capital gains they are likely to achieve based on the recent appreciation in property values. I have cited one example. I could cite more. It is a significant grievance of people in my area, as it is in many, to see places that could be used sitting empty year after year. Everybody knows the people who are sitting on those properties are wealthy. They are happy to sit on a vacant property because it is a valuable asset which is appreciating in value and nothing is being done about it. The penalty has to be made punitive. There is a much bigger danger if it is ineffective. The Minister and I may differ on this point. I think the stakes are really high because the housing crisis is so bad. The Minister's caution and statement that we should be careful and review this as we go might be a reasonable position to take if we were not facing the current dire situation. When we are faced with the sort of human misery, suffering, hardship and trauma that so many families and children are now facing, there is no time to work out whether this will work. We have to make sure it works. We have to drive those vacant properties back into use as a matter of urgency. Whatever about debates on whether Housing for All is adequate, I think we all accept that we are a long way from where we need to be. We need to get to where we want to go with regard to addressing this housing crisis as quickly as possible. I ask the Minister to seriously consider this. Deputy Matthews made the point himself so it is not just the lefties who are saying this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not worry, Deputy Matthews. I will say no more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 72:In page 153, after line 39, to insert the following:“653AQ.

Within 3 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the amount of revenue that would be raised if he were to abolish the current Local Property Tax and impose a new Non Principal Private Residence Tax on an incremental basis as follows:	(a) a second home tax of €1000;	(b) a 3 to 5 homes tax of €1500 per home;	(c) a 6 to 10 home tax of €2000 per home;	(d) an over 10 homes tax of €2500 per home.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our concern about all of this is that very profitable companies and data centres should not benefit. That is basically it. We are worried about data centres being able to get it because we have a fundamental problem with data centres and the drain they represent on the energy of this country, which is rising exponentially. We would put a fair bit of the responsibility for the energy security concerns we now have in this country on their shoulders and on the Government's shoulders for facilitating and encouraging the massive proliferation of data centres, with the huge consequences they have for the energy of this country, such that they are going to absorb huge amounts of whatever renewable energy we may develop.They are currently using a much higher volume of energy proportionately than they do in most other countries, if not all of them. They are, therefore, part of the problem that we are now all facing, and we think that they should not be supported in that regard.  There is also the matter of supports that we want to see for businesses that are genuinely struggling with this massive hike in energy costs, including electricity and so on. We want them to be supported and we do not want to see businesses and SMEs going under in this situation. They deserve the support, just as they deserved the support during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we think there should be a different approach for companies making big money. Basically, if they are profitable or if their turnover is above a certain level, we think that they probably do not need the help. I would the Minister respond to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a different perspective. My optimum solution, and I say this in all sincerity, is that we would improve this situation even more by nationalising energy and running it on a not-for-profit basis. That would help even more. This is the scheme that the Minister is proposing and I take his point about turnover. However, if it was to be based on profitability, it would be entirely reasonable to have a profitability threshold above which a company would not need support. While it depends on where the threshold is set, I do not envisage some of the big employers the Minister mentioned running for the hills if we say that companies will get support when they are below a certain threshold because their existence is threatened, but those whose profits are above a certain threshold can absorb some of the cost because their existence is clearly not threatened. I suspect that the Minister disagrees with me, but I will put the argument in any event. On the subject of data centres, I fundamentally disagree with the him. I am thinking about the sheer scale of these data centres in terms of their impact on our energy. There was brief talk about how we could have blackouts. If we took out the data centres, that would not have been a threat. That is how much of our energy they are sucking up. Some of the big, mega data centres that are planned for the near future will balloon that even further. Even as we develop our renewable energy resources, they will suck up much that energy. That is a real problem and it is a serious contribution to an energy crisis that is developing. The Minister is understating just how big of a problem they are for us, in particular because of the huge proliferation of them that we have, and we have to address that.I suspect we disagree but I just wish to mark the issue.
