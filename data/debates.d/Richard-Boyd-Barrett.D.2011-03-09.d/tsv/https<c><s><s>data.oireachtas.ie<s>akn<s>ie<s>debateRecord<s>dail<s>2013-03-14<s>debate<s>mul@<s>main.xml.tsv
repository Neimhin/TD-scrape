RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just to pick up on the Minister's reference to the election of the Pope-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the Minister think of the significance of the Pope's choice of the name Francis?The Minister will be aware that St. Francis was the son of a wealthy merchant who made the decision to repudiate his wealth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was someone who chose to repudiate his wealth and walk among the poor. The Government might consider taking a leaf from his book. My main question relates in a way to something we might consider at the weekend when we commemorate another saint, St. Patrick. The occasion is a celebration of our national identity. As Minister in charge of Coillte and the State forestry, will the Minister for Finance take the opportunity of this weekend to reconsider the plan of the Government to sell off the harvesting rights to our State forestry, which is a symbol of our national heritage, history and culture? We will consider these things this weekend and many of us will probably walk in the State forests over the weekend. Does the Minister not believe it would represent the ultimate betrayal of our national heritage and culture to sell off the harvesting rights to our State forests, especially when it is likely that the people who would purchase them will be the same bankers and bondholders who bankrupted the country? Since this Government and the previous Government have agreed to pay off those gambling debts we could have the ultimate irony whereby we are forced to sell off our State forests to pay the debts of banks, and those self-same banks would end up owning the forests. Would it not be the ultimate betrayal of our national heritage, history and culture to sell this precious asset to Helvetia Wealth and its subsidiary, headed up by Bertie Ahern, the Irish Forestry Unit Trust, a consortium involving Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Irish Life, or the China State Bank, which has expressed an interest? Is it not unacceptable to sell this precious resource to pay off the debts of bankers when those bankers would end up owning our State forests? Will the Minister for Finance use this weekend to reconsider the plan of the Government and give a commitment that it will retain the State forestry in public hands and use it in the interests of the people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not much of an answer from the Minister. He could indicate who those stakeholders are and who the Government is talking to about the sale of the forests. I asked the Minister whether he would reconsider and review the commitment of the Government to sell off the harvesting rights to our State forests. If we do this - if we sell off our forests - we will be the only country in Europe to have disposed of the harvesting rights to state forestry. In one country where this was partially done, Sweden, after several years there was a national outcry and then Sweden took the state forestry back into public ownership. In another country which has partially privatised state forests, New Zealand, one of the richest people in that country now owns a significant part of the state forestry and, as a result, there has been a significant loss of jobs and public access, a significant outflow of profits from the country and damage done to the country's sawmill industry. Banks are not interested in protecting public access, national heritage or the long-term stewardship of forests. They are interested in turning a quick buck. I put it to the Minister that this is not the way to protect our forests. What we should do and what I call on the Minister to do is to retain our State forestry fully in public ownership and manage and develop it to create jobs and desperately needed revenue for the State, which could be done if it was managed properly and sustainably, something banks will never do.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where are our copies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister and everyone else is aware, the discovery of horse and pig DNA in what are supposed to be beef products raises the most serious questions. It raises questions for the food industry across Europe and for the political authorities. The fact that it is a pan-European problem and scandal should not be a source of comfort for the Government. I note that at the outset the Minister's response to this crisis was to jump quickly to the conclusion that the origin of the problem lay outside the country and to reassure everybody that everything was okay here and to point the finger at Poland.What we do not need is false comfort in this regard. Instead, we need to be sure that assurances given by the Minister are based on real fact and evidence. Notwithstanding the fact this is a pan-European problem, it is a larger problem for this country for several reasons. First, as Ireland is the largest exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere, sorting out this problem is of significant economic importance to us. Second, the reputation of our food industry is indelibly linked with the welfare of our economy as a whole. The fact horse DNA was found in one third of products tested by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and pig DNA in 85% of burgers tested in another study is pretty serious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but it is a pretty serious problem which raises questions about the role of big business in the food industry and its attitude to food quality and integrity. It also raises important social questions. Academics in Britain have been making the point that in time of recession, people in financial distress or who have lost their jobs economise on food purchases and, as a result, are much more dependent on cheap processed food from supermarkets. Accordingly, it is the less well-off who stand to be most impacted upon by this crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I understand the report correctly, one food producer in this country, B&F Meats, was involved in mislabelling meat which was then sold on to the Czech Republic. From the looks of it, this was deliberate and there should be prosecutions. The fact that Silvercrest, owned by someone who is notorious in the beef industry as a result of the activities of his firms in the 1980s and 1990s, was misleading its major customers as to whether its products were sourced properly is also serious. It must be remembered that this factory belongs to a firm which a tribunal of inquiry was established to investigate, which the State had to step in to bail out for hundreds of millions of euro and which was involved in widespread tax evasion as well as selling substandard meat to the Iraqis. Quite incredibly, its chief executive was never done for any of this and remains in charge of one of the largest food producers in the country. QK Cold Stores denied it had found horse DNA in its food products even though the scandal had broken.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is concerning is the report states there is no evidence that Silvercrest and Rangeland Meats knowingly purchased or used horsemeat in the production of beef products. Neither is there any evidence that they did not, however. One could argue it is quite incredible that they would not know these facts. I met a well-known celebrity chef on the street in DÃºn Laoghaire recently who told me that at the base of this scandal was a product call rind emulsion. This consists of animal carcasses, mainly horses and pigs, which are boiled down to produce an emulsion which, in turn, is used by food processors to bulk up meat products to make more money and to fool the pubic as to the quality and standard of the meat. According to the chef this is widespread. Are these bulking agents produced in Ireland and put on beef products labelled as Irish? If that is not the case and they were sourced from outside, what were Irish beef producers doing, in a country that produces more beef than any other country in the northern hemisphere, buying in dodgy beef products from abroad? Punitive action needs to be taken against the firms in question. We need a regulatory regime that ensures we know precisely the origins of all ingredients in food products and what they are. The issue of horse passports also needs to be addressed.
