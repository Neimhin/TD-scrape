RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier the Taoiseach used words such as unhelpful or uncomfortable to describe some of the language used by presidential candidates during the election campaign in terms of immigrants in the United States. Do we need to be a little bit more forthright in roundly condemning the language of one particular candidate, Mr. Donald Trump, who has been condemned by governments, civil rights organisations and human rights organisations for using what can only be described as utterly despicable and racist language? He accused Mexico of exporting its rapists and criminals to the United States. What is very relevant to the undocumented Irish is that he has called for the expulsion of all 11.3 million undocumented workers in the United States. This is the same Donald Trump whom the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, met in Shannon Airport in May 2014 with a red carpet, harps and people in traditional Irish dress in what was frankly even at the time quite a ludicrous show of deference to this multibillionaire. This same person now turns out to be somebody who is literally whipping up an outrageous and dangerous hysteria against the undocumented, who include the Irish undocumented. Do we regret rolling out the red carpet for a man who would say this about immigrants in the United States? Will we condemn what he is saying? He will hear those words given his investment in this country. It will be something he will hear if the Irish Taoiseach and political system condemn him utterly for the words he has used to describe undocumented immigrants in the United States from wherever they may come. I ask the Taoiseach to respond to this and make this forthright condemnation when somebody is being racist, and that is what he is. He is whipping up dangerous hysteria, whereby there are serious reports of immigrants actually suffering heightened levels of violence, threats and racist stereotyping specifically because of the language and rhetoric Donald Trump has used. It is emboldening the worst and most racist elements in the United States to attack, physically in some cases, target, vilify and demonise undocumented immigrants. This is mostly directed at Mexicans, but he has said he wants to expel all undocumented workers from the United States. In the context of the refugee crisis, and particularly the situation in Syria and how it has been one of the major centres from which these refugees are fleeing, did the Taoiseach, as we asked him to on a number of occasions earlier this year, raise criticism, questions and concerns about the role of the United States in creating the conditions for this refugee crisis through its actions in Iraq, support for Saudi Arabia and arming of these regimes which have then gone on in turn to finance, support, give succour and create the conditions for the rise of ISIS? Somebody has to start saying this stuff because the consequences have been so devastating. The Taoiseach mentioned his attendance at the UN meeting in New York. I have heard an unconfirmed report, and I would like a straight and direct answer. Did the Taoiseach meet, or have any engagement with, General al-Sisi, the president and dictator - there is no other word to use for this man - of Egypt?Did the Taoiseach or any of his officials or representatives of the Irish State or political system meet President el-Sisi, the man who is engaging in mass executions and mass trials of his own citizens, as well as Ibrahim Halawa? If they did, was the Halawa case raised? His trial has been deferred yet again, and he has been incarcerated for two years in prison.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It relates to the Taoiseach's comment regarding his attendance at the meeting in New York. Did the Taoiseach meet President el-Sisi in New York or did other officials have any engagement with him? If they did, was the issue of Ibrahim Halawa raised?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Donald Trump is not in that league.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were red carpets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would have been helpful if the Taoiseach had reported that meeting to the family.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue of corporate tax avoidance, aggressive tax planning or, to put it in more accurate language, wholesale tax evasion by the biggest, wealthiest and most profitable multinationals is the most urgent issue that needs to be addressed in the global economy and for the sake of humanity. The failure of these corporations to pay a fair and reasonable amount of their profits back into society to fund the infrastructure, services and incomes of ordinary citizens through taxation has run alongside and is directly connected to a staggering growth in inequality and an increase in the gap between rich and poor. One cannot separate these two matters. When Oxfam produces a report stating that next year the wealthiest 1% of individuals in the world will have the same amount of wealth and assets as the other 99% of society, that is a stunning, staggering, and hard to comprehend indictment of our economic system. One of the facts with which people are probably familiar is that the 180 richest individuals have more wealth personally than the 48 poorest countries in the world and there is a direct overlap between the wealth of those individuals and the corporations of which they are CEOs. Many of these corporations that are responsible for this incomprehensible concentration of wealth in a few hands are based here and that also is not a coincidence. I and most of the world are convinced, despite Government denials, that Ireland is at the centre of an international nexus of tax avoidance and tax evasion, the result of which has been a truly stunning concentration of wealth in the hands of these corporations and those who own them at the expense of society in general, in particular the less well-off. The global growth in inequality of wealth is clearly echoed in the figures in a previous motion which we discussed a few months ago and some of which are referred to in the motion under discussion. The estimates we include are the conservative estimates produced by TASC which suggest that the wealthiest 10% of the population in this country has 42% of the wealth, while Credit Suisse estimates that 10% has 58% of the wealth. Whichever is correct, it is shocking inequality. At the same time, poverty and deprivation have increased dramatically such that 750,000 people in this country live in poverty, including 250,000 children. We have the worst housing crisis in the modern history of the State. I have just come from the Department of Finance pre-budget briefing which was very interesting, but it bears out the same picture. Corporate profits have shot through the roof yet again in recent months.The increases have been stunning. When we asked the Department of Finance officials if they could explain the enormous jump in corporate tax revenue recorded for the past six months, they could not explain it. It represents a 20% increase in profits, overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of these same multinationals. This is happening at the same time as a chronic lack of investment in public housing and, as a result, homelessness levels going through the roof. We desperately need investment in all sorts of areas of infrastructure and schools. Our water infrastructure is in a state of collapse. Our hospitals have been gutted of money and investment to the tune of billions of euro and our health services are in a state of emergency. This is happening at the same time as corporate profits have gone through the roof, and there is no explanation. While it is utterly unjust, it is also the explanation for the fragility, vulnerability and crisis-prone nature of the global economy. Although Thomas Piketty and others have pointed this out, it does not seem to be taken on board by the political elites in Europe, the economists, departments of finance or the ECB. They do not seem to comprehend that this level of concentration of wealth is not just unfair but very dangerous. It is a recipe for another crash. I saw a shocking graph which showed the reduction in lending by banks to the European periphery countries, including Ireland, Greece and Portugal, all of which have been in reverse since 2008. At exactly the same time, lending to China had increased in the same proportions. There has been a massive reduction in bank lending to Europe, which is at the back of the economic collapse and the austerity that follows, while all the speculative money moves to China. How can it happen? It has created a bubble in China, where massive capacity has been built up. However, there is nobody to buy the goods given that everybody else has been hammered with austerity and eventually somebody will realise it is unsustainable, the money will run out of China, the Chinese economy will collapse and further ramifications will hit the entire global economy. Such crazy fluctuations can happen only because of the incredible concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny number of corporate and financial bodies which are accumulating massive profits and exponential profit growth. These groups, accountable to nobody and paying no tax, can create a bubble for a while in an economy and bring it crashing down just as quickly. This is not just about disgusting inequality and unfairness, whereby people are hammered with tax, austerity and cuts while profits increase and the corporations pay nothing into the infrastructure that sustains them as well as the whole of society. It also creates the crisis-prone character of the entire global economy, which is an accident waiting to happen. While there is a consensus that we must do something about it, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who has been pushed into it because everybody is screaming about Ireland’s central role in it, says we must not go too far. He is quoted on the front of The Irish Times saying we should not go too far. The base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project is just a set of guidelines; it is not binding; we are not required to do it. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is already saying we should not go too far with any of it and denying what successive Governments have done to facilitate this or turn a blind eye. At our press conference earlier I made a point that I want people to take on board regarding the technical paper produced by the Department of Finance on effective corporate tax rates, about which there is much dispute. While the US says our effective corporate tax rate is 2%, EUROSTAT says it is 6% and the Government says it is 10.9%. While one can mess around with figures, accounting and different calculation methods to obscure the reality, the truth is in the tables produced by the Revenue and published by the Department of Finance. Only last week, when we were preparing the motion, I discovered something that tells the whole story. I cannot believe the Government or Revenue did not notice it and say there was something wrong. I refer to the deductions which allow multinational corporations, primarily, to reduce their taxable profits. Corporate profits are increasing overall. In 2006, gross trading profits were €72 billion while in 2011 they had increased slightly to €73 billion. They have probably increased a little by now; these are the latest available figures. Why do we not have corporate tax figures for after 2011? Why is there a four or five year lag? In itself, this means there is no transparency. In 2006, the total income, given that there were some allowances, was €59 billion and the deductions were €5 billion. In 2011, the total income was €61 billion, but the deductions had increased to €21 billion. The deductions are mostly related to trade charges, whereby one subsidiary of a multinational charges another subsidiary royalties for the use of patents. One part of the company is taxable here while the other is not, but pays tax in the Cayman Islands or somewhere similar. Such trade charges increased from 10% of total profits in 2006 to 33% in 2011. In other words, the multinationals are saying that whatever they do to increase their profits, they will increase the price they pay to themselves to get the profits off the books of the company that is taxable in Ireland and onto the books of a subsidiary of the company that is not taxable in Ireland. They do it completely arbitrarily. I cannot believe the Government or Revenue does not look at the figures and say, “Jesus! How did that happen?” How can their deductions treble within a couple of years without anybody saying that something fishy or some sharp accounting practice is going on? Either it is gross incompetence or we turned a blind eye because we knew exactly what was going on and we decided to do nothing about it. None of it brings us to the question of the 12.5%. It is just about enforcing the 12.5% and ensuring the multinationals are not taking the taxpayer, the tax system and Irish society for a ride by playing around with sharp accounting practice in order to write down their taxable profit. At stake are billions of euro that could have gone into housing, infrastructure and health, and we have done nothing about it. When the European Commission finally screamed "foul" and said we had special deals with companies such as Apple, the Government tooled up with lawyers to fight to ensure we did not get some of the money back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Government not enforce the European Commission's decision on Apple? Why does it not say we will take the money back, the billions of euro in tax these guys have managed to evade by way of sharp accounting practice? Our society and economy are paying a terrible price for it and it must stop. However, there is no will to do it.The comments of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, as reported on the front of today's The Irish Times, suggest that although he understands he has to say he wants to see something done about this, he does not want to go too far. The mantra of this Government is that tax competition is a good thing. The tax specialist Richard Murphy, who has done more than any other individual to expose this practice on an international level, told us at a briefing last week that there is no such thing as good tax competition because the taxpayer, the society and the economy always lose when there is a race to the bottom in terms of corporate tax competition. There might be a short-term gain, but the long-term effect is staggering levels of inequality and the concentration of profits and wealth in the hands of multinationals that essentially hold whole Governments and economies hostage. Just as the multinationals have an aggressive policy of avoiding tax, we must have an aggressive policy of making them pay their taxes, which is something they have not been doing in recent times.
