RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mortgage and negative equity crisis is absolutely massive.  It faces at least 115,000 people who either are in arrears or, as a result of their mortgages being distressed, have had their mortgages restructured.  Moreover, this may only be the beginning of it or, at least, there may be much more to come if the economic situation deteriorates further or if more people get into trouble.  This is an emergency and a potential timebomb unless it is dealt with in a serious, determined, fair and sustainable way.  Most importantly, it is a huge human crisis for those tens of thousands of families racked with anxiety and fear of losing their homes, having debts they simply cannot manage, worrying about their futures and those of their children, as well as about the prospect, if not of losing their homes, of being crippled with debts for years to come.This human tragedy is also an economic emergency because unless this problem is sorted out, the economy will be crippled for years to come.  If this number of people and families are in massive debt, crippled and strangled by it and fighting to keep a roof over their heads, it is obvious they will not have money to spend in the economy and the disastrous stagnation of the domestic economy will continue and worsen.  Consequently, there is both a human and an economic imperative to deal with this crisis.  In order to do so in a meaningful and fair way, one must establish first principles.  This is where the Keane report gets it wrong from the outset.  Its guiding principles say it all by stating:Those who can discharge their mortgage applications must do so.  There is no entitlement to a particular solution and solutions have consequences ... it is inevitable that people will lose their homes ... blanket debt forgiveness ... is not recommended.The report also states the challenges are "to keep people in their homes, where appropriate" and "to avoid inappropriate mortgage holder behaviour, thereby compounding the ... problem".  That says it all about the attitude demonstrated within the Keane report.This is a bankers' report.  Moreover, it is the report of bankers and a Government and State that are in hock to bankers, the first priority of which is to pay back bankers, bondholders and speculators and for which the human needs of the mortgage holders, that is, of the 115,000 or more families struggling with unsustainable levels of debt, come way down the line.  This is the priority and it is spelled out clearly in the report.  From the outset, it was put together with the wrong priorities in mind.Moreover, it says everything about the manner in which the report was put together that those who actually know what the mortgage crisis means and who deal with it on a daily basis were not involved.  Why were organisations such as MABS, the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, New Beginning and Threshold not involved?  These are the organisations which actually are familiar with the plight of mortgage holders.  It reflects everything about the Government's priorities in setting up the Keane group and setting the report's terms of reference that it chose not to include either those whose concern is the actual mortgage holders or representatives of the mortgage holders themselves.  The guiding principles at the beginning of the report set out clearly that the agenda was to do the bidding of the European Union and the IMF yet again.  It was to protect the banks at all costs, squeeze as much money as possible out of ordinary householders to make sure the banks' books balanced, because that is what the IMF and the troika wanted.  They do not give a damn about the human and social consequences, what will happen to the economy or those who may lose their homes.Moreover, all the weasel words Members have heard in this debate in the past two days, in which Members have expressed their concern for mortgage holders and commended MABS, FLAC and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, mean absolutely nothing unless one states, in a way the Keane report point blank refused to do, that one's priority is to assist the mortgage holders who are in this distressed state and their families.  Members must set out meaningful first principles that name the problem as it is.  The first principle with which Members must start is that the crisis, this car crash as Deputy Mathews correctly termed it yesterday, was caused by the greed of bankers, developers and the Fianna Fáil Government which facilitated them every step of the way.  Those who simply sought to put a roof over their heads during a bubble created by the greed of a tiny minority are not responsible and should not be held responsible.  They do not have obligations to pay back the banks, as suggested in the Keane report, because the debt they carry was inflicted on them by the reckless greed, sharp practice and imprudential banking of these financial institutions which created a rigged and distorted market.  Those who simply wanted to satisfy the most basic need to put a roof over their heads and who are entitled to so do could only do so in a rigged and distorted market created by the greed of a tiny minority.  Members' first principle must be that they are there to protect and recommendations, proposals or legislation arising from this debate must state these persons are innocent and do not have obligations.  They have an obligation to keep a roof over their heads and unsaddle them from this massive debt burden inflicted on them by bankers and bondholders and which the IMF and EU troika wish to continue to hold over them.  They must confirm that people have a right to a home.  Particularly when there is a massive oversupply running to tens of thousands of empty homes, the idea that anyone might face eviction is obscene.  There should be no evictions and people saddled with unsustainable debt should have that debt taken from them.As for establishing these first principles, at the very least the Government should take on board the recommendations made by the groups such as MABS, New Beginning and so on which appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday.  These are the first principles that should have informed the report.  Full information must be provided on the extent of distressed mortgages, which still is lacking, and how many more are likely to become distressed.  We need to take all personal debt into account.  People in this situation need representation which should be provided by the State and paid for the banks.  Any arrangement for people in a distressed situation must ensure there is a dignified standard of living for the families in that arrangement and they must retain their dwellings.  Personal insolvency legislation which switches the balance in favour of the borrower and against the bank should be introduced immediately.  Yesterday New Beginning made a suggestion that could be done tomorrow if the Government had the will.  It proposed inserting a clause in existing legislation requiring judges to take into account the personal circumstances of borrowers when dealing with debt situations.If we want to remove the car crash that has been caused by the property bubble and the greed of a minority, there must be debt write-off.  The Government and the Keane report are again disingenuous on the cost of this.  The figure of €14 billion is bandied around, but it was stated that if it was targeted towards people with principal private residences being the criterion, it could be €10 billion and the Central Bank conference on 13 October said the real cost could be €8.3 billion.  We put €70 billion into recapitalising the banks, €24 billion of which was to address distressed mortgages.  We put €35 billion into NAMA and we are paying €200,000 a year to developers who bankrupted this country to manage their assets.  Despite this, the Government is claiming we cannot afford €8 billion or €10 billion to write down the debts of mortgage holders.  Of course we can.  It is a question of which is our priority: to protect bankers and financiers and do what the troika tells us or to protect ordinary householders, who are in a desperate situation through no fault of their own, and allow them keep a roof over their heads.  The choice is the Minister's and he should side with the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You must be joking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I run clinics every week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is welcome to visit my next clinic on Monday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the Minister's information, I run a clinic every week and I am opening an office on the main street in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	None of the Fine Gael Deputies in our area runs clinics, however.  They do not have to deal with people coming in to them.Does the Minister agree that the Keane report got it badly wrong given that it fails to utter one word of criticism of the bankers for their role in this crisis?  Given that its guiding principles do not say anything about the culpability of bankers, developers or Fianna Fáil politicians, it is starting from the wrong point.  Is it not outrageous that the report states there should be no entitlement to particular solutions, that it is inevitable that some will lose their homes and that people should keep their homes "where appropriate"?  The latter statement implies there are times when it is appropriate that a person should not keep his or home and that one of the problems we have to address is inappropriate mortgage holder behaviour.  The entire emphasis of the guiding principles is on the so-called irresponsible mortgage holder.  Does the Minister agree that is a disgraceful starting point for a report?In setting up the terms of reference for the working group, was it not wrong to exclude MABS, FLAC, the Northside Community Law Centre, New Beginning, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and all the other groups which deal daily with the victims of the mortgage crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In directing the debate in the coming days, will the Minister state that the majority of people with distressed mortgages are victims of a problem that was created by bankers?  They do not have an obligation to pay back inflated debts which resulted from the gross distortion of the property market by bankers' reckless lending and developers' irresponsible behaviour.  Does he agree that is the correct starting point?  Will he state that the burden which built up during the property bubble should be removed from the backs of people who bear no responsibility for their unsustainable debt burdens?The Minister claims we cannot afford to write down negative equity and unsustainable debt and that it is theoretical to suggest otherwise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly finished.  How is it that €24 billion was put into the banks to guard against the worst case scenarios, including €8 billion for negative equity and unsustainable debt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to finish the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will not cost the public or the taxpayer any more to write down the negative equity.  The banks will face the cost but that is why the money was given to them.  Unless we take that course of action we will cripple our economy when it suffers the real cost of hundreds of thousands of families saddled with debts they cannot pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All of them were questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why were the mortgage holders blamed then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government needs to get a move on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should they have to plead in front of a judge for leniency in respect of debts that were forced on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A shocking 96,000 people are on housing waiting lists, many for as long as ten years.  Most of the people on the list believe that at the end of their unacceptable wait they will get a council home with proper standards and a housing authority that is accountable to the public in terms of the condition of that housing.  They do not realise that the Minister ended those hopes in June with his proposals on outsourcing social housing to private landlords' leasing arrangements and now with the new proposals on the banks, they may even have bankers as landlords.  This makes no sense in light of the rental revenue lost to the State and the stupidity of handing over €600,000 per year to private landlords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that the Minister seems intent on these reforms, what assurance can he offer that we will not end up with a repeat of the 19th century style of slum landlord?  If there is no regulation, we will return to the tenements of the 19th century.  I have heard appalling stories about the conditions that people face when renting from private landlords, although I do not want to tar all of them with the same brush.  These stories have included RAS tenancies.  What assurances can the Minister give tenants that they will get proper, high quality housing rather than slum landlords?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I followed the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand why we do not build 6,000 houses for the €600 million we are paying out between RAS and the rent allowance.  We would recoup the rental revenue on these properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have social houses.  There are 90,000 people on the housing lists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even though there are 90,000 people on housing lists, the Minister does not want to build social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Instead we will possibly lease property from bankers, private landlords and these private bodies.  In some cases we are paying for the housing that will be managed by the voluntary housing bodies but we will not receive rent.  It does not make sense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are paying out €600 million per year——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——over ten years, we could build all the social housing we need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would have the asset and the rental revenue instead of outsourcing to organisations over which we have no control.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In England they are big business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why will he not make them council houses?
