RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My contribution may be somewhat disjointed because I have been running around dealing with the consequences of IMF-inspired austerity in the form of the household charge.  The bottom line — the point I wish to emphasise above all else — is that we must resist the IMF.  This legislation must not be supported because it is a cosmetic attempt to make the IMF look like a benign entity rather than the vulture it really is, a vulture acting on behalf of the very corporate elites and financial speculators which wrecked the European economy and the Irish economy.  The IMF represents the forces which did the same to other parts of the world in the past.  Now it has moved on to the peripheral countries of Europe and will no doubt move on to the rest of the Continent in due course.It does not at all surprise me that our Government should support the IMF and consent to do deals with it, which is essentially what the Minister's argument seems to be.  If we do a little deal by supporting these so-called reforms, we will in return be thrown a few crumbs from the table in the form of small interest rate reductions.  I argue strongly that we should not be doing deals with the IMF.  It is not helping us and we should not be begging for crumbs from its table.  The devastation to our economy is a consequence of the constraints imposed on us by the IMF and the ECB, at the behest of the private financial system, that is, the bankers and bondholders.  These entities are determined to protect the people who caused the economic crisis and to unload the cost of it onto our backs.  They are forcing the so-called bailout programme down our throats in order to gain control of our economy and hereafter dictate the economic policy of this State.The pattern of IMF intervention over the years has been appalling in the extreme.  It is not an exaggeration to say it has wreaked devastation across the world in every location in which it has intervened.  It is not unlike a drug pusher in this regard.  Its approach is to offer loans to countries in crisis at exorbitant interest rates while imposing austerity to such a severe degree that the society is devastated and its people endure severe suffering.  Ultimately, these countries are placed in a position where they cannot ever repay their loans and are therefore forced perpetually to seek new loans.  It is a downward debt spiral where the only winners are the IMF and the financial interests it champions and represents, namely, the banks and bondholders.The IMF did this in Africa in the 1980s, causing utter devastation to dozens of African countries.  There is always a pattern to its policies, the same policies that are now being unleashed in this country.  The intent is to protect the banks at all costs by ensuring they are repaid, privatising as many state assets as possible, ratcheting down public expenditure, lowering taxes on big business and on wealth, and introducing user charges for public services.  The latter inevitably leads to a devastation of those services and excludes huge sections of the population from accessing them.  This process of introducing user charges opens the way to the privatisation of public services, public enterprises and public assets, which is the real prize.  The IMF sets out to grab resources, create labour market pools and feed assets back to the vultures in the western corporate and financial sector.  After devastating Africa, the IMF repeated that achievement in Asia following the crisis there at the end of the 1990s.  It then intervened in Brazil and elsewhere, imposing the same conditionalities in return for so-called bailouts and thus imposing the same extraordinary damage on those economies.People need to understand that the proposed changes are utterly cosmetic and that the large economic powers will remain absolutely in control of the IMF.  Oxfam has roundly condemned the proposals for so-called reform as absolutely inadequate and as leaving the poorest countries in the world, including those in sub-Saharan Africa — all of the countries which have been victims of the IMF — with virtually no representation of any significance within the organisation and no opportunity to influence its policies.  All that is being done is to increase very slightly the voting strength of the so-called BRIC countries.  It is indicative of the notion of democracy in institutions such as the IMF and also indicative of a capitalist notion of democracy generally.  Democracy to most of us means everyone having an equal vote and an equal say.  This is not how it works in the IMF.  It works like the democracy of a private corporation whereby those with the most shares have the most say.  It is not that every voter has an equal weight but rather those with the most money have the most voting power.  This shift in the structure of the board simply recognises that Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa, are now major players in the global economy and emerging global powers.  Their economic strength has to be reflected by them being brought into the club of dominant powers within the IMF, in order to then dictate and ram down the throats of everybody else in the world the economic policies which suit their interests and which subscribe to a particular ideological doctrine which I have described, one of privatisation, the slashing of public services, smashing up protections for workers and for the environment.  This is the agenda.  Even that cosmetic change, which is certainly not a move towards any notion of real democracy or international co-operation or solidarity, has been forced on them.  The reason it has been forced on them was that in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, Asian countries and places like Brazil, which had been devastated by IMF policies, started to pull out of the IMF.  They refused to give it money, to the point that the IMF had to start selling gold in order to replenish its funds and, interestingly, move into the bond market.  This is where it gets really interesting.  In 2008, Dominique Strauss-Kahn talked about the IMF diversifying into investment into corporate bonds and state bonds.  We do not know who are the bondholders but one has to wonder if the IMF moved into bonds in 2008, whether the IMF bondholders are in the Irish banks, in Anglo, and whether they are the ones we are repaying.  The judgment of people who know a lot about the IMF is not one that gives much reason for optimism.For example, in October, the Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, said that Brazil would put more money into the fund in exchange for more voting rights but then she went on to criticise IMF conditionality.  She said: "We will never accept, as participants of the IMF, that certain conditions that were imposed on us be imposed on other countries."  He pointed to and understood the way the IMF works——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.  That is well spotted by the Deputy opposite.  However, it does not change the substance of my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The conditionalities.  Yes, but wait until the Minister feels the effects.  He should look at what the IMF did to other countries.Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist who worked closely with the IMF for ten years until he became a whistleblower on the reality of the IMF, was damning in his description of the IMF.  He said:When the IMF arrives in a country, they are interested in only one thing: how do we make sure the banks and financial institutions are paid.  It is the IMF that keeps the financial speculators in business.  They are not interested in development or what helps to get a country out of poverty.This is the view of an insider who knows and whose economic credentials are unquestioned.  This is who we are huddling up to and for whom we are doing favours.  This is the body we are helping to re-legitimise in order to get a few crumbs off its table.  I warn the Minister however cute he may imagine he is being, in the nod and a wink politics of doing it a little favour and it will do us a favour in return, the IMF is playing him.  It is playing him like it has played every other country in which it has ever intervened.  As Joseph Stiglitz said, all it is interested in is giving the money back to the banks and the financial institutions and the speculators and it does not care about poverty, economic recovery or anything else.  The IMF has admitted to these motives.The issue of jobs is one of the most important issues facing this country.  I ask what is the IMF attitude towards job creation.  I refer to the IMF website where it is stated that the IMF admits that its support to countries is not structured with the centrality of jobs in mind.  That is for sure.  In fact, what the IMF demands of countries is the massacre of jobs in the public sector. The IMF programme has a policy to keep slashing jobs.On the question of who benefits, I will draw the attention of the Minister to recent replies to parliamentary questions.  They provide some indication of who benefits from the massacre of jobs in the public sector.  I have not received all the replies from Departments as most of them are stonewalling me about supplying detailed answers.  The replies provide all the narrative of attacking the public sector which is being reinforced by the IMF.  It is the policy to make savings by axing public sector jobs.  An audit of this practice is required across the board.  One small State agency under the Minister's auspices, the National Sports Council, has eight agency staff employed through employment agencies, Orange, Hays and Calix.  Six of those staff cost €264,000 a year.  If those were directly employed, those staff would cost €203,000, a difference of €51,000.  This is the cost of outsourcing to a private agency, Orange.  This difference of €51,000 is profit for those employment agencies paid for from public moneys.  Another worker could be employed for that amount or a saving could be made.  The Hays agency earned €76,000 for the provision of one staff member and if that individual were to be employed directly it would cost the State €51,000.  Calix provides one employee at a cost of €83,000 and if employed directly this employee would cost the State €51,000.  If this is repeated across the public sector, local authorities and State agencies, it amounts to a loss to the Exchequer, apart from anything else, of millions and millions of euro.  It could be tens of millions of euro or possibly hundreds of millions of euro.My own local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, has a budget of €220 million and €140 million was spent on outsourcing to private contractors.  I could not get any answers as to how much was being paid to private contractors and whether it was value for money.  The private contractors, the consultants, benefit.  This is what the IMF forces on us.  We are told to do away with decent and secure jobs, well-paid jobs and jobs that are good value for money for the public and to replace them with agency staff who have fewer rights but the private operator makes a nice fat profit.Will we do anything about this?  We will probably do nothing because the IMF's ideological position is that we must privatise and cut jobs, which is what it demands in its stability programme.The other thing about the IMF that should worry us is just how bad it is at predicting the impact of its own economic and structural adjustments — the so-called programmes.  It admits on its website that it fails to predict growth in economies, confirming that its "GDP growth forecasts showed a tendency to systematically exceed outcomes."  "This phenomenon", it noted, "was particularly prevalent in countries with an IMF-supported program."  It is important to note this failure when considering our prospects as we reel under the impact of IMF austerity, cutbacks, privatisations and the sale of State assets.  If there is any justification for these measures, it must be that somehow — magically — they will produce economic growth.  The IMF admits, however, that it has been proven wrong in all countries where it has imposed its programmes telling them they may feel a little pain for a while but will eventually recover.  Its programmes have not produced growth and employment but the opposite, namely, stagnation and recession.  The banks and corporations which were moving in on the state assets and natural resources of the countries in question got their money, however.  That is the real agenda of the IMF.While the Minister may not be remotely interested in my next point, it may be of some interest to members of the public.  The reason the IMF was under pressure to make changes and the reason organisations such as Oxfam commented on the role of the institution was that by the end of the 1990s people had grown sick and tired of what it was doing to the world.  This led to massive protests in Seattle, Genoa, Prague and elsewhere which became known as the anti-globalisation movement.  The protests rounded on the IMF and World Bank for the way they had ravaged countries with their neoliberal wrecking doctrine which had caused massive poverty, major increases in child mortality, the destruction of infrastructure and the rape of the assets and natural resources of developing countries.  Such was the scale of the anti-globalisation movement, which reached its high point when millions of people — peasant groups, community groups, trade unions and others — took to the streets of cities around the world to say the IMF had wrecked their societies, caused immense poverty and accelerated growth in the gap between rich and poor, that the institution found itself in serious trouble and its future in question.  As a result, it was forced to start to make what appeared to be concessions but which were simply efforts to bolster the real character of the institution.  As we know, the true nature of the IMF and World Bank is to act as the bootboys of global capitalism.  They are modelled on a corporate structure in which those who have money call the shots.  We should not be taken in for a moment by the suggestion that we will somehow gain something out of the IMF-ECB programme.  By saddling us with the debts of bondholders, the IMF and ECB will cripple growth and the economy.  The programme will be used as an excuse to ram down our throats the neoliberal dogma that has wrecked Africa and Asia and done extreme damage to Latin America.When the Government develops its policy of essentially sucking up to the ECB, IMF and other institutions I wonder if it has any sense of history or knows anything about what the IMF has done elsewhere in the world.  Does it listen to experts such as Joseph Stiglitz or Paul Krugman?  Who does it listen to and from whom does it take advice on how to deal with these matters?  I was given a little insight in this regard yesterday in a response to a parliamentary question I had submitted to the Department of Finance.  This shocking information I received may or may not be in the public domain.  The reply stated that in 2010 the National Treasury Management Agency paid out €6.2 million to the Rothschild Group for advice on how to deal with the banking crisis.  While the payment was made under the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, I ask the Minister if he will indicate whether the Department continues to take advice from this company and if the Government was taking advice from it at the time of the bank guarantee.  Notwithstanding how the Minister may answer those questions, the Department was taking advice from the Rothschild Group at the end of 2010 when we were deciding whether to sign up to the EU-IMF programme.Rothschild is a bond trading company which represents the global super-rich, the multimillionaires and multibillionaires who hold our bonds.  Let us get this straight.  The Department, under the Minister's predecessor, paid €6.2 million to ask the representatives of the bondholders if we should repay their clients.  Not surprisingly, the Rothschild Group advised that the bondholders should be repaid.  The decision to follow its advice has sunk the country.  While the Minister has become more muted on this issue, at the time he was critical of the decision to repay the bondholders, describing it as morally wrong and economically unsustainable to ransom the country to protect the interests of bankers and bondholders.  He made a statement to this effect in February of this year.  Given that bondholders would benefit from the advice that we should sacrifice the economy and impose brutal austerity on citizens, one would expect Rothschild to offer it free of charge.  Instead, it charged us €6.2 million for doing so, which is amazing.  Talk about golden circles; not only do such circles operate at the crony level of this country but we are now linked into the golden circles of the IMF, the Rothschild Group and bondholders, with the ECB dictating policy.  It beggars belief that this company is advising us.Rather than trying to prop up a vulture institution such as the IMF or give it any legitimacy, we should tell it and the bondholders to get lost.  We should address our problems rather than become the victims of what are essentially drug pushers who are pressing us to take on the debt and austerity that will cripple our society and economy.  This is what the IMF has done everywhere else.I make the following point due to sheer frustration.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform I asked members of the Fiscal Advisory Council,  which monitors the Government's macroeconomic policy, about the council's growth projections.  Irish growth projections have been already been downgraded and, as I noted, the IMF admits it always gets its projections wrong.  Various reports, experts, media articles and so on which projected a return to growth in 2012 or 2013 have subsequently been revised as the authors realised closer to the relevant time that we would not achieve growth.  In light of the downgrading of Ireland's projected rate of growth for next year, I pointed out to the Fiscal Advisory Council that its charts showing an upward curve from 2013 onwards indicate that it predicts austerity will produce growth from 2013 onwards.They have also admitted that their initial growth projection for 2012 was wrong.  They are continuing to say there will be increased growth in 2013 and 2014.  I asked them to outline the evidence that those growth projections are accurate in any way.  They could not answer.  Their projections are collations of the growth projections of the IMF, the Central Bank and the ECB etc.  Where is the evidence for what they are all projecting?  In some cases, they are projecting on the basis of each other's projections.  When an organisation learns of the IMF's projection, it amends its own growth projection by a couple of points.  When I sought hard evidence and mentioned the concrete evidence before us that austerity is crippling the economy and strangling growth, I was eventually told that historical models form the basis for the growth projections.  That is alarming.What historical models are being used?  Is consideration being given to the history of the IMF everywhere it has gone?  I suggest we would be better off to look at the historical model of what happened in the 1920s and 1930s, when there was a crisis of the same sort.  The same policies of austerity were imposed and the result was the Great Depression.  That is where we are heading now.  The IMF is leading us down the track towards a depression.  We should tell it to get stuffed.
