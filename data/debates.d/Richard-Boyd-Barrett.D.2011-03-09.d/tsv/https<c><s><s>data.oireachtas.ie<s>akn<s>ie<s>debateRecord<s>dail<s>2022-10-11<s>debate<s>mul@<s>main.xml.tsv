RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of People Before Profit-Solidarity, I extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to all those who lost family members and friends and to the wider Creeslough community. What that community has suffered with the events on Friday is utterly unspeakable. No words we can say can possibly compensate for the shocking loss and tragedy they have experienced, but they deserve tribute for the incredible dignity and heroism they have demonstrated in the face of this horrendous, unspeakable tragedy. As others have done, I also pay tribute to all the emergency services, who have done such heroic work. I know our words cannot compensate, but I hope the solidarity, the wishes and the thoughts that are being sent not just from this House but from all over the country can play some very small part in trying to comfort the family members and friends who have lost loved ones, as well as the community of Creeslough, at this dark time for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will be aware that there are many thousands of people with defects in their homes arising from the behaviour of the cowboy builders of the Celtic tiger era. The latter did even not deem it necessary to build proper houses. People are facing huge bills in the context of fire safety issues, water ingress and so on. There is one particular case that I would like the Taoiseach to look into, namely, that relating to Carrickmines Green. The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is control of that estate and is refusing to remedy building defects, even though it has done so elsewhere. I am told by residents that NAMA has sold units to people who do not know that there are serious building defects. This is despite the fact that the residents themselves cannot sell, get insurance and so on. The Minister for Finance should instruct NAMA and its liquidators to remediate those homes as it has done in other estates where it has been in control of the properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach knows, we are in not only a climate emergency but also a biodiversity emergency, and often the latter is forgotten and neglected. That is particularly important when we think about our marine area and the protection of it. Not only is that sea an unparalleled store of biodiversity but it is also the most important carbon sink. If we destroy marine biodiversity or if we do not have a proper system for ensuring it is developed in a sustainable way, we will do double the damage to both biodiversity and the attempt to battle climate change. Against that background, I strongly urge the Taoiseach to study the identifying areas of interest for marine protected area, MPA, designation produced by the Fair Seas group. It castigates the Government for the fact that only 2% of our areas have been designated whereas we need to have a minimum of 30%, and points out that many of the self-selected sites for offshore industrial wind are on sites that would destroy potential marine protected areas. Will he look into that and ensure our marine is not destroyed by profit-driven companies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It means that developers cannot select their own sites at the expense of the marine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Developers should not select their own sites.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The developers are going to choose their own sites.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here we go again with Fianna Fáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are; they have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has designated the relevant project.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly what I am talking about.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many if not most organisations advocating for people with disabilities were extremely disappointed with the budget. One of the demands they all rallied behind was that there should be a cost-of-disability premium to bring minimum payments for people with disabilities up to €350 per week, as we deemed appropriate during Covid, and that people with disability should get at least that in recognition of the huge costs of living with disability. I was at a briefing with Inclusion Ireland where some shocking facts were relayed on our lack of provision for people with disabilities. I was informed that 2,500 people are unnecessarily living in institutions and that 1,300 people below the age of 65 are living in nursing homes. I was also informed that many young people are still living with parents who are their carers. However for 1,500 of those people, their carers are over the age of 70 and for 400 of them their carers are over the age of 80, begging the question of who will care for these people when their parents pass on. I will name a few of the issues as follows. There is also a lack of therapeutic resources and supports in schools for young people with special needs. The Government has failed to seriously address all these things and to ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Equality is a right for people with disabilities but the Government has not matched that with budgetary measures or with policy measures generally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week in the House, we discussed the issue of disconnections for users of prepay meters. On Friday, after holding my weekly clinic, I went to meet senior citizens who live in council accommodation. While I was meeting these elderly residents, an emergency occurred. They informed me of a man who had just got out of hospital, having spent five or six months there following multiple strokes, and who needed a nebuliser to allow him to continue breathing and so on. He had been released from hospital earlier in the week and when he opened the door of his house, he discovered that the prepay electricity had been disconnected while he was in hospital. Unbeknown to him, while he was in hospital, he was being charged €1.50 a day, which had clocked up to a grand total of €365. Unless he had the money to pay that debt of €365, he would have no electricity. For the next three or four days, therefore, he had nowhere to plug in his nebuliser, no cooker, no lighting and no power in his house. When we walked into the house to meet him, he was bawling crying. This elderly man had been reduced to tears and was terrified as to how he would address this. Luckily, we got him sorted that day, although it was extremely difficult and involved phoning PrepayPower and the council and, eventually, after much argument, getting a code from them because we stressed that this man's life was danger, that his health was at stake and that he had been left in this utterly unacceptable position for several days. Even we had difficulty putting in codes and so on to finally get his electricity turned back on. Quite honestly, that man is lucky to be alive, given he had nowhere to plug in his nebuliser. When the Government states that there should be no disconnections and commits to doing its best or endeavouring or whatever the expression is to ensure that people on prepay power will not be cut off, here is an example of what actually happened to a sick and vulnerable elderly man. We need certainty, and people like that man and many others who could find themselves in that situation this winter need cast-iron guarantees that they are not going to be disconnected. What is particularly shocking in this case is that people can be disconnected and find themselves with a €365 bill without even having used the electricity. It is beyond belief. We hear these somewhat abstract debates in the House or abstract assurances from the Government, but that is the reality of what goes on. I will now similarly set out the situation for people who use district heating systems. The Government, and in particular the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, should know this because Clúid, Tuath and Respond, all of which provide social housing to people on the lowest incomes, wrote to him earlier this year warning him of the dire situation facing many of their tenants in social housing who had experienced increases of up to 600% in their energy costs, with bills rising from average figures of about €50 a month to €150 a month.These massive increases are completely unsustainable. They appealed to the Minister in February or March to do something about this but, as of now, nothing has been done. I have some bills in front of me from one of the district heating companies. Thousands of people are caught in these situations, but I want to underline the fact that many of them are social housing tenants. People are also affected by this more generally, however. The bills are quite extraordinary. People are paying unit rates that are approximately treble what most people pay. The energy hikes are affecting most people but this is far worse. The biggest component of the bill is a network heating charge. The latter is approximately 50% of every bill. Even if a person does not turn on the heating, he or she is paying this charge. A person pays a standing charge and a network heating charge, which is the biggest component of the bill. I am looking at a bill for €489 for 59 days. Some €91 of that is for user charges, €26 is for standing charges and €110 is for a network heating charge. In other words, a person pays it regardless of whether he or she uses any electricity. Something has to be done about the extortionate rates that are being charged to people on district heating systems.
