RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins. In fairness, they have not gone into the individual adjudications, if you like. What they are saying is incredibly relevant because it underlines the point that the sole purpose of this tax relief is to create quality employment and training and to contribute to Irish culture. If it does not do those things, then it should not be paid out. More to the point, the recipients of that must sign a solemn declaration saying they are doing that. Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins have spelled this out, but if they feel there is anything more they can say to do so, then they should, because as I look on, there is an incredible, gross contradiction. On the one hand, film producers last year could get €100 million for this by signing a solemn undertaking they are creating quality employment and training, and then the very same people can walk into the WRC and say they can have no employment relationship with the people who worked on the film production. It is not just that they do not have an employment relationship with Mr. Arkins or a particular individual but that they say they cannot have an employment relationship with them. They are blaming section 481, which is dubious, to put it mildly, but it is an incredible contradiction. I do not know if Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins want to spell that out. In that regard, I ask them to elaborate the point about the EU directives on state aid and industry development, because from my reading of this, the only reason the EU allows particular forms of state aid is to create a permanent pool of talent. How do you create a permanent pool if the people who get the state aid say they cannot under any circumstances have any employees? It is hard for me to understand how that can be sustained and whether it has to be investigated. Ms Murray and Mr. Arkins may have some comments on that. Another question I am interested in relates to something our guests often say. Maybe it is worth underlining the figures for how much has gone into section 481 over the past decade. Our guests always put it fairly starkly by asking what we have got for all that public money. Can anybody think of any other area of expenditure where the State would have forked out €4 billion and have nothing, literally nothing, for it, namely, no employees, no ownership of content, no studios, no equipment and no props? We have literally nothing. Maybe they could say a little about where that money is going or where they think it is going because, at the end of it, the State does not seem to have anything for the investment. Where is the physical equipment bought with section 481 money on film productions going?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just to be clear, that stuff is bought with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With taxpayer's money, yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are paying for the same stuff over and over again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe Ms Murray will say a little about the EU directive conditions on state aid for the film and audiovisual industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the other things about which I am curious because I have read the Equity submission - I think this committee needs to seriously investigate this - is that the producers who receive section 481 assistance on the explicit requirement of creating employment and training, but then say they are not and could never be an employer when asked by employees for their rights, also seem to have ownership of the content about which we are talking. At the very least, there is a question mark over where the ownership of the content goes. In its submission, Equity says that in respect of the intellectual property and the royalties that would flow from their share of that intellectual property, they are either asked to sign away their entitlement or to get a far lower proportion of it than in other jurisdictions. Is it the case that the producer is saying on one hand that it cannot have employees but on the other that it owns the intellectual property?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So in a word, would Mr. Arkins advise that we need to talk to the producers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Arkins think we are in serious breach of EU directives around state aid, etc? I think we are, and I would like a comment on this point. I refer as well to companies of scale and the other conditions in respect of what is happening in the context of section 481. I would also like Mr. Arkins to comment briefly on the studios here. I am curious about this point. Public money was involved in Troy Studios, was it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also think I am correct in saying that public money was originally involved in Ardmore Studios.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are film studios. I think it is legitimate to mention film studios. I honestly do. Can we not mention film studios?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will just call them film studios, including the former national studio. To ensure I understand this aspect, I think public money went into all these studios and the ongoing operation of section 481 would have contributed to their maintenance. Is it correct to say those studios have no employees?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are no crew workers in those studios, however.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps I am innocent, but it seems very odd to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. O'Brien and Ms Quinn. It is to be hoped that what they described will be an eye-opener for people. We all agree, as they do, that we want to see continued State support for film, the arts and culture but we want it to benefit performers, actors and crews. They are telling us that support is not doing as it should in respect of that. To put it bluntly, and I asked this at a previous meeting, would the representatives agree we are in breach of the legislation regarding copyright? The way in which it is now being operated by producers means that we are quite simply in breach of copyright legislation and the similar directives from which that legislation flows - the witnesses can probably clarify that. There is a problem here with legal compliance, which is then seriously disadvantaging - I could probably use stronger words - performers from getting the value of the work they have done. One question I have in that regard is to ask the Irish Equity representatives to spell out the buy-out contract business and the pressure its members are put under to get work that means they have to, in many cases, in effect sign away their rights to their intellectual property, and the value of their performances as tied up in copyright and intellectual property. I suspect many people do not know this. Maybe they could elaborate a little on that point. I have a couple of other questions but maybe they could start with that. Related to that, what do they think those working in the UK or other jurisdictions think about the conditions Irish Equity members have to endure here? Are they shocked when they encounter what is going on for its members here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does. It is a very stark picture and rather a depressing one, with all of this public money going in. I will fire a few more questions at Mr. O'Brien before my time runs out and I hope he can come back on them, and I know Ms Quinn also wants to come in. I understood from hearing what was said earlier that one contrast is that if someone is working on a film in Ireland just for a few days, they might then be laid off and they would have to go back on social welfare, and they might then come in for another few days and go back on social welfare again, whereas in the UK, people actually get paid throughout the period. That seems like a big contrast and perhaps Mr. O'Brien can spell out that. Second, what happens to an actor who says, “I do not want to sign the buy-out contract”? When they do sign it, who ends up with the value of their intellectual property? Who walks off with it? The DAC ceases to exist after a year, so who actually goes off with all the money? As well as the actors getting back some of the money they should be getting, should the State be getting back some of that money because of its investment through section 481? Who actually gets it? Irish Equity mentioned in its longer submission that there was potential abuse of tax credits through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies, which sounds pretty ominous. The witnesses might spell out what that means.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. O'Brien answered many of the questions. I had asked what happens to actors and performers who do not want to sign a buy-out contract? How likely are they to get work if they were to say something like that? I asked the question about something in the executive summary of Irish Equity's main submission which our committee should certainly take very seriously. It pointed out that the risks with section 481 include potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies. That sounds quite ominous. It made similar references to problems with the entire DAC structure and a potential for abuse within the DAC structure. I would like to get elaboration on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Quinn and Mr. O'Brien.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The arts committee in 2018 recommended such a stakeholder forum. It should have happened but never did and we are the worse for it. It should happen as a matter of urgency. The DAC structure seems incredibly problematic. They are like mushrooms jumping up and down. They appear, disappear and make the whole thing opaque. You do not know where your intellectual property rights are gone. Nobody quite knows who the employer is. Nobody wants a cent less going into film; in fact, I think we want all the money going into section 481 and more to go into stimulating the sort of industry witnesses have described and would like to see, with dignity for all involved and experience, gelling into a growing and developing industry. It seems to me the DAC structure and the way we are funding via section 481 militate against that. If there were a model that had the same amount or more but that did not go through this opaque, complex structure and was done in another way, maybe more directly funded, might that not be better? Connected to that, would we learn a bit from talking directly to film producers? We have never had a chance to talk to them in all of this. The witnesses say they do not know where their intellectual property is, while our previous panellists said we should ask the film producers. Nobody seems to know but somebody must know. I thank both witnesses.
