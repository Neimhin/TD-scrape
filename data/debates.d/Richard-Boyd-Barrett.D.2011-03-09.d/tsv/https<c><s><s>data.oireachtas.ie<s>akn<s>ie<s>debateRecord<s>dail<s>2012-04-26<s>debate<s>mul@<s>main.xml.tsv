RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under the influence of austerity the European economy plunged back into crisis this week.  The chorus of opposition to Angela Merkel's austerity treaty has increased, with unions and governments across Europe, including some of the Tánaiste's former comrades in the Irish trade union movement, have come out against the treaty on the basis that the austerity required would be disastrous.  The Government stands almost alone with Angela Merkel in continuing to promote this treaty as a good thing.In that context, the Taoiseach stated yesterday that the citizens of this country should have access to every piece of available information on the fiscal treaty prior to the referendum.  That commitment is hard to credit given that the Government has hidden the troika away from the press and Opposition precisely because it might make comments that will upset the citizens.  If the Taoiseach's commitment is a serious one, what will it cost the State to meet the treaty's targets for 2015 and beyond in regard to reducing the debt to 0.5% and the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60%?  I will be helpful in this regard.  The Central Bank quarterly bulletin for April indicates that our GDP is €162 billion.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio is due to reach 120% by 2014, which means a national debt of €200 billion.  Reducing that to 60% would require us to halve our national debt -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- to €100 billion and one twentieth of that equates to €5 billion per year in cuts over 20 years in order to pay down the debt, on top of whatever cuts are necessary to meet the deficit targets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are those figures correct and, if not, can the Tánaiste -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The claim that we are likely to grow our way out of this recession is a fairy tale given the current economic climate and the figures available to us.The latest victim of the austerity and the crisis in Europe is our biggest trading partner, Britain, which has dipped further into recession-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----following on EUROSTAT figures and purchasing manager index figures that show the European economy contracting.  I ask the Tánaiste to answer the question I put to him.  What will be the cost to the State according to the figures that are available to us now in terms of the size of our GDP and the projected size of our national debt in 2015 when we are due to exit the programme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The estimates in the public domain suggest that it will require €5 billion annually in cuts to meet the debt-to-GDP ratio targets and approximately €5 billion to €6 billion in cuts to meet the deficit targets after 2015.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That level of cutting and austerity would devastate our economy and further devastate our society.  I ask the Tánaiste to give us the figures because those figures are damning-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and will mean a generation of austerity which will cripple the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What will it cost?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The treaty states-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste is not answering the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Ceann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made in recent days but again, on this last day, before the guillotine falls, it is absolutely wrong for the Government to impose this guillotine on such important legislation.  Yesterday, we spent the best part of three hours debating one section of the Bill that deals with, in our opinion, the disgraceful cuts to lone parents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We needed that much time to discuss that section alone and probably could have done with more.  We still have an entire rake of sections to discuss that deal with important matters, such as the change in mortgage interest supplement that could cause real problems for mortgage holders in distress and the changes to jobseeker's benefit which will see part-time workers losing €20 or €30 a week.  These are very serious issues affecting groups in our society who are under serious pressure and no guillotine should be imposed by this Government.  We object very strongly to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Lone parents will not be getting those jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section essentially deals with the phasing in of the abolition of one-parent family payments for lone parents when their children reach the age of seven.  The Minister has suggested that the cut in payments to lone parents when their children reach the age of seven is designed to help them become financially independent, that is, to encourage them to get back to work.  The truth is that these are complex transition arrangements designed to minimise the outrage that is likely to be felt, and is being felt, by lone parents as it becomes apparent that the Government is targeting them for a nasty regressive cut that is going to have precisely the opposite effect to the one that the Government claims it wants to achieve, namely, it is going to drive lone parents out of work.  Lone parents and organisations representing them who have examined the measures are clear that this would be the effect of the changes, namely, to drive lone parents out of work, exactly the opposite of what the Government has said it wants to achieve.These sections are designed as the intricate machinery that is required to try to minimise the level of popular anger and protest over what the Government is trying to do.  There would be uproar if the Government reduced the eligibility for all lone parents with immediate effect when their children reach the age of seven.  The protests we have seen to date would be multiplied by ten or probably a hundred in terms of their size.  This measure is designed in a deceptive fashion to phase in the change gradually so that the real impact will be felt a little further down the line and for new applicants for the lone-parents payment.  The choreography of the nasty cut masquerading as something progressive cannot hide the simple fact about the legislation, namely, that it is difficult for lone parents to get jobs or to access education because they are lone parents and they need child care.  It is as simple as that.  Whether lone parents are trying to get jobs or access education and to upskill in order to access the jobs market, they need child care.  Lone parents need child care whether their child is aged one to seven or beyond that from seven to at least 14 years.  They need support in order to be able to access education and jobs and this measure takes that support away from them.The Minister's suggestion that new applicants will be able to apply for jobseeker's allowance poses a real question which she should answer directly.  If someone is to be entitled to jobseeker's allowance, do they not have to be available for work?  Is that not the simple criteria; that one will be interrogated by the local social welfare office about whether one is available for work.  If one does not have the means to provide child care for one's children, one is not available for work and it is as simple as that.  One would have to lie to the social welfare office to suggest one was available for work and, therefore, one would not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance as currently constituted.Lone parent payments were not so great in the first place but they gave a little bit of a leg up to lone parents to be able to cover the cost of child care.  It is completely inadequate given the very high cost of child care in the State, its lack of availability and the extreme difficulty of getting one of the very few jobs now available.  It is to the immense credit of lone parents that approximately 60% of them are in employment at present given the lack of support and the lack of affordable child care available to them.  They have made a supreme effort.  The lone parent payments have been of some assistance, although entirely inadequate, in allowing lone parents to access jobs.  This support, which has assisted to some degree in getting lone parents back into the workforce and education, is to be removed once their children reach the age of seven.  This is the simple fact and there is nothing else before us.We have received an off-the-cuff remark and verbal commitments to putting in place child care facilities and other supports which would mitigate against the impact of this nasty regressive cut.  However, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, nothing concrete is on the legislative programme and nobody believes it is credible that these supports will be in place.  I presume the Government simply hopes the hullabaloo and anger will have died down by the end of the year, that people will just have to resign themselves to this nasty cut and its consequences and that they will forget about the Government's commitments to a Scandinavian model of child care.The engineering of the phasing in period is amazingly intricate.  Trying to work it all out and figure out at what point people's entitlements begin to be reduced indicates it took much thought and work, and fair play to the officials for working it all out.  However, they are operating under a political direction from the Minister and the Government.  Where is the intricate engineering when it comes to putting alongside it and running parallel to it child care supports and facilities and other arrangements to compensate for the cut in lone parents' payments once children reach the age of seven or the various ages in the phasing in period?  This is the simple reality of the Bill and the section.  It contains complex engineering to cut the entitlement of lone parents to the vital support they need if they are to access employment and education driving out of work people who want to work and contribute to society.  It is unbelievably regressive.When Fianna Fáil reduced the age from 18 to 14, the now Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, stated reducing it to the age of 13 would drive 12,000 more people onto the live register and out of work.  Why does this logic not still apply?  Is this another treacherous U-turn by the Labour Party turning on the very people who probably voted for it looking for protection?  It has turned on them, driving lone parents, mostly young women who are struggling as it is, out of the workforce and back into dependency on social welfare and the poverty that goes with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Good quality, cheap, affordable child care services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister deserves a medal for the smokescreen she has created in order to present this regressive legislation as something positive for lone parents.  She waxed lyrical about a preposterous vision for a wonderful child care and education system which would make lone parent payments unnecessary.  Let us clear the decks of the red herrings.  All of us would like the level of public services available in the countries to which the Minister referred.  The difference is that Finland, Germany and Sweden have state-of-the-art education systems and child care supports that are affordable or, in some cases, free.  If this or any other Government succeeds in putting such systems in place, I will be the first to applaud.However, we have to start from where lone parents are at present.  How will lone parents be impacted by the changes introduced in this Bill?  They will gradually come into force over the next several years until we reach a point where lone parents will not receive payments once their children reach the age of seven.It would be useful to rehearse the concerns raised by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, with the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Cuív, in June 2010 in regard to proposals to reduce the age limit for eligibility to lone parent payments to 13.  This is relevant because after next week new applicants with children aged 12 or 13 years will not be entitled to lone parent payments.  She stated:For those who manage to find work, the main problem will undoubtedly be who will mind their children when they are at work.  Most will not be able to afford to pay someone else to do it.  What is a lone parent to do during their summer months when his or her child is off school?  Teenagers are off school for three months in the summer.  Is it now Government policy for 13 year olds to have no parental supervision and to be left to their own devices during the three months of their summer holidays?  I would like the Minister to address that point in responding to the debate tomorrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the Ceann Comhairle's point but these specific amendments deal -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They pertain to the transition from the current age limit of 14 years to seven years.  There will be an immediate impact on new applicants who have children aged 12 or 13 years and from next year the measure will affect new applicants with children aged ten years or older.  This change will directly affect lone parents' ability to access employment and education.  While the Minister is trying to justify it as a labour activation measure designed to assist lone parents, it will in fact have the opposite effect, as her colleague pointed out when similar moves were made by the previous Government.  Therefore, the quote is relevant to these specific amendments.  Speaking when in opposition, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, continued:Just because a child is 13 does not mean he or she can look after himself or herself.  Has the Government even considered the social consequences of this?  There are huge implications for anti-social behaviour, drug abuse and, ironically, teenage pregnancy.  Has the Minister really thought this through?  It seems from his comments to date that very little thought has been given to the likely fall-out of his proposed changes ... it costs substantially more to raise a teenager than it does to raise a younger child.The withdrawal of one parent family payment will in many cases create an additional barrier to school completion and to third level education.  If the teenage children of lone parents realise that their parents are in far more strained financial circumstances under the Minister's new arrangements than they currently are, it will inevitably have a knock-on impact in terms of the ability of teenagers in poor lone parent families to remain in school.  The pressure will undoubtedly grow on them to leave school early and try to find work.  The pressures working against the possibility of them participating in third level education will be even greater.Will the operational guidelines for the jobseekers allowance be amended to reflect that for some parents the cost of after school care will represent a poverty trap?I could not put it better than that.  I do not understand how the Labour Party could argue all of this in 2010 and now argue for precisely the opposite.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, believed at the time it would drive lone parents out of work and would act as a disincentive for them and their children to access education and employment.  The Minister is trying to convince us that the same measures will actually assist people into education and employment.  It does not add up.  Therefore, one can only conclude it is a smokescreen.The other big difference between our country and the other countries the Minister mentioned is that they do not have the same unemployment crisis we have.  Where are these jobs?  To put it simply, as of next week a new applicant for one-parent family payment with a child of 12 or 13 years of age will not be eligible and will be refused.  What is such a person to do?  Earlier I asked the Minister a question that she did not answer.  I believe she said yesterday that such a person should apply for jobseeker's allowance.  However, a person, who is minding his or her children and, therefore, not available for work would not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance.  How can somebody, who is not available for work, be entitled to jobseeker's allowance without lying and claiming he or she is available when he or she is not?  That will be true for new applicants from January 2013 if their children are aged ten or older.  It continues until the age limit of seven is reached.As of next week lone parents with children aged 12 or 13 will be disadvantaged.  The Minister cannot tell me that by next week this beautiful vision of child care support and education support, to which we would all subscribe, will be in place.  That is preposterous.  I ask the Minister to tell the truth.  It has nothing to do with Leon Trotsky or jibes about Killiney and the north side and all the rest of it.  That is demeaning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an appalling comment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not make any comment about women.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Almost, if the Minister will stop barracking me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is nothing to withdraw.  The Minister should-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will look at the record.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could you ask the Minister to stop barracking me, a Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Minister might desist then.What should be withdrawn are these measures which will attack mostly women, lone parents, who form one of the most vulnerable and impoverished sectors in our society as the Minister acknowledges.  Given that there are no complementary supports in terms of child care or education to compensate for the loss of these payments, how can the Minister paint removing these supports as anything other than a nasty attack?On the issue of name-calling and the rest of it, I cannot see how this is motivated by anything other than a belief in some of the stereotying and stigmatisation of lone parents that has justified the attacks on them in the past.  It is appalling that the Minister would be involved in justifying any of that because I do not believe she herself believes any of those stereotypes and yet this legislation can only be motivated by that because that is the effect it will have.  It will attack those very sectors of society which two years ago the Minister and her party colleagues were championing and defending against precisely this sort of legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is being disingenuous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was pointing out that such unacceptable language was used about women and lone parents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was saying it is unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was pointing out that lone parents have been stigmatised with such terms.
