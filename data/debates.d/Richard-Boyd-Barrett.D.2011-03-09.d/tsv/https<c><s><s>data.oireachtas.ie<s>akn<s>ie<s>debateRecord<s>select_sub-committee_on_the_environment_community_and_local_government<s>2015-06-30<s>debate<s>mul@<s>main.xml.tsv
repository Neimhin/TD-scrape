RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point follows on from Deputy Naughten's point. This amendment might make sense if the Government gave us a commitment and a cast-iron guarantee that the capital will be provided by the Government when the local authorities come up with plans to develop sites that are suitable for social housing where there is a social housing need.
This pertains to something that I am very uncertain about in terms of the Government's whole approach to the social housing crisis. The Government states that the money is available but it is up to the local authorities to provide the housing. Is the money really there for the local authorities? I can think of several sites owned by my local authority which are earmarked for social housing, but we have been told by the local authority that it does not have the money to develop the sites. If the Minister of State is saying that all the local authorities have to do is to come up with a plan to put social housing on those sites and the Minster will give them the money, I might support this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the absence of such a provision, this is a mechanism to force the privatisation of local authority land. The only way the local authority will be able to come up with plans that it can finance, if the Government does not guarantee the local authority the money, is by handing the land over to private developers, who will take it and lease it back to the council at a further cost to the taxpayer and to the State, and this will ultimately result in a loss of public housing that might have been owned by the State. If this were the case, I would be resolutely opposed to the Bill. I am asking the Minister whether he is guaranteeing money for local authorities that come forward with plans for land that they currently own. I would be very happy but surprised if that were true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not tabled an amendment to the section, but I suggest the following for consideration given the possibility that I might put something in on Report Stage. I refer to section 5(2). When we are talking about the definitions of "site" and "home" on page 7, we are excluding what are described as "homes". Obviously, there is a very good reason to do that in most cases. One does not want to be lashing levies on people who might have a house or what is defined as a "home" empty for a period for understandable and legitimate reasons. However, there is an issue of which I am aware, albeit I have to do a bit more research. In fact, the Minister of State may be in a position to enlighten us. I understand that in London and other European cities if a house is empty for a very prolonged period without good reason, there are laws which provide that those sites can either be taken by local authorities or that levies will apply to them. One might not be able to take them here, but levies might be possible. I would like to hear the Minister of State on this. While one would obviously have to be careful and there would have to be a great deal of consideration as to how it might be done, it is wrong if there are built houses just sitting there for long period, whether they are in public or private ownership, when there are people in need of places to live. We need to consider whether a provision should be included in the Bill to address that issue. It may be that we could look at how the issue is dealt with in other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, where legislation is in place to ensure that empty properties are used for housing for people who need it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Arguably, if there was a constitutional impediment, that could equally apply to the levy. If the levy can apply to land, I do not see why it cannot apply to vacant properties. It may be something we need to look at. I have not thought it out fully or put down an amendment, but it is something we should look at and consider. I am certainly going to do so. If there is any way to have a measure to push buildings and houses which are not being used back into use for those who need them, we should consider including it in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This relates to the Government's plan to reduce the obligation on the developer from 20% of any development to 10%, which is a central aspect of the legislation. Undoubtedly, the Government will claim that a level of 20% is an inhibitor and discourages developers from developing and that reducing it to 10% could incentivise builders to start developments. It probably captures the Government's argument to state that it is better to have 10% of something than 20% of nothing. I have probably stolen the Minister of State's lines.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, but I understand the Government's-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not. There is a link between this amendment and some of the others that I have tabled. My problem with it is that there is too much reliance on the private sector generally in the Government's approach to dealing with the housing crisis. This Bill is the working out of that logic, in that it asserts that the only way we will get the social and affordable housing that we need is by constantly incentivising, getting down on our knees and begging private developers to provide it for us. I do not agree with this approach. It will not deliver the volume of social and affordable housing that we need. My concerns in this regard are increased by the fact that the Government is going to provide a further large get-out clause on the 10%, in that developers can lease property back to local authorities, which is a matter that subsequent amendments will address. The combined effect of these two provisions is to let developers off the hook completely, leaving local authorities with nothing. They will not get 20% or even 10%, but 10% leased back, which means that they will get nothing. I do not agree with the logic behind these provisions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am genuinely tempted by the idea that 10% of something is better than 20% of nothing, given the dire situation we are in. I put this amendment forward out of genuine concern and desire to have a serious debate on the issue. I remain open to hearing the arguments but I wanted to put it down because this is a central component of the Bill and I will consider it as we go along. Essentially, I want to reserve the right to re-enter it on Report Stage, depending on what I hear in the discussions that I might have with people who are concerned about this issue between now and then. On the question of how much can we directly deliver, which, as the Minister of State indicated, is my favourite approach, I accept that some has to come from the private sector as well but we are not exploring fully the potential for direct build. I was at a briefing by TASC recently and it was pointed out that apparently - I cannot give the exact title, but I can get it - there is some provision for about €1 billion which one can get off balance sheet in the European Union for infrastructural projects where one can show it is infrastructural expenditure. Such expenditure will not be put on the balance sheet. I also believe from discussions we had on this subject with the Fiscal Advisory Council a week or two ago that a serious debate is opening up about structural deficits, what should be included in them and the degree to which capital expenditure should be included in them. There is much debate on what should be considered a structural deficit and there are different interpretations of it. However, there is a debate opening up in the European Union that endorses the view that capital expenditure of this sort should not be included in the structural deficit. We need to wade in big time behind that argument. It follows what Deputy Wallace has just said. This is a no-brainer. It is guaranteed saving of money that is currently being wasted on rent allowance and so on.One needs upfront capital but in the long term, there is a guaranteed saving and benefit to the State. We need to strongly make that case and to proceed in that direction and be much more ambitious in doing so. I will now deal with the provisions under Part V for social and affordable housing. There is a large site in my area, namely, the Dún Laoghaire golf club. As Deputy Murphy said, prior to the boom, some developers were burned by the Part V provisions because they had done the deal and paid extortionate prices to meet their 20% obligation. However, should this Bill be enacted, the developer who was bailed out by NAMA, and is probably still in NAMA, will be required to deliver 10% of the land for social and affordable housing in the second phase of this development. I consider that completely unacceptable, particularly when the developer was bailed out by NAMA.  At this point, things are on the floor in terms of the number of houses being constructed but let us remember that we will head upwards, although never to the mad levels of building 80,000 to 90,000 houses a year. When the market normalises, with the construction of between 30,000 to 50,000 houses per annum, and the hope is that the sector will head in that direction, I would hate to think that when more houses are being built, we will not get the necessary social and affordable housing to ensure we have a social mix.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am open to the argument but I am worried because once things head back in that direction, we may not be getting what we should be getting. We are also sacrificing the sort of balance, in terms of social mix, we should get. I want to signal a point that we will come to later. A very substantial get out clause is the lease back alternative. Deputy Wallace mentioned the cost of the land but the lease back arrangement is a significant get out clause. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My series of amendments covers a number of areas, but my major concern is the get-out clause, that is, that instead of the 10% to the local authority, there is a leasing option, if I understand this correctly, so that the developer, instead of the local authority or, for that matter, a voluntary housing body, ending up with the 10%, the developers can just agree to lease this property on a long-term basis to the council. We do not get permanent social housing, we get property that is being leased by the developer. In effect, this is a way out of even the 10% requirement. They get 90% at full-market profitability for themselves and then they can lease the other 10% at market rates. Given market rates at the moment, that is a recipe for sucking local authorities dry. The money continues to pour out from the public sector to the private sector, but we do not even get something permanent to call our own social housing. I consider this an unacceptable, major get-out clause, which could store up significant costs for the public and the taxpayer, where the public coffers get sucked dry. It would be like rent allowance, but on a massive scale, sucking the local authorities dry. The other one in this series of amendments relates to the idea that the price paid by the local authority for the 10% social housing should include a profit on the normal construction and development costs calculated at open market rates. I have a big problem with that. We are even including profit on the 10%.They are making profit on the 90%. Is that not enough for them? We should get the 10% at cost price.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is saying that, in general, where the capital is available local authorities will be encouraged to acquire rather than lease, but that creates a major slippery slope. I suspect this provision will mean that the bulk of the 10% will end up being leased, and the Minister has not convinced me so far that this will not be the case. On the profit issue, we know there has been a major problem in terms of negotiating about the price. I do not understand why it is not sufficient that they make profit on the 90%. It does not cost them anything but there is an obligation to give us cost price on the 10%. That is an entirely reasonable question to ask. I raise a somewhat related matter so that I can raise it on Report Stage. Has the Minister thought about including a reference in the Bill to the local authorities having the money to buy existing property of individual units when it goes on the market? A case arose recently in my area where a landlord is having to sell and evict their tenant. However, the landlord does not want to evict the tenant and has asked the local authority to buy the house and allow the tenant to stay, and the local authority said it does not have the money. In those instances, and there may be quite a few of them - we know this is happening - there should be some way that we can tell the local authority to buy the house. This particular landlord is saying they will sell it to the local authority at a discount rate because they do not want to see this person on the street. That is an acquisition area where we could get permanent social housing and save people being made homeless if local authorities are given the approval and the money to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section adds to my anxiety, and that of other Deputies, about the consequences of the reduction in the requirement for social housing provision from 20% to 10%. I presume that, in order to accommodate that, the number of units will have to be reduced from nine to four. My fear is that it is a logical follow-on from the earlier state of affairs and it could become easier for developments to be built just at the threshold in order to get around it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly agree with Deputy Murphy on this one. I believe Deputies sometimes put forward these review clauses just for the sake of tabling an amendment, so that they can say they said something about a Bill, but in this case there is a real argument for it because the housing market is completely fluid, volatile and subject to constant change. We have debated and disputed the arguments here but we do not know what is actually going to happen. The Minister of State could be right or he could be wrong, and that is a very good reason to review the provision on a regular basis. We need to get the result we want from this legislation and to look regularly at the changes to the percentage, from 10% to 20% or even to 15%, as has been suggested as a compromise. We cannot fail in the spectacular and disastrous way we failed in the past, with multiple, awful consequences. This amendment would force us to come back and review the provisions after a relatively short period.
