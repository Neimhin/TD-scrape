RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Saint-Amans may have gathered from quite a few of the questioners that there is a consensus in this country that we are not a tax haven and he has given some comfort to that consensus by suggesting that we are not a tax haven. The definition of "tax haven" Mr. Saint-Amans is using, which is current, is meaningless. It is just another thing the multinationals have spread around. The phrase "double Irish" makes it clear that the tax and legal situation in this country is such that multinationals can exploit it to facilitate enormous tax avoidance. From a moral point of view and from the point of view of the ordinary lay citizen, particularly in this country where people are being crucified with taxes, austerity and cuts, that makes us in any meaningful sense a tax haven because we are facilitating aggressive, large-scale tax avoidance by some of the wealthiest corporations in the world.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then why does the term "double Irish" exist?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Saint-Amans has not answered the question of why the concept is called "double Irish". It is not called double German, double French-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes; it is double Dutch. The only explanation Mr. Saint-Amans seems to be giving is that our low corporate tax rate seems to attract companies involved in this aggressive tax avoidance. For the benefit of people trying to understand this situation, is the following brief description, given to me by former Google workers, an accurate description of how Ireland functions as a facilitator of tax avoidance?Google's advertising is a digital product. They sell that product to customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa from their Dublin HQ - and as such don't have to pay taxes on that anywhere except Ireland because the sale of that good is deemed under international law to have taken place in Ireland. The profit they make from all those advertising sales is eaten up by a charge levied by Google Ireland Limited's holding company - which (conveniently) tends to be almost the exact amount of profit they make. The little bit that is left is charged at the standard 12.5%. The holding company's profits aren't taxed because of Irish law waiving corporation tax on certain profits made from intellectual property royalties and/or because the company isn't managed or controlled in Ireland. That money then tends to be routed through further subsidiaries in Holland before moving to the Caribbean.Is that a fairly accurate description of the double Irish?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To close the double Irish loophole, is it not simple for Ireland, first, to stop giving tax breaks on intangible assets through the corporate tax system, which is the main reason we have a much lower effective tax rate than the nominal rate, as Mr. Saint-Amans has acknowledged?Second, we could simply change the law so any company that is incorporated here in Ireland pays tax here in Ireland, as, for example, is the case in the United States.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To confirm, the rules around intangible assets in this country were introduced in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and allow those things to be deductible against income earned by those companies. However, there is nothing to stop us changing those rules so that those things, for example, are not tax deductible and, similarly, there is nothing to stop us changing the rules around tax residency such that any company that is incorporated here would be taxed here. Consequently, companies that are currently based here, but are paying tax nowhere, would be taxed here. That would close off those loopholes. There is nothing to stop us doing that, is there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask Mr. Saint-Amans about his study on an effective tax rate, because earlier he referred to an effective tax rate of between 3% and 5% in this country as against the nominal rate of 12.5%. There is considerable dispute in this country about the rate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a question. What does Mr. Saint-Amans consider to be the effective tax rate?
