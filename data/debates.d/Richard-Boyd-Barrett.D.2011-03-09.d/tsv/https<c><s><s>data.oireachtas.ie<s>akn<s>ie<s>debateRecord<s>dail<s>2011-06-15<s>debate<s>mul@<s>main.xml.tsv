RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The context for these questions is obvious.  It is, as we approach the end of the Government's first 100 days in office, the objectives and hopes the Government had to deal with the most important issue facing the country, the EU-IMF deal.  Is it not time to acknowledge that the strategy pursued by the Government in terms of seeking to ease the burden of this brutal deal has failed spectacularly?  The strategy of being the good boys and girls of Europe and of bowing subserviently to the EU and IMF in terms of imposing austerity and putting on the backs of Irish people the private gambling debts of speculators, developers and financiers has failed.  All my questions ask whether it is not time to abandon this failed strategy and consider another strategy by recognising the very stark contrast between our failure to achieve any relief from the EU and IMF and the success of ordinary Greek people taking to the streets, protesting and resisting the austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the question is about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we not need to learn from the Greeks in particular and from the other so-called PIGS countries that have taken a different approach?  We should be talking to them about how, as a result of their resistance to the EU-IMF deal and particularly the resistance of the people of those countries, the German Finance Minister is now talking openly, in the context of the Greek situation, about burning the bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach recognise the effectiveness of the Greek resistance to this package and how it is forcing a debate among the EU authorities about burning the bondholders?  It is what we all know must be done to relieve the ordinary people of this country.  Should we not meet with the Greeks, the Portuguese and the Spanish to discuss that and recognise that we stand or fall together and we will only stand, rather than fall, if we resist this insane package, the austerity and the attempt to unload the speculators' debts onto the backs of ordinary people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not trying to score political points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking a question and the question is about appealing to the Taoiseach to consider changing strategy——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All of the questions request the Taoiseach——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——for a particular purpose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not making a statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a logical connection in the questions I am asking.  We should specifically meet other countries in the same plight as we are——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking him——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to reconsider his decision not to do that and his strategy of appealing only to the EU authorities as a whole rather than specifically making common cause with the Greeks, the Portuguese and Spanish, who are in the same plight as us.  I am suggesting and asking the Taoiseach to do so on the basis that resistance by the Greek people to the EU-IMF austerity measures is proving more effective than the Taoiseach's strategy pursued to date——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——because it is forcing the German authorities——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——seriously to reconsider the rescheduling——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——of debt and the burning of bondholders.  Is that not proving more effective and do we not have something to learn from the Greeks in that regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are our people not challenged?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is only four minutes per question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the Minister is trying to put a positive spin on what is an outrageous diktat from the IMF-EU to force working people in this country to work longer, harder and for less?  Given that working class people, poor people, live shorter lives, this will disproportionately hit them and essentially work some people to death when they should have a few years to enjoy a dignified retirement.Is not the least we could expect in such a serious matter, namely, raising the pension age, that the people would have a democratic say?  Is it not extraordinary that in Slovenia on 5 June, a referendum was held on this matter and the people voted 72% against raising the pension age when their government planned to do the same as this one?  Could we not have the same level of democracy on this key issue affecting ordinary people as the people of Slovenia had?Italy has referendums on key and substantial issues of policy.   One would not associate a country headed by Silvio Berlusconi with great levels of democracy but it has held referendums on serious and substantial issues and the government there has been defeated.  Why can we not have a democratic say on this outrageous measure to force the people to work longer and harder for less?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not really answer the questions.  Is it not the case that if we had a referendum on raising the State pension age, some would be in favour of it, as in Slovenia where 20% or so were in favour of it, and some would be against it, as in Slovenia where 72% were against it?  Is it also not the case that if we had a referendum and people had a democratic say, we would get a similar result?Given the physical nature of their jobs, manual workers are exhausted by the age of 65 and they would not wish to be forced to work longer.  Can we have consultation on what is a very serious measure?  Has the Minister costed this?  If public sector workers, who will be paid at the top of the incremental scale, work longer, younger workers, who will come in at the lower end of the incremental scale, will not be coming in.  Will it not cost the State money to force public sector workers to work longer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should be voluntary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The wealthy members of the global diaspora will yet again be feted in this country.  We constantly talk about the global diaspora and how important it is, but in the case of these two people this is just contempt through the implementation of the habitual residence condition as it is applied to a less well-off Irish citizen, the male in this case.  We are talking about an Irish citizen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Minister to examine this case.  The man concerned is an Irish citizen.  His family is from Clonegal and most of his family live there.  His mother is returning from England.  He happened to be born in England but has severed all ties with Britain, at the request of the social welfare authorities here.  He has nothing to return to and all his family are in this country.  He and his wife, who has mental health issues, face eviction this Friday; they will be out on the street unless payments are resumed.  Their cases are under appeal.  It is just incomprehensible that these people have been refused under the habitual residency requirement.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this case.  It is absolutely unfair and contemptible treatment of an Irish citizen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In England.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask a supplementary question.
