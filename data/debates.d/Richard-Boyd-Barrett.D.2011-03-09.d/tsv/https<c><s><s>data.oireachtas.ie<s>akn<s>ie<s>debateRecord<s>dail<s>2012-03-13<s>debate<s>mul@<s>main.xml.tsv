RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are still trying to get an answer to the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach indicate if there is joined-up thinking between Cabinet sub-committees such as the Cabinet Committee on Social Protection and the Cabinet sub-committee on jobs, the body which his Government has given priority to create jobs?  I ask that question because it has become clear that many of the measures introduced in the budget will act to drive loan parents in particular out of-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about how these two committees connect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is, honestly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of the measures will drive loan parents out of work-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----particularly because lone parents payments will be withdrawn after a child has reached the age of seven.  Loan parents are asking a simple question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Government wants them to work, who is supposed to look after the children-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----after the age of seven?  Has that issue been discussed at the Cabinet sub-committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can ask, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Others have asked it, and they got an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the hedge funds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about hedge funds?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who lent the Irish banks the money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Taoiseach thinks about the troika, namely, they who must be obeyed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am seeking clarification on the same issue.  Will the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, be debated in the Dáil before or after the referendum on the fiscal treaty?  As the Taoiseach seems to be indicating, the reason this is a critical question is that, if the Dáil passes the ESM legislation, we will pass the clause that denies us access to the ESM in the event that we oppose the treaty.  We will be committing money to an ESM from which we might not be able to benefit if we do not pass the fiscal treaty.  The sequence is critical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We rant and the Government obfuscates.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To blackmail ourselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will put a gun to our own head.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment is correct in its intent and is the very least we can do.  There is significant dispute about how the Government's response to the economic crisis impacts on different sectors of society.  Some of us on this side of the House have repeatedly made the point that all the pain and punishment is inflicted on the least well off in our society when other sectors could far better afford it and could, more justifiably, be taxed and have cuts imposed on their incomes.  The Government ignores those points or tries to rubbish or dismiss them.  Would it not be entirely reasonable to be a little objective and scientific about this and do a proper and full assessment of how the measures in this Bill impact on the different sectors of our society so that we can establish the truth as to who is really taking the pain in the austerity programme?  I fully support the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The value of this amendment is obvious in assessing whether this budget will help or hinder our progress towards economic recovery.  There are a number of very controversial proposals in this Bill, most obviously, the increase in VAT.  Some Members and many people in the wider public believe this will be very damaging to consumer demand and the ability of many SMEs to survive.  There must be an assessment of whether that arises.Similarly, there is outrage at the fact that the Government is planning to give tax breaks to corporate high fliers while everyone else is being hammered by austerity measures, cuts and new charges.  Given the controversial nature of such proposals, the least the Government could do is assess whether new jobs will be created or we lose tax revenue as well as annoy huge numbers of people suffering under the impact of austerity.  There are several measures in the budget that, at the least, require analysis further down the line to see whether they are beneficial or damaging to this country's prospects of economic recovery.  On that basis, I support the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment.  On a moral level, it is unacceptable that the universal social charge was imposed on people earning the minimum wage or lower.  The Government acknowledged the injustice at some level of hitting low-income earners by exempting the lowest income earners from the universal social charge but leaving people on the minimum wage and lower paying this punitive austerity tax is unacceptable.  The universal social charge on low and middle income earners should go completely because it is damaging and unfair in the extreme.  It is one of the major contributory factors to depressing consumer demand and its damaging consequences.I do not understand why the Government refuses to look elsewhere, at high income earners, and impose higher taxes on them.  We never get a straight answer.  United Left Alliance proposed that people earning over €100,000 would pay 50% tax, those earning over €150,000 would pay 60% tax and those earning over €200,000 would pay 70% tax.  In answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister acknowledged this would raise €1.1 billion.  Is it not fair to do that and to impose higher taxes on those who can afford it?  Would it not be economically far more sensible?  If one earns in excess of €100,000, unless one lives a very lavish lifestyle, one does not spend it all.  People can save it and in our case it is not going to the economy.  We all accept the need to increase spending rather than the amount of money sitting on deposit.  I do not see the rationale for not giving significant relief to people who have been hit with austerity taxes at the low and middle end while resolutely refusing to impose higher taxes on those who can afford them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pay tribute to the officials who have had to wade through the tax codes while preparing the Bill.  This is my first time to study the tax codes but from what I understand of them they cross-reference legislation all over the place.  It is an impressive achievement for anyone to apprehend this level of detail.As regards the substance of the Finance Bill, most of it is irrelevant to the situation the country currently faces.  The framework in which this Bill has been prepared results from the decision to allow the EU, IMF and ECB to determine the economic and social future of our country.  The interests of the bankers, bondholders and financial markets who wrecked the European economy are to be protected while the cost is imposed on working people, the unemployed and the vulnerable sectors of society.  The last Government signed up to the agreement and this Government has decided to adhere to that utterly unfair and economically suicidal approach.Much of the Bill merely shifts the deck chairs on the Titanic.  The ship is sinking because of austerity and the people are drowning.  I am amazed to hear people claim that austerity is working when people are leaving the country in their tens of thousands.  The only reason the unemployment figures are not higher is that of the despicable valve of forced emigration.  This catastrophe has been inflicted on the economy to protect bankers and bondholders.  It is beyond me how anyone can suggest the situation is getting better when the least vulnerable are suffering so appallingly.Much of this Bill is simply decoration because policy has been already determined by the decision to pay off bondholders and adhere to this disastrous austerity strategy.  In so far as it has anything of substance, it reveals that the Government has the same flawed mindset as the EU, ECB and IMF in giving further opportunities to the corporate elites who caused the mess in the first place.  Even if the money is not huge compared to the overall public finances, it is nauseating that the Government is giving tax breaks to corporate high fliers on already large salaries.Where is the incentive for public sector workers or for low and middle income workers?  Why are they not given incentives?  Instead, they are hatcheted while, at the same time, we have to give incentives to the corporate high flyers.  What about the plan to incentivise carbon trading, which is about turning our environment into the same sort of casino into which the financial system was turned and which had such disastrous consequences, or to give further breaks in corporate tax by extending out the ridiculously low level of corporate tax to other companies that did not benefit from it and which are trading outside the EU?It will not make much difference because the Government has signed away the country's future for austerity and bank bailouts.  In so far as there is any substance, it all points in the wrong direction.  Most importantly, the Government resolutely refuses to tax the wealthy in our society, who, as The Sunday Times rich list shows, got richer by €6 billion last year and have vast billions.  The Government refuses to tax those people.  Instead, it keeps hitting low and middle income earners and small and medium enterprises and it keeps protecting the rich.  As long as it continues in that vein, there is no way out of the economic mess this country faces.  I will certainly oppose the Bill.
