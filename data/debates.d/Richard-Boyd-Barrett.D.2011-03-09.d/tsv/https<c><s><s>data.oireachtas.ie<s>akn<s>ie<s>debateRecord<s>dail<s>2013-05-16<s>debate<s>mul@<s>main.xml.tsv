RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Justice and Equality has announced that he intends to table amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill giving himself the power to shut down mobile phone networks in advance of the G8 summit. This move comes alongside what can only be described as a huge campaign of hype and hysteria whereby drone planes are being brought in and thousands of police are also being brought over from Britain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this legislation part of a systematic campaign to try to intimidate peaceful protesters at the G8 summit? These peaceful protesters against war and militarism will be intimidated and bullied North and South.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why do we need these powers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the chance to speak on the Taxi Regulation Bill. The starting point in discussing the Bill is to say the situation in the taxi industry is a very powerful example of the utter bankruptcy of the free market deregulation ideology which Mary Harney, Bobby Molloy and their Fianna Fáil counterparts were responsible for applying with such dire consequences. It is worth noting in terms of certain larger economic questions just how disastrous it was. The whole principle behind certain free market thinking is that it is an efficient way to allocate resources and match supply and demand. There could be no more powerful example of how that is rubbish than what has happened to the taxi industry. Of course, when deregulation was introduced, there was a shortage of taxis, no one disputes that. There were 2,000 taxis in Dublin at the time of deregulation and I well remember as a teenager wandering for hours around the city trying to find a taxi to get to Dún Laoghaire and often having to walk home. There is no disputing, even by taxi drivers, that there was a real problem that had to be addressed but my God, did we go from one extreme to the other in double quick time. We went from 2,000 taxis in Dublin to the current figure of 13,000 taxis. There are now more taxis in Dublin than there are in New York. That is astonishing. We only have to wander down O'Connell Street or Dame Street at the weekend now to see a sea of taxis sitting in ranks for hours on end with frustrated and desperate drivers wondering what the point is and if they will be able to pay their bills and put food on the table. It is an unbelievable failure of policy in the first place by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil and, subsequently, a dire failure of regulation of the industry. In the first instance, it has made life extraordinarily difficult for full-time taxi drivers to make a living. As other speakers have mentioned, it raises serious questions about health and safety for users of taxis, such is the free-for-all that has ensued since deregulation of the taxi industry, with widespread evidence of people working in the industry who are completely non-compliant with insurance regulations and so on and drivers double jobbing, working full-time jobs then driving a taxi at night, which is putting the safety of passengers at serious risk. The Minister of State mentioned the suitability of people working as taxi drivers and this is a major focus of the legislation. It is right and proper that there should be vetting, so that is another area although people have rightly pointed to complexities that must be addressed. I do not want to over-exaggerate the crisis facing taxi drivers but it is a damning indictment of what has happened to the taxi industry that deregulation combined with the economic crisis saw a terrifying peak in suicides among taxi drivers, with drivers so desperate at their plight that 33 of them have taken their own lives in a two-year period. We can add to that figure many deaths from heart attacks. It is a fact that those who drive for a living, whether they drive buses or taxis, are one of the groups most likely to die of heart attacks. There is a stereotype of high powered executives in stressful jobs dying of heart attacks.In fact, professional drivers of taxis or buses are one of the groups most vulnerable to that health threat because of the nature of and stress involved in their job. Those have been the fairly awful consequences of deregulation and the subsequent impact of the economic crisis. In that regard, I think everybody breathes a sigh of relief that the Government is bringing forward this legislation and has made attempts to engage with the different stakeholders in the taxi sector to address the issues. However, the taxi drivers to whom I have spoken, primarily the National Private Hire and Taxi Association, NPHTA, and Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann, have expressed considerable concerns. We should take them seriously. I note the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, is smiling. Obviously, he has been engaged more in the process than I have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Minister of State has. I am not disputing that. I have also been quite involved in this issue over the years. I marched in the protest against deregulation, not because I did not recognise the need for more taxis but because the taxi drivers who marched against deregulation warned what would happen, and they were correct. Subsequently, I have joined many campaigns, protests and demonstrations by groups such as Taxi Drivers for Change, which has morphed into another group. For the majority of my engagement with those taxi drivers groups over the years, I have found them to be sane and sensible people making reasonable points, most if not all of which have been vindicated, about the anarchy that ensued from deregulation and the need for proper regulation and enforcement. I welcome that we have finally reached this point but, as I stated, there are a number of concerns, and I hope the Minister will engage with those concerns over the course of the passage of this legislation through the House. The first concern raised was about the consultation process, and I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in response. There may be competing claims about which is the biggest group - there are an array of groups representing taxi drivers - but I have known for quite a few years those members of the NPHTA to whom I spoke. They were involved with Taxi Drivers for Change. I believe their account to be reasonably credible as to what the NPHTA represents. They state they are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, representative organisations of taxi drivers. Representing in the region of 6,000 taxi drivers certainly makes them one of the biggest. While they were initially on the review group, they were removed from that group because they were unhappy, I presume, with certain proposals, or they were not accepting of certain consensus positions. Am I correct in stating that Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann was not on the group?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that it is difficult. What they informed me is that, subsequently, a taxi forum has been set up which brings all of these groups together.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to signal this and follow the debate and the discussion. I will not pre-empt the matter, but persons who I believe have credibility state there was a problem. Probably for historical reasons as well as historical failures, there is a significant lack of confidence in the authorities and the regulatory regime. The Minister of State must go out of his way to be inclusive, in terms of all of these groups and in trying to take on their concerns. In that regard, one immediate issue which does not relate directly to the legislation are the proposals resulting from the new construction works on the Luas in St. Stephen's Green, O'Connell Street and Foster Place. The drivers have told me that, if there are unilateral moves to remove ranks from these areas related to the Luas works, there will be murder and the Government had better get its act together and engage with the taxi drivers on this or it will have a crisis on its hands. The taxi drivers understand the works must be done but they want serious consultation about how they will be accommodated. This issue of ranks is a big problem, both in the city and in suburban areas. I encountered the problem in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere, and it is a serious problem. The lack of rank space is leading to taxi drivers getting penalty points because they are not on rank space, rather they are queuing to get onto a rank. For this they are getting penalty points, and if they get eight penalty points, they are disqualified, even though none of it is the taxi driver's fault. These are serious issues that need to be addressed and the starting point for addressing them is real consultation with all the groups in an inclusive process where the taxi drivers have genuine confidence that their views are being listened to. The key matter is proper and effective regulation to deal with rogue drivers, non-compliant drivers, unsafe drivers and so on. On one of the important proposals, the NPHTA stated that it is vital that plate, car and insurance are all in the one name, and this will be at the centre of having an effective regulatory regime. The association states that if one does not have that, a driver may have a licence and may be able to show his or her insurance, but the insurance is not insurance for the car in question because one cannot insure somebody else's car. It needs to be one package and that the driver is registered to that car. There should be one package of plate, car and insurance all in one name. This would resolve many of the problems of rogue drivers. The association also states that the branding issue is problematic because already one can go to five or six locations in Dublin to get forged versions of the green branding that has been put on the side of taxis. It is not effective. The association has proposed alternatives. There may need to be debate and discussion about how this could be done and made more workable. I think it was proposing particularly items that would be put on the roof-signs which would identify taxis properly. There needs to be engagement on this issue because if those green brands are being forged, one can see fairly quickly how ineffective it will be. The association also states the smartphone application is a very good idea and is hopeful about it. The effectiveness of this application, which allows NTA officials or gardaí to check whether a driver is properly registered, licensed, insured and so on, has been diluted by giving a 24-hour breathing space in which the information about a driver's compliance can come up on it. In other words, instead of being able to check the application and find out there and then whether there is information on it about proper registration and compliance, the position is that the information cannot come up but one is told it must be put up within 24 hours, which means those who are not insured and registered to drive a particular car can get it done retrospectively, allowing abuse to continue. The association states that the dilution by allowing a 24-hour breathing space must be removed. The other big issue is the issue of transferability and inheritance rights. Here the drivers state that, as has been mentioned, the requirement that the car be not less than three years old will mean that transferability is not possible between family members or persons working in a small family business.There should be inheritance rights for the entire package without a three-year restriction, which could mean that family members, on the death of somebody working a taxi, would not be able to inherit a small family business. With regard to double-jobbing, I underline the point that it is not just about people driving but anybody who works. There are EU work time directives coming into play regarding hours which are safe to work. If a person is working for eight hours in any job, such as teaching, working in a council, driving a bus or working in a factory before going out to drive at night, it would be a real problem. A person who works too long is not safe as a driver, and the issue must be addressed urgently. I am not underestimating the difficulty of addressing what is a complex issue but it should be tackled. There must be a level playing field. People may have part-time jobs when on low income, and in such cases it would be legitimate for them to work in a taxi but there must be health and safety regulations which should be stringently adhered to. There is also the enforcement issue, as it is not good enough just to have regulations. For example, over two hours a checkpoint was put on Dame Street to check compliance rates by taxi drivers and in that period 19 drivers were found to be non-compliant with regulations. That suggests widespread non-compliance in the industry, which is driving full-time taxi drivers demented. They want assurance that these issues will be addressed in legislation to allow for a level playing field and proper regulation and enforcement in the industry so that everybody has a chance to make a living and undo the damage that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats did to the industry.
