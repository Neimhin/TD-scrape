RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, People Before Profit opposes property tax, full stop. We believe the Minister would raise more money and it would be fairer to introduce a wealth tax and would help to get a budget surplus. However, given that property tax exists, he had promised a review at the beginning of last year and said people were deserving of certainty as to the future plans for property tax. Given the dramatic increase in property values and the potential for huge increases in people's property tax liability, what is happening with the review? What can the Minister tell us about what is coming down the line?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to make a few points. First, I believe the Minister owes it to transparent and accountable Government to tell people what will happen with property tax before the local elections. It would be a bit of a scam to wait until after the local elections and then see massive hikes based on the November revaluation date, which is promised. Second, I would point out to the Minister that there were two major justifications for property tax at the time it was introduced. The first was that it would control property values and stop property bubbles happening again. It clearly failed to achieve that. The second is that it would give extra revenues to local authorities. I want to read a sentence from the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown transport roads project document. It states: "Since 2015 these grants [the grants from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport] were replaced by Local Property Tax income, and, up to 2018, this has resulted in a reduced income to Roads Maintenance of approx. €500K". It has failed to control property prices and it has led to a reduction in the moneys available to local authorities.
