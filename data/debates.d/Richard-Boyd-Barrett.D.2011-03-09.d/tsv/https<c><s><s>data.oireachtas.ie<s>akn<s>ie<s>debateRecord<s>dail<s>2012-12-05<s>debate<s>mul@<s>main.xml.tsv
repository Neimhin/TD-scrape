RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, on a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why do you not listen to me?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have copies of the statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What changes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish I could say otherwise but today is another day of shame for this Government. It is not a day of hard choices, as it kept repeating. It is a day of cruel choices inflicted by those who are protecting the privileged and the powerful on those who are struggling and in despair. It is a day when it has driven tens of thousands of families who were teetering on the edge of poverty into poverty. It is a day when it has hammered a few more nails into the coffin of the battered Irish economy. I say to the Tánaiste that this Government had a choice. A few simple measures could have done away with the need for all the suffering it has inflicted on ordinary families today. If it had simply enforced, as we suggested, the 12.5% corporation tax rate and increased in a significant way the taxes on those earning in excess of €100,000 a year, as 88% of the population now want it to do, it could have done away with the need for all this suffering and despair and all those families being driven into poverty. If the Government had done that not only could it have prevented these vicious cuts but it would have had the resources to reverse some of the most vicious cuts imposed in recent years. It could have abolished the universal social charge for those on average incomes. It could have lifted the special needs assistant, SNA, caps that have caused such suffering to some of the most vulnerable families. It could have reinstated the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients and for pensioners. It could have reinstated the home help hours for the elderly and the disabled. It could have reversed the increases in registration fees and the cuts in grants for students and many more of the nasty cuts that have been imposed in the past two years. To do all of that would have cost approximately €3 billion. Those measures alone would have been covered just by making the corporations that made €70 billion in pre-tax profits last year pay a little more tax, and all that suffering could have been avoided.Instead, the Government made a cold-hearted decision to attack those who have nothing or next to nothing yet again. The property tax will cost ordinary families hundreds of euro, €300 or €400 extra per year. How will the 1.3 million people in this country who have less than €50 a month left over pay the charge? They simply do not have it. How will they pay for the cuts to child benefit? If they have three children, they will lose €38 per month. How will they deal with the €20 per month loss in earnings if they are working, as a result of the abolition of the weekly PRSI allowance? The 1.3 million people with less than €50 a month after they pay their bills will have that €50 and more taken from them as a result of these measures. This will drive them into poverty. Then there are some of the really nasty cuts. The decision to cut the respite care grant for families with children with disabilities is obnoxious. Some €356 has been taken from families with disabled children or family members when it could give them some respite once a year. It is an outrage to cut the back-to-school allowance by €50 for some of the poorest families in the country. The Government had choices to avoid this suffering and make those who have the money and the profits pay a little more so the poor and the struggling do not have to struggle more than they do. The Government could have marshalled funds by imposing taxes to fund a stimulus and jobs programme to put people in this country back to work so they can contribute to the economic recovery we so badly need. None of that will happen and, shamefully, the Government restated its commitment to selling off our forests and other State assets and enterprises that could be the vehicles for job creation and economic recovery. Shame on the Tánaiste and shame on this Government. This is a recipe for long-term economic depression and suffering for hundreds of thousands of families. The Government had a choice; why did it not take it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to be brief to give the other Deputies time. This measure has nothing to do with public health, but it has everything to do with grabbing more money in a regressive way that will yet again hit the least well-off. This will hit those on the lowest incomes. It is precisely the gross inequalities in our society, widespread unemployment and poverty that will fuel addiction to cigarettes and alcohol, with all the problems that entails. Those are the things the Government needs to deal with if it wants to improve public health.The Government certainly does not need to take €780 million out of the health service or effect cutbacks in education and all the rest of it. This is regressive, is a money-grabbing exercise and will hit the bar trade, thereby causing job losses in that sector. As has been noted previously, the only entities likely to benefit from this are the multiples and so on, towards which the Government has taken no action regarding their below-cost selling practices. This is a regressive move and my group will be voting against it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief. As with many of the measures that are being introduced in the budget, and in the previous budget, the Taoiseach will try to provide a specific justification or rationale for particular tax increases. He will try to make them sound more palatable when in reality they are just further overwhelmingly regressive austerity measures that are being imposed on ordinary families. Families do not have different pots of money which are somehow separate and unconnected: one for cars, one for farm vehicles, another one for property taxes or cigarettes and a pint of beer at the weekend. They all come out of the same pot. All of the increases will disproportionately and regressively affect those who have the least. That is the reality of all such measures. Their combined effect will be to impoverish people who already have very little. Those particular measures will disproportionately affect families, as so many others have. The more children one has, the harder one will be hit in a range of ways. The motor taxation measures are no exception in that regard. One will be punished just because one has more children and has to have a larger car to transport them. Just in case it would encourage people to use alternative forms of transport such as public transport, let us not forget that a significant number of people do not have access to public transport. Cuts have been made to existing public transport and there have been increases in bus and rail fares of between 14% and 19%. People are being hit from the left, the right and the centre but all of the extra money must come out of the same pot. The increases are a slap in the face for people who bought vehicles with low emissions not just this year, but last year. The attempt to say the increases are stepped and that there are still incentives is all mar dhea. The Government has slapped in the face those who made an investment to try to comply with measures to encourage reduced CO2 emissions. We will oppose the resolutions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that point, your whipness, in response to what Deputy Sean Fleming said-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been consistent on these matters because we provided an alternative. As I tried to explain to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste earlier, none of these cuts would be necessary if they enforced the 12.5% corporate tax rate on the multinationals which are making tens of billions in profits and walking away with the loot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is our alternative.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Alternatively, if it had imposed a fair and progressive income tax on those earning over €100,000, as we explained in our pre-budget submission, the Government could have raised €2.5 billion. It would not have needed to impose these cuts or attack families; it could have done it fairly and had money left over to fund a jobs programme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry His Whipness is not here to hear me say that we will support this measure because it is a marginally progressive move. It is a gesture or token towards being progressive and dealing with gross inequalities of wealth and income without any serious substance in the budget towards addressing these inequalities. I cannot say it better than Deputy Shortall because she hit the nail on the head. This is a token to make it look as if the budget is trying to be fair without dealing with the substantial issues. The Government has hammered working families. The more I look at the detail of this, the worse it gets. The larger the family, the more it is hammered, which will hit working class families particularly hard. They will take some time to work out how large the hit is but they will be counting the cost for a long time. As has been said, there were potential savings and choices in respect of pension tax relief. Hundreds of millions of euro could have been saved that are spent on reliefs that benefit the wealthiest in society. It is fairly incomprehensible that the Government did not choose those options instead of the ones it did choose. One would have to speculate that it is either because the people making the decisions benefit from the current regime or it is a capitulation by the Labour Party to the Fine Gael agenda. Either way, it is deplorable, given what is being done to people who are hanging on by their fingernails.  We will support the measure. There are one or two measures further down that one would support but they are so marginal and fail to deal with these inequalities. It is unbelievable. Perhaps the Government would not have opted for as radical or, as some people might say, aggressive measures on taxing wealth and profits as some on this side of the House have proposed but it could have gone a hell of a lot further in dealing with those inequalities. Every step further it could have gone would have given relief to the people it has hit. That is not just a terrible wasted opportunity. It will continue the suffering for many and the understandable bitterness, anger and frustration of ordinary people who are the victims at the bottom of society and have yet again been hammered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil is a funny party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have sympathy with the Government here. Whatever deficiencies there might be in the failure to address the issue of incomes in excess of €100,000, it is not a reason to vote against what is a progressive measure. There are genuine questions about the other two resolutions and I would appreciate explanations. I support this measure because to be hit with this extra level of universal social charge, a person would have had to have earned during his or her working life approximately €120,000 a year and be getting a generous pension of €60,000. The idea that one would be brought up to the same level of universal social charge as somebody who is working and earning that money is reasonable and the measure is at least a move in the direction of wealth redistribution. Although not a reason to vote against it, the measure, if the Government can do so, raises the question of why it cannot raise the income tax level for those earning more than €100,000 a year. I do not understand it. In response to the Deputies from the Labour Party who were heckling on this matter, whatever dispute there might be about how much can be raised from a wealth tax, we certainly acknowledged in our submission that there is a dispute about it. We do not have accurate figures on wealth and assets and therefore it must be estimates. We accept that fully.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Similarly, it is also true to say that there would have to be some deep scrutiny of how much one would gain from corporation tax, etc., although one would certainly be talking about billions of euro if one enforced the effective 12.5% rate. On the issue of increasing income taxes for those earning €100,000 or more, there is no dispute about how much it could raise. It merely depends what rates one imposes, and we have the tables. Our proposal was that the effective rates, from €100,000 up to the very top of €8 million to €10 million, inclusive, should go from the current levels of 31.3% to 46% and from to 33% to 62%, respectively, and that would raise €2.5 billion according to the tables.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the yield, one would be taking approximately €1 million a year off somebody who is earning €3 million to €4 million a year. I do not have a difficulty with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are approximately 120 of them, according to tables we received from the Department.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I do not understand is, if the Government can do what is proposed in this resolution, which is a progressive measure, why could it not have increased to some degree, if not as much as we wished, the income tax for those earning more than €100,000 on some sort of progressive increasing scale? I have genuine questions for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore. Is there an issue on the loans employees may receive? I have no difficulty with employees getting loans from their companies and being giving some relief to them on that basis, but I ask the Tánaiste in his response to allay my concern that this is a method through which directors and executives could lend to themselves and get tax relief on it. It summons up images of certain families in this country who helped bring the country to its knees who played all sorts of games with their companies and siphoned wealth out of them. I seek assurance that this scheme could not be abused by such people. The measure on risk equalisation seems reasonable although I would appreciate elaboration on who is likely to be affected by it and how it would translate. I would like to vote for these, but I seek clarification on them. Perhaps the Tánaiste would also answer why, if the Government could implement the measure on pensions in excess of €60,000, it could not do so on earnings in excess of €100,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I stated we would support it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The establishment closes ranks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was the wrong kind of activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	None of us wants to drag out this process at this stage. Broadly speaking, these measures are reasonable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister might be surprised to hear that I have said that now on three occasions tonight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite the attempts by certain people on the other side of the House to caricature this side, we take these issues seriously, considering the detail as much as possible in the short time available. I have a concern but I am unsure what to do about it given that, broadly speaking, these are progressive measures. Some of the increases do not distinguish between the small and big saver. I know the vast majority of people who will be affected by these increases in tax will be people who have plenty of money to save, and the people we wish to protect or give relief to do not have much in the way of savings these days. Broadly speaking, these resolutions are right. There are ordinary people with relatively modest amounts of savings, and it is unfortunate that they will get caught in what is a broadly progressive measure. The Government should think about it. There is a more marginal point. We are a country with a high degree of home ownership, although in a way different from much of the rest of Europe. There is a difference in the way property is passed to the next generation when it is not necessarily about passing on significant amounts of wealth. Although it may not be done now, we should examine the process of imposing taxes on capital gains and acquisitions, as well as taxes on savings. I will not labour the point but the Government could have gone much further in going after the major inequalities. It is fair to say everything could have been costed by the Department of Finance. As the new people on the block, we thought the parliamentary question process was the way to get information from the Department of Finance. That is how we got some of our information. There was nothing amateur or half-hearted about our efforts in putting together our document. Most of it stands up to scrutiny. The income tax element has been taken directly from a spreadsheet provided by the Department; when the effective tax rate is adjusted, the relevant figures pop up on the screen. It is very interesting and Deputies should look at it. I thank the Department of Finance for that information. It would not have helped to have the issue of corporation tax costed because the Minister for Finance told us it was too complicated to calculate. That is not much of an answer to our first question. A second question asked for the bands of the different levels of profits of companies, and it was only then that we got the figures to show how much gross pre-tax income of companies was available, how much tax was paid and the various allowances that facilitated the taxable amount to be written down. The response that the process was too complicated was not satisfactory.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The response from the Minister for Finance was that the process was too complicated.On the issue of a wealth tax, the answer, as we stated explicitly, was that we need a comprehensive register of wealth and assets to identify how wealth is distributed. All we have, however, are Central Bank figures which show the overall quantum of wealth, how much of it is financial and how much is household wealth and what are the liabilities. We do not know the distribution of household assets that are valued at €447 billion. We need to know how these assets are distributed in order that we can have a progressive taxation system that targets accumulated wealth. There is by international standards a significant quantum of household wealth in this small country. If one divides the figure by the population, as has been done, one finds that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world. This position is not borne out by our levels of poverty, however, and for this reason it is necessary to carry out a serious study to identify how wealth is distributed. This would enable us to implement a targeted wealth tax. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Having a roof over one's head is not an indication of one's ability to pay €300, €400 or €500.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us not be facile about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All that being said, these measures are broadly progressive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not. We proposed to reverse the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We costed the reversal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in ours.
