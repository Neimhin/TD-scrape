RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there not a debate on this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can only speak on the section because amendments have been ruled out of order. It should be noted, although I know there are reasons we are having to short-circuit the normal legislative process on this Bill, that there was no pre-legislative scrutiny and Committee and remaining Stages are being rolled into one. It is a bit unfortunate for me and other Deputies whose amendments were ruled out of order. If there was another debate scheduled, we could have refined those amendments and resubmitted them on the next Stage. Debate on what I consider to be a pretty important issue has been truncated and we are left only with a brief opportunity to talk about what is in the Bill. Section 1 is the substantial section of the Bill, which extends the loan capacity of the Irish Film Board from its current ceiling of €300 million to €500 million, a considerable sum.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendments tabled proposed to create a new section 2 but now that they have been ruled out of order, the only substantial section that we are able to talk to is section 1.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendment was after section 1 and before section 2, and proposed to create a new section 2.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 3 is just the citation, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The substantial section of the Bill is section 1, which spells out the increasing loan capacity. The amendments we hoped to move, which were ruled out of order, provided that there would be a certain conditionality on that. We agree with section 1 but we want conditions put on it. While for the purposes of pressing those conditions, they have been ruled out of order, it is entirely in order to say that the decision of the Dáil to expand the loan capacity of the Irish Film Board should be conditional. I seriously appeal to the Minister and the Department to examine the conditions relating to this significant public funding for the film industry, particularly in the areas of the extent to which the loans and grants that are given out by the Irish Film Board are helping to develop the industry and to create quality employment and training in it. That should be the point of public funding. In 2016, this stream of funding resulted in €12 million being distributed in loans.It varies from €12 million to €16 million depending on the year. That is a lot of money. In addition, there is the section 481 tax relief that comes via Revenue. I was just at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight at which this matter was also discussed. Last year, that tax relief amounted to €100 million. There is €100 million in tax relief and €12 million to €16 million coming through the Irish Film Board. Most of this money goes to approximately 12 film production companies, with the bulk of it going to about seven of those. It is very good that the State is funding the Irish film industry. I want to see more funding for that industry, whether it is via Revenue or through direct grant aid. However, we need to ask what we are getting out of it. At the meeting of Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the representatives from the Parliamentary Budget Office, who are independent people, stated there is a real problem with us evaluating public expenditures. We allocate money every year but we are not so good at scrutinising what we get in return. In the film industry, what is the result of €300 million of public funding via the Irish Film Board and probably another €1 billion through section 481 tax relief? What tangible results do we get for that level of public investment? Even though most of the money has gone to approximately 12 companies, those companies employ almost nobody. There may be a few administrative positions in some of the bigger ones, but there are no jobs. What film infrastructure does the State own? The answer is almost none. Even though we finance these companies, they have not created any long-term employment and the State owns virtually no infrastructure. That is a problem. I want to see the investment, but where is the net result? I just came from a meeting of actors and performers which, unfortunately, coincided with this debate and at which the topic is that they are the working poor, living a completely precarious existence. That echoes some of the stuff I heard from the film industry. This is another area of the arts where the performers are saying they are living in dirt poverty. A dancer who is very prominent on the international stage is living on €12,000 a year. She asked what kind of future she has. At the age of 20, 21 or 22, she might have been happy to sustain that for a while, living with six people in a small apartment, but where is her future? The answer is that she has no career progression, which is a problem. For all this public money, there has to be a career progression and some sort of future for people who work in the industry. Although the amendments have been ruled out of order, I appeal to the Minister. I welcome the great engagement in recent weeks by Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. I have brought workers in with me to meet officials. That is a great improvement and positive signals are coming from the Government. This is not a criticism of the Government, but we need to address the issue of employment in the industry. It would be wrong for the film industry to run purely on a for-profit or commercial viability basis because we need to subsidise the arts. However, let us consider the figures for the loans being given out. In 2007 €16 million in loans was given out. The amount recouped from these loans was €1.1 million. The following year €17 million was given out and €1.3 million was recouped. In the year after that €15 million was given out and was €738,000 was recouped. It is pretty much the same picture each year, with less than 10% of the money recouped. A lot of money is being loaned out with very little coming back. One could say that this is acceptable because we need to subsidise the film industry. However, how much are we getting back in tax revenue from the sector? Is that maximised? Much of the employment is precarious, with people being forced to work as contractors, freelancers and so on. They are not getting direct employment and there is resistance from the production companies to employ people directly as PAYE workers. Not only do they face an existence where they do not know from job to job if they have a future in the industry and are very vulnerable, but if they look for their rights, ask for PAYE employment, try to get overtime rates or anything like that, they will be told they will not be coming back for the next production because they have asked about these things. That is bad for them but it is also bad for Revenue because, generally speaking, it would get a considerable amount of money from PAYE employment. The Revenue Commissioners would get a higher yield of tax through PAYE than they tend to get when the whole thing is freelance and self-employed. We need to link this public funding more closely with creating quality employment and training. The workers need career progression and a properly structured system of training. That training needs to be linked to trainees on productions and not just training in the abstract. The Irish Film Board runs some courses, but what is the relationship between that and trainees working on productions? People are categorised as trainees, but it is never clear when they cease to be a trainee and become a qualified professional.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to have those things. One way to establish that would be - as I proposed in my amendment - by having a register of employees. If we can find out who is working in the industry, we can then gauge how we are doing. We can then say that we are putting in this amount of money and this is how many jobs we are creating. We can then ascertain if the number is improving year on year; if the quality of that employment is improving; and if the trainees are progressing or if they are trainees for a while and then dropping out of the industry because they cannot survive and have no future. These are things we need. At one of the meetings I attended with officials from Revenue and the Department of Finance, the workers from the film industry actually showed that in the past there was a register of trainees. There is no longer such a register. We actually had some of these things in the past but we do not have them now. Why is that the case? If we did have them, we could know who the trainees are and could track if they are progressing from production to production so that we are developing the skills base of the industry. This has relevance when we talk about attracting inward investment. Internationally, film production is ramping up very significantly with organisations such as HBO, Netflix, Amazon and others, but how much of this stuff are we getting? I think we are not getting enough and part of the reason we are not getting enough is that there is not enough stability in the skills pool. When they come here it needs to be clear to that them we have the infrastructure and people skilled in all these areas. However, it is too precarious for the workers. It is also too fragmented in terms of what potential investors might be looking for. We need those registers of employees and we need direct PAYE employment. This issue was discussed with the officials from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and I know they are looking at it. The Irish Film Board should be expanded. It needs stakeholders from across the industry and not just the producers. Of course, we need producers on the Irish Film Board, but we also need workers on the board and people who will evaluate how the money is being allocated, and the extent to which the State is getting a good return based on criteria such as employment, building up infrastructure and cultural impact.All of these factors need to be assessed independently and not just by producers. We need to look at issues like potential conflicts of interest whereby producers on the film board are lending money to their own production companies. I am not saying that those producers should not be on the board but we must be very careful about this kind of thing. As I understand it, there was a very substantial revamp of the film board in Britain. The British got rid of their film board and created a film commission which has a much wider industry stakeholder involvement, including workers as well as producers, performers and others. I hope to hear more from the Minister on this and I also believe that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have a role to play in this area. Revenue and the relevant Departments must work together to progress these matters, which would be to the benefit of the entire industry. It would also be very much to the benefit of those who work in the industry to have direct employment and the full application of all of their employment rights, which many would say is not happening currently. It would also help to draw in more investment from some of the big international producers of film and television in the audiovisual sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What do you mean, a Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am genuinely not trying to be difficult. I know this needs to get passed and we are not trying to extend the debate unnecessarily. However, on Committee Stage we get to scrutinise and this is our only chance to scrutinise this Bill. I take the point about the arts committee and pre-legislative scrutiny, which is fair enough. Sadly, I am not on the arts committee but the point is we are having two Stages rather than the normal three and, therefore, this is our one opportunity to scrutinise the legislation. It is reasonable, as happens in the committee, that there be a little back and forth on what is, to my mind, a significant Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I see it, the whole point of committee is that we get the opportunity to have a little back and forth on, in this case, the one substantial section in the Bill. We have heard from the Minister and we want to have an opportunity to respond. I do not see why that would be considered a problem. That is what a committee is for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I fully accept the Minister did not rule the amendments out of order. I talked to the person in the Bills Office this morning and she was very reasonable and gave me an explanation. However, I am just making the point that this is a very important issue. Some of us believe the continued operation of the film board, which is imperative for the Irish film industry, should also be accompanied by changes to the benefit of the film industry and those who work in it, and in order to ensure the best return for the State for the considerable amount of public funding that goes into it. That is the context in which we are trying to put in amendments. They have been ruled out of order on technical grounds, not on political grounds, but I still think it is entirely justifiable for us to use the opportunity to make those points. To be fair, we often have "bash each other" sessions in here but I am not here to bash the Government. The Government, the Department and the officials have engaged not just with myself but with other stakeholders. Nonetheless, I would like there to be clarity about where that process of engagement is heading in regard to the film industry, the film board and so on. To respond to the Minister, and to put it succinctly, those who get the public money should be responsible for delivering the quality employment. Currently they are not because of the SPV structure. There are cases in the courts and at the Workplace Relations Commission in regard to trying to look through the SPV structure to the parent recipient, or whatever we want to call it, behind that structure but it is difficult to establish who are the employers and where are the employees. If the condition of section 481 is quality employment, then a fairly elementary point is to ask who are the employers and who are the employees. It is not quite clear who is responsible for employees and who are the employees. One interesting and curious comment came from one of the workers who was, let us say, harshly treated in the recent "Prime Time" programme on RTÉ, when he said he did not mind being harshly treated by RTÉ because at least it proves he exists. He was making a point on these issues. For example, how do we establish who are the people who work in the industry? How do they prove they exist? What rights do they accumulate from one film to the next? How can it be that somebody works for 12, 15 or 20 years in the industry yet they have no employer and have not accumulated any rights whatsoever? It is the hope that the Minister will look at these issues. It is very positive to hear the Minister say she accepts we should look at the size of the film board. Part of improving that situation would be to have worker representatives, that is, PAYE workers, represented on the board so the workers as well as the producers and the others on the board would have a real input into it, which would make the board more representative of the stakeholders in the industry. It is not a question of making it bigger but of making it more representative by being certain we have workers on it. While I do not expect the Minister to say right now that she is definitely going to do that, I would like to hear her say it is a reasonable thing to consider. We have it in other State bodies and we should have it here.It would help to resolve some of the problems to which we are referring. We should also press ahead with the stakeholder forum. While one wants to bring everyone on board, at a certain point the Government should establish the forum and put it to people that if they want to have their say on the industry, they should attend. If they do not want to have their say, they need not attend. The contributions made at that forum will inform our policy, which is important. The following is a very reasonable thing to ask the Government to consider. If people are in receipt of public funds and they are found to be in breach of the working time directive, employee rights and so on, we have to consider applying penalties, withdrawing the public funding or holding them to account in some other way. While there have been some changes in the section 481 relief, we must zone in on it and make it clear that it is not going to be acceptable to behave in this way. We should expect employees to be categorised correctly. In most areas where there are allegations of bogus self-employment, the control test is simple to apply. If someone is told what hours to work, when to have lunch and is subject to someone telling him or her what to do, he or she is an employee. He or she is not a contractor or self-employed entrepreneur but is, rather, a worker and should be categorised as a PAYE employee. If a person is miscategorised, he or she will not be given his or her rights. In the bulk of the situations we are talking about this evening, the majority of workers should be PAYE employees. If they are not, there is probably something amiss. We know this from the construction sector. That is not to say there cannot be some legitimate contractors in these areas. Of course, there can. However, one would expect the bulk of people in this situation to be PAYE workers and to accumulate rights. One would expect to see a transfer of those PAYE employees and trainees from one production to the next and to see the companies receiving the relief taking responsibility for their workers. Those are reasonable things and if they happened, it would resolve many of the problems. It would improve the industry and its output and improve the lot of those working in it. I am encouraged by the Government's response over the past while. I hope it will follow through in the new year with the forum and the establishment of proper employee and trainee structures and ensure the full application of employee rights for the workers in the industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be extremely brief. On the SPV structure, the problem is that it appears and it disappears. That is a problem in terms of people's employment rights. We need to re-examine that. I just want to make that clear. I am not going to elaborate the point as the officials understand it. It is a particular structure. There are reasons at one level that we should have it but it causes a problem in terms of the normal relationship between an employer and an employee that should exist. On the issue the Minister mentioned regarding people having the right to be freelancers and so on, my response to that is "Yes" and "No". There is a control test. There are documents which have been produced and I probably have one of them among my papers. There are rules about the way employment, as against self-employment, is defined. It is not a case of somebody saying he or she is a freelancer or a lone trader. If a person's relationship to an employment ticks certain boxes that person is an employee. That person is not a lone trader or a self-employed entrepreneur. It is not accurate to say that. These issues are set out in a code of practice for determining employment or self-employment. We need to examine this area.  I understand that in some jurisdictions, such as France, at the beginning of a production officials from the equivalent of Revenue and the State ask the people involved what they do, what are their terms and conditions and they set out the way they will be categorised. That is how it is done. They go through every single employee and set out the way it is defined. I will not go through them. The officials will be aware of them.  In fairness to the Government, in response to campaigning in other areas such as construction, it has taken this issue on board, and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has stated we need to deal with issues such as bogus self-employment. There has been an acknowledgement in other areas, particularly in the construction sector, that must be dealt with. There are at least allegations, and I believe credible ones, that this is happening in the film industry. Therefore, it must be examined. That is not unreasonable. That is how we get to the truth. In any of these situations some people will allege one thing and others will allege another. Our job, as public representatives and as representatives of the Government, is to find the facts, establish what the rules and the law are, ensure they are being applied and to make it clear to the stakeholders in the industry that these are the rules and this is the law. The law must be complied with. If we have to debate whether we should change laws in certain circumstances, let us do that. I am simply arguing, as are I believe many people in the industry, that must be applied.  Some information is being gathered and some has been remitted to Revenue. However, we need more information about who is working, what they are doing and so on. We need to know what sort of tax remittances we are getting. I will not elaborate the point further. The point has been made. I believe the board should be larger. I am glad the Government is talking about that. However, it is important to have workers on it and a good diversity and not just one type of board member, for want of a better description. We need to examine that.
