From its figures presented to us, 179 people have had properties repossessed.  In 195 more cases, the bank has got a judgment for repossession.  There is then a whopping 3,945 cases in which court proceedings have been initiated.  Notwithstanding that the number of people in arrears over 90 days is falling, the bank still has large numbers of mortgage arrears, essentially 16,000 principal private dwellings and more than 3,000 buy-to-lets.  Are we moving towards a significant escalation in repossessions?  Is it a case that some of the easier lifting has been done with those who can afford deals but now we are facing into those in extreme difficulty who will have their homes repossessed?  Is that the likely scenario as we move deeper into the cases of householders with greater difficulties?

I appreciate the points Mr. O'Sullivan is making, but I strongly suspect that people who are in extreme financial difficulty - those who have been worst hit by the economic crisis, unemployment and very low incomes - are probably burying their heads in the sand because they know that the bank has nothing to offer them and that they are facing the prospect of their homes being taken away from them.

How can it do this?  While what it is doing would not be my ideal solution, it is interesting that it has big investors who are willing to put money into this option and saying they will keep people in their homes.  Why can they do it and the banks cannot?
