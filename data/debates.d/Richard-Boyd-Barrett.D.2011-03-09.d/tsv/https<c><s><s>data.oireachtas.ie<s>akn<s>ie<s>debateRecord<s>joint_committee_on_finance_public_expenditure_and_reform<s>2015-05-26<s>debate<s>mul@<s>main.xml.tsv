RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the short amount of time available, I will try to fire my questions out as quickly as possible. On the larger European picture, why is the Brussels group - the newly named troika - of which the European Commission is a member, bullying Greece to the point that it might be driven out of the European Union? Although nobody really knows what might be the outcome of the latter, it could possibly trigger the beginning of the end of the euro project. Why has Greece been placed in an unprecedented situation whereby it is being obliged to take the cash reserves of local councils and other state bodies in order to pay interest on debt? The Commissioner can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this to be an absolutely unique and unprecedented demand on a country. As understand it - and, again, I stand open to correction - this is being done in order to shove more austerity, in the form of pension cuts and so-called labour market reforms, down the throats of the Greek people, who have already endured so much and who are in the midst of a devastating humanitarian crisis.Could the Commissioner explain the stance he is taking, which I consider bizarre and cruel? That leads to my next question on the issue of debt. The Commissioner referred to the problems of public debt in this country and he is, more generally, concerned with high debt levels across Europe. We are finding out through the banking inquiry at least one story of the previous Government being told by the ECB to "save the banks at all costs". A gun was put to its head. Mr. Moscovici says he is concerned about debt, yet the policy seems to be to force people to take on these massive debt burdens at a devastating cost. Could he explain that contradiction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He said there was no contradiction between reforming and investing, but there is a big contradiction in those policies. The Commission has demanded cuts in public expenditure in areas such as health and social welfare, but then it gives out about the fact that we do not have decent child care services and says we should have investment, which is a direct contradiction. Is there not a contradiction in Mr. Moscovici's comments in saying that is not the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Moscovici is concerned about macroeconomic imbalances. Joseph Stiglitz recently said that the real macroeconomic imbalance, which the Union does not seem to understand, is the gross inequality in the distribution of wealth, a point which Thomas Piketty has also made. This is the pattern across Europe, and it is the danger to macroeconomic stability. Why is that not addressed by him? Could he also comment on what many people consider to be the return of a property bubble, with rent and property prices going through the roof in this country? What does he think of that? Some of us oppose the consensus on making Irish corporate tax sacrosanct. We think the rate is ridiculously low and that we should break away from a tax piracy corporate tax policy. What is his view on the replacement of the "double Irish" measure with the patent box or the so-called knowledge box? My view is that it is the same thing by another name and it is another tax avoidance facilitation. Will he comment on that?
