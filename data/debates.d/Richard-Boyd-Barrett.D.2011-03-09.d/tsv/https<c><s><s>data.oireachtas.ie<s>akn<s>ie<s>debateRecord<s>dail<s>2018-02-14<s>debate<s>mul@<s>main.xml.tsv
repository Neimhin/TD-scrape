RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What can we expect in terms of the provision of housing under the capital plan? Today, we have had further evidence of the failure of the Government's policy to deal with spiralling house prices. An increase of 12.7% has just been reported. This is on top of the news yesterday of an 81% increase in rent since 2010. It seems as if the Government's solution to all this is to say that, at some point, the private sector will ramp up supply to the point that prices will fall. This is such a fantasy but it is never scrutinised. With the exception of disastrous economic crashes of the kind we had in 2008, prices and rents never fall. They are not going to fall over the medium or longer term, yet the Government's whole housing strategy is based on the fantasy that the market will at some point lead to a reduction in the price of property. I put it to the Government that the only way this could happen is if there were a very dramatic ramping up of State provision of housing. What can we expect in terms of not-for-profit housing whose price and rent we control? What plan can we expect for the State provision of housing to deal with the needs of our country over the period of the plan?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government said that the Government approach to governing would be crucially tested on the issue of housing and how it dealt with the housing crisis. I understand the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on Monday and was a little put out because I was outside protesting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So I believe, but I did not apologise on behalf of the Minister. I was there with people who come to my clinic and who represent the human evidence of the failure of the Government's policies. I will offer some examples of some of the people who were there. Two young women who are pregnant were there. They are homeless. They are being told by the council that they have to go to Brú Aimsir Hostel, where there are many active drug users. They have letters from social workers saying the suggestion is completely unsuitable for pregnant women. The latest response we have received is that when they are seven months pregnant, perhaps the council will be able to get them out. Most pregnancies fail in the first few months. These young pregnant vulnerable women are being put into a dangerous situation for people in their condition. This is the sort of carry-on that is going on. I received an answer to a parliamentary question on housing assistant payment tenancies last year. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government claimed in the answer that the figure was 17,000. I asked how many HAP tenancies failed last year. The figure was 2,250. Some 15% of the Government's HAPs last year failed, and they were the low-hanging fruit in the support scheme. A total of two thirds of the Government plan for 2021 is dependent on these tenancies, which are already failing in spectacular numbers. Does the Government not believe it is time to revisit the entire plan?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Sinn Féin on introducing the Bill. I fully agree with the proposed measure to establish that it would be a criminal offence for banks to lie or give misleading information to the Central Bank of Ireland and to impose sanctions of up to €250,000 in fines and-or five-year prison sentences. This is welcome legislation because people are fed up to the back teeth of there being one law for the bankers and the rich and another for the rest of us. The utter failure and unwillingness of the political establishment to rein in the greed of the banks, their mistreatment of customers and their reckless behaviour, which crashed the entire economy as they financed a wild speculative bubble that presaged the economic crisis and resulted in the imposition of a decade of austerity and misery. We must go much further than the measures proposed in the Bill. As Deputy Paul Murphy stated, not only is the State unwilling to control the greed of the banks but there is no way of doing so, as was evident in the years leading up to the economic collapse and has been evident in the years since. Even when the then Government was forced to nationalise the banks, it refused to exercise any control over their behaviour, including how they treated people in mortgage distress. The tracker scandal is the most recent example of this behaviour. Everything this Government and its predecessors did was focused on nursing the banks back to their position prior to the crisis. The disgraceful decision to privatise them again and allow them to flog off mortgages to vulture funds freed them to do it all over again. Today, The Irish Times reports that further mortgages with a value of €11 billion are to be flogged off to vulture funds by Allied Irish Banks, Permanent TSB and Lloyds Bank. The decision of the National Asset Management Agency to flog to the vulture funds loans valued at €40 billion led directly to the current housing emergency. There has been no willingness on the part of the Government to exercise control over the banks. Instead, it has chosen to nurse them back to health to do what they did all over again.  In the few moments remaining to me, I will highlight one issue about which I asked Deputy Doherty. While the Bill refers to section 33AT of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act, it does not amend or delete the section. The section establishes in legislation that there is one law for the bankers and another for the rest of us. It states as follows:If the Regulatory Authority imposes a monetary penalty in accordance with section 33AQ or 33AR and the prescribed contravention in respect of which the sanction is imposed is an offence under a law of the State, the financial service provider or other person concerned is not liable to be prosecuted or punished for the offence under that law.This express provision means that if a small fine is imposed on bankers for misbehaviour, they cannot be prosecuted. The bankers have avoided going to jail because we have, written in the relevant Act, a different law for bankers who engage in criminal activity from the law that applies to other citizens.
