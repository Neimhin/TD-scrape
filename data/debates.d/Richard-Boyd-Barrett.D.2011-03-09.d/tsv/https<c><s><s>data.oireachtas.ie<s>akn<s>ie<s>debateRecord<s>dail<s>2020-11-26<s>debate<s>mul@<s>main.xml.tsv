RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was reported in the past week or two, and perhaps earlier, that a company set up by Goldman Sachs - it is a crowd called Tramore Funding DAC, a special purpose vehicle that is just two years old and is due to disappear shortly - and which had purchased loan portfolios off banks generated €153 million in tax-free profits from its backers but, through "complex accounting procedures", managed to turn those profits into a loss and paid no tax whatever. Is the Minister aware of this? What does he think about such an extraordinary situation where those kinds of profits are not taxed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The securitisation of loans helped to crash the entire global economy in 2008. The Minister would have to do a fair bit of convincing to persuade me or most people that it is not a very hazardous practice. It is absolutely unacceptable that outfits like Goldman Sachs can purchase these loan portfolios and set up designated activity companies, DACs, in this case Tramore Funding DAC, that can generate €153 million in profits and somehow turn that into a loss. This is not just about that individual company. This is how a huge number of multinational corporations manage to pay nothing like the 12.5% tax rate. They pay next to no tax, or none at all, by using accountancy tricks to write down profits and turn them into losses. The Minister is allowing this to happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can only say that whatever efforts the Minister claims he is making have made absolutely zero difference to the capacity of big financial corporations and other multinationals to use networks of subsidiaries in this way. They can generate profits in one subsidiary and through distributions, royalties or payments of interest on loans from other subsidiaries they magically turn a profit into a loss on the balance sheet. They can therefore tell the Revenue that they did not make any profits at all, even though these practices are reported on and celebrated by the companies in question. They boast about the tax-free profits they are making. A 12.5% share of €153 million is a lot, and we got zero. The Minister and his Government are allowing this to happen.
