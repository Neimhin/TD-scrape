RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Months of Opposition pressure, public anger and protest yesterday dragged the Government kicking and screaming into bringing in a temporary eviction ban. According to the Government's interesting figures yesterday, as welcome as the belated ban is it still means that 2, 273 people will face eviction after the ban ends, which means that the level of homelessness is likely to be up to 13,000 to 14,000 people. Of course, we all know that, in any event, those figures are an understatement. Evictions and homelessness are the most horrible symptom of the deeper and more fundamental underlying failure of the Government to address the housing crisis and deliver the affordable and public housing we need to solve that crisis. The Central Bank decision to change mortgage rules is yet another symptom of that failure. We now risk repeating the mistakes of the Celtic tiger, saddling another generation of mortgage holders with potentially crippling debts, in particular if interest rates go up. All of this speaks to a situation whereby people who need a home are caught in a vice grip of extortionate unaffordable rents and house prices and a chronic lack of public and affordable housing. What does the Government intend to do? In the interests of being constructive, just as we proposed the eviction ban I want to make some proposals about what the Government should do over the coming months. First, the State must buy up all the properties of landlords who are selling up and exiting the market. That deals with the problem of landlords exiting from rental properties. It should be a systematic policy. I see that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is whispering to the Taoiseach that that is happening. Of all of the ones I have raised in my area, not a single property has yet got over the line. We want to see that happen. The State must buy up developer and investor properties to ensure that every new property that comes on the market is affordable. There is no point in developers delivering stuff that nobody can afford. The Government should buy up those properties. There should be an aggressive campaign to take vacant and derelict properties into use, including a punitive - the one introduced in the budget is not - vacant property tax that forces them in. Private building is starting to slow down, therefore a State construction company should be established to equip and support local authorities to deliver public and affordable housing directly. Can we raise the income limits, something that has been promised for more than a year, so that all of those who cannot afford extortionate rents and house prices get the support of the State in being housed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's figures, if it meets, or slightly exceeds, the target for social and affordable housing in my area there will be more people on the housing list in four years' time than there are now. That is how inadequate the policy is. We need additional measures beyond what the Government has done to date. On the issue of buying properties, are rent supplements included in the HAP and RAS purchases? We need clarity on that. People who are over the threshold because they have not been raised are left in limbo if they are faced with eviction or are already homeless. Furthermore, there is planning permission already in existence for tens of thousands of units. Planning permission is not the problem. The problem is whether units are going to be built. It is looking like the private sector may not deliver them. Will they be affordable when they are built? There is no point in selling houses at extortionate prices and saddling people with huge debts or extortionate rents that people cannot afford. That is why we need a State construction company and for income limits to be raised. What about a serious vacant property tax to force the empty units back into use?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to ban evictions for the duration of the current housing emergency.Incidentally, this is the third Bill that People Before Profit has introduced in an effort to ban evictions where people would end up homeless through no fault of their own. The first of these was introduced in 2018, another was introduced in 2020 and we sent this into Bills Office a couple of weeks ago. It was due to be debated in the Dáil and voted on next week.  Last time we brought such a Bill forward, it prompted the Government to introduce the Covid temporary emergency evictions ban, although it had railed against introducing such a ban up until it was forced to do so. Similarly, over months now we have sought to put maximum pressure on the Government to reintroduce a ban on evictions. Perhaps not coincidentally, the week before this Bill was due to be voted on in the Dáil, the Government yesterday introduced a temporary ban on evictions. Although we are glad that it did that, we still want to have this Bill on the Order Paper. It is not clear to us that what the Government is planning to introduce will be sufficient to deal with the blight of evictions into homelessness, which has resulted in nearly 11,000 families, households and individuals being in the appalling situation of being homeless, in emergency accommodation and often in the most dreadful of circumstances. In most cases, it is because landlords are selling up.  Importantly, this will be a test of the Government’s proposed temporary ban. In some cases, as has been said on many occasions in this House over recent months, the cost-of-living crisis literally means that people are making choices between paying the rent and paying the bills, and having the money to put food on the table for their children. Our Bill is clear that where people are in financial difficulty - not wilfully not paying – as a result of a cost-of-living crisis that is spiralling out of control, they should be protected if they fall into arrears simply because of the extraordinary, unprecedented pressures of the cost of living, including food and energy prices, which are crucifying so many low- and middle-income households. It would be interesting to see what the Government does on that.  Our Bill proposes that such an eviction ban would last for a year.The Minister would then have the power to extend that, depending on whether the Government had actually addressed the housing crisis, the unaffordability of rents, the lack of social and affordable housing, the numbers of people in emergency homeless accommodation and, indeed, the cost-of-living crisis which is also fuelling the housing crisis. Now that the Government has been forced to move, we will keep the Bill in waiting, but we will bring it to a vote if the Government fails to deliver the solutions necessary to prevent the blight of homelessness and evictions into homelessness and address the deeper underlying issues of homelessness and evictions. The Ministers and so on should take heed of the example of Jennifer, with whose case I am dealing and who featured on a news programme yesterday, or of Graham and Patricia King, whose case I brought to public attention in the Dáil a few weeks ago. They should they take heed of the example of a couple in Blackrock with whom I am currently dealing. The couple are now overholding and are being evicted from a house in which they have lived since the 1950s with their kids. They were terrified at the prospect of being evicted. They and all the other thousands of people who face evictions need to be protected by the Government. We need sustainable, secure and long-term solutions in terms of social and affordable housing. If the Government does not deliver on that, we will have no choice but to push for the Bill to be voted on in the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss will look very closely at the manner in which our marine resources and offshore marine areas have been grabbed for so-called "relevant projects" in offshore industrial wind. The developers have chosen the sites, which are often very sensitive sites that arguably or definitely should have been designated as marine protected areas, something that the Government has failed to do. I read this morning that hundreds of records released to Coastal Concern Alliance, a citizens' group, under freedom of information rules raise serious questions about habitat protection in the offshore area. The documents seem to suggest political interference in the designation of special areas of conservation and that areas which should have been designated as sandbanks were removed. For example, in the context of areas of the Codling Bank, the Kish Bank and so on that should have been designated as sandbanks and almost certainly would have gained protection but have now been grabbed as sites by developers, there is a suggestion of interference in the designation and lack of protection of those sites where private companies are planning offshore industrial wind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will send the Taoiseach the material.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose that NESC and, indeed, the Government urgently look into the question of the nationalisation of our entire energy sector. I want to demonstrate one example to show the Taoiseach the problems we face. That example is the bills over the course of a year of one woman on a district heating system in an area in Dun Laoghaire. In the bill from January to March, the tariff is 0.8 cent per kWh; in the next bill, it is 21 cent; in the next, it is 38 cent; and in the next, it is 49 cent per kWh. These are multiples of even the extortionate increases for ordinary people who are not caught, but trapped, on district heating systems. I mentioned Enniskerry Road, where the picture is similar in the cost-rental development that the Government trumpeted. This is insanity. It is grossly unfair and it is causing incredible hardship for people that profit-hungry, very profitable energy companies are, willy-nilly, charging unaffordable rates. There is no cohesion to the thing and people on that estate have been cut off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not on district heating.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just one instance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our ability as Deputies to function in these buildings is crucially dependent on the ushers and service officers. They are the first in and the last out, but, in general, they are pretty poorly paid. I raised with the Taoiseach a while ago the issue of the divisors for calculating overtime for ushers still being based on the old Croke Park hours. Essentially, this deprives the ushers and service officers of additional overtime payments. Equally, the service officers for some time have been looking for allowances for some of the additional duties they do and for which they do not get recognition for. I ask the Taoiseach to examine these issues out of respect for the important role the ushers and service officers play for all of us in these buildings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State was reported as saying, I think on Friday of last week, that the Irish people were not ready to join NATO yet. He revealed the cynical agenda and the attempt to condition Irish public opinion by exploiting the tragic situation in Ukraine to try to shred the last remnants of Ireland's neutrality. We all of course condemn in the strongest terms Putin's bloody imperialist invasion and occupation of Ukraine and the attempt to crush the legitimate right of Ukrainians to self-determination.If anybody believes for one minute that this motivates Irish Government policy, the policy of the European Union or the major powers that dominate NATO, particularly the United States, France, the UK and so on, and that they have some principled opposition to military occupation, war, or that they support legitimate forms of resistance and struggles for self-determination, then they need to look again at what the European Union is doing. Let us look at Palestine. A criminal siege of Gaza has been going on for 15 years, creating a permanent humanitarian crisis in a flagrant and ongoing breach of international law. There is ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the West Bank. Some 750,000 illegal settlers are on land that, under international law, is Palestinian. Are there any sanctions against Israel or any mention of sanctions against it in the Taoiseach's speech? Is there any support for Palestinian armed resistance against an illegal occupation? There is none at all. If a Palestinian picked up a gun, there would be condemnation all round. I am not proposing that they pick up guns, but could we at least take the guns out of the Israelis' hands? Could we stop arming the Israelis and giving them favourable trade status? There is not a word, because Israel is an ally of the powers that dominate the European Union and NATO, so Ireland does not care about the crimes it commits against the Palestinian people and it is not going to do anything about those crimes. Another particularly disgraceful example of the gross hypocrisy and double standards at work in the European Union and in our Government policy relates to the situation in Western Sahara. We heard from representatives of the occupied, oppressed people of Western Sahara, who have been subject to a brutal military occupation by Morocco since the 1970s. The United Nations believes it is an unjust occupation. Most importantly, the European Court of Justice has issued three rulings saying that the trade deal and fisheries deal which have been concluded over the last years between the European Union and Morocco to steal the fish and phosphates from the people of Western Sahara is illegal. The European courts annulled that deal, but the European Council and the European Commission have appealed the courts' rulings. Ireland went along with it. It is outrageous. The only country which had the courage to stand with European legal decisions and international law, in insisting that the people of Western Sahara had the right to self-determination and to oppose a deal that they had not played any role in assenting to, which is required under international law, was Sweden. Ireland, pathetically and outrageously, went along with it. Let us not forget about Saudi Arabia. The irony is that we will increase our imports of energy from Saudi Arabia, which has simultaneously increased its oil and gas imports from Russia. Saudi Arabia is effectively laundering Russian gas and oil, but we will do more deals with the Saudis to deal with our energy crisis. It is the most brutal and autocratic regime imaginable. Let us do away with the hypocrisy. The Irish Government wants to shred our military neutrality and our political neutrality, which we should retain. It wants to abandon the revolutionary traditions that founded this State and to join with the hypocrites and warmongers like the United States, France and Britain, which have foreign policy riddled with double standards.
