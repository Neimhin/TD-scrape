RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have loads of questions and there definitely will not be time for the Secretary General to answer them all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, exactly.  He should come back soon.  In the Secretary General's opening statement, he set out five goals.  In fairness, they probably really could be narrowed down to two goals.  Two of the goals pertain to meeting the troika debt and deficit targets and balancing the public finances, while the other ones are about jobs, growth, investment and improved living standards.  Is it not the case that these two sets of goals are completely irreconcilable?  Is the evidence not now mounting that they are completely irreconcilable and that what the Secretary General has set out in his statement up to 2014 is mission impossible?  Is it not the case that it cannot be done and that the evidence is becoming impossible to ignore?  Is it part of the Secretary General's role to give advice or to analyse this issue?  In his statement, he indicated he is engaging with economic commentators, is listening to what the media are saying, is listening to the business community and to economists and so on.  However, a great many people are stating that what he has set out in this statement is impossible, as is what he is trying to do.  Does the Secretary General have a role in assessing this and in advising the Government on the possibility or otherwise of what it is trying to do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Secretary General has been very efficient in implementing the cuts to meet the deficit targets.  Hats off to him on his success in this regard.  Objectively, however, and this is not a matter of opinion, living standards have not risen, employment has not increased and growth has not occurred.  In fact, the Department has been obliged to downgrade its growth forecast, even within the last year.  If I recall correctly, in the autumn of 2011 the Department was projecting 3% growth for 2013.  This projection now has been reduced to 2.2% and while the Secretary General will not provide members with the figure he will give to the Economic Management Council this evening, they can assume it is worse than that.  Are these not objective indicators that the growth, jobs and improved living standards side of the Department's mission simply is not being delivered on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Moran's predecessor, then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point except to state it surely is the case that under the improved living standards and employment criteria the Department has set for itself, it has not delivered as there is no sign whatsoever of progress on those two fronts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the growth forecasts are radically wrong?  We have gone from 3% down to whatever the figure will be, although it is likely to be under 2% and may be under 1%, in forecasting growth next year.  In one year we have gone from the forecast of 3% to this.  How did the Department get it so wrong?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the witness's view of the IMF's recent statement that the negative multiplier effect on the economy is three times worse than it and the Department believed?  We have €8.6 billion in cuts to make over the next three years and the IMF has indicated if growth is 1% less than projected - it may be worse than that - there will be another €1 billion per year in required cuts.  If the multiplier is 1.5 and not 0.5, as expected, there will be a €15 billion hit to the economy over the period of the adjustment.  What is Mr. Moran's opinion of the scenario suggested by the IMF?  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has stated an extra €1 billion in cuts will be required per year over the next three years if we are 1% off on the growth projections, which the witness has admitted must be downgraded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We shall see.  If the multiplier proposed turns out to be the general figure, our debt position would be unsustainable.  Mr. Moran believes that it is currently sustainable.  An unsustainable level will require a much larger level of cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will find out which is the case.  What role does the Department have in the Clearing House Group and what lobbying has come from commercial and private interests with regard to the financial transaction tax and the attitude towards corporation tax?  Does Mr. Moran have any thoughts on the potential revenues forgone by not imposing a financial transaction tax and on the very low effective corporate tax rate, which may be as low as 6%?  Should that be examined?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it Mr. Moran's advice to the Government that we should not touch it?  Does he have any thoughts-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It came from the answers given by the Department.
