It seems to me, particularly given recent events such as the election of Mr. Trump in the US and what many people are calling the rise of extreme populism, that the question of tackling inequality is central to addressing inequality. The political establishment, in all its wailing, hand-wringing and gnashing of teeth, laments what it calls the rise of the extremes at the expense of what I think the Minister, Deputy Coveney, called the sensible centre. The political establishment should recognise that the lesson of what has happened in the United States and much of Europe with the rise of the extreme right is that it is a response precisely to the extremities of inequality that are growing across the globe, which are the responsibility of the so-called sensible centre. It has been under the sensible centre, so-called, that the extremes of inequality that are destabilising our society have grown. I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a remarkable and alarming symmetry between the levels of inequality that form the backdrop to the rise of Mr. Trump and those that exist in this country. That is the real lesson, if we are to take seriously the danger that Mr. Trump and his like represent and if we do not want to see a repeat of it in this country. The levels of inequality in this country have grown shockingly under the Government's watch and under the watch of the Labour Party previously. The number of children suffering deprivation has doubled, we have one of the highest proportion of people working on low pay almost anywhere in the OECD - we are in second place - and the gap between the rich and poor has grown exponentially. All of these factors are witnessed in the United States as well.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had not interrupted me, I would be finished by now. My point is that the extremities of inequality that have grown in the United States in recent years are mirrored and echoed here under the Government's watch and need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While the two particular aspects of the EDA we are talking about here are relatively innocuous, on the face of it, I have a problem with the agency itself for the reasons that have just been alluded to. I am against the arms industry. There is simply no justification for the disgusting arms industry. The EDA was previously known as the European Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities Agency, which was a more accurate title, before its name was softened and it became the EDA. It was set up explicitly to ramp up defence spending and the military-industrial complex and to produce more weapons for use and for sale. The EDA is about developing the European military-industrial complex. The consequences of that are disgusting, in my opinion. I do not use that word lightly. EU countries have licensed arms exports valued at €39.9 billion. This includes €9.7 billion to the Middle East. The biggest recipient is Saudi Arabia. I really do not have to say any more. Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship which is involved in an absolutely savage assault on the people of Yemen. It has produced a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including the displacement of millions of people and the deaths of tens of thousands of people. It is an obnoxious regime at every level. The European military-industrial complex, which the EDA was set up specifically to support, is promoting this kind of stuff. That is what leads to the sorts of horrors we are seeing in the Middle East, including the displacement of millions of people in Syria. Ireland is being progressively dragged into this stuff because of our support for treaties that explicitly increase and ramp up our involvement in this area. There is simply no excuse for the sale of components of arms to countries like Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Israel and the purchase of military equipment from places like Israel. We will not support any further involvement in the European military-industrial complex.
