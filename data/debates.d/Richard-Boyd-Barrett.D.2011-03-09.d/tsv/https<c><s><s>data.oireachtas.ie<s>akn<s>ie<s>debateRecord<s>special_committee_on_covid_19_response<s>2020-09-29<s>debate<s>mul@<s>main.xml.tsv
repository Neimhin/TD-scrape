RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to register an objection to the fact that, two weeks in a row, we have asked the acting Chief Medical Officer and NPHET to come before the committee. We expected them to come in today but they are not coming. It is extraordinary. We have had one party leaders' briefing, which included the acting CMO and NPHET, since the new Government was elected. On two occasions now we have asked for the acting CMO and NPHET to come in here in the context of rising infections, the case numbers going in the wrong direction and many worries about the strategy being pursued and we cannot get key people at the front line of the State's response to Covid-19 to come in here.It is unacceptable and frustrating and adds to my much repeated concern about the expert advisory group's and NPHET's minutes being published months after the meetings take place. Getting information from NPHET is like pulling teeth. What is happening is unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Currently, we are running at between 200 and 400 cases of infection a day, which is rising generally. If we went to 800 or 1,000 cases a day, what would that mean in terms of our tracing capacity? Mr. Reid has said that the HSE is meeting demand and in meeting demand, it has got above 90,000 tests, which I believe was the figure he gave. If meeting demand at the current level of infection is near our testing capacity, it seems to follow that if the number of cases starts to get near the figures we had in April, and let us hope this does not happen, our testing capacity would be overrun; it would be unable to meet demand. Is that a fair comment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on. I have got very little time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will come to that point shortly but there is a view that if we aggressively chase the virus instead of it chasing us and essentially, were we to screen the entire population in the way we screen our cattle in this country, we could identify where all the disease is and extract it from the population. Instead, it seems to me that we are being bounced around by the virus and, at a certain point, we could be bounced so badly we will be overrun. We would then be into hospitalisations. I put that point to Dr. Henry but, given the short time I have available, I want to ask about ICU if we get to that point. In 2009, the HSE said it needed 579 ICU beds. As I understand it, but the witnesses might confirm the figures on this, we currently have approximately 280. That is a reduction from the 354 beds we had in April. That is very alarming. We are far short of a target set in 2009 before the advent of Covid-19. We are significantly down from the figures we had in April and let us remind ourselves that in April, the hospitals were providing ICU in theatre recovery areas.The additional capacity we had was completely surge based and unsustainable in the long run. How close are we to our ICUs being overrun?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true. There is no killing of herds on a large scale. Mr. Reid should not put out nonsense. That is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is very alarming. We have nearly 70 fewer critical care beds than we had in April when the system was nearly overrun.
