RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For clarification, if we are not debating the budget here, what are we debating?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unlike some of my colleagues, I think the USC should be abolished or reduced for low and middle-income earners. However, I do not agree with moving to abolish or reduce it for people on higher incomes and I would like to hear what possible justification there could be for it. The justification for reducing it for low and middle-income people is the fact that we have chronically high levels of low pay and what I believe is a 30% increase in the number of people on family income supplement. People at the lower end have been hammered so I agree with giving them relief. However, I do not agree with reducing the income tax burden via USC or any other means on those earning in excess of about €70,000. Could the Minister respond to that and tell us what possible justification exists for reducing it for those on higher incomes, given the rate of income inequality? In respect of revenue raising from other sources, as a general point, there is a general recognition that we need funds for capital investment. There is an investment crisis in vital infrastructure, be it housing, health or education. There is insufficient investment. The question is where we get the money from. I put it to the Minister that the answer to that question lies in the corporate sector and wealth and that this is the area in which we need to tighten up. Have we not failed disastrously in this area and been brutally exposed by the EU ruling on Apple, the scandal relating to section 110 and the scandal referred to by Deputy Doherty regarding the qualifying investor funds - another scandal that needs to be looked into? We need information on all of these aspects. How many funds are there? How many of these qualifying investor funds are there? We need to know. How much income has been foregone as a result of the failure to impose a withholding tax on these qualifying investor funds? How much tax has been foregone because of the failure to apply the normal corporation tax rate to these section 110 companies? We need every bit of information that Revenue has on the corporate tax heading. We are getting the information two or three years behind so we are flying blind in discussing these matters. We need this information.  I am sure Revenue is aware of the comments I made about the deductions and allowances over the past few weeks but if it is not, I will repeat them. There was a shocking increase in the level of allowances permitted for the corporate sector post-2007. It jumped by €13 billion in two years. That is a tax loophole. My guess is that it relates to Google, Facebook or Apple. This is a huge jump in allowances. I cannot believe that this could happen without it being detected.It took the European Union and some of us contrarians in here questioning these headings to force a serious examination of this. We are talking about billions upon billions of euro in profits that were being siphoned out of the tax system by the multinationals, with nothing being said. Was there any discussion about these matters? Critically, we need to know whether the double Irish is still operating. Despite the Minister having made public comments to the effect that the double Irish is gone, it is not and all the big offenders are still capable of availing themselves of it. We need to know whether they are still doing so. Can we have all the figures that the Minister has and not be two or three years behind in respect of corporate tax? We need a forensic examination of all the deductions and allowances that are being given to the corporate sector and that allow it to write down the amount of profit that is actually being taxed. That is where the scandal lies at the back of the Apple story. Are we now going to calculate the tax liability of all the firms in question from here on according to the decision of the European Union, or are we going to continue to calculate as we have been calculating previously? I acknowledge that the Minister is appealing the decision but there is now a ruling. We will see what the outcome of the appeal is. As those present know, I believe it is absolutely bonkers that the Minister is appealing the decision. How will he calculate the tax of the corporations this year, next year and the year after?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think we were campaigning for the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think my plans for taxes on wealth and corporations might stymy that offer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In Mr. Howard's tables, they come under headings such as “Deductions" and "Allowances”, which jumped to quite staggering levels after 2007, particularly in the deductions section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, there are figures for 2015 and even provisional figures for 2016. They are not complete but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A sum of €7 billion was just mentioned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is where I want to be very specific. As I understand from reading the Revenue Commissioners' own papers, the deductions allowed under that section are allowed in advance, so the Revenue Commissioners do have a figure-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am reading from the Revenue Commissioners' own papers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to interrupt. This is what we need to get to the bottom of. We are not getting to the bottom of it. What we get is commentary and speculation about what may have produced the €2 billion spike. However, we do not receive hard facts and evidence about it. We know it is a question of the patent royalties, but is what is happening legitimate? Are those concerned just saying whatever figure suits them in any given year-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and sending it to one of the subsidiaries that was incorporated here but not a tax resident here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry but I asked about the EU ruling. It stated it was not legitimate because the payments of royalties were in respect of companies that were not tax resident anywhere. That is not legitimate according to the European Union.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that in trying to scrutinise the budget, which is our job, we are flying blind on a number of key questions and under this key heading.We just have to take Mr. Howard's word on certain things without up-to-date information. There is speculation about what may be happening under this critical tax heading. That is unsatisfactory and means that we cannot do our job properly. That is the bottom line. I am still not quite sure if it means that we are calculating. We have not had an answer on the double Irish. Is it still operating? Are companies still availing of it and will they be able to avail of it for the next few years? If we were to calculate the tax liabilities of the offending companies, as the European Union would have wished us to do in the light of its ruling, notwithstanding the dispute about what happened in the past, what would it mean for now, this year and next year? That question has not been answered. There is one other thing I will flag because I do not have time to deal with it. There is an ongoing vociferous campaign by building workers who believe the RCT system is being abused on a rampant scale by building contractors. I have put various questions to the Minister on the numbers in the construction industry on RCTs which are usually subsequently answered by Revenue. In one answer I was advised that 35,000 people were on RCTs, but I was then told in another that there were 70,000 people on them, which is quite a big difference. As only 130,000 people work in the construction sector, it means, according to one of the figures, that two thirds of them are self-employed. I do not believe that for one minute. We then discover that virtually nothing is coming back under that tax heading. In some years there is a minus figure, but overall there is almost nothing, which suggests there is absolute rampant abuse of the bogus self-employment RCT system. I do not believe we are taking seriously the allegations that are being made consistently. The dogs on the street in the construction industry know that this is going on and still we do not seem to be doing anything about it. I will flag one further issue. The Unite trade union, in particular, and some of the other unions have highlighted the very low levels of employers' PRSI as one of the big deficits in the tax system in terms of having a sustainable tax base. We have much lower levels of employers' PRSI than in most of the rest of Europe. This is at the heart at the tax battle or conflict about where we will get the money to have a sustainable tax base.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a very simple question. Given that certain tax heads are ahead of the projections - I know some are also a bit behind - does the Minister have a figure or will he have a figure anytime soon as to how much extra tax revenue may be available and spendable in the budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is saying the fact that certain tax revenues are higher than expected will be traded off against certain expenditures.
