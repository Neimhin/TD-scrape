RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We discussed this on Committee Stage and I have submitted another amendment, which attempts to take on board some of the defence the Government side gave when it came to the concerns that were raised by us at that stage. The Government said that there is, or can be, difficulty in getting qualified people to be medical assessors on a permanent, full-time basis, and for that reason they needed the option of getting people from employment agencies. Taking the Government in good faith in that regard, I have put forward an amendment that allows the Government that option, but only after the option of directly engaging people on a full-time, permanent basis has been exhausted. That is a fair compromise because it is not ideal that we should have agency people coming in. It can be more costly and is more haphazard because people are going in and out and not developing the necessary expertise. Another issue I will raise in regard to some of the other amendments I have tabled is that we need some discussion about the medical qualifications of these assessors. Are they specialists? Are they people who have specialised, expert knowledge in the particular areas they are supposed to be dealing with? I suspect they are not. As we will discuss later, even worse is the fact that we often have unqualified, non-medical people as deciding officers, second-guessing qualified medical practitioners who give diagnoses on the care and support needs of people with disabilities, which is totally unacceptable. We will come to that in a minute. At the very least, if the Government is saying that it is forced, in a non-ideal situation, to take agency people on for this staff sometimes, then it should only be as a last resort when the possibility of getting full-time, permanent and appropriately qualified people to make these medical assessments has been exhausted. Let us not forget, these applicants are very vulnerable, disabled people with real needs, who should be our absolute priority in this regard, never mind the need to have decently paid, proper jobs, for people performing this important task. My amendment is a fair attempt to deal with the Government's difficulty in getting medical assessors while prioritising the objective of getting full-time, permanent, directly employed people wherever possible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not quite sure, given the Minister of State's response and the fact that he seems to accept the points we made-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He suggested that his objective was the same as ours in terms of the issue of concern in that he is trying to get full-time people, and I accept this. I am not entirely sure why the Minister of State will not accept what I think is a reasonable compromise amendment, because it would set it out clearly in the legislation that while the option is retained to use agency people where they are needed, the optimum situation is for us to employ people on a full-time permanent and direct basis rather than on an agency basis. The amendment I have tabled is in line with what the Minister of State said, and deals with his concern that this option should be available. I am not sure why he will not accept it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, line 6, before "employed" to insert the following:"where the Minister is unable to engage directly a registered medical practitioner, and only where this is the case,".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 6, to delete lines 31 to 38, and in page 7, to delete lines 1 to 30.This was discussed on Committee Stage, and in an effort to be reasonable and take on board the Government's concerns while addressing the issues we raised, we have tabled a series of amendments which shift the balance of presumption about people's entitlement to carers and supports towards the positive and away from the negative. To clarify what I mean, the Bill states, "For the purposes of the definition of 'relevant person' in this Chapter, a person shall not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless the person has such a disability that he or she requires from another person" continual supervision throughout the day, and other requirements outlined in the Bill. This series of amendments proposes that the Bill should state that a person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention.It is a positive rather than a negative. I think the negative wording in this Bill is symptomatic of what is actually going on in the Department. We will come to this again later when we are dealing with another issue in the context of other amendments, some of which bizarrely have been ruled out of order. The bureaucratic default position of rejecting people's applications is probably influenced by budgetary considerations. Many vulnerable people, including some who are disabled, are being put through unnecessary hoops in order to access their rights and entitlements. These people, who are already suffering in difficulty, need to be supported. The framing of this whole legislation, not just this section or this part of the Bill, is about tightening up and providing the legislative back-up to say "No" as the first response. If it is not the case that it will place a bigger onus on the applicant who is seeking to get resources or supports, and if our anxieties and concerns that this is the inclination of the Department and the Government are misplaced, the Minister of State should have no reason to refuse our amendments. If the intention of the Bill is to provide support to anybody who is entitled to that support, as it should be, there is absolutely no reason for the Minister of State not to accept these amendments. The only reason to refuse to accept them would be a desire to retain a provision that will make it easier to say "No" without good cause. I hope that is not the case, but some of us on this side of the House suspect that it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe the Government on this one. There is no justification to the changes it is making. From an objective analysis of the current legislative wording, any sane and sensible person will see the Government is tightening the criteria around the eligibility to justify current practice which is completely wrong and unfair.It inflicts unnecessary hardship on legitimate applicants who, I repeat, are vulnerable and disabled people who are being refused supports and benefits they should get when they are ill and vulnerable and need support. That is what is going on. It relates to people who are being refused at first instance and who subsequently get it on appeal when they go through hoops or come to Deputies' clinics. These Deputies go to oral hearings or submit letters to get these people through the hoops to get them benefits and supports they should have got in the first place. Bizarrely, our amendments suggesting that the medical eligibility criteria and the diagnoses of GPs and qualified medical practitioners be simply accepted and not second-guessed by unqualified, non-medical deciding officers have been ruled out of order on the basis that they are a charge on the Exchequer. If someone meets the medical criteria for a benefit they are entitled to apply for and a medical practitioner testifies that they are eligible, how can that be a potential charge on the Exchequer? That is rubbish. It is a disingenuous way of trying to cover up what is going on here, which is a tightening up of eligibility rules. There is no doubt about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do believe the Minister of State but I do not believe the Government's intent in terms of this legislation. We have all seen, in practice, what is going on. The Government needs to get its head around what is going on and the actual intention of this legislation. When one looks at this issue in the round one begins to wonder if the thought process behind this Bill is to shave a particular budget to cover the cost of the back-to-work family dividend. Whether or not this is the overall thinking behind this Bill, people who are vulnerable and disabled, who are entitled to care or support, are being refused it because of the default position of "if we can refuse them, we will refuse them." The people in FLAC are very reasonable. Under the principal Act, the term "relevant people" is defined as follows:(4) For the purposes of subsection (1), a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where— (a) the person has such a disability that he or she requires from another person— (i) continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions, or (ii) continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself, (b) the person has such a disability that he or she is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months, and (c) the nature and extent of the person’s disability has been certified in the prescribed manner by a registered medical practitioner.That is positive. To get support a person needs only to meet those criteria and the medical practitioner's certification of eligibility is taken as fact. However, this legislation as drafted seeks to tighten up this provision in line with the practice over the past few years of deciding officers second-guessing doctors. Unqualified, non-medical people are second-guessing the diagnoses of general practitioners and medical professionals in order to deny people supports to which they are entitled.  Interestingly, our amendments, which seek to provide that a general practitioner's diagnosis be accepted, have been ruled out of order. They were also ruled out of order on Committee Stage. When we asked on Committee Stage why they had been ruled out of order we were told it was because they would result in a charge on the Exchequer. What does this mean? It means that budgetary constraints are overriding medical diagnoses. That is clearly apparent. The fear of the Department is that if the word of GPs in regard to whether a person needs care or support is accepted this will impact on its budget. This is not the basis on which care and supports should be provided. It should be the case that where a doctor certifies that a person requires care or support that support is provided. This legislation provides that somebody else, who is not a doctor or a qualified professional, can disagree with the GP and not provide the support. Applications are being delayed in the hope that some of the applicants will go away out of frustration, which many of them do. This is what this legislation seeks to do. There is no doubt about that.  I propose to press this amendment because too many people are suffering unnecessarily as a result of this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, made a very significant announcement in Limerick this morning to journalists about social housing. The announcement was not made in this House, despite the fact the housing crisis is probably the most serious social emergency we have in the country. Will the Taoiseach explain why he did not come-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the intention of the Government to have the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, come to the House and explain what he said to journalists?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will there be a debate in this House on it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why I am asking the Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want a debate on the strategy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no action. This is bogus. There is no action except in Limerick.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have certainly had to think long and hard about my attitude to the final vote on this Bill, and I had to consult colleagues. This is because a trick is being played with this Bill. The trick is to smuggle in a very regressive measure under the cover of one that is marginally progressive. I find that sort of politics quite dishonest. It is a way of trying to blackmail the Opposition into endorsing legislation that is regressive. Much of the debate on this Bill has focused, for important and entirely legitimate reasons, on the issue of lone parents and the impact of changes already made, but not dealt with in this legislation. I am referring to the phasing out of the one-parent family payment for families when their children reach the age of seven. That was a the regressive move. As has been said, we were promised this would not be implemented until we had Scandinavian-style child care but we have not got that. The Government has broken the promise. Instead of giving what it promised, it has offered the sop of the back-to-work family dividend, essentially under pressure owing to agitation by lone parents, advocate groups such as SPARK and its supporters in this House. In so far as the Government has been forced to introduce the dividend, lone parents who are not working will be able to move on to the transitional payment and, therefore, not lose out. However, as has been pointed out at length, those who are working will lose out, even with the back-to-work family dividend. That loss will become increasingly worse over a number of years. On the other hand, it is better than nothing for those who will benefit from the concession the Government made under pressure. While much of the debate has focused on that, what was smuggled in under the radar was not really spotted by me and most other Deputies until we read the detail of the legislation on Committee Stage. We saw in various sections of the legislation that the Government is giving a little with one hand but taking away with the other. The taking away is in the form of the tightening of the eligibility criteria for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant. These issues are every bit as serious and important as those concerning lone parents. This is a real sleight of hand by the Government. We have debated this extensively through the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, in addition to those we tabled on Report Stage this morning. The Government has not given any justification for the changes included in this Bill in respect of the criteria, the definition of a "relevant person" who would be entitled to carer's benefit, or the criteria for eligibility in that regard. We just got bluster. The reason for this is to cover up the fact that the Minister of State, his officials and everybody knows that this is a tightening up. The Minister of State said something to the effect that the previous legislation was ambiguous. If I am correct, that was the justification. The Minister of State said this Bill is doing away with ambiguity. I would prefer the ambiguous version because it offers more latitude and support to the applicant for the carer's allowance, or carer support, than the tightened-up version. The existing legislation states a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care where they meet the criteria. This Bill states a relevant person "shall not" be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless certain criteria are met. That is a clear shift in the presumption of entitlement. It absolutely clear that it is a shift. It makes it easier for deciding officers to say "No". That is essentially giving legislative support to deciding officers who were wrongly refusing applicants. When they refuse people, they are inflicting suffering on a very significant cohort who do not need further suffering on top of the disabilities, illnesses and infirmities that lead them to apply for carer supports in the first place. It is just not fair. Needless suffering is being experienced. We should be moving in the opposite direction, as alluded to in the amendments that Deputy Collins and I tabled. These amendments would simply require the acceptance of the word of a general practitioner. I will make a point I did not have time to make earlier. When we discussed this on Committee Stage, I asked why we should not simply accept the word of the general practitioner or professionally qualified medical practitioner when testifying to medical eligibility for a carer's payment. The response we got from a committee member on the Government side was that it would put too much pressure on general practitioners. We also heard the excuse that it would make the general practitioner judge, jury and executioner in the determination of eligibility. I would much rather a general practitioner, who is medically qualified to decide whether somebody needs carer support, to be judge, jury and executioner than somebody who is not medically qualified and for whom a significant pressure is the budgetary constraint. I am not merely speculating that budgetary constraints are an influence on deciding officers; we know this because amendments to address this were ruled out of order on Committee Stage because they would represent a potential charge on the Exchequer. Why would they be a potential charge on the Exchequer? If somebody meets the medical eligibility criteria for a benefit, he is entitled to it. If the Government were honest in this legislation, it would actually say the relevant person shall not be entitled to a benefit unless he or she fits the medical criteria, "subject to budgetary constraints". Of course, it would not say "subject to budgetary constraints" because that would completely undermine the principle of the measure, which is supposed to be a support for people who need it.The Department could not possibly admit that in legislation but it is absolutely clear that this is what was driving the thinking. The idea is that the Government cannot open the floodgates, as the Department would see it, because it would impact on budgets and would bring a charge on the Exchequer. The Government does not admit that this is what is driving the tightening up of the criteria in the legislation. It is dishonest legislation. One of the implications was explicitly stated at the committee. Certainly, from talking to some of the Deputies afterwards - I am not referring to the Minister of State, but other Deputies - there was a belief that general practitioners are willy-nilly signing letters stating that someone needs supports or is permanently disabled or whatever, when that is not the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is what is in the Bill. That is the point I am making. The implication is that doctors are lying and writing false testimonies on a large scale. I do not believe that for a minute. Even if there are a small number of abuses, the idea that the Government would frame the legislation on the presumption that large numbers of GPs are lying is rubbish. It is an absolutely unacceptable way to frame legislation, particularly when the alternative is to depend on deciding officers who are not medically qualified. I believe that, by and large, when GPs say someone needs support, they need it. That should be enough. Having thought it over and in view of what is going on here, I believe we have no choice but to vote against the Bill. I have no wish to vote against the back-to-work family dividend, not because it is sufficient compensation for the axing of the one-parent family payment for children over the age of seven years - it is not - but because it is a marginal improvement on the decision made in 2012. It should not be lumped in with a regressive move which will tighten the eligibility criteria for carers and for a significant cohort of others on an ongoing basis for years to come, including people who are vulnerable, disabled and infirm. These people need support. They should not have extra unnecessary hoops put in front of them to claim their entitlements. These two things should not be lumped together. I want to make it absolutely clear in saying I am voting against the Bill that I am against it on the basis of what the Government is doing around the eligibility criteria for carers. If the Government were cognisant of this, it could easily introduce amendments in the Seanad that would separate out the two issues. That would allow us not to oppose the parts of the Bill that will improve the situation for lone parents without forcing us simultaneously to endorse something that will disimprove the situation for vulnerable, ill, disabled and infirm people. The Government should not ask us to lump those two things together.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, the Minister of State does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not tie anything.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After appeals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Once upon a time what we now call banking was known as usury and it was illegal to lend money at interest because back in those days they understood the potential for lenders to engage in profiteering and extortion and held that to be completely immoral. We have moved from that and now not only is it not illegal to engage in extortion and profiteering when lending money to people, but these institutions rule the roost and dictate policy and governments cower before them as they blatantly engage in extortion and profiteering. It is quite extraordinary. I commend Fianna Fáil on raising the issue. I disagree fundamentally with its solution for dealing with it because we do not need more market competition to deal with this. We do not need more banks lending money which always hammer out an informal cartel arrangement anyway to deal with this sort of extortion and profiteering. We need a public banking system where banking is not about profit and extortion but is about allowing for the circulation of money to the benefit of all citizens, the economy and society as a whole. Considering the extortion that is particularly being suffered by variable rate mortgage holders, why on earth are we allowing the banks that we bailed out to do this to people? It was laughable for the Taoiseach to claim that our banking policy was not to the benefit of the bankers, but was to the benefit of the consumers and mortgage holders. Are mortgage holders, who are unable to pay their mortgages because of extortionate interest rates, feeling the same as Mr. Richie Boucher when he collects his monthly pay check, which could probably pay the mortgage interest on about ten mortgages in one month?
