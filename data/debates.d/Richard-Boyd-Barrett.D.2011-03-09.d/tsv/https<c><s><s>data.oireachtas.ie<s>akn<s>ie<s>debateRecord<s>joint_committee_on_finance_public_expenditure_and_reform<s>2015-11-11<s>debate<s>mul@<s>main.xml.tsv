RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to thank everybody who has presented their views here today. It is interesting, although I had not thought a lot about it coming into this meeting. It has occupied us all in a more general way in recent years with tribunals and all of that. Fair play to the witnesses for thinking about it and for briefing us. Hopefully it will prompt me, and maybe all of us here, to think about this in a bit more detail. If I understood Dr. Byrne correctly, she is arguing for a whistleblower's office. Am I correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think that is vital. SIPO sends us a lot of stuff to fill out every year. I have been late a couple of times, I have to confess, but it is right and proper that it is sent to us. That, in itself, is an improvement. However, I do not actually know what else SIPO really does. Is the proposal here that SIPO and the whistleblower's office would all become part of one big standards in public office unit? Does SIPO currently have any role in whistleblowing? Can whistleblowers go to SIPO at the moment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. That is a useful piece of information for me, apart from anything else. That does not just relate to elected representatives, but also to people making disclosures or whistleblowing in relation to public officials generally. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must think my way through it, but we definitely need a whistleblowers' office. The question before us then is whether that should be integrated. As Mr. Tyndall stated, the need for streamlining of the legislative role is unquestionable. We are probably all on the same page there, but then, as well as having the best possible legislation, and streamlined so that it is all in one place, the question is, what sort of agency or agencies should we have? Those seem to be the parameters of the discussion. Dr. Byrne states that at present it is quite fragmented, and I would agree. People do not know where to go. Frankly, I do not know where to go some of the time. Is it proposed in the general scheme, is anybody proposing it, and how does this overlap with the Ombudsman's office?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Tyndall in favour - maybe he is not allowed to say - of integrating all of these offices into a single one?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Tyndall venturing any particular opinion on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that. I tend to lean towards a commission. Maybe none of the witnesses are allowed to say because they are all being very balanced and neutral, even those who are veering one way or slightly veering the other. I can see the advantages of the commission only because, when one is dealing with a fairly broad range of areas, including quite controversial issues, it is good to have a bit of balance; a few heads are better than one. On first impressions, I think I would prefer that. However, I like the idea that the offices that deal with public complaints, concerns, whistleblowing, etc., would all be one body. Is it the logical follow-on of the streamlining of the fragmented legislation, or rules and regulations, into one piece of legislation that one would also try to integrate the different agencies that are points of engagement for the public on these matters into something bigger and more visible that becomes a well known force to which the public can go, although it might well have different sections that deal with different aspects of all this? On the first observation, that seems like quite a good idea.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dr. Byrne stated that Canada was a good model.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Market-based whistleblowing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I see the point but alarm bells are ringing a little bit. It is not because of ideology but a genuine concern that there will be a financial incentive to make allegations that have no substance. How does one guard against that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Mr. O'Keeffe elaborate on why he was not that impressed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would have no friends at all. Everybody would be running away from us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are aware of particular cases, can we bring them to the commission?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who do we actually take those cases to?
