RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for their attendance. I always enjoy their contributions and reports. I do not always agree with them, but they are always informative. I think I understand their critique which, in layman's terms, is that given the uncertainties in the economy and outside it, including Brexit, a possible downturn, the onset of protectionism and an over-dependence on corporation tax receipts, we could be in a very vulnerable position. In that context, having spending Estimates which may be less than realistic, given the commitments the Government has made, could cause big problems if any of these chickens comes home to roost. That is, more or less, the critique of the council. Of course, that still leaves all of us the political conundrum of what to do with it. It seems that, in broad terms, we have three choices. We can spend less, raise more revenue or manage projects better. The answer would probably include all three, but a trickier question is trying to figure out the key ways to deal with the problem. I put it to the delegates that, given the size and openness of the economy and its vulnerability to all of the things to which they referred, there is almost nothing we can do vis-Ã -vis the unpredictables. I make that general point, although I am not saying we should not do anything. What I am saying is that if any of those chickens comes home to roost, we are not really going to be in control of the situation. I am interested in hearing the response of the delegates.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that we are such a small cork is part of the problem. In general, the more things the Government can control, the better the control we have, but to my mind, private interests have too much control over what will happen and they will just do it to us, as they did in the past. That is an ideological point.One of the issues on which the council should focus a little more and which is referenced in its analysis is the drift and increase in the cost of housing assistance payments. This is an issue about which we should be talking a lot more because we should not be so vulnerable to it. Is the council concerned? I know that it cannot be too political, but it is flagging certain concerns. Is it concerned about what private property sector interests could potentially do to us, given the dependence of Rebuilding Ireland on it? If I was Minister for Finance, I would grab as much of the extra corporation tax revenue as I could, and more, and barrel it in a massive council housing programme because at least that exposure would be reduced significantly and we would also be dealing with what is a major macroeconomic and social problem. The delegates might not agree with all of my prognosis, but do they agree that we have massive exposure in that area that could be every bit as big as some of the others to which we referred in the context of threats and vulnerabilities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rents for housing provided by the AHBs are controlled. They are largely controlled, whereas they are not controlled in the private sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask one more question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Mr. Coffey go into any more detail on what he considers to be sustainable sources of additional revenue? He knows my view on where we could and should get extra revenue, including from a wealth tax, higher or at least effective taxes on corporations and an increase in employers' PRSI to European levels. Is Mr. Coffey willing to give a few examples of sustainable sources of additional revenue as against unsustainable sources?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit, among others, has always opposed the property tax. Given the review that is under way and the fact that, at some point, the Minister will have to make decisions on all these matters, will he consider abolishing the LPT at this time? When it was introduced, the Government said it would provide more funding for local services. It has not done so. We were told it would help to dampen the type of property madness we saw prior to 2008. It clearly has not achieved that objective. In addition, it has proved in its operation not to be fair in the way the Government suggested it would be. Increases in the tax have been deferred several times and the Minister does not know quite what to do in that regard. We are left with a situation where the Government is having to look at all sorts of convolutions to reconfigure it. Is not all of this proof that the tax was fundamentally flawed from the beginning and was always going to be unfair? The basic problem is that the payment was linked to property prices, something over which householders have absolutely no control, and which have, in the intervening period, gone out of control. It represents an additional payment for something people have paid for already and, moreover, ability to pay - that is, the income coming into the household - is not taken into account at all. All these chickens have come home to roost and the Minister is left in the dilemma of what to do. Without being too political about it, it is surely fair for those of us who opposed the tax from the beginning to say that this dilemma is good reason to reconsider its whole merit. Our view is that it is a fundamentally flawed tax. The Minister must finally deal with the problems arising out of the linkage between the tax and property values, which are going through the roof. If we go ahead with the tax as originally envisaged, those increased property prices will see huge increases in payments due. Even after any changes the Minister might introduce, the problem of the linkage with property values remains at the heart of the issue. Will the Minister now consider that the problem is, in fact, the property market? Will he take on board the other matters we have been highlighting all along?Rather than put an unfair tax on the family home, will he review things like wealth taxes, particularly in the context of the enormous wealth generated by those who are speculating on property? A reconfigured property tax might be redirected away from ordinary homeowners towards those who are profiteering from the property sector, driving it out of control and doing immense damage at several levels to society, including to the people who are trying to put an affordable roof over their head. At this point, the mess in the property market amounts to a macroeconomic threat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister stated earlier that some of the problems he is facing in reworking the LPT are to do with the unevenness of property prices, price increases and so on. How can he say that in one breath and then state that it is fair to levy a tax based on the value of somebody's property when there is no consistency or fairness as to how those prices have, as in most cases, increased? How can he make those statements at the same time when, clearly, the value of his or her property bears no relation to the actions of the householder?
