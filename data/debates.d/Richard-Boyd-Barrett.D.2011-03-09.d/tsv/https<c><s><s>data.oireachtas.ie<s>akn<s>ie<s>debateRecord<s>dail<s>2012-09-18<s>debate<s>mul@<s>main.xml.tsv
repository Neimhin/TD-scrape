RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister think it is completely unacceptable that Clare County Council is blackmailing applicants for higher education grants in the context of the household charge-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and threatening the future of young people and their career and education prospects?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it okay to blackmail people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which was set up as part of the troika deal, warned that growth forecasts had been consistently off and overly optimistic and that unless growth targets were met - it is looking highly likely that they will not be met - our debt would become unsustainable.That is what the Fiscal Advisory Council, not the left or the Opposition, is indicating. It has warned that all the growth projections so far have been wrong, and all the dangers are on the down side. Against that background is the question of us getting some relief on the debt, which is absolutely urgent as it will become unsustainable otherwise. Over the summer months the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have intimated there might be some progress on the debt issue but last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel put that to bed and said we would get nothing. She indicated there is no envisaged change and none is necessary. She set out her stall. The only idea those people seem to be concerned with is that we continue to impose austerity and even if there is a restructuring of the debt, it would be conditional on further austerity. We are either in the grips of the loan sharks in the troika and their demands for austerity or the requirements of the markets to impose austerity. Is there any choice for the people in the country that would give relief from austerity? Is the Taoiseach pursuing any deal on the debt that will allow him to say, in the upcoming budget in December or the following budget, that people will endure less pain or austerity? Will the Taoiseach comment on the fact that, in its report, the Fiscal Advisory Council indicated that three quarters of the way through next year this country will not be spending more than it can afford, with the entire basis of the deficit being interest on debt? Is it an acceptable choice that in 2013, we are saying it is more important to pay bondholders and satisfy the loan sharks of the international markets while subjecting the people of this country, who simply cannot take any more, to further cuts and austerity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have to write a cheque for bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know if Dr. Angela Merkel and EU leaders are making a fool of the Taoiseach or he is making a fool of the people of this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Someone is leading the people of this country on a merry dance where we are told there are negotiations and discussions that may lead to something and there are hopes of relief, but nothing materialises. Meanwhile the hammer of austerity falls again. People in this country are quaking in their shoes at the prospect of what may be done to them in the budget in December. The Taoiseach should not underestimate the fear and anxiety out there. He must know it. In the face of that, Dr. Angela Merkel said we are getting nothing. Are these negotiations, which the Taoiseach said he is pursuing, going to bring any relief to the public who are terrified about further austerity? Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable, given that Europe and Dr. Merkel are giving us nothing and that we are getting diddly-squat from Europe in terms of debt relief, that we are still going to allow â‚¬1 billion to be paid out to unsecured Allied Irish Banks bondholders on 1 October? Does he think our negotiating strategy is working? Does he not think it is time to get tough and say that if they do not give us something that will give relief to the people of this country who have suffered enough, we are not going to pay off these unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders on 1 October?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are coming in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Setting aside our different views on the morality of what Clare County Council has done and the precedent it may set, has the council legal authority to refuse third level grants to students whose parents have not paid the household charge?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought the only legal basis for refusing third level grants is failure to meet the eligibility criteria. Has anything changed legally? In other words, it does not matter and people will get the grant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we have clarity on that? The second issue I wish to raise, which I have been doing for the past year, is the housing Bill. When will it be brought before the House for discussion, given the atrocious situation where 96,000 families continue to rot on housing waiting lists for up to ten years in a State with almost 250,000 empty houses? The Taoiseach claims the State does not have any money but we have plenty of empty houses. Can we have a debate around that Bill, which would allow us to move that situation forward and deal with the unacceptably lengthy housing lists?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach does not have to answer the question about the household charge.
