RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council representatives. Anybody looking at this committee would be somewhat baffled by some of the discussion. Would it be a fair summary of the witnesses' comments, particularly in light of the EU ruling on Apple - I certainly agree with them - that the tax dodging activities of multinationals have now significantly distorted the real picture of the Irish economy to the point that the well-being of the economy is exaggerated significantly and that if we were to strip out all of that, the economic position would be far less rosy? Would it also be fair to say that it is imprudent, to use the witnesses' word, to rely on this stuff for any expenditure plans the Government may have? The council is saying that in so far as the Government has expenditure plans, they are on the outer limit of leaning on what may be a very unreliable source of income. I get that, but perhaps the witnesses could confirm that is what they are saying. Is it fair to say that, against that background, there would be nothing imprudent at all about spending the €13 billion that the EU believes is money in the bank already, money Ireland should have received in tax? It is not about the volatility of future corporate tax receipts linked to the tax dodging activities of a small group of multinationals.The money they have said is owed is money in the bank so it would be perfectly prudent to spend that money. I speak in fiscal terms and with a view to maintaining a sensible fiscal stance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does Mr. Tutty believe constitutes tax dodging?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point but we spoke about prudence. If the EU ruling stands and the money was money that was owed to us, there would be nothing imprudent in our spending the money. It is money we should have had all along. Is that not the fact?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say we had to spend it all in one go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a question on the general corporation tax head. There has been a gross distortion of the growth figures because of what we believe is probably the relocation of intellectual property assets by Apple. Mr. Coffey outlined the figures in question relating to deductions on the part of Apple and a few other companies. The figures jumped massively from 2007 onwards and were part of what I believe is a tax avoidance apparatus. As far as I know, the figures we have go up to 2014 but is there any way of us knowing what is now happening in that area? Could we have a more detailed understanding of it? We have spoken about potential volatility in this area so it would help us make a judgment if we actually had the information. We do not have an up-to-date picture of the figures on corporate tax, on income, on profits and allowed deductions or allowable tax write-offs. Does Mr. Coffey think that is a problem? I certainly think it is a problem. There has been much talk about closing off the double Irish but do we actually know that the double Irish has been closed off? These companies can still avail of it and have done so in the past couple of years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are there not provisional figures? We get announcements on those.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Mr. Coffey not want to ask, as I do, for information that is as up-to-date as possible in the form of provisional figures? We could then have some picture of what is going on. This is a huge distortion in our economy, which has spawned the term "leprechaun economics" and made us the laughing stock of the world. Would it not be helpful for us to have a more detailed picture, if not the final figures? Would it not be helpful to have the provisional figures available to us so that we could work out what is happening here? I would like to know if the double Irish is still operating in reality. It is available until 2020 so are they using it or not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is very important and I accept what the witnesses say about disentangling the double Irish from trade charges. The jump from 2007 onwards, however, is spectacular. The deductions were allowed go from €6 billion to €19 billion and then to €21 billion. Can Mr. Coffey confirm that these were deductions that were allowed in advance? Mr. Coffey's paper refers to advance tax rulings and said the companies allowed a certain amount for the year. It then goes on to state that the companies used most of it, a fact which, presumably, is established later. We would therefore have a figure for what was allowed for 2015 and 2016, albeit that some of the figures will be provisional. Those figures should be furnished to us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are, certainly, but my point is that they jumped extraordinarily. The scale of the jump is so vast. If I was in the Revenue Commissioners, I would be looking at whether this is an abuse of the allowances in place. If an allowance goes from €6 billion to €19 billion in a couple of years and then goes up to €21 billion, I would be asking whether the allowance is being abused on a massive scale. If it is, the potential loss of revenue to the State is simply staggering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The companies are setting their own prices.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are quick-fire questions. First, the council representatives said that the Government was at the outer limits of prudence. Would it be fair to say that our view about how we could and should raise extra money for spending, current and capital, from wealth taxes or higher taxes on those with higher incomes is far more prudent because it is about gaining extra revenue from relatively stable sources rather than basing it on sources that, the council maintains, are volatile? Second, is it part of the remit of the council to warn against imprudence? We have mentioned the €300 billion figure for intellectual property. Another figure, which is the same, coincidentally, is the €300 billion worth of NAMA assets that have been disposed of, mostly to a small number of vulture funds. Is it part of the council remit to warn that this might be somewhat imprudent? Do the council representatives consider that movement of assets into a small number of hands imprudent? Finally, we know the 26% jump in GDP is a fantasy. To what extent was that fantasy, perhaps on a smaller scale, present before the jump? How might that have affected the money we had to pay out to the European Union in the past ten years? Could we quantify that in a rough calculation? Given our population by comparison with other countries, was our contribution to the EU disproportionate? Does the council agree with that proposition?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is because it is prudent. We are very prudent, in other words.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a matter of opinion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a further question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put this question to the ESRI as well. We have had a discussion about possibly making a case to Europe or there was reference to discussions in Europe about distinguishing between capital and current expenditure, particularly where there might be a return and so on. Is it the council's understanding that currently there is provision for us to make that distinction which therefore would allow us to borrow in particular areas without it being considered to be breaching the rules? I have not got a definitive answer on that. Alan - is it Alan Bennett?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Alan Barrett seemed to indicate there might be circumstances, and people have argued for this in some cases. Is it true, for example, that if money is spent during flood emergencies, such expenditure is different? Does the council know exactly what the rules are on this? Is there any flexibility or is it a matter of us making a political case for a change? I am thinking of housing in particular and if we can say we have to do this, that there is a guaranteed return if we do it and we can make a case for it, is there any flexibility for that or is it a hard and fast rule?
