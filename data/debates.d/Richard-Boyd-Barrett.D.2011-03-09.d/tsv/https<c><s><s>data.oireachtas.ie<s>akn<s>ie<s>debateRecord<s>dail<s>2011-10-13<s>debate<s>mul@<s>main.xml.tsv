RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In light of the fact that county councillors in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council made a decision earlier this week to opt for the most expensive option for new iPhones——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——when a cost neutral option was proposed to them——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will a matter like that be dealt with in the fiscal responsibility Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This comes under the fiscal responsibility Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not deal with excessive expenditure by local authorities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine Gael and Labour councillors decided they want to spend more money——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not get €43,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Stagg is wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Stagg should check his facts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister clarify that last point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Richard Bruton stated it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is bad enough that those with special needs and low-paid workers, our accident and emergency services, and workers struggling to make ends meet, the 350,000 people who have lost their jobs or the 200,000 who have left the country, have to pay to satisfy the greed of the bankers and the bondholders which the Government, the EU and the IMF wish to protect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Minister's policy amounts to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is sacrificing the needs of our society——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——and the needs of our most vulnerable citizens to pay off bankers and bondholders.  This is what the Minister is doing.  If all of this is not bad enough, there might be some justification for it if it contributed one iota towards economic growth and recovery and eventually putting people back to work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue of State assets exposes the lie of this strategy.  This is about getting rid of the very resources and assets that could create jobs, that could provide the engine for economic recovery——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister knows well because he has read the ICT report on the Eircom privatisation which was published this year.  It makes me laugh to hear Fianna Fáil criticising the possible sale of State assets when they presided over Eircom, which was a disaster, led to 5,000 jobs being lost and to massive enrichment for Tony O'Reilly, Goldman Sachs, George Soros and all the rest of the vultures.  It is shameful for a Labour Party Minister and a Labour Party Government to stand over in any way or to justify the sale of State assets which the Minister knows has been a disaster in the past and which will do nothing but enrich corporate vultures, chief executive officers who will be getting inordinate salaries while at the same time resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs.  It is beyond debating.  What we need to do is to get out on the streets like the Greeks and the Americans and resist this.  It is shameful that the Labour Party should be part of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the cuts to the fuel allowance the Minister is proposing and the cuts she has already indicated to the household benefits package are the sharp edge of an obscene attack on the most vulnerable sectors of our society and that despite soothing words about covering the cost of electricity and gas price increases the reality of these cuts is a matter of life and death for people?  Is the Minister aware — I am sure she is — that there were 2,000 winter related deaths among elderly people, most of them pneumonia, colds and other winter related ailments?  Is it not a fact that these cuts mean more people will die?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can that be justified when Ministers are earning €140,000 a year, gas company executives are earning €400,000 a year and ESB executives are earning €650,00 a year when we are talking about equality of pain?  None of them will die because of any increased taxes but elderly people may die as a result of these cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I urge the Minister to reverse these cuts and any thought of imposing cuts on fuel allowance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Minister use the work of community welfare officers as a smokescreen for the substantial question that is being asked of her?  If we have already had 2,000 winter related deaths, is it because the funds to procure fuel and electricity to provide warmth for elderly and vulnerable citizens are inadequate?  Many of them would not have the confidence, knowledge or ability to contact a community welfare officer.  The reality is that an unacceptable situation is now going to be made worse because of cuts to fuel allowance and household benefits package.  More elderly and vulnerable people will die if we continue to cut the fuel allowance and other vital allowance for electricity and gas.  That is not acceptable and I do not know how the Minister can justify it.  Surely we can look to the well paid and the wealthy to bear this burden instead of putting it on the most vulnerable and elderly sections of our society where it will result in deaths.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all agree with that idea but it does not justify the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have had a lot of calls about this.  A simple criterion should apply; if someone wants to go back to education or to further their education, he should not be put in a position where he must stay on the dole for another six months before qualifying.  It is an extraordinary situation.  One young woman approached me recently.  She decided not to sign on after having been away because she did not want to be a drain on the State.  She was forced to sign on somewhat later and was subsequently refused the back to education allowance because she had not signed on earlier.  When she put it to the social welfare office that she had not signed on because she did not want to do so unnecessarily and be a drain on the State, she was told she should have signed on, been a drain on the State and she would then have qualified.  It is crazy.  If people show the energy and dynamism of wanting to improve their education and not be forced into dependency on social welfare, we must deal with the anomalies that would people in that position and I would urge the Minister to do that.
