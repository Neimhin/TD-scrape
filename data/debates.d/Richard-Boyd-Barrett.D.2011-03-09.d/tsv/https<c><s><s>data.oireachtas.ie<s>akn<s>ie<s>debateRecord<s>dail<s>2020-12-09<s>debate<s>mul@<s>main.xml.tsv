RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last Wednesday, the Taoiseach and his Government insulted the student nurses and midwives of this country by voting down the Solidarity-People Before Profit motion, which was drawn up in conjunction with those student nurses and midwives, calling for them to be paid. The Taoiseach has since insulted them by suggesting that they are not doing real work and that he is protecting their education, when we have repeatedly given him dozens of testimonies from those student nurses and midwives about the extent of their work, about how they are being exploited in terms of working with Covid-19 patients, getting Covid-19 themselves, working with the sick, the dying and mothers giving birth and about the number of hours they work. The Taoiseach has also insulted them by suggesting that they are getting allowances when huge numbers of them are not getting allowances at all. Even if they do get them, those allowances would not cover their accommodation or travel costs. The Taoiseach has added the final insult by refusing to pay the student nurses and midwives who protected us on the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic and signing off on an unbelievable restoration of pensions and of increases of up to €15,000 for former taoisigh and civil servants who are in already in receipt of payments in excess of €100,000. That is simply shocking beyond belief. In doing this, the has further insulted those to whom I refer by betraying the promise in the section of the programme for Government relating to healthcare workers in which it is stated that the Government would reward our healthcare workers for the work they have done on the front line of Covid-19 and for their dedication and professionalism. He has betrayed what he said directly to me in this House on 20 October to the effect that he would return them to the healthcare assistant, HCA, rate of pay which had been agreed during the period of Covid-19 earlier in the year. In fact, the first thing the Government did after penning the words in the programme for Government was to take that HCA rate off them. The Taoiseach should stop with the spin, stop believing the fantasy he is being told by the HSE and listen to the voices of the student nurses and midwives. Will the Taoiseach reinstate the HCA rate that was given to the student nurses and midwives earlier in the year and that he took back from them as one of his first actions in office? Will he dispense with the nonsense that there is a choice between getting paid and getting a degree? Even in Britain, nurses pursuing degree courses get significant bursaries and do not have to pay excessive fees. Will the Taoiseach stop insulting the intelligence of student nurses and midwives, respect the work they do and pay them for their placements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, I have to respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One student said: "My name is Conor. I am a first-year nursing student. In the last week I have had to wash, feed, lift and dress Covid-positive patients unsupervised." Another, Michelle, said:I finished my final six weeks' unpaid placement of fourth year. I was doing between 70 to 80 hours per week for six weeks, sometimes finishing placement at 8.00 p.m. and going directly into a 12-hour night duty sleepover shift, most of the time not sleeping as I had to get up and assist people with their needs.I could go on; I have dozens of these testimonies. The Taoiseach does not need to talk to the HSE. I have invited him - and I invite him again - any day this week or in the next week to meet with the hundreds of student nurses who will give him the accounts directly of how it is systematic. It is not an isolated instance; it is systematic. We were in favour of FEMPI restoration for nurses, teachers and ordinary low- and middle-income front-line workers who were robbed as a result of austerity cuts. We always said that nobody - politicians, top civil servants - should be getting pensions or pay from the public purse of over €100,000.The Taoiseach should not spin that nonsense to deflect from the shocking unwillingness to pay student nurses and midwives and should instead keep to the commitment to giving them the healthcare assistant rate that the Government took off them but that they were given earlier this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nonsense. Absolute nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the Government's health service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not think it is okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have invited the Taoiseach to meet the people involved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach want to meet them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are any of these press advisers the people who researched a speech of mine from back in 2016 to inform the Taoiseach's earlier attempts at deflection over the student nurses and midwives? Would their time not have been better spent overnight, instead of looking at a speech of mine about FEMPI in 2016, looking at the hundreds of testimonies from student nurses and midwives about their systematic work exploitation with the sick, with those with Covid and with those giving birth? Would those advisers not have been better looking at those testimonies and finding out whether the nonsense the Taoiseach is getting from the HSE is, in fact, the nonsense that we, and the student nurses and midwives, more importantly, know it to be? I would be curious. Who did that research and why were they not busy verifying a far more important issue about the hundreds of nurses and midwives who say they are being systematically exploited and not paid for the work they are doing in the front line?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has not checked out the situation of the student nurses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So they can be victimised?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should take up the offer to meet them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not have to be paid over €100,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bring it in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Income and pension differentials are a very serious economic issue. I do not want to spend too much time on this because I want to ask about another issue but the Taoiseach knows, and I ask him to, please, not be dishonest, that when we sought restoration of the FEMPI pay and pension cuts, it was for low and middle income earners. He had four items of legislation which targeted particular segments, including the higher paid pensioners and civil servants, so I ask him not to give us the nonsense that there is not a way to stop obscene increases for people on already obscene pensions in excess of €100,000. From the transport point of view, I ask about the plight of the taxi drivers yet again. There was a temporary waiver on the ten-year rule for having to get a new taxi for the year 2020 but there are 1,600 taxi drivers who, in 2021, starting with the first taxi driver on 3 January, are required to replace their taxis, which they cannot afford to do because they have lost all the income for this year. They have asked about this and there was a review, a consultation and so on but they have no clue whether they will get a waiver for 2021 and, if they do not get a waiver, they will not be able to afford to run their businesses and replace their cars. Can the Taoiseach, please, give a clear indication to taxi drivers now that the ten-year rule for 2021 will be waived and that those 1,600 taxi drivers and others who are not sure what will happen in the middle of next year will not have to replace perfectly good taxis that must, in any event, pass NCTs and suitability tests?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Separate them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We simultaneously said-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before Christmas if possible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach meet with them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the bizarre things about this discussion on Covid-19, whether it is spin doctors or consultants as is the case with this question, is why the Government just does not go and do the research. The Government tells us we have to do the research when presenting the Taoiseach with the evidence around the exploitation of student nurses and midwives. It is beyond bizarre. For the record, and the Taoiseach’s consultants or press people could do some research on this, in Britain student nurses used to get paid £15,000 with no fees, as a bursary while they were students. The Tories cut that and in the years following a massive crisis of recruitment and retention ensued which is still persisting in the NHS. Even the right-wing Tory, Boris Johnson, has reintroduced significant cash payment bursaries and the waiving of fees for student nurses and midwives in degree programmes. If the Taoiseach wants the answer to the question that he asked, we want degrees with payments for placements and no extortionate fees if one wants to recruit and retain the nurses that we need in the health service.
