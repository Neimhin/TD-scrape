RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to indicate that I might put down an amendment on Report Stage proposing the deletion of everything in the Bill after section 1, that is, from section 2 on.  It should be replaced with an indication that we will either resign from the International Monetary Fund, IMF, or that we will not commit to any of the Bretton Woods Agreements and will delete them from the Statute Book until there is proper democratic reform of the International Monetary Fund, whereby governance of the fund would not be based on weights which are essentially related to the size of economies and their wealth and power.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to apologise because I must leave shortly to attend Leaders' Questions.We will discuss this further on Report Stage.  While others may have other opinions there is probably consensus across much of the political establishment on the need to pass this Bill.  However, I wish to dissent because I believe it is not technical at all and it is disingenuous to suggest it is.  It is deeply political and arises from the fact that the IMF was utterly discredited after the Asian crisis.  Many of the funding nations, particularly in the Asian area but also countries such as Brazil, which had been devastated by the consequences of IMF dogma and doctrine applied to their countries, were seriously considering - rightly in my view - their membership of the IMF and the value of the IMF as a global institution.  The IMF has been scrambling to regain its credibility ever since.This amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreement is about trying to rehabilitate the IMF, restore some of its credibility and give the pretence of increased democratisation because, of course, much of the criticism that was levelled at the IMF during that period arose precisely because it was a creature of the big global and economic powers that had been the victors at the end of the Second World War and emerged as the powerful economies in that period.  They essentially used the IMF as a vehicle to asset-strip resources and impose their economic will in the developing world in particular.  Faced with a very high level of criticism in the aftermath of the Asian crisis and as a result of the disastrous consequences of IMF structural adjustment programmes being imposed in the developing world, they felt the need to restore credibility by giving slightly greater voting weight to what are now called the BRIC countries because they are deeply worried about the rise of the newly industrialised nations and that they could be eclipsed in the global political stakes by the newly developing industrialised nations such as Brazil, India, China, South Africa and so on.This is an attempt to counteract the criticism of the IMF by giving slightly greater voting weight to people who are willing to sign on.  However, essentially it copper-fastens a global financial institution which is still far from democratic.  It is still based on the new alignment of economic power in the world.  A slightly greater voting weight is given to certain countries, but there are a great number of countries which are effectively disenfranchised in a real sense and it will still be utterly dominated by the big powers.  That is wrong and indicates the IMF always acts in the interests of the big players.I wish to comment on some of the debate regarding the visit of the troika and the comments the IMF representatives made to me when I met them which bear this out.  Their policy and now this amendment are often presented as technical issues, when they are not technical but deeply ideological and political.  For example, a key question of concern to people is whether the IMF, the troika or the Government is making the decision on the possible sale of State assets.  In response to a question I asked representatives of the troika last week, they said that they encouraged governments to be very ambitious in the area of privatisation and sale of state assets.  I asked their reasons and whether it was to pay off debts or to provide money to fiscally stimulate the economy.  They replied that they just believed privatisation was more efficient.  Regardless of whether one believes that, it is ideology and it is the IMF ramming a particular ideology down the throats of this and other countries which are in its grip.  I believe that is not technical even though some people like to present it as such - it is ideological and political.  We should question that and it is important that this Bill is not rushed through the DÃ¡il as if it were a technical matter when it is deeply political and of great significance for this country and the world.
