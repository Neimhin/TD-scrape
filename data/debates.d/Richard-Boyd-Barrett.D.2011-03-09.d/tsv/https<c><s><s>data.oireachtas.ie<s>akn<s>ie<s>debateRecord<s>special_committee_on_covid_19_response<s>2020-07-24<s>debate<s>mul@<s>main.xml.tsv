RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise in advance to Mr. O'Leary from the NBRU. My time is short and I specifically asked that the taxi drivers attend today, so I will fire most of my questions at them. They have been ignored. However, I will quickly put a question to Mr. O'Leary. The subsidies for public transport in Ireland were lower than almost anywhere else in Europe before Covid. For the public's benefit, will Mr. O'Leary say how low they were and how Covid has added dramatically to the case that we must have a substantial increase in them, given that public transport is now more essential than ever? I will put the rest of my questions to the taxi drivers' representatives. It is obvious that taxi drivers have been ignored and are being treated with contempt by the NTA. Now, their industry has been decimated and there is no roadmap - pardon the pun - back for them in the current period. All of the associated elements - tourism, live entertainment and music, bars and so on - that would have given them the possibility of having some sort of sustainable income are on the floor as well. Will the witnesses state the case for why the income subsidy to allow people to return to work is so crucial? Do they agree that the failure to extend the pandemic payment to people aged over 66 years put the affected taxi drivers in a very dangerous position in terms of their health and that, even now, taxi drivers are caught in a terrible bind? If they return to work, they will lose their payments but they cannot earn a decent living in the current situation. If they remain on the pandemic payment, however, it will be cut and cut again. Indeed, it has already been cut. This puts them in a dilemma. My next question is on the number of taxis. Before Covid, there were more taxis in Dublin than there were in New York. The idea that the NTA would continue to issue licences for new taxis when the industry is on the floor seems crazy. Perhaps the taxi drivers' representatives could elaborate on this. They might also comment on the appeal for the same large stimulus grants that are being given to some businesses to be given to taxi drivers as well to cover the â‚¬11,000 of annual fixed costs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to comment on the Chairman's remarks. China is a brutal, totalitarian state that has a terrible history of oppression, including against the Uighur Muslims mentioned by the Chairman and dating back to Tiananmen Square. It is not a telling indictment of our State and the NTA that taxi drivers who need PPE cannot get it from the Government or the NTA such that they have to get it from China? The Chairman's question should be directed to the NTA, not taxi drivers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do. I thank Mr. Macken and Mr. Waldron for attending. I thank all of the taxi representative groups-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will proceed now. My first question is to Mr. Macken and Mr. Waldron. Would it be a fair summary that the key things they are asking for are a step-down income subsidy to make it viable for taxi drivers to survive, grants to cover fixed costs because the loss of income means that members cannot cover them, the extension of the ten-year rule to 15 years, a moratorium on new licences and, critically, that the NTA, the Government and Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport treat taxi drivers with respect and give them fair representation on a committee that is supposed to be representing them? Perhaps Mr. Macken and Mr. Waldron will comment on whether that is a fair summary or if there is anything else they would like to add. They might also give their views on why the NTA seems to be treating taxi drivers with such contempt, ignoring them and seeking to reduce their representation on committees rather than increase it.
