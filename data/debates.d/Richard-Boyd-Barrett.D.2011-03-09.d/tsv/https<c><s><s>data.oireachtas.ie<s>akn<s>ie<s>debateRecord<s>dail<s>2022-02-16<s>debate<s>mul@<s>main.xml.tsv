RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Regional Group for tabling this very important motion. As has already been said, the question of transport for people with disabilities is absolutely critical. Without a decent transport system, every aspect of their lives is diminished. This includes access to education, employment, a social life and everything. As a result, people with disabilities suffer disproportionately from poverty and in terms of the impact on their mental health. This is not merely grossly unfair because if we are serious about the UNCRPD we are, in fact, also infringing their rights. We are failing to vindicate the rights of huge numbers of people who have a disability. This failure has continued. I was a member of the finance committee when the issue arose of there being a problem with the mobility transport grant and motorised grant. This was because it was discriminatory and if we opened it up it would cost a fortune so, therefore, we would have to reconsider the entire thing. It has been left on ice for eight years with no financial support for people. It is absolutely outrageous penny-pinching and the impact is pretty severe. I want to instance one example of something that points to solutions and to the failure of the Government in this regard. I have raised this repeatedly. I think I have raised it with the Minister of State. I have certainly raised it with the Taoiseach. It sums things up. This morning, my office spoke to the group Accessible Community Transport Southside Limited, ACTS. It provides a door-to-door service. It was doing 1,100 trips a month prior to Covid and this reduced to 550 during Covid. As a result, this impacted on its ability to generate funding. People cannot use their free travel pass on this scheme because it does not come under the Department of Transport. Ironically, Dublin Bus and Transport for Ireland advertise this door-to-door transport scheme for people with disabilities on their websites but do not give a cent towards it. Nobody will take any responsibility for this. The Department of Transport does not want it and the Department of Health does not want it. Will it go to the Department with responsibility for disability? We are not quite sure. Perhaps it will. The point is that for the want of €53,000 in immediate funding, it could close down. I understand it met the Minister of State. The last I heard, which was today, was that it had not heard back.Therefore, the group still does not know whether it is going to get the money. It needs €250,000 to replace its fleet. It used to have ten buses and now it is down to four. This is disgraceful, given it is such a fantastic service. It is disgraceful that those who use the service cannot do so for free. The fare structure, which is necessary if the group is to fund itself, is such that €12 is charged for a journey between 0 km and 5 km and €16 is charged for a journey from 5 km to 8 km. As much as €35 is charged for a journey between 25 km to 32 km. Those concerned have to do flag days and stand outside shopping centres collecting money. It is outrageous. There are similar services with which I am not as familiar, including Easy-Cab Travel Club, Lucan Disability Action Group, Cork Accessible Transport and Vantastic. They should be part of the public transport system and should be funded. They should not have to organise flag days and all the rest of it to avoid the possibility of closing down because of a lack of funding. They should not have to have me come in here essentially begging on their behalf. I hope this will be addressed as a matter of urgency. It is absolutely unacceptable. Public transport has a responsibility. There are many with disabilities who cannot access a normal bus service because services are overcrowded and because there is only one wheelchair space on a bus. There are similar issues associated with the DART. In this regard, I want to raise the Access for All Ireland campaign. I pay tribute to Mr. Bernard Mulvany and Sean O'Kelly, who have campaigned so consistently. Again, they are substituting for the failures of Iarnród Éireann, the Department of Transport and so on. What do they do? They send texts to people saying the lift is not working at such and such a DART station and that if people go there they will be trapped or unable to get on the train. This happens to people regularly. Mr. Mulvany told me this morning that there are three different portals with information on what is happening in each DART station. One is online and its information never correlates with what is actually going on at the station. Another comprises the displays at the station, which show information that is different from the information online. Another portal, which, apparently, is somewhat reliable, is the office putting the information together. Therefore, there are three sources of information on whether the lift is working. Lifts are constantly breaking down. We have removed personnel from many DART stations. If you go to one and there is nobody to help you with your problem, you are in trouble, which in itself is a disgrace. We should put staff back in the DART stations. The other point Mr. Mulvany raised - I was not aware of it - is that people in rural areas still have to give 24 hours' notice to get on a train or bus. That is outrageous. We had a fight up here about that and there were some improvements. While it is still far from perfect in Dublin, 24 hours' notice must be given in rural Ireland. Where is the equality in that? This links to many things, including our failure to take seriously the UNCRPD and our ongoing failure to sign up to the optional protocol. Ireland is one of two countries that has not signed up to it. Why? It is because we are afraid we will be caught out. Ireland has one of the lowest levels of subsidy for public transport in general anywhere in Europe. We are penny-pinching with public transport generally by comparison with our European counterparts. Ours is more expensive, less frequent and less reliable. While it hurts everybody, it hurts people with disabilities most. As a result, they cannot trust the public transport system or risk using it. In Canada, brilliant services similar to ACTS have been institutionalised. As the state directly funds them, people do not have to worry about organising flag days and whether funding will be available. They do not have to charge fares to their customers because the public transport system provides a door-to-door service to people with disabilities. That is the sort of service we need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Eighteen years ago, the British Government was critical in supporting the US Government in telling a pack of lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Those lies were used to justify a murderous war in that country, albeit against the nasty regime of Saddam Hussein. However, the premise of the war was a pack of lies that had been recycled by the British Government and the US Government. That war had disastrous consequences for the people of Iraq and the entire region. Given the events of the last few weeks around Ukraine, does that history give the Taoiseach any pause for thought about the claims of NATO and the United States that an invasion of Ukraine is imminent? Do not get me wrong; Putin is a nasty, authoritarian piece of work and I do not trust him. However, the Russian ambassador has stated that it would be insane for them to invade Ukraine. The Russians have started to move some of their military forces away from the border and, indeed, out of Crimea. Yet, NATO and the US are still saying that war is likely. This happens to coincide with NATO and the European Union looking for massive increases in military expenditure, including from this country. Does the Taoiseach not think that to some extent the role of a neutral country is to ask questions about the drums that are beating for war?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach trust US military intelligence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has all changed since Iraq, has it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Americans and British are angels then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	New computers for the HSE might help.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was appalling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is more evidence today of the crisis in the health system. Covid shone a light on a hopelessly dysfunctional, fragmented, under-resourced and understaffed health service and brought us to the brink but all that dysfunction, fragmentation and lack of resources and staff is coming back to bite us quickly in the aftermath of the pandemic, especially in the context of emergency departments being overrun and what we saw in north Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, which is widespread. Why are we failing to recruit and retain the staff that are necessary in order to provide the health service that we need? One problem I would put to the Taoiseach is that when I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for a review of the over-medication of children by CAMHS because of the lack of staff last April, he did not answer the question directly but bounced it on to the HSE, which then gave me a pro forma answer which stated that there would not be a review. I asked a question in April regarding a general review of the over-medication of young people by CAMHS because of the lack of staffing, which, I believe, is widespread and is not limited to north Kerry. The Minister for Health - this is standard practice when you ask the Department of Health for anything - stated that he was not going to answer the question and that he would bang it on to the HSE because it was responsible for it. This begs the question as to what the Department of Health and the Minister are responsible for. The HSE gave me a pro forma answer indicating that it would not conduct a review and now we have the scandal with regard to what happened in north Kerry. Is the lack of a proper, integrated, properly governed health service part of the reason nobody wants to work in it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many instances that demonstrate that the equality for people with disabilities to which we signed up with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is not being delivered.There is one that I want to draw to the Taoiseach's attention and that I ask the Government to address as a matter of urgency. Many people who have mobility problems or who are in wheelchairs simply cannot access the existing public transport system. Bus, DART and train services are not suitable for their wheelchairs so they have to rely on essentially voluntary clubs, that is if they exist, such as ACTS, which I brought up with the Taoiseach before and there is a similar organisation in Cork city. Those door-to-door services essentially have to fundraise themselves. They get bits of money here and there from this or that Department, but they get no money from the Department of Transport. People's bus passes, which are no good to them because they cannot use mainstream public transport, do not apply to these door-to-door services so they have to pay quite significant sums of money to access public transport. The Department of Transport gives no funding whatsoever to these door-to-door services. That is a lack of equality for people who are particularly impacted by disability. I think their bus passes should fund their use of these door-to-door transport services rather than relying on voluntary funding. That is what equality demands. I ask the Taoiseach to address that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just reading over the debate in January 2003 in the Oireachtas in advance of the Gulf War when then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen, got up and defended what we now know to be an absolute pack of lies told by the US Government, US military intelligence, the British Government and British military intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that did not exist. Brian Cowen and others said there was a real danger they existed and something had to be done and the consequences of this were absolutely devastating for Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction that did not exist except in dodgy dossiers and lies told, primarily by the United States and Britain, led to the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people and the devastation of Iraq. Here we have the Government today doing exactly the same in a completely one-sided assessment of military intelligence provided, primarily by the United States and Britain, about the threat of imminent war from Russia. There is no critical assessment. As I have said to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, I think Putin is a thug. He is a militarist. He has done horrific things in Chechnya. The Minister is happy to talk about his threat, but not about the record of the United States, Britain and NATO and what their agenda is. There is not a word of criticism. That is why I do not trust this report. I do not trust the agenda behind it. I do not trust Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with our military neutrality because they have trashed it. They have allowed us to be complicit in the slaughter of innocent people in Iraq with devastating consequences for the Middle East. I do not trust this. It is fairly ironic that we are talking about fighter jets, the need to defend ourselves and €500 million extra - or is it €2 billion - which is what NATO wants and which is what the militarists in the European Union want us to do. They want to go along with that but when it comes to paying the soldiers who might be sent out to die in these situations, the vast majority of them are on less than the average industrial wage. Moreover, the EU working time directive does not apply to them so that they have to work overtime for free, they do not get the housing they used to get any more and they are affected by the housing crisis and so on. Why does the Government not pay the soldiers? If it has so much respect for the Defence Forces, it should pay the soldiers decent money. It is a joke. They will have all these new ships and aeroplanes and the Government cannot even have the number of Defence Forces personnel that we need because the pay and conditions are so rubbish. The Government should pay the Defence Forces properly and let them be affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but it should stop trashing Irish military neutrality and actually restore it, and stop signing up with warmongers. Whether it is NATO, the US or, for that matter, Russia, neutrality means neutrality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is important legislation. Insofar as it seeks to improve the whistleblower regime, its intentions seem laudable enough. The provisions seeking to include volunteers, shareholders, those in administrative management or supervisory bodies, and those who have a work-based relationship that is yet to begin or who are involved in a recruitment process, all seem good. The establishment of the office of the protected disclosures commissioner within the Ombudsman seems a good thing, as does enhancing the protections for workers who suffer penalisation as a result of a disclosure by changing the burden of proof in civil proceedings. However, Whistleblowers Ireland has made a number of criticisms of the Bill, of which officials are probably aware. The first criticism is that legal cases, Clarke v. CGI Food Services Limited and Baranya v. Rosderra Meats Group Limited, established that the guidelines produced in 2015 regarding the operation of protected disclosures under the 2014 Act did not accurately reflect the law. That is important because, at least according to the Whistleblowing International Network, it meant that many of the people who should have been afforded protection fell at the first hurdle, as the actual code of practice employers and others were using to operate the protected disclosures regime was inaccurate. That is pretty elementary stuff. The regulations flowing from the legislation should be accurate and should ensure that the intent of the law is given effect and that whistleblowers have the protections they are supposed to have. The biggest concern I have, which is reflected by whistleblowers, is whether the protections under the 2014 Act worked at all. Are they acted on? Some people have asked about the private sector. If a business has more than 50 employees, it has to have its own channels and the public sector has to have its own channels as well. I am aware, anecdotally, of people who have attempted to make protected disclosures and they have gone absolutely nowhere. Others have mentioned examples of that as well. Nothing happens, or they make a protected disclosure, very little happens, and then they get thrashed for something completely different. That is a classic tactic. People make a protected disclosure about malpractice, maladministration or wrongdoing, and the next minute they are hauled up for something else. Then it becomes about them and what they have done wrong because the management or some power that be has decided to thrash them, victimise them, blacklist them or whatever. What are we going to do about that? I am just not sure whether this legislation will address that problem. It is a deep problem and I do not have all the answers. There is a fundamental imbalance between workers and bosses. That is just a fact. In either the public or private sector, if somebody kicks up or calls their employer out on something, the instinct of most senior management is to go for them because they are afraid that it could reflect badly on them, that the buck might stop with them or that they could be held accountable. How do we deal with that fundamental imbalance of power? I want to hear the Government explain how that is going to happen. I would not mind some hard facts on this matter. Maybe they are available. I am not on the relevant committee, so I apologise if there are a lot of hard facts available on this. I would like to know the details of what has happened with protected disclosures in the public and private sectors. How many disclosures were made? How many were upheld? How many went nowhere? Are these facts and statistics available so we can assess the extent to which the legislation had any effect whatsoever? It seems to me that, broadly speaking, we need genuinely independent and well-resourced people to oversee this. That is why I welcome the office of the protected disclosures commissioner and the ombudsman. They are needed in order to make sure that whistleblowers are actually protected, that the protected disclosures or allegations of wrongdoing they make with regard to public or private bodies are treated seriously and are fully investigated, and that people are held accountable if those investigations discover that there was merit or validity to those allegations. Maybe the person was just raising legitimate concerns. They may not have been absolutely correct because these things are not always black and white. Where someone has genuine concerns about things that are going on and has made a complaint, even if everything they said did not turn out to be true, if those concerns were legitimate they should be protected and the matter investigated. They should not suffer retaliation, either directly or indirectly. There has to be some mechanism for dealing with that because when management or higher-ups retaliate, they do not do it directly. They do not say they are going to sack someone or blacklist them because they made a protected disclosure. Of course they would not do that. They go for them in other ways, usually by trying to fit them up for something or label them as a troublemaker or vexatious. What happens to people who feel there is wrongdoing, malpractice, abuse or whatever it might be in a particular industry where the conditions of the workers are deeply precarious? Does this legislation deal with such situations? These people may not even have an employment relationship with the people who are abusing them but they may be part of an abusive industry or sector. Today we heard from representatives of performers in the arts, such as comedians and so on, who appeared before the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media. There have been similar allegations from people in the trad music scene. These people are self-employed lone traders - sole traders, essentially - but in reality they are dependent for their employment on a relatively small group of people in the arts and culture sector, many of whom are funded by the State and get public money. These people have described a culture of fear in the sector.I have heard it repeatedly from actors, musicians and all sorts of people working in the arts that if you speak up about abuse, malpractice or whatever, that phrase you will never work in this town again is often used. That is the way it works. What are we going to do about that? Is that covered and how will we vindicate it to make sure that it is effective? Certainly, that sort of thing is widespread. I would like to know how can we address the following issue, which I have raised in other forums. In some cases, the employer denies that they are the employer even though they are. It is bogus self-employment. What rights do you have if you are being misclassified as a contractor when, in fact, you are not a contractor? You are an employee and you should have the rights of an employee but this is a way of the employer denying their responsibility to you as an employee. Therefore, if you make a complaint, they do not have to process it because they are not your employer. We need to address that. A particular egregious example that I have raised many times here is going on in the film industry. I do not know how many times I have raised it with the Departments of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and Finance, where allegations have been made by film crew that the section 481 tax relief is being abused. When they went into a joint Oireachtas committee in January 2018 and made these allegations, guess what happened? They never worked in this town again, having worked for decades in the film industry. The names of some of these people are on the credits of films over the past 20 years but they will never work in this town again after they came into an Oireachtas committee. What is interesting about this example is that all film productions in this country are funded with public money and they are conditional on giving quality employment and training. You are only supposed to get the relief if you provide quality employment and training as a result. Under EU directives, you are also supposed to create a permanent pool of skills in that sector. Notwithstanding the fact that film-making can be somewhat episodic, you are supposed to have rights and you are supposed to have rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, which deals with people who are in these situations of episode-to-episode type employment. You accumulate rights of service under the law, but what happens in this instance is that when workers make complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, that their rights are not being respected, the film producers, who get the public money conditional on the provision of quality employment and training, go into the WRC and say that not only are they not the employer of this person even though they were the producer on the film on which the person worked but, in fact, they could not possibly have an employment relationship with him or her. They are saying this in the WRC as we speak, and they have said it repeatedly. Representatives of Screen Producers Ireland, which also gets public funding, collects the money from Revenue for providing quality employment and training and then, when the crew who are employed on these films make complaints, say that they could not possibly have an employment relationship with them and it is the nature of their industry that they do not have employees. If you say anything, you will never work in this town again. How are we going to deal with that? I am putting those points out there because I think they are relevant. I am not saying I have all the answers but I think they need to be addressed. You can have all sorts of laws, intentions and all the rest of it but it is no good unless they are actually to be enforced, unless there is a mechanism to enforce them and unless there is a mechanism to stop the abuses. The nature of the sort of abuses we are talking about, when we are talking about the things that whistleblowers bring up and the retaliation they face, is such that there is an in-built power imbalance. Usually, it is people in powerful positions against whom the complaints are being made who obviously have no interest in acknowledging the truth of those allegations and who, in fact, have a vested interest in thrashing the reputation, and often the livelihoods and lives, of the people who make those protected disclosures. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response. I would be particularly interested in and keen to see the statistics and the facts on the operation and effectiveness of the 2014 legislation. If they are available, the Minister of State might let me know where.
