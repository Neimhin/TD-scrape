RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach agree this is not about forms of words, but rather about the brutal austerity that has been imposed on people in this country for the past three years which has led to a massacre of jobs, a massacre of our public services and attacks on the most vulnerable in our society to the point where many people are on their knees?  All of that resulted from a decision by governments in this and other European countries to bail out banks at all costs and to impose austerity.  Given the obvious disastrous consequences of three years of austerity and bailing out banks, how on earth can the Taoiseach or other European leaders expect that institutionalising austerity in the form of a euro compact will make things any better?  Surely it is absolutely inevitable that it will do exactly the same as it has done in the past three years.  By prioritising banks and their balance sheets and insisting on the imposition of austerity on ordinary people, one will get the same result and the situation will get even worse.The Taoiseach referred to firewalls against contagion in the eurozone.  Where are the firewalls for the unemployed in the euro compact?  Where are the firewalls for the vulnerable?  Where are the firewalls for workers?  My colleagues and I from the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform met the German ambassador earlier today.  He told us that announcements would be made on Monday regarding stimulus measures and job creation.  He did not say much about what these measures would involve but that, given the demand for fiscal rectitude and austerity, they would hinge on competitiveness.  What the hell does that mean?  When wages have been ratcheted down to the extent that most low and middle income workers in this country have been impoverished, when we have 400,000 unemployed and the numbers on the streets are multiplying daily, what does competitiveness mean?  Does it mean the country must be starving before investment magically floods back into it, following which everything will be all right again?  Where are the proposals in the euro compact for job creation?  Where are the proposals that will ensure investment?  If we do not get people back to work or do not have investment to make this happen, we are on the road towards a 1930s-type crisis.  Even Christine Lagarde of the IMF is saying this.  I cannot understand how the Government is slapping itself on the back for signing up to a treaty that will mean austerity and suffering for the people in perpetuity.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might explain where this is leading.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One can always point to this or that glimmer of light.  We are all looking for such glimmers.  However, the facts speak for themselves.  It is not only the doom and gloom merchants - the Taoiseach describes us as such - who are criticising this approach.  Christine Lagarde, someone very far away from me in terms of her viewpoint on economics and politics, is saying we are heading towards a 1930s style depression unless we solve our problems.  The reason she is saying this is yet again today the IMF has downgraded its growth projections.  The December figures for the retail sector in Ireland indicate that the sector is in real trouble.  We are in decline and must face reality.  There can be no jobs and growth without substantial investment.  Investment has collapsed.Where in the euro compact or among the EU leaders is the plan for us to achieve a recommencement of investment?  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is none.  The euro compact is about balancing the books with an ever diminishing cake.  One can try to balance the books all one likes, but if the cake is diminishing, it means suffering and that there will be no economic growth.  Where are the proposals for serious investment in the digital and other sectors which we know have the potential to develop?  There is no sign of such investment.  The reason for this is the Government's decision that all funds will be placed in the vaults of bondholders and banks.  We are not the only ones who are saying this: Roubini and Stiglitz are saying it.  Anyone looking at the situation objectively is saying this cannot work.  Why, therefore, are we signing up to it?  Why can we not at least have a debate on whether this is the best way to go?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the workers who pay all the bills.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the bondholders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should not take on liabilities, the creation of which the people had nothing to do with.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The latest draft of the euro compact states that the austerity rules must be "of binding force and permanent character" and must be "guaranteed to be respected throughout the national budgetary processes".   Permanent, binding austerity must be enforced by this Government or any future government.  How can the Taoiseach say that that level of infringement on the right of democratically elected parliaments in Europe does not justify the people of this country and the people of Europe having a say on whether they want to give up that level of democratic oversight on their own affairs and their own future?  Legal issues aside, how can anybody say that this level of incursion on democratic rights does not require a democratic referendum, so that the citizens can decide whether they want permanent austerity dictated from Brussels or Frankfurt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was delighted to receive a message on my phone this morning from Ms Louise Bayliss telling me of her reinstatement, just as I was utterly shocked and dismayed to receive a call from her last week saying she had been sacked for doing her job and advocating on behalf of patients.  Her reinstatement is a victory for her courage and commitment to the cause of mental health patients in ensuring they are properly treated.  However, major questions still need to be answered.  Why was she removed from the wards after blowing the whistle on behalf of patients?  We need to find out who made that decision and they need to be held to account.  We need to end the situation where retaliation is possible or punishment is meted out in any State agency or sector of society to people who are doing their job and acting in the interests of society and the persons they are supposed to be looking after.  We must urgently bring forward the promised whistleblower legislation.  We must address the lack of resources in mental health facilities and the health service generally which can lead to the mistreatment of patients and bodies trying to cover up that mistreatment by acting in the way Ms Louise Bayliss was treated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to bandy around terms in a sensitive area like mental health.  It seems to me that moving patients from an open unit where they are happy in a community to a closed secure unit - at Christmas, of all times - essentially because of staffing shortages is not the best treatment possible for patients.  The question of who is responsible for that is a separate one.  Ms Louise Bayliss was right to blow the whistle on it.  Although I do not know the truth of the matter, I am absolutely convinced that Ms Bayliss is telling the truth in every single detail of her account.  Therefore, questions have to be asked about why she was removed from the wards the day after she blew the whistle on what was happening at St. Brendan's Hospital.  I absolutely accept what the Minister of State said about the independence of the advocacy network.  I suggest it needs to have an independent source of funding.  We can argue about the difference between direct pressure and indirect or implicit pressure, but I suggest that if one's funding comes from the HSE, one will feel compromised in one's ability to advocate on behalf of patients if one thinks it might annoy the HSE.  That has to be addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could be shifted to another Department.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would not be the same management.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not be sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no moral, political or democratic justification for denying the citizens of this country or their counterparts across Europe a say in whether we should sign up to an arrangement, whereby permanent austerity will be imposed on them, society and the economy.  The draft of the treaty in circulation makes it clear that such an arrangement is being contemplated.  It refers to fiscal austerity rules being binding in force and permanent in character and stipulates that governments must guarantee to impose these rules on their national budgetary processes.  What is envisaged is written in black and white for all to see.  The democratic right of citizens and their representatives to decide their own economic policies will effectively be abolished with this treaty.  Surely, the very least to which the citizens of the country are entitled is the right to decide whether they want to abolish their right to control matters relating to their economic and social future.Permanent austerity means permanent mass unemployment, emigration and attacks on the most vulnerable in our society, namely, those who are already reeling owing to the impact of three years of austerity measures which have not worked.  When will European leaders and the Government learn that the policy of austerity is not working?  Every indicator shows that the European economy is shrinking and that austerity is the cause.  What is being done appears to be underpinned by a belief that technocrats know better than the people and their elected representatives.  It is absolutely clear that all technocrats know about is balancing books.  That does not get people back to work, nor does it make economies grow.All the money we have collected via the austerity measures is being hoarded in the vaults of the European Central Bank.  We need it in order to create jobs and foster growth.  Why is no one talking about releasing and investing it in our society in order to create jobs, improve services and build infrastructure, thereby encouraging growth in the economy?  The people should at least be given a vote in order that they might choose the path we should take.
