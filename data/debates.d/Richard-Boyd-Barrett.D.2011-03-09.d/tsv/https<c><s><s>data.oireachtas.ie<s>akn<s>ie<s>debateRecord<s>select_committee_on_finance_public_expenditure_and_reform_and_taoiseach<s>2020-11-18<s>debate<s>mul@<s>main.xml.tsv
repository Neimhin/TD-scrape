RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I made the point yesterday that the research and development tax credit involves such a substantial amount of public expenditure that an analysis of the benefit to society is required. Perhaps the Minister can give us the latest figures on what is projected for this year in terms of this tax credit but my understanding is that it is approximately €700 million and that has been rising in recent years. That money is going to private companies and I suspect, largely, to very big and profitable companies. It seems to me that there is a trade off between expenditure going to those companies whose research and development is focused on increasing their profitability or, alternatively, to our public universities to do research and development that is geared towards societal objectives, that is, things that we as a society decide are important. We should remember that our universities are very significantly underfunded. There is not enough money going into research at third level and many of the people working in third level education have very poor wages and conditions of employment. Many are on temporary contracts and so on. A lot of investment is needed in higher education and in research in our universities. The money that is currently going to private companies through the research and development tax credit would be better spent on our universities. At the very least, we should examine that question and look at it closely to see if there would be more benefit in doing that rather than handing out vast sums of money to a relatively small coterie of profit driven corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will briefly give another example of public bodies on which this money would be better spent. In the recent budget I was quite flabbergasted by the Estimate for health expenditure. As we know, the Estimate was significantly increased in the context of Covid-19 and rightly so but in the area of health research in the HSE, there was no increase this year at all. I was absolutely amazed by that because I would have thought that in the context of Covid-19, surely we should be pouring money into public health research, especially given the situation we are facing and our awareness of the importance of research in that area. That is a further example to illustrate my point. Do we want to subsidise, with public money, some IT firm to come up with the 15th upgrade of the iPhone or some such, or would we rather that money went into public health research? I know what I would prefer. More generally, there is an issue with a lack of funding for our universities. The Minister is saying that we are doing that as well but the investment, per student, in third level education in this country is abysmally low.I remember attending an event held by one of the student unions last year. It was about the funding of third level education. It was pointed out that there was more investment in horse racing per horse in this country than in third level education per student. Per capita investment in our students is very low. We note that Irish universities have been falling in the international rankings over recent years. It is very obvious that there are other areas in which this kind of public expenditure would be more beneficial from the point of view of our society than handing it to a relatively small group of multinationals. I have made the point. It is obvious that we disagree with the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 171:In page 66, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“PART 6REPORTS
Report on Knowledge Development Box and other research and development tax reliefs
55. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, produce a report on the Knowledge Development Box and other research and development tax reliefs and provide a cost-benefit analysis of the impact of such reliefs in terms of domestic job creation, stimulation of the domestic economy and the promotion of sustainable indigenous industry as compared to the benefits that might be achieved from equivalent direct public expenditures in knowledge, research and development orientated on measures and objectives to benefit society as a whole.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister tell us the latest available figure for intra-group transactions? I have raised the issue of intra-group transactions as a very significant example of these huge giveaways to multinationals using labyrinthine structures of subsidiaries to avoid tax. Up until recently, the Revenue tables showing the tax reliefs and allowances that are available contained a heading labelled intra-group transactions. The last figure I saw was something like €9 billion and it was rising consistently. It was one of the largest categories of tax relief and had risen very dramatically over recent years. I looked recently at the Revenue table on this and the category of intra-group transactions seemed to have disappeared, which I thought was a bit odd because large companies use multiple subsidiaries to avoid tax. As we need to know the extent of this, could the Minister tell us how much tax relief is being given out under the heading of intra-group transactions according to the latest available figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be helpful if the Minister could come back with the figures. This is an enormous and growing category of allowances - or loopholes, in my language - which big multinationals with multiple subsidiaries are exploiting in order to avoid tax. I understand that he does not have the information now, but I would also appreciate if the Minister could confirm whether there has been a change in the way the Revenue Commissioners list intra-group transactions in their table of allowances, deductions and reliefs for corporate tax. It would be quite worrying if that were the case. Information on the extent to which these companies are using this loophole to effectively lend themselves money and pay themselves interest needs to be publicly available. What is actually profit then becomes a cost, which reduces their taxable profit by huge margins. This effectively means these firms can write their own tax bills. It is a scam that needs to be investigated. At the very least we need complete transparency about the extent of this. It must be very clearly set out in the Revenue Commissioners' tables on deductions, reliefs and allowances.
