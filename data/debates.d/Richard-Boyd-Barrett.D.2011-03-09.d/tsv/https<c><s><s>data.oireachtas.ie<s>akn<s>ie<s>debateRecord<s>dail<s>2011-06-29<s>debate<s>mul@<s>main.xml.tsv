RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach trying to stop them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Martin should not worry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mine is a supplementary question.  Could the Taoiseach explain how we can seriously be expected to believe that the rather vague and ill-defined benefits arising from the visit of President Obama, as outlined by the Taoiseach, outweigh the cost of €20 billion to the Irish people, referred to in this connection, which cost the people are bearing through the closure of hospitals and cuts to special educational needs resources?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Taoiseach to explain how the ill-defined benefits of the visit outweigh the alleged cost of €20 billion to the Irish people on foot of US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's intervention on the question of the bondholders.  In the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Martin, he stated the ECB makes the relevant decisions and that the question regarding the intervention by Mr. Geithner is irrelevant.  However, the Taoiseach knows——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——that if Mr. Timothy Geithner lets his opinion be known on this matter, it carries weight.  Is the House not interested in the answer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is €20 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, no.  The Geithner——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had six yesterday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should have seen some of the articles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach discuss at the health committee as urgently as possible the plans to close accident and emergency services at Loughlinstown and other hospitals and to revisit, reconsider and reverse these decisions and remove the huge anxiety and distress that people are facing as a result?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach consider how the——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——-hospitals that will remain will be overrun——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These hospitals, which are already overrun, will be even more overrun if these accident and emergency units are closed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are queues for both.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Next week, from 6 June until 16 July, the EU-IMF delegation will come to Dublin to implement further austerity, as agreed at the European Council meeting, austerity that the Taoiseach and other European leaders appear to commend as a good thing but which is resulting in tremendous suffering for the people of Greece in so far as it is being implemented there and tremendous suffering for people here.Notwithstanding the insistence that there is a difference between Greece and Ireland, while the EU-IMF are here, protests will commence and continue for those ten days.  There will be protests over the closure of Loughlinstown Hospital accident and emergency services, a closure that is being replicated in hospital accident and emergency services all over the country and which I hope will lead to further protests.  On 12 July students will protest over registration fee increases while on 13 July there will be a large protest outside the Dáil by parents of special needs children who, as a result of the cuts this Government is imposing on those resources for our most vulnerable citizens, do not know if their children will have an education come September.  On 14 July communities all over Dublin will protest the axing of bus services, with hundreds of buses and dozens of routes, mostly serving the elderly, the vulnerable, the immobile and young, being taken out of service.  On 16 July all of those groups, and many others affected by the austerity that the Taoiseach and the other EU leaders wish to impose on the people of the State, will mobilise in a final demonstration demanding jobs and an end to cuts and austerity as dictated by the EU-IMF.These people will protest because they are the victims of the austerity programme European Council leaders have once again signed off and are determined to continue to inflict on the people of this country to pay off the bankers and bond holders who caused the crisis.  Most of those protestors, as is the case in Greece, will feel there is a bizarre disconnect between this Government and the European leaders and the concerns and needs of ordinary people.  The Greek people and the Irish people cannot understand how the Government or the other European leaders believe that savaging the incomes of ordinary people, attacking the most vulnerable and imposing austerity that is increasing unemployment in this country daily, cutting hospital services, bus services and inflicting austerity on the most vulnerable who bear no responsibility for this crisis, will achieve anything.  What planet is the Taoiseach living on if he believes this will help economic recovery?  Austerity in recent years has done the opposite; it has made things worse and will continue to do so.  Is there any understanding that if the Government takes money out of the pockets of ordinary people or if it attacks the education system, it does not aid economic recovery, it sabotages the prospects for it?I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider, to show a bit of spine and stand up to the economic madmen in the ECB, the IMF and the EU who are inflicting extreme suffering on people and shoving down their throats an economic strategy that is failing to a disastrous extent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to get my head around the Taoiseach's logic and that of the European leaders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well, the Taoiseach should answer these questions.  How can he justify and explain the economic logic behind cutting special needs assistants, with the disruptive effect that will have on our education system and our young people, who are our economic future, the closure of accident and emergency wards in hospitals around the country, the savaging of the incomes of low-paid workers, despite the injustice of it and the clearly depressive effect it has on the economy, and the selling of State assets, many of them profitable, as is being demanded by the EU and IMF?  How will that aid economic recovery?  How is it fair?  How will it improve the situation?  The logic behind it is bizarre.Is it not a fact that, in so far as there is now some discussion about shifting the burden on to the bondholders who actually caused this crisis, it is arising from the fact that the Greek people are protesting, rightly and justly, against the same vicious austerity measures that are being imposed on them? Did the Taoiseach discuss with his European counterparts contingency plans for the event of the eurozone breaking up?  Are we in this country preparing contingency plans, such as printing punts, in preparation for the possibility that we might have to pull out of the euro?  Can we have a direct answer to that question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hundreds are being refused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have dozens of refusals in my constituency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The families and parents are telling me about these refusals.  I do not need to be reading reports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are being refused now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The bondholders have plenty of money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, tax the superwealthy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Heather Humphreys said in her maiden speech on the Bill that there was an element of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.  I hope I am not putting words in her mouth, but that is putting it mildly.  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 is an utterly pathetic attempt to make it look as if the Government and the European authorities are doing something to prevent a repeat of the financial madness that went on in the banking system in this country and across Europe that produced the financial crisis, but in actual fact does nothing about it and retains the key features of the banking and financial system.  It protects precisely the features that led to the crash in the first place.  This is smoke and mirrors, spin and a smokescreen to make it look as if one is dealing with the problem when in fact one has no intention of getting to its root.  I am not sure if the Government understands that because this proposed legislation is in fact a measure which the Government has been dictated to introduce by the IMF and the EU.  When one sets aside all the spins, this is what the EU-IMF deal for this country and similar deals imposed elsewhere seeks to do.  What they are really about is protecting the banking system that wrecked our economy and ensuring that nothing is done to infringe upon its right to make profits regardless and to be protected in the present situation against any attempt by anybody to make the bankers take on the burden of their reckless gambling and speculation.  This is in the first line of the third review for fiscal consolidation and financial sector reforms in the memorandum of understanding for this quarter.  On recapitalisation, the authorities will ensure that a process of a banking system recapitalisation is immediately set in motion.  That is the bottom line, recapitalisation at all costs, force us to borrow money at high interest rates to pump into these banks to recapitalise them so that their balance sheets are okay; so that they can return to profitability and carry on doing what they did before, the sort of reckless behaviour that led to the crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will get to that point, Deputy Donohoe.  Of course, if one wants to understand the thinking behind the IMF-EU diktats, what one needs to look at are the ECB's guiding principles for asset support schemes in the section under governance from 2009.  This is what they say and it is worth reading.A guiding principle pertaining to the governance of asset support schemes, which refrain from outright nationalisation and which should be borne in mind even if nationalisation become necessary, is that after receiving public support the institutions should continue to be run on the basis of business criteria; to the extent it is possible the preservation of private ownership is preferable for several reasons.  These include in the short term the high costs involved in nationalisation — could the cost possibly be any higher than the cost incurred by ordinary people in this country? — and in the medium term the risk of banks' objectives being diverted from profit maximisation to alternative goals that might distort the market structure and jeopardise the level playing field.   These are the guidelines that inform the IMF-EU deal and their diktats have been carried through in this Bill to deal with the banking system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about regulation of the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will get to that; the Deputy has already had his chance.  The Bill is about making sure the banking system remains in private ownership and is protected from any serious public control, with profit maximisation as a central goal.If we are to deal with the causes of the banking crisis, should we not ask what caused it?  Was it not caused by the pursuit of profit maximisation at all costs, with no consideration of other factors?  That was precisely the problem and it is not just me who says that; Peter Nyberg said that the crisis was reinforced in a widespread international belief in the efficiency of financial markets, talking about group think and the herd mentality in believing that nonsense.  Nyberg recognises the pursuit of profit over every other consideration by the financial crisis is the reason we have this crisis but the ECB, in its guidelines for dealing with the banks, says we must not divert from the goal of profit maximisation.  We have learned nothing; the report tells us what the problem is, then the ECB tells us we must do nothing about it.  Any measures we take must do nothing about it and the public must bear the cost.  That is the reality of the Bill.  All it says is that if there is another crisis, we will have some sort of fund the banks will put some money into so perhaps the cost to the public will be minimised, never questioning the driving force behind the crisis, the pursuit of profit at all costs.It is not necessary to be a socialist or revolutionary——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to understand the need for a different type of banking system.  Deputy Higgins earlier said the way to deal with this is to bring the banking system, which is simply the system to control surplus wealth, the savings produced by ordinary working people, under democratic control.  Banks simply operate the investment funds and those who own the funds should decide what they are invested in and how our society is developed.  Is it not obvious that to avoid the sort of financial crisis we have just witnessed those surplus funds should be under public and democratic ownership so we as a society can democratically decide our priorities for investing and lending?  Would that not be fair?Even in the United States, where they are not socialists and where they are not advocating the views of Deputy Higgins or me, the Federal Reserve has three goals: to prevent inflation, to protect home owners and ensure employment.  The European Central Bank has only one concern — inflation, or in other words the protection of price stability and the interests of business.  The demands of the EU-IMF and the deal to recapitalise the banks means ten of thousands of people might lose their homes.  The banks will not lend into the economy to restart growth and get people back to work because recapitalisation of the banks is the major priority of the ECB, the EU and the IMF and that is because profit maximisation is the bottom line; the balance sheet is all that counts.To prevent a recurrence of the economic crisis we do not need pathetic, meaningless measures about what will happen after the next crisis, we should put in place measures to ensure there will not be another crisis by reining in the vampires and sharks of the international financial system and putting them and our banks under democratic control so we dictate their lending and investment policies, policies that are concerned with job creation, strategic industry and keeping people in their homes.  If we did that we might prevent another crisis.  This Bill will do nothing to prevent such a crisis.
