RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The message contained in the results of the elections which took place on Friday demanding radical emergency measures to address the climate crisis was dramatic and unmistakable. The central demand of the global climate movement is to keep fossil fuels in the ground. All the science says that 80% of known reserves of fossil fuels must stay in the ground if we are to address the crisis. At the weekend, the Taoiseach promised that the Government would heed the message. In that context, I ask very simply whether the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment will now refuse the application under consideration in his Department from the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation and Exxon Mobil to drill for oil off the Kerry coast? If the Government is serious about climate change and dealing with the climate crisis as promised, will that application now be refused? To permit new drilling for oil off the Kerry coast is completely incompatible with any serious intent to deal with the climate crisis.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who does "our" refer to? It is a global problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what the science says.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And to keep drilling for oil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is giving it away to the big multinational corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a growing crisis in childcare in this country. The crisis is threefold: the extortionate costs of childcare, often reaching over €1,000 a month; the staffing and pay for workers in childcare, which is low and precarious or seasonal; and increasingly, the major problem in accessing childcare places. What is the Government intending to do to address this crisis, particularly the lack of spaces?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sceptical that the efforts the Minister has outlined will deliver the affordable childcare that we need. There is already evidence that the childcare scheme may merely push up the prices charged by the private providers and wipe out the value of the subsidy. That highlights the overall problem. A little like the housing crisis, the Government's plans for childcare depend on the private sector. I am not sure the private sector will deliver. It may merely increase prices but also not deliver the places.To my mind, unless the State directly provides affordable childcare places, which will also deal with the issue of precarious work and pay, we will not get the sort of affordable childcare that we desperately need. In my area, there is a large new housing development called Cualanor and Honeypark. A crèche was supposed to be provided as part of planning. It was never provided because when we are depending on a private developer to do it, it just does not happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the problem that because we are relying on the private sector, this will inevitably happen? The evidence is there and the Minister acknowledged it. As to the provision of places, the issue was highlighted to me in my area where there was a crèche in the Holy Child school in Sallynoggin. For reasons I do not understand, the school closed the crèche in the middle of the year, leaving a number of mothers, children and families high and dry with nowhere to go. They were told to find somewhere else, which they simply could not do. People in Sallynoggin were told to go to Rathfarnham, which was totally unsustainable for people working in education and so on. There are simply not the places. The local childcare committee in the council acknowledge the problem but does not have the resources because we are not directly providing the affordable childcare places. That is the only way we are going to get the affordable childcare on the scale we need to address this need.
