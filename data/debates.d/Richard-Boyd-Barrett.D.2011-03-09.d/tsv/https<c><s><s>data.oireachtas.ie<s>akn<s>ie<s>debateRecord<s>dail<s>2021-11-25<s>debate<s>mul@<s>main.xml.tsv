RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is nominally committed to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. In that regard I raise the plight of Accessible Community Transport Southside, which is a door-to-door transport service in the south Dublin area catering for 1,620 registered travel members, most of whom are wheelchair users or have severe mobility issues. That organisation is threatened with closure. It will run out of funding in two months' time. It did not get funding under the latest raft of stability Covid payments because less income is coming in. Shockingly, the members need to pay; they do not even get the use of the service for free. It is now threatened with closure and in two months' time, its funding will run out, leaving 1,600 wheelchair users and others with mobility issues without this vital service. I ask for the Government to look at this urgently and provide the funding it needs to retain the service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Great. Happy days for a Thursday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will open with an appeal to the Minister, and I hope his answer will be "Yes". We had a deadline of 11 a.m. today to submit amendments, before the Bill had even passed Second Stage. We were able to table quite a few amendments, but this is not fair. I have raised this at the Business Committee. We need more time to put forward amendments following a debate. Having listened to the debate so far, at least two further amendments have occurred to us. We should have the right to submit them. It is not acceptable. There should be proper scrutiny of the Bill on Committee Stage. We need to strike down the SHD legislation which has failed. While we have to meet the deadline of 17 December, that does not require riding roughshod over proper Committee Stage consideration of the Bill. It certainly does not mean that we should be tied to a deadline for Committee Stage amendments before we have even completed the Second Stage debate and heard the Minister's response. I ask that there be some latitude to submit amendments following today's debate. I hope I will get a positive response. The strategic housing development planning process was a failure, and that is why we are all agreed that it has to go. That is what this Bill is about. Why was it a failure? It was a failure because it did not deliver the housing that we need to address the housing crisis. It most certainly did not deliver affordability in the small amount of housing it did deliver.It completely alienated local communities, tied housing development up in a series of legal challenges, rode roughshod over local democracy and proper and sustainable planning and it facilitated speculation and hoarding by profit-driven developers. The figures for SHD approvals speak for themselves. Of the 210 SHDs granted, only 72 were developed. Some 24,000 homes were approved and only 8,700 homes were commenced. It is clear that in many cases this is a direct result of speculation. Deansgrange, which the Minister's colleague, Deputy Devlin, should concern himself with, as should all Deputies in our area, is an example of what needs to be addressed. It is an SHD that was granted a few years ago. The developer got SHD approval for a nine-storey development overlooking Deansgrange cemetery and across the road from small, one-bedroom cottages. The developer sat on it for two years and recently flipped it. Nothing was built, of course. That is what was going on and what it facilitated. How did all that happen? How did we get it so wrong? We got it wrong because there were, frankly, ideological assumptions. We are often accused of ideology on this side of the House but, of course, ideology permeates every party. One of the ideological assumptions that is completely misguided, but which we hear trotted out repeatedly, is that the reason we do not have this, that or the other housing development is those nasty objectors, and that if there was just a process that allowed the developer to get around these nasty objectors, we would have all the housing we need and resolve the problem. This is an idea that very much chimes with private developers, who were facilitated by the SHD, got a special process of their own, got lots of grants and delivered hardly any housing, none of which was affordable. Let us start by recognising that we were had on that argument. As to learning the lesson from that, and I am not sure what the Minister is signalling-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, and I will get on to the Bill, but we have to learn the lessons from what we did wrong in order to get this Bill right. That is my point, because the Government is still trotting out that the problem, and the reason we do not have the housing we need to address the housing crisis and affordability, is all these terrible objectors. I am still hearing that, and it is just not true. The facts bear it out in respect of the SHDs because the developers got their own special process and the nasty objectors were pushed aside. They got the grants and the process did not deliver. It facilitated speculation. The lesson to be learned is that private developers will say absolutely anything to get a planning permission to increase the value of the site and to facilitate their profit taking, which very often involves hoarding, speculation and flipping properties. Let us learn the lesson about listening to the lobbying of these private, profit-driven property developers. Second, it was premised on another ideological assumption - it is textbook neoliberal economics, but a load of nonsense - that if we increase supply, the price will drop. That is just not true. It does not matter how many economic textbooks say it because one need only look at the experience of this country. We had record levels of supply; at the height of the Celtic tiger economy there was three times what we have now. Did prices, rents or anything else drop? No, they continued to rise all the time. That is what happened. If we do not learn that lesson, we will not bring forward the legislation necessary to deal with the problems we face. It is not just me, Karl Marx or whoever saying it. The head of Tuath Housing Association said recently at a conference that we need to get rid of the "red herring" that if one increases supply, the price comes down. He is absolutely right. It does not. The problem is that these private developers have no interest in the prices going down. If they are the dominant force in setting the legislative agenda and the policy and in controlling a large part or most of the output in the housing sector, they will never, ever increase supply to the point at which their profits go down. That is what happens when property prices and rents go down. Why on earth would they do it? They will not. Can we please learn that lesson? Then we might have the wisdom to develop the necessary legislation to facilitate proper, sustainable development and the level of output to deliver the affordable housing we need to address the housing crisis. The Minister says we should move on to the legislation and what is in it, which is the end of the SHDs. No, it is not. Consider section 17. First, we had to push it out after the announcement in July that it was going to be the end of October. Then we had to push it out a little further. Now we have created another out for the developers if they can get in the pre-planning application meetings and requests. Then we can push it out further into next year. Why are we doing that for a process that has patently failed? We should not allow any more of this process to continue. It has done zilch - zero. In fact, it has exacerbated the housing crisis and is often linked to the speculation and so forth I spoke about, the profit taking or, indeed, deals with local authorities over extortionate costs for leasing back properties and the builds-to-rent that cost an absolute fortune, inflating the housing assistance payment, HAP, bill and the rents ordinary people have to pay. We need to cut it dead and there should be no get-out clause. We have tabled amendments to that effect. What else do we need? I agree that at the pre-application stage we should deal with all the potentially relevant issues. That is fine if it helps to move things along, but there must be consultation at that level with the stakeholders, the local communities and so forth. The beginning of wisdom is to listen to ordinary people. They are not the enemy in delivering housing. What they want is sustainable development of their areas and they want housing that their children and community can afford. They do not want development that is going to be extortionate in cost and that will only facilitate money making. People are also very aware that just letting things be developer-led in the first place can lead to the type of catastrophic consequences we saw with the economic crash in 2008 and 2009, so let us understand the wisdom of local communities. When talking about student accommodation we should have a condition for even consideration of this new special process. The point I want to make is that we are replacing the special process developers got with SHDs with a new special process. It is a better special process. It has to take cognisance of the local county development plans, which the other process did not, and so forth, but it is still a special process for them. I am not really sure why a special process is justified at all. Surely one of the things we have learned from all this is that the question of them getting planning applications was not the block. Much as they claimed it and much as the awful objectors were blamed, have we not now learned that it was not blockages in the planning process that were the problem in delivering the amount of housing we needed and the affordability that ordinary people need to afford that housing? It begs the question: why do we need a special process for them at all? The real problem is that they are only going to build when it is profitable for them and we have to short-circuit that. That would be primarily done by the State delivering a large enough amount of public and affordable housing on scale so that they do not control the sector, control the rents and control the prices.In fact, they are put under pressure by the scale of public and affordable development to actually drop their prices because that will force them to drop their prices. I heard today from officials in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that it could be the end of next year before the development in Shanganagh, which was supposed to have been on site by the end of this year, gets going with the Land Development Agency, LDA, which is extremely disappointing news.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. I knew the LDA would not deliver and now it is not delivering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said they would be on site by the end of this year. They will not be on site.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will tell the Minister what my answer is. The private developers that successive Governments have insisted must in some way be involved in this process could not bear it if there was a large amount of housing in my area built at affordable prices of, for example, €200,000 because it would be very hard for them to sell stuff up the road for €400,000 if that were happening on scale. It is obvious that is the case. The way to drive down property prices and the cost of rent is by the State doing it regardless of the consequences for those private developers. It needs to be done on scale and quickly, but it needs to be done in consultation with local communities and within the principles of proper sustainable planning and development. If we are talking about any permissions under this new regime for student accommodation which we desperately need, it should be in consultation with the local college communities. The first people we need to talk to are the student union representatives, the college authorities and, most particularly, the students to find out what sort of student accommodation they need and whether such a planning proposal offers them the sort of affordable accommodation they need. If there is any case at all for a special planning dispensation for private developers, it should be linked to affordability. What is the point of giving them a special process of their own if the result is not accommodation well below the completely unaffordable market prices? I do not see the case for it. Why would we give them a special process if we end up with rents of €2,500 or €3,000 a month, or property prices of €400,000 or €500,000? What is the point in facilitating that? There is absolutely no point. It is actually counterproductive.  While I accept this is some improvement on the SHD process, any special process they are given, even if it is an improved process, should be conditional on the affordability of what is delivered. The whole point in addressing the current housing crisis is delivering for people where the market has failed. We need to intervene with legislation and other measures in order to deliver for the people who have been failed consistently. This legislation should be conditional on all those things.  The Minister referred to landlords being able to rent out student accommodation outside academic term times. At an absolute minimum that should be amended to the academic year. A landlord should not be allowed to tell a student to get out on 17 December because they want to rent it out for Christmas for short-term lets during holidays or something. We need strict provisions so that landlords cannot exploit change-of-use provisions to turn what was supposed to be a strategic housing development to meet a real need into use for something completely different. The requirement for a minimum of 70% of housing is good, but it is followed by "or other such percentage as may be prescribed". Does that mean it could be less than 70%? No way should that be allowed. I do not see the case for that discretion and it should be deleted. Similarly, on the different uses for the 30%, there needs to be close consultation with the local communities to ascertain what they want. I heard the Minister speak earlier. I take his point that we need the services, retail outlets, coffee shops or whatever it might be. However, what is needed should not be entirely or even mostly dictated by what private developers think they can make money from with the development, but what members of the local community think they need when a new housing development is going ahead in their area. Doing that would allow for much more buy-in from the local community for significant new developments in an area. It is critical that developers are required to provide-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----statements showing that they will comply with specific local objectives, SLOs, in development plans. Is the Minister saying that is in the Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is if we have a Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It must be a meaningful Committee Stage. The point made by Deputy Nash about dereliction is absolutely right in the current circumstances. We should use the opportunity to do something about dereliction. I was shocked by the findings of a new report about the level of dereliction in Dún Laoghaire. The amount of dereliction on the main street in Dún Laoghaire drives people insane. We were put out of the office I had on the main street in Dún Laoghaire on the basis that it was being sold to somebody else. It was very difficult to find the new owner. We went to the new owner and asked if we could rent it out but were refused for whatever reason. That was two years ago and it is still lying empty with not a sign of movement. That is typical of what is going on. The upper storeys of that building are perfectly suitable for residential accommodation if the money were put into it. Radical measures need to be taken to ensure that is simply not allowed. Refurbishing the derelict property that is already there has far less impact on the environment, CO2 emissions and so on. However, people are sitting on it for speculative and other reasons. There are no excuses in the case of the office we tried to rent back. It has a new owner and yet it is lying empty, as are apparently 350 properties on the main street in Dún Laoghaire, a figure I could not believe. Measures to address that problem should be included in this legislation because it is an absolute emergency.  We will support the legislation, but we will be tabling amendments and I hope the Minister will take them seriously. I hope he will give us time to put in more amendments and have proper scrutiny of this vital legislation on Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said I would support that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." This Bill is about trying to learn one of the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic and protecting a particularly vulnerable group of workers whose plight was highlighted in the midst of the pandemic. It was revealed as one of the central stories and scandals of the pandemic. That was the plight of migrant workers working in meat processing, horticulture, dairy and other similar areas within which thousands of people work and about 70% of whom are migrant workers. Reports into the plight of these workers in this country have shown a very poor record of their treatment in those industries even before Covid-19. Between 2015 and 2020, for example, nearly half of all inspections in meat plants detected breaches of labour law relating to pay, working time, inadequate record keeping and employment permit issues. This is an area where a vulnerable group of workers are largely unseen by the Irish population and are largely not discussed in public discourse. Maybe it says something about their plight that there are few Members here tonight to discuss this. Their role in Irish society was revealed in a stark way during the height of the pandemic when, despite initial Government denials, we had to highlight the fact that there were rampant outbreaks of Covid in the meat processing plants. The Government denied the problem initially but eventually was forced to acknowledge that there was a serious problem. There were hundreds of outbreaks. About 3,000 to 4,000 workers were infected with Covid-19. The high levels of infection in the Border counties and counties where these processing plants were situated told its own story about the conditions in those meat plants. One of the key issues highlighted was when these very vulnerable workers, in a sector where permits are often not properly arranged by employers and where there has been poor treatment of migrant workers historically, got sick or got symptoms they had a fear of not going to work and that it could put them in a vulnerable position with their employer. We have introduced this Bill against that background. The most important provision of this Bill is, crucially, to ensure an employer pays for a sick pay scheme for workers on general employment permits working in these sectors so that if they become ill, they will receive 70% of the pay they would have got for four weeks, if it is personal illness or injury, or six months if it is work related. That is the central provision of this Bill. It is important to state why that is important. It is obviously important for the health of the workers that they are not forced to go to work while sick out of fear of financial loss or retribution by an employer who might be unhappy if they choose to stay off sick. It is, therefore, important for that reason. However, as we learned during the pandemic, it was critically important to address the plight of these workers to reduce the level of transmission of Covid-19. In other words, if they were treated badly, there was a serious impact on the public health situation in the towns, villages and areas around where those plants were based. Of additional importance was the potential impacts on the food supply chain of this country. If 70% of the people who help process meat and pick fruit and vegetables to stock the shelves in the shops of this country to feed people were vulnerable and could be sick, this could have potentially endangered the food supply chain for the whole country. Addressing this is also good for workers generally. There is not a proper statutory sick pay scheme for all workers in this country. Many workers in the private sector do not have that and we need that as well.If there is a cohort of migrant workers who are badly treated and vulnerable and who do not have rights, that undermines conditions for workers in this country generally and makes it more difficult for them to fight for their rights to the sort of statutory entitlement to sick pay they should have if they become ill. The central provision is to ensure that employers will not get permits for migrant workers unless they provide a sick pay scheme that will ensure that workers who get ill get sick pay for four weeks in the case of personal injury or illness or six months in the case of work-related illness. The Bill also includes a number of other measures to give workers who are treated badly by their employers access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, adjudication process, even where there may be problems with their work permits if they can show they have made reasonable efforts to secure such a permit and where the responsibility for them not having one really lies with employers who did not take those matters seriously or who may even have thought it convenient to have workers in that vulnerable position. Section 1 seeks to ensure that workers have that sort of recourse to the WRC, even if they do not have a valid work permit. It also allows workers on a general employment permit to seek an alternative employer. They should not just be tied to one employer if it is the case that their health, their dignity at work or their well-being is threatened by their treatment at the hands of that employer.  Another section of the Bill ensures that migrant workers can receive any amount awarded to them under the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014 as a result of redundancy in the case of an employer becoming insolvent. This is about giving rights to these vulnerable workers. We have seen just how vulnerable they are and just how bad it is for all of us if they are treated badly and do not have those kinds of protections. The Government may point to the Bill, the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, has talked about bringing in that will provide a sick pay scheme. He has talked about it being a benefit for Covid workers. In our opinion, that is not adequate in that, first of all, workers will have to have been paying PRSI contributions for six months to avail of the proposed scheme so workers who have only been here a few weeks, like many of those at the centre of what we saw during the Covid pandemic, would not be entitled to sick pay in a situation such as that we have just been through with the pandemic. The scheme also only proposes to give an entitlement to sick pay of between four and ten days. The number of days is to increase over a number of years but will remain paltry compared to what is necessary. While the scheme proposes to provide 70% of a person's pay for those short and totally inadequate periods, it is to be capped at €110 a day, which is simply not enough.  The Government should support this Bill. We owe an ongoing debt to these vulnerable workers for the role they play in producing the food the people of this country need. There is a history of them being mistreated. We have seen starkly that, if they do not have a right to sick pay and protections as employees, it can be very bad not just for them, but for our entire society. The matter is cut and dried. The Government should not oppose this Bill and should let it pass to the next Stage so that we can give those sorts of protections to this vulnerable group of workers. This should be part of the much more wide-ranging payback that it is needed for working people in this country because we have seen the role workers, who although often poorly treated, are absolutely essential, played in keeping our entire society running during the Covid pandemic. Workers who are vulnerable often suffer from poor working conditions and very low pay. There was a lot of clapping for them and a lot of rhetoric about the role they played but we need to see really tangible measures to improve basic pay and conditions of employment for the workers in this country who kept us all going and sustained us through this very difficult and dark period. I will leave it at that. I hope the Government will respond positively to the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I should have said in my initial comments that on the occasion of a Bill like this coming through it is worth considering the horrific events that took place in the English Channel this week with desperate migrants losing their lives in a boat that capsized. The seas around Europe have become a graveyard for thousands and thousands of desperate people - men, women and children - who are fleeing war, persecution and desperate conditions and losing their lives in the most horrible fashion. We saw a very stark example of it this week. It is always worth contemplating how we were in that situation once upon a time. Indeed we suffered the same demonisation and mistreatment that those desperate people suffered. People from this country lost their lives trying to cross oceans to flee hunger, poverty and mistreatment. They often suffered terrible treatment in the countries they went to, at least initially, until we organised and fought for our rights and improved our situation. It is worth saying that. It is worth reminding ourselves that we suffered the same racist stereotypes as well. I am often fond of quoting Karl Marx. One of the things he was particularly interested in was the plight of the Irish worker and the demonisation of the Irish worker in Britain in the middle of the 19th century. The popular magazines in Britain used to demonise the Irish workers and present them as less than human, as monkeys, a stereotype that was later applied to people of different colour. That early stereotype was applied to the Irish. One of the things Marx said was that the mistreatment of the Irish worker, the racism and exploitation directed at the Irish worker, was the secret weakness of the British working-class movement. That is a very telling phrase. In other words, the degree to which the working-class movement in Britain allowed anti-Irish racism to persist weakened their movement. Not only did it mean the mistreatment of the Irish worker but it weakened the struggle of the entire British working class. If one group of workers, in that case the Irish workers, were treated badly, paid badly and exploited, that was used as a stick to beat all the other workers.That remains the case. Workers in this country need to understand they have a stake in ensuring that migrant workers here are not exploited and treated badly and that they have rights and entitlements. If workers do not ensure this, particularly because migrants are critical for food supply, the migrants’ poor conditions and mistreatment will be a stick with which to beat other workers and keep their conditions poor. The connection can be seen in the sense that if we allow the mistreatment of migrants to persist in circumstances of widespread illness in an industry where they have very few rights and where documented inspections, even before Covid, have shown breaches of labour and employment law and permit issues more than 50% of the time, it will be bad for all workers. It is worth commenting on what occurs along the food supply chain. Some of the people who contacted me to alert me about the mistreatment of the workers in the meat plants during the Covid pandemic were beef farmers who had been part of the Beef Plan movement. That was very interesting and good because they themselves were fighting against the miserable incomes they, as direct producers of beef, earn. Their average income is between €10,000 and €12,000. When the Beef Plan brought the matter to my attention, I could not believe how poor the incomes were of the people who produce one of the main exports of the country, an export that generates enormous profits for the big agri-processors, the Larry Goodmans of this world. Staggering profits are made by such people but the direct producers, the farmers, get a pittance. The people processing the meat in the meat factories work in terrible conditions, sleep in dormitories with rampant Covid and have very few rights. On the next step along the chain, there are the low-paid retail workers in Tesco, the shops, the supermarkets and so on, which workers are among the most poorly paid and often have very precarious conditions. Is it not telling?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry. I did not say that. Supermarkets. I did not mention their name. Sorry, it was a slip of the tongue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The workers are on very low pay. Considering that the food we eat is one of the most basic things we need to sustain our society, it says something that pretty much everyone along the food chain, whether they are Irish, small farmers, migrant workers or the people who work in the shops, is pretty poorly paid. This Bill is part of trying to address that. If we are serious about some of the lessons we have learned, bearing in mind that everybody, including the Government, referred during Covid to the role of essential workers and their importance to society, what we are going to do will have to be tangible and meaningful. The Minister of State will not be surprised to hear I am not happy with his response to our Bill. Is four weeks for personal illness or injury, or six months at 70% of what we are proposing, excessively generous? Does it represent an excessive burden on the employers? It is not, given the profits being generated by them. The profits are enormous, so I do not accept that the big beef barons, whom we have discovered sometimes hide their profits offshore in Luxembourg and elsewhere, could not afford to pay decent sick benefits to the workers who help to generate them. In Germany, a worker receives 100% of his or her wage for the first six weeks. The Irish Government is proposing 70% of the salary, starting with three days and working up to ten at the height. We are so far behind the rest of Europe in these matters. The burden is not excessive in the other countries, including Germany, so why should it be regarded as excessive by employers here? I do not accept the Minister of State’s excuse, therefore. Consider the question of whether a worker, who does not have have a valid work permit, should not be entitled to benefit from the social insurance fund or to have recourse to the WRC. We have cases on this. There are workers who had permits but who were mistreated when they stood up for themselves when they got into a dispute with their employer. The WRC found that they were mistreated and that had they had the entitlement, they would have received awards in compensation. They did not get them, however, because their permits had expired. Their employer wanted to make sure they did not get their additional permits because they were regarded as troublesome workers. That cannot be allowed. The workers had made reasonable efforts and previously had permits. They wanted to have permits but did not have them because they were in a dispute with their employer. In their case, the WRC found in their favour. Therefore, the Minister of State’s answer does not address the point. The implication of what the Minister of State said is that if workers did not have permits, they could not have been paying PRSI and therefore would not have been entitled to benefit from the fund. Why would he assume that? Almost certainly they are paying PRSI, but they do not have the permits. They have made the effort to get them. They are paying PRSI in most cases or were paying it until their permits expired or their employer did not want their permits to be maintained. The central demand of Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and others has been that employees should have the right to move from their employer and to have this spelt out explicitly. The Minister of State says the right is provided for but, in reality, it is extremely difficult for migrant workers attached to an employer to move from them. It needs to be stated explicitly in law that they have the right to do so. I appeal to the Government to reconsider its opposition to this Bill and let it progress. If it wants to make tweaks, let it make them on Committee Stage, but it should not block the Bill, which is intended to enhance the rights of migrant workers and all other workers.
