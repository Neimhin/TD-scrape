She often accuses me and those of us on this side of the House of being negative so I want to take the opportunity to say something positive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is important during this European week that we review the experience of the last year. While Members have referred to certain negative things, I want to discuss some of the positive developments here and in Europe as a whole. One of the very positive things that happened in the last week was that 4,000 people went into the Wicklow hills to join in a demonstration featuring music, poetry and readings from plays to indicate that they wanted to retain ownership of their public forests despite the attempt of the troika and the Government to take that away.Amazingly, and tremendously positively, within two days of the demonstration a Government Minister said the sale of the forest was unlikely. That is a good news story. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public sector workers in this country, who have been battered with pay cuts over the past five years, finally said "No" in the past few weeks. They defied threats and bullying, stood together, showed solidarity and said "No". Positively, the Government threats to legislate immediately and impose 7% pay cuts did not happen. It shows positively that when workers stand together they can achieve results. Another good news story is Cyprus, where the troika, with the collusion of the Cypriot Government, attempted to raid savings under â‚¬100,000 of ordinary people. The people of Cyprus took to the streets, surrounded their Parliament, stuck together, showed solidarity and manifested people power. Lo and behold, they forced the troika to reverse its plans and to do something that, until that point, had been considered completely unthinkable, namely, to burn the bondholders. It was an extraordinary victory for people power. What is even more amazing is that it produced a fundamental shift in European policy, away from the one that said we cannot burn bondholders to one that says we can. The new banking resolution regime proposed by the European Union now says we should distinguish between ordinary savers and professional speculators and investors. It is a major victory for people power on a European scale. Another fantastic thing is the co-ordinated series of general strikes that happened across southern European countries in November last year. It was a true demonstration of international solidarity and people power when workers in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal went on strike on the same day to say they had enough of austerity. Positively, this produced a shift in rhetoric, if not in policy, from the European leaders. They are now saying we have reached the limits of austerity and we must rethink. The interesting thing about these positive good news stories is that they come from below, from people themselves taking action. This is something governments and politicians often do not like because it takes the focus away from their importance and begins to point to the fact that real change comes from ordinary people organising themselves, taking to the streets and showing solidarity. This can force policy changes from the mighty troika and from governments trying to ram solidarity down their throats.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a positive note, we need more of that sort of people power. We need people to take to the streets and say that austerity is not working, that we want a fairer policy where the bondholders and speculators pay the price for their crimes so that the rest of society can flourish and develop and that we can focus on creating jobs. For the past five years, Europe's policy has been to say we must have specific targets on deficit and debt reduction. That has not worked very well. As a positive alternative, I suggest specific targets for the reduction of unemployment. For example, if it is 14% this year, the Government should have a target of 10% next year, 5% the year after that and 0% unemployment the following year. Starting policy consideration from that perspective would lead to us being in a far better place.
