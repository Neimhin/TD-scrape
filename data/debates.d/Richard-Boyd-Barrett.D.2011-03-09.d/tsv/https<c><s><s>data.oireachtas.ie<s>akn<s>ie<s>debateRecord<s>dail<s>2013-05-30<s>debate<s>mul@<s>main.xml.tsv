RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Bill contains several positive measures. I welcome the overdue recognition of the important role played by retained firefighters and their exclusion from certain conditions of the jobseeker's allowance. I also welcome the rationalisation of the regulation of pensions. The establishment of the new pensions council appears a particularly positive development, although we will have to see how it works out. The council will have greater involvement from consumers, and people who were previously paid will be replaced by volunteers. I have no major objection to identity cards. I am neutral on them, although I will not say I welcome them. It is positive that the Minister acknowledged the need to undo the damage wrought by cuts to lone parent payments. She is now attempting to address this issue with the jobseeker's transitional payment and the changes to family income supplement. Problems remain with the system but the Government has at least recognised the hardship created for lone parents by previous budgets. Credit where credit is due; the Minister listened to the concerns expressed on this side of the House and, more important, by groups like SPARK and One Family, which have appointed people representing lone parents to speak on these issues. Before I deal with the details of the Bill, I want to discuss three issues in regard to what is in the Bill, what is not in it and what might be in it.I will first respond briefly to some of the general comments the Minister made. I welcome her statement that we need to look beyond austerity. Her words echo statements made in recent weeks by senior figures in the European Union and reflect a long overdue acknowledgement that the disastrous policy pursued for the past five years by this Government, the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and governments across Europe has failed. It is now recognised that we cannot resolve the current crisis through a policy of crippling austerity that is aimed primarily at forcing the cost of the bank bailout onto ordinary citizens and must instead move in a different direction. The trick, however, in moving beyond austerity, is to make the shift from words to deeds. As the Minister pointed out when she discussed her brief, there is something of a contradiction between saying we need to move beyond austerity and continuing to adhere to the debt and deficit targets the troika has imposed on us and which require her to impose further cuts in the forthcoming budget. I note the European Commission stated this morning that the Government must not waver from its commitment to remove a further €5 billion from the economy in the next two years. To date, the Government has made clear it will not waver from this commitment. I shudder to think what this means. Whether one believes, as the Minister does, that the adjustments and cuts that have been imposed over the past five years are necessary or whether one believes, as I do, that they are unnecessary and wrong, we all accept they have been cruel and have caused hurt and suffering. People are close to the end of their tether in terms of the cuts in income they can endure. I suspect that people across society, especially the vulnerable who depend on social welfare payments, shudder to think where the Government will find further savings in the forthcoming budget beyond what is in the Bill. I do not know how the Government will find the savings without causing suffering to people who have suffered enough. It is contradictory to state that austerity has ended and we need to move beyond it while at the same time recommitting oneself to imposing cuts of billions of euro in the forthcoming budget. I note the Minister's statement that the Government's key commitment is to jobs. We all agree that growth and jobs offer the way out of the contradiction between the desire to move beyond austerity and demands to meet debt and deficit targets. It is, however, difficult to reconcile these two imperatives. I do not see how one can take a further €5 billion out of the economy without causing further job losses. I hope the Government is not impressed by figures showing that unemployment has declined from 14.6% to 13.7% since the Government came to office. Many of the jobs lost during the period in question were full-time, permanent positions, including in the public sector, which have been replaced by part-time jobs. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate can almost certainly be explained by the high level of emigration during the period in question. The reality, therefore, is that little of substance is taking place in the area of job creation. In setting out her commitment to job creation, the Minister cited a figure of €1 billion to be spent on education and training. This funding is welcome and desperately needed as we try to reposition and reorient the economy and encourage the unemployed to prepare for the new work opportunities we hope will materialise, even if there are few signs that this is happening. I note in passing that there is also a contradiction between making a commitment to re-education and training in one area, and I accept the Department of Social Protection is spending money in this area, when cuts being imposed by the Department of Education and Skills in the further education sector will significantly and adversely impact on the training and education available to the very groups on which we know we must focus if we are to help them out of unemployment. Further education, as we know, is the sector that caters most for people in disadvantaged areas who are unable to access or do as well in the mainstream education system. It has done well in filling a gap through the provision of education and training to sections of the population which have not prospered in the mainstream education system. However, the sector is under attack and its educational offering will be significantly reduced as a result of the decision to increase the pupil-staff ratio in further education colleges. It is campaigning hard against retrograde cuts which will undermine the critical imperative to provide education and training to people who need it if they are to get out of the unemployment disaster that has struck us. It is unfortunate that the Minister continues to repeat the claim that the Government has not touched core social welfare rates. Let us at least be honest about what has taken place. Everybody who receives a social welfare payment has taken a significant hit in recent years arising from the budget cuts the Government has imposed. Playing around with semantics about core social welfare rates is disingenuous. Cuts to the rent and fuel allowances, lone parent payment, child benefit, school clothing and respite care grants and many other payments have caused suffering and constitute real cuts in the income on which some of the vulnerable sections of society must live. The Department acknowledges this in its assessment of the main welfare and taxation measures in the 2013 budget. According to the document, which is published on the Department's website: "Households worst affected by the measures are those with children, in particular lone parent families." The Department acknowledges that the most vulnerable sections of society have been adversely affected by the social welfare cuts it has imposed. I propose to raise an issue that should be addressed in the Bill. The Minister may not be aware of it as I have not raised it previously. A couple in my constituency contacted me recently to discuss a decision to reduce significantly their jobseeker's payments.This decision was taken after the Department of Social Protection inquired as to how this man and his wife are paying their mortgage, which is currently in distress. The man had been working but, like many others, he lost his job and could not afford to pay his mortgage. When asked how he was meeting his mortgage repayments, he openly and honestly replied that his children had loaned him some money in order that he might try to do so. He also informed the Department that he is attempting to obtain employment on a daily basis and that in the meantime - and because he does not want to fall behind with his repayments - his children, who are working, have agreed to lend him some money in order to pay off the mortgage. When this emerged, the Department cut his and his wife's payments by €65 per week. This was in direct proportion to the amount of assistance they received from their children, which is disgraceful. If one cannot pay one's mortgage and one approaches the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for and receives financial assistance, this is not taken into account by the Department. However, because one's children help one out of a hole, one is penalised. This is not extra income one is hiding or using in order to lead a better life, it is, rather, money one is using to pay off one's mortgage rather than allowing it to fall further into distress. If people cannot repay their mortgages, there are consequences for the banks and, ultimately, the taxpayer. This is a matter to which the Minister should give consideration because what happened in this instance was unfair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do so. I wanted to draw the matter to the Minister's attention because I am of the view that the way these people were treated was grossly unfair. I suspect that if it happened once, then it is probably occurring on a wider basis. In the context of the jobseeker's transitional payment, it is positive that the Minister has addressed a major problem which arose on foot of the fact that people cannot obtain the lone-parent or one-parent family payments when their children reach the age of seven. However, there is a problem with her assertion to the effect that she wants to provide people with incentives to return to work in order that they will not be dependent on social welfare payments. Let us start with the facts. When income disregards were initially introduced in respect of lone parents, the latter took them up in droves. The number of lone parents who were working when those disregards were first introduced stood at 58%. This meant that the belief that lone parents do not work because they can depend on the lone-parent payment was simply not true. When they were given incentives to work, these people took them up as a result of the introduction of income disregards. Under the Bill, however, when lone parents whose children reach the age of eight move onto the jobseeker's transitional payment, they are going to lose out if they are working. Those who are in jobs in respect of which they earn €200 per week will lose out to the tune of €39 each week as a result of the fact that the income disregard which applies is significantly less. Initially the disregard was €149 under the lone parents scheme. It then decreased to €110. Under the jobseeker's transitional payment scheme it has fallen to €60. As a result, lone parents who are working on a part-time basis are going to take a major hit. What is proposed is going to act as a significant disincentive for lone parents to work at a time when the Minister and the Government claim they want to incentivise those people to work. The matter to which I refer must be addressed, otherwise what the Minister is doing will be a retrograde step not only in terms of people's incomes but also in the context of being a disincentive to work. This is against the background of the EU-SILC report on deprivation showing that the level of deprivation among the general public in this country is 24%, that it is 42% among the unemployed and that it stands at 56% among lone parents. It is clear that lone parents suffer disproportionately from deprivation. We had in place a scheme of incentives to get people back into employment that was working but now we are moving in a retrograde direction. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter. There should be no disincentives for lone parents and nor should there be any further attacks on their incomes. My final point relates to pensions. There is significant disappointment regarding the fact that the Minister has not addressed the order of priority in respect of pensions, particularly in view of the fact that four out of five defined benefit pension schemes here are in serious trouble. As long ago as 2011, she acknowledged that something needs to be done in respect of this matter. She promised that legislation would be brought forward but she is now using the judgment handed down by the European Court of Justice in the Waterford Crystal case as an excuse to, yet again, place this matter on the long finger. As already stated, I welcome the fact that an attempt is being made to rationalise, restructure and reform pensions regulation. However, the Minister has not dealt with this critical issue which has given rise to cases such as those relating to Waterford Crystal, the Abbey Theatre, etc. The entitlements of thousands of pensioners are under serious threat. Not including a provision in respect of this matter is a major omission. It should be addressed in this Bill.
