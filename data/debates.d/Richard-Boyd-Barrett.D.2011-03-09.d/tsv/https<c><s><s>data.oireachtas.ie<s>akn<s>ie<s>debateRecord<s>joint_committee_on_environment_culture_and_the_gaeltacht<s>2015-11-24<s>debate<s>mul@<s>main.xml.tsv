RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to follow up on the housing issue and clarify what might be called the war of the figures with regard to the social housing crisis. It is not the Chairman's fault, and I am not sure where the responsibility lies, but we do not have enough time to do what we should be doing here. There must be a forensic analysis of these figures. If the OECD has condemned the Oireachtas, quite correctly, for a spectacular failure in measuring outputs against Estimates and so forth and if we are promising we will do something about that, this is not a good example. We have an hour and a quarter to deal with the outputs for the money spent. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that point, because the topic we are dealing with here is Estimates and outputs.What we are engaged in is not satisfactory and not serious budget scrutiny. Where are the figures which we certainly need for the numbers of new applicants on local authority housing lists this year? All of the figures the Minister has given us are meaningless or, at least, seriously deficient when it comes to forming a true picture of what is happening in dealing with the housing issue. The data serve no purpose unless all estimates, projections and outputs are set against the numbers of new applicants. If we had these figures, I am confident they would show there will be more people on the housing lists at the end of this year than there were at the beginning of it. To give an example, 100 people are joining the housing list in Dún Laoghaire every month, which amounts to 1,200 in a year, but Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council delivered zero houses last year. The numbers are pitiful everywhere else. We cannot get a real sense of whether we are beginning even to make an impact on the catastrophic housing lists unless we are able to measure the data against the numbers of new applicants this year. I am asking the Minister for a commitment that we will get these figures. If he does not have them now, will he give them to us soon? It should be part of his brief to contact every local authority in the country to find out how many new applicants they have had on a month by month basis. Will the Minister accept that the targets he has set for 2015 completely misrepresent the plan to deal with the social housing emergency? What I mean by this is that his target for 2015 was 15,925 under all categories, namely, acquisition, construction, capital assistance, regeneration, voids, vacant units, leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment scheme and so on. However, there is a large distinction between long-term leasing, the RAS and HAP schemes, all of which are dependent on the private sector and most of which do not actually involve the provision of new accommodation for those on the lists. I do not see how the Minister can deliver on the targets he has set in this regard, given that he has failed spectacularly to do so thus far. However, even if he does deliver, does he accept that none of it involves new accommodation? In fact, it is simply a case of recategorising people who are already in rented accommodation as being housed. There is no new social housing; people will remain in the private housing they have been in all along, but they will now be counted under a different category. If we are to have any meaningful assessment of the level of delivery of new social housing, we should only be talking about construction, acquisition, capital assistance and regeneration projects. In fact, regeneration projects do not provide new accommodation, nor does the restoration of voids and vacant properties. The only meaningful figures are those which concern construction, acquisition and the capital assistance scheme. The Minister's targets were 946 units for construction and 440 for capital assistance. I understand the number to be delivered under the construction heading is 422 units, although the Minister might be able to give an update on that figure, and 157 under the capital assistance scheme. In other words, less than half the target figure has been delivered. The Minister is saying he will meet the targets and in one case exceed them. How does he propose to achieve this, given that we are less than two months from the end of the year?Even if the Minister does meet those targets, we are talking about only 1,300 new social housing units against a background where, according to my estimation, some 15,000 new applicants will have come onto the list by year end. In other words, we are effectively going backwards. The Minister said local authorities may use revenues from the local property tax as they see fit. Will he explain how Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has €10 million allocated for social housing for 2015 from the local property tax but is not allowed to spend that money because it is apparently "awaiting instructions" from the Minister and has been for the past year? That is according to the management of the council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will. This question has been raised repeatedly in recent months. For 2016, the council has €8 million allocated, in respect of which it is "awaiting further information" from the Minister about how the moneys can be spent. With the Chairman's indulgence, I have a final question. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is claiming the reason it cannot advance a more ambitious programme of new Part VIII social housing deliveries is that it does not have the staff to do so. The council has increased the number of Part VIII projects that have come forward, although they are two years down the line. Is the Minister willing to commit that whatever staff resources are necessary to increase the number of Part VIII projects local authorities can progress to deliver social housing, that those resources will be given?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point I am making-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked one question about applicants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not always. It depends on the question. We want to know how many applicants there were in 2015, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that include new applicants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will be very helpful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do those figures include the Dún Laoghaire area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is hardly any social housing in south Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On foot of my earlier question about money from the local property tax fund which was allocated for social housing, the figure in the case of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council being €10 million for 2015 and €8 million for 2016, will the Minister confirm that there is nothing to stop the council from using the money as it sees fit to provide new social housing? I would like a clear answer to that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not getting a straight answer from someone; who I do not know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one last question. We are all wondering why we received so little from NAMA. Do we have figures for how much stock NAMA has in each area? I am not just talking about what it identifies for use as social housing. Do we have the figures for how much stock it actually has, broken down on a county by county basis? I know that a lot of it has been sold, but what remains on a county by county basis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has Deputy Murphy received a response yet?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we hear the responses and then I can come in?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I mentioned to the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, when leaving the earlier session, I would like an instruction to be given to all local authorities to the effect that the eligibility criteria for any of the schemes designed to keep people in homes or get them into homes if they are on the housing list or homeless should be relaxed and there should be flexibility. Too often, in the context of a series of issues - including HAP, RAS and other schemes - officials are operating to the letter of the law which is what they understand they have to do. They would be worried if they did anything other than respect the letter of the law because they might get rapped over the knuckles by the Department for doing so. This leads to a bureaucratic stupidity which is no individual's fault. There is a need for an instruction from the top to the effect that people should be flexible. Obviously, if they are going outside particular eligibility criteria, they should note that and if that is subsequently perceived to be a problem, it could be addressed. However, we need more flexibility and, in the first instance, people need to be encouraged to be flexible and not say, "You don't quite tick all the boxes here, therefore you can't go for this scheme."We are dealing with a case at the moment of a couple who are working whose landlord proposes to increase the rent from €1,000 to €1,200. They cannot afford that and will become homeless. However, their landlord says he would be interested in doing RAS but because they are working, they are not eligible for RAS so they will be put out of their home. HAPS is not operational in Dún Laoghaire for some odd reason, because it is a pilot. It should be bloody well brought in everywhere - I do not like it but we should at least have a level playing field. There must be flexibility. The official in that situation needs to say: "We can stop these people becoming homeless here by making a dispensation to keep them in their home." I will give another example of where flexibility is needed of a situation where a landlord is selling the property, even though he is very happy with the tenants who have always paid their rent. He does not want to put these people out on the street, this message is passed via the tenants to me and to the council. He tells the council he would like to sell the house back to keep these people in their home rather than allow the property to go on the free market. That is very nice of the landlord, a lot of people would not do that, but he is told it cannot be done because authorisation is needed.  The policy must be to get people into houses or prevent them from being evicted, whatever that takes. The mortgage to rent scheme - where people are in arrears and the banks are supposed to offer them a suite of options to keep them in their homes - would have been helpful to many people on low income. There has been a spectacular failure in the delivery of this scheme for reasons I do not fully understand. A policy should be introduced where people are automatically put on the mortgage to rent scheme rather than evicted. Resources should be provided to local authorities to buy those houses to prevent evictions and the properties rented back to people. That would take the pressure off the thousands of people currently afraid they will lose their homes and be placed on council lists or in homelessness services anyway.  On modular housing, what guarantees can the Minister provide that short term will not become long term? I am very sceptical about this move. I do not want to be obstructive to any measure that would solve an emergency but I am deeply worried, as I think many people are, that this will become a long-term solution. The Minister initially referred to a figure of six months but what happens to a tenant after six months? Will tenants and families have key workers assigned to them during that period to assist them to get housed, one way or another, through local authority schemes, HAP or whatever? On NAMA hotels, a suggestion has been made that these would be reconfigured and redesigned to provide emergency accommodation. Has the Minister examined whether this could be a better, faster, more appropriate option than modular housing?These hotels are currently unsuitable but if work on them could be done within a six month period - we are talking about a lead-in time of six months or longer for the modular housing - would it not be more appropriate to reconfigure them to provide the emergency short-term accommodation we need to alleviate the crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I am advocating.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A new phenomenon of working homeless has appeared. If people are working, they often do not qualify for many of the housing supports available. We need to change policy to ensure that where people's working income is insufficient to meet their accommodation requirements as a result of which they become homeless, there is flexibility in terms of family income supplement, FIS, for example, for people who do not have kids or rent allowance, if people do not satisfy the exact criteria. We need to make changes. People who have kids qualify for FIS and if they are working, this helps them to manage their rent but single people are banjaxed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will it come into operation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we ask for more time to debate this in the Dáil on Thursday?
