RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, for attending the committee.  Its reports are helpful and packed full of information.  The requirements to get to a 0.5% structural deficit rate and reduce our debt by half over 20 years under the fiscal treaty are terrifying challenges for the economy.  The council members are very pleasant in the way they put across information.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When I listen to what they are actually saying, however, I find it quite scary.  They reiterate constantly that the risks are on the downside and the forecasts are very uncertain.  I agree with that because, particularly, the growth forecasts vary quite widely.  The Government depends on the more optimistic growth scenario to materialise which makes me worry even more.  Even after the €2 billion adjustment in the forthcoming budget, we have to reduce spending by 2018 by another 8%, which does not necessarily require cuts at the nominal level.  This is against a background where demographic pressures and other demands from real human beings in the economy are likely to significantly increase.  However nicely one puts it, this is beginning to look like a bleak and grim scenario.  The circle that cannot be squared will be the big demand on our public service by our growing population when we have to continue to reduce spending.  This looks grim for people living in our society.  It may also be impossible because everything the council says is on the downside.  It is difficult to imagine the scenario where some of those downside risks do not materialise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It sounds like a "lose-lose" scenario.  Professor McHale's essential argument is that if we ease up on the austerity, the markets panic and increase the cost of lending to us so we cannot possibly do that.  We must keep them happy so that we keep the cost of borrowing low.  However, if we do that, we effectively strangle any hopes for growth.  Professor McHale pointed out that one can have historically low levels of investment, which we have at the moment, for a short period of time but if one continues with historically low levels of investment, one will potentially destroy the capacity of the economy to recover at any point and do very severe long-term damage to it.  I put it to him that we are at that stage.  We have had a massive retrenchment in capital investment and are at the point that if this continues, we will do long-term structural damage to the economy that will remove our capacity to recover in any serious way and put us at a serious disadvantage.  If one combines that with all the pressures Professor McHale has also referred to, it sounds like a "lose-lose" scenario.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The council has a very nice tone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In terms of the medium-term objectives that the Government has set itself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that a bit of an anomaly?  On the one hand, the council is the bad cop when it comes to the forthcoming budget, saying that we must stick to the €2 billion while the Government is saying, possibly for political reasons, that it should be less.  However, Mr. Barnes seems to be saying that over the long term, the Government is arguing for a more aggressive consolidation whereas the council is saying that this is overly ambitious and potentially damaging.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that.  There are some areas where I think we could change the goalposts and move the parameters of this discussion, which is not the council's job because they must work within existing parameters.  I think we should tell Europe to take a hike for €8 billion in interest but the council cannot say that and cannot step outside those parameters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It can say we will give Europe €5 billion this year, not €8 billion, and that it recommends that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think that is more a political battle we have with the Government.  I also think that the question of whether one makes this adjustment through taxing the financial services sector, the FTT, wealth tax or taxes on higher earners as against cuts in public expenditure is a political battle we must fight.  It is the council's job to flag the dangers and down sides if they are coming up.  I think I was the first Deputy the last time to ask about the area of housing, the potential for a housing bubble and the macro-economic danger that might represent.  Since we had that discussion, at which point the council said it would look at it, it has become more manifest.  Could the witnesses comment on the danger that represents?  What seems to be happening encouraged by Government policy is that the big outside investors who are coming in and buying up all of the property are quickly developing a monopoly and rents are going up.  One spin-off of that is a housing crisis and it will also affect small and medium enterprise.  Given the tax breaks that are available for this kind of activity, much of that money could go out of the economy.We recently held a meeting with the finance committee of the German Bundestag. I am probably in a minority in thinking our policies vis-à-vis multinationals and corporate taxation are dangerous, but there was agreement from our German counterparts in this regard. We have a big gap between GNP and GDP which is essentially accounted for by multinationals, which appears to make us vulnerable to problems in that sector. The Bausch & Lomb events suggested we could face real dangers. An aggressive multinational employer demanded 20% pay cuts across the board and got its way through fear. If other multinationals were to act in the same way, we could be facing a wave of wage deflation which could pose a serious threat to the capacity of the domestic economy to recover. This highlights the vulnerable position in which we are putting ourselves by our heavy reliance on this sector. The Germans advised us to develop our own industrial capacity, including small and medium enterprises. Given the huge gap between GNP and GDP, do the delegates see our disproportionate reliance on this sector as a structural danger to the economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Professor McHale encourage preventive action at this stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not asking for a comment on the 12.5% rate, rather I am asking about the weighting of foreign direct investment from the multinational sector in the economy.  It accounts for a high proportion of our economic activity and we have a unique gap between GNP and GDP in European terms because of our heavy reliance on the sector.  The visitors from the Bundestag finance committee advised us to watch it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was referring to a recent example, not necessarily the general case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make several points.  My first point relates to an issue raised by Deputy Spring and leads towards a suggestion on something the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council could examine, but I do not know whether it will take me up on it.  We spoke about Keynes earlier, and a name rarely mentioned but which should be mentioned more in my opinion is Marx.  Marx made the point that along with the boom-slump cycle, the longer-term problem of capitalism is that the rate of return on investment on aggregate across the economy tends to decline, and when this happens pressure is brought to increase or maintain profit levels by driving down wages and extending working hours, and speculation begins so money begins to rush around places where people think they can make a higher return.  This relates to Deputy Spring's point on huge amounts of money sloshing around in the global economy in relatively few hands, lurching from place to place looking for a higher rate of return.  Generally, because of declining rates of profits in real industry and enterprise, people are risk averse to investing in the real economy.  Why take the risk of setting up an industry when one could make a quick return on buying cheap property in Dublin and jacking up rents knowing there is huge demand for property?  This is exactly what is happening.  To my mind there is over-financialisation of the global economy and the Irish economy.  Something which I believe is an extension of this, and which has come sharply into focus recently as it has been highlighted by Mr. Piketty, is growing inequality.  An important point to make is that inequality becomes a drag on growth.  Growing inequality begins to undermine the dynamism of an economy.  Much money is concentrated in few hands, which are risk averse and afraid of real investment.  This inequality and the lack of demand produced among ordinary people who do not have any money to spend becomes at a certain point a significant drag on economic growth.  This is the space we are in and Mr. Piketty is absolutely right to identify it.  Should the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council examine inequality as a macroeconomic question and how it is a structural danger to the economy?  As politicians we are very concerned about the human impacts of inequality, but inequality is actually a serious drag on growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take Professor McHale's point that certain aspects of the book are not the business of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, but if it is a factor in producing instability in the economy, is this not something about which the council has to worry?  This is something towards which he is pointing, and I agree that rapidly growing levels of inequality are a factor of instability in an economy.
