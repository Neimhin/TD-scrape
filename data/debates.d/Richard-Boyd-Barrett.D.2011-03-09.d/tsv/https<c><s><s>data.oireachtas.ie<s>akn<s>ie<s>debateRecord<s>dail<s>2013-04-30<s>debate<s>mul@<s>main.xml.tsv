RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last weekend I was involved in organising a protest in Wicklow that saw 4,000 people come out and demonstrate at the Avondale Forest Park, the former home of Charles Stewart Parnell, against the Government's plan to sell off the harvesting rights to Ireland's forestry. In that context, while the Taoiseach was in Switzerland, did he speak to any foresters or anyone in the Swiss Government involved in the area of forestry? Had he done so, he might have discovered that the Swiss have a flourishing forestry sector and that a country half the size of Ireland has over 100,000 people working in forestry and would not dream of selling that resource to anyone. While the Taoiseach was rubbing shoulders with the great and the good at Davos, did he meet any representatives of Helvetia Wealth, the Swiss bank, a subsidiary of which is chaired by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, which has expressed an interest in taking over our forests? The Swiss certainly seem to understand the value of forestry. The Taoiseach, while in Davos, should have examined the question of how to manage public forestry properly and how to harness the value of public forestry for the economy. In the Taoiseach's discussions about Ireland's economic plight and debt position, did he point out to Ms Lagarde, the people from the European Central Bank and those who are overseeing the austerity programme in this country that this year and for the following three years, 20% of all tax revenues in the State will be used to pay off debts? As of next year, this country will bring in more in tax than we are spending, meaning that 20% of all revenues will purely be used to pay off debts. It will not be used to pay nurses and doctors or front-line public sector workers, as the Taoiseach has claimed so often, but for next year and for many years after, we will borrow billions of euro purely to pay off debts, which were largely incurred as a result of the activities of private financial institutions. Did the Taoiseach make that point to people like Ms Lagarde? We are paying our way and by next year we will be more than paying our way. It is grossly unjust, in that context, for a fifth of our tax revenues, according the Department of Finance figures, to be paid out in meeting the debts of private institutions. Did the Taoiseach point out the gross injustice and economic stupidity of this? Did he tell these people that the process is not sustainable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He would turn in his grave if he thought the forests were being sold.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just wondering if he was at Davos.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I met the troika on Friday and it stated that as far as it understood it, there was a commitment to sell off the harvesting rights to Coillte.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is saying it is being considered. Could the Taoiseach clarify for the House if it is a commitment or a consideration of a commitment? That is what we want to know and, more importantly, that is what the thousands of people who came out to Wicklow from all over the country at the weekend want to know. Is the Government required to do this under the troika programme? If so, when? Will there be legislation to do this? We would like to hear the Government is not required to do this but the troika told us on Friday that it is in the programme and the Taoiseach had not given any indication that commitment was changing. Could the Taoiseach clarify this? Is the Government going ahead with the sale of the harvesting rights of our public forest estate, which the people do not want the Government to do, or is it not? If it is, when will happen and when will the legislation come forward?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will that happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Considering the context of this Bill, it proves to me and most people in the country that there is one law for the billionaires and another for everybody else. At the weekend, Independent News and Media, owned by a billionaire, Mr. Denis O'Brien, had €138 million of debt written off by a consortium including Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. If a billionaire owns a company, the banks that are owned by us or which have been bailed out by us - with the Government either having a controlling or significant stake - will write off €138 million at a stroke. In the same week, the Government wants to bring forward a Bill that will allow the wild dogs of the banks to be unleashed on distressed mortgage holders to facilitate the repossession of their homes. That is absolutely extraordinary, proving entirely the dictum that if a person owes a bank €100,000, it is that person's problem, but if a person owes €100 million, it is the bank's problem. It is a clear case of one law for the rich and another for everybody else. Under troika pressure, this is a way to facilitate opening the floodgates of home repossession for people, with the vast majority in mortgage distress not because of anything they did but because of what the banks and developers - along with the politicians who facilitated them - have done. The Government, under the diktat of the troika, is pushing legislation that will facilitate banks hounding people with a view to getting back the homes of ordinary people, taking the roof from over people's heads. It is extraordinary. I am sure the Minister knows of the horrendous experience of Spain, where there have been 400,000 evictions and homelessness has gone through the roof. There is a dire crisis facing ordinary working class and middle class families as they are evicted from homes. In many cases it is leading to desperate action from people facing eviction from homes. These include 53 year old Amaya Egaña, who threw herself from the window of her fourth floor apartment in the Basque country as court officials were coming up the stairs to evict her. That is just one case but we have 180,000 families out there in distress, suffering, with the vast majority doing so not because they did anything wrong.They simply sought to put a roof over their head in a market that was rigged by the banks and the developers, with the encouragement of the politicians. It was stoked up while these innocent people sought to put a roof over their heads. They were not out to profiteer or enrich themselves, they were not out to get the obscene bonuses bankers paid themselves to sell these mortgages, they were just trying to put a roof over their heads. In some cases, the banks would tell people that if they had spare savings, they should invest them in property and borrow money to purchase an investment property for their old age or for their children. Why on earth, then, would the Minister introduce legislation to give further powers to the banks? Why would he remove an obstacle to home repossessions by the banks? The Minister might argue that in normal times perhaps the banks should have the power to repossess, although I would not agree because I do not believe banks should have the right to repossess homes from ordinary people, particularly not in these extraordinary times of crisis created by those banks and developers. In the current situation, however, why would the Government add to the armoury of the banks? I do not understand why it would do that. Could it not at least use this as a bargaining chip and say to the banks that we would consider removing this legal loophole that acts as an obstacle to home repossessions if we see real movement on the restructuring of unsustainable mortgages for ordinary people in distress through no fault of their own? If there is real, tangible progress by the banks in this regard, writing down unsustainable debt and taking some responsibility themselves for the dire situation these tens of thousands of families are in, the Government could say it will think in a year or two about doing this. Why do it now? It is like unleashing the wild dogs and saying we have a plan to house train them. Surely some house training before they are unleashed would be a better idea, rather than opening the floodgates for them to take people's homes from them. I do not understand it. I would like to hear an explanation from the Government. The only argument I have heard from the Minister when this point is put to him is that there are those who cannot pay but there are also those who simply will not pay. First, I do not see much evidence of that; most people I come across are making extraordinary efforts to meet their mortgage obligations when they would be better off telling the bank they cannot continue such is the level of suffering when trying to meet unsustainable mortgage repayments. That is the reality for the vast majority of people in distress but the banks do not care about that. They want their pound of flesh and the Minister is giving them more ammunition, empowering them to get that pound of flesh from people who are overwhelmingly innocent victims of a crisis created by others. If the Minister is going to invoke moral hazard as an excuse, where is the moral hazard for billionaires like Denis O'Brien? Not only did he have €138 million of debts written off for INM this week, previously Anglo Irish Bank wrote €110 million of his debts off. That amounts to debts of €240 million being written for a company owned by one of the richest people in this country at the stroke of a pen. At the same time, the Minister wants to empower the banks to repossess the homes of people who can barely put bread on the table.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is semantics. He is the biggest shareholder.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough but he is the majority shareholder.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am genuinely at a loss, as is the public. Someone sat down with the board of the AIB and I do not know what influence that person used. Perhaps it was it the influence of someone who is very wealthy or several people who are very wealthy or perhaps there was a genuine consideration that this media company should survive and job losses should be avoided. That would be a reasonable basis for the writing off of debts, although there should be a quid pro quo for that. There is talk of the bank taking equity, although it goes from-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps they would but in a situation where we own AIB and a significant portion of Bank of Ireland, do we not have a responsibility to ask why different standards are being applied? A major company like INM, with massive debts, can go before the board of a bank that we own and have those debts written off. We do not know why; it could be a favour for friends or to keep the business going or it could be a combination of both.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be very pleased if he did but I am asking the Minister, and the Government, as the majority shareholder in AIB, how is it acceptable for a bank that the public owns to write off all this debt while the banks, under pressure from the troika and facilitated by the Government, are being allowed to repossess the homes of people who cannot make their mortgage repayments. The reason most of those people cannot make their mortgage payments is because their incomes have been slashed or they have lost their jobs as a result of circumstances beyond their control. Where is the leeway for them? Why did the Minister not at least hold this back? The only argument he has put forward is about moral hazard, that there must be some power for the lender-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In previous debates we have had the Minister has mentioned it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then I do not understand why the Minister is doing this. Why is he empowering the banks now when he could have used this leverage over them to do what he says he wants them to do, which is to restructure debts for people so they become sustainable? Then, after a year or two, if there is tangible evidence the banks are being fair with people, we might consider removing the legal obstacle. That is what he should do. It is difficult for people not to conclude the Government is being disingenuous on this, that it says it is concerned for distressed mortgage holders and will do something about the problem but it is not the Government's fault how the banks behave, there are legal issues and pressure from the troika.In reality, the Minister is making this decision the net effect of which is to give more power to the banks to seize people's homes. Why would the Minister possibly do that? He should explain, not only to me but more importantly to the 180,000 families who are in serious distress - one could probably add to their number the 1,000 a week who are falling into arrears - why there seems to be two different laws and two different standards when it comes to being in debt in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Fleming on proposing this motion on what is a tremendously important subject. I understand this is the first time it has been discussed in the Dáil. It has only been discussed on one previous occasion in the Oireachtas when Senator Feargal Quinn raised the matter in the Upper House. This is, therefore, a first for the Dáil and Deputy Fleming is to be commended on that. We are talking about organ donation which can be life changing for many people. While I am not an expert in this field, I have come across people who have been waiting many years for vital organ transplants. They have suffered considerably in the interim while awaiting transplants, and when they get them it utterly transforms their lives. There are few things more worthy of debate here than a move to improve a situation that can change thousand of lives for the better. It is tremendous that we are talking about this subject and I hope that as a result of this debate the Government will take action to change the lives of so many people who could benefit from the proposals contained in this motion. The motion proposes that we should have presumed consent, which is a no-brainer. Currently, however, if there are disputes within a family as well as uncertainty and delays, an adjudication of no consent is given. Where somebody or their family say they do not want to give consent, it is right that they should have that choice for whatever reason they choose. In other circumstances where it is less clear, however, it could make a significant difference if the consent was presumed and people had to make a conscious choice to opt out of organ donation. We should all support that.  In so far as I have acquainted myself with this subject, everybody with detailed knowledge of the issue will say that presumed consent is not enough. It is just the first step and we need to go further. The model in Europe is Spain where they have presumed consent which was introduced a number of years ago. In addition, the Spanish authorities discovered that even when presumed consent was introduced it did not make a significant difference to the level of organ donations. It was found that there were many other issues which caused problems in increasing the number of organ donations.Deputy Tom Fleming's motion also rightly addresses these issues. In Spain, it no longer is simply described as "presumed consent" but now is described as "informed consent". In other words, in addition to having in place that system in which one is presumed to opt in, one also has a major education programme in respect of organ transplantation and its importance, as well as programmes in schools and so on, in which this issue is discussed by children, families and so on. In consequence, people are familiar with it and with the importance of organ donation for saving or transforming the lives of those in need of such organs. While this aspect of the motion is important, the question of the system for managing organ donation also must be addressed. It is suggested that a system of regional donor co-ordinators is required or possibly even specialised donor nurses in hospitals who are trained in this area. This is to ensure the optimal retrieval of organs in situations in which a possibility might arise to talk to the families involved and to ensure the optimum level of organ retrieval. It also is suggested there should be an independent national donor office to co-ordinate at a national level, but that underneath such an office, the regional co-ordinators and possibly the specially trained donor nurses would operate in the hospitals. Another issue raised in this regard concerned the question of the air ambulance service and the limitations on it in the context of ensuring the rapid and efficient transport of organs to where they are needed. It is a resource issue to ensure the transport capability exists to get organs quickly to where they are needed. On all these fronts, the Government should consider what it can do to provide the requisite resources and back up a clinical and administrative system that can ensure the efficient retrieval of organs and their transportation to where they are needed. In addition, there should be no question of any cuts. I believe there may have been some cuts to some organisations such as the Irish Kidney Association, which has done such tremendous work on this issue. However, I reiterate there should be no question of any cuts to voluntary organisations or NGOs that are working in this area. All the necessary resources should be provided to ensure the implementation of the best possible system in organ transplantation and donation. Consequently, the Government should take on board these suggestions made by Deputy Tom Fleming and the organisations that are pushing for these measures in order that they truly can offer a life-changing or lifesaving option to as many people as possible, many thousands of whom are currently waiting for such operations.
