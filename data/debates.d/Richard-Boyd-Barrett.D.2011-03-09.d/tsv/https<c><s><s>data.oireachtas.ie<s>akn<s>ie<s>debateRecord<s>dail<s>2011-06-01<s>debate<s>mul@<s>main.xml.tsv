RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question related to whether the Taoiseach had detailed discussions with the Greek Prime Minister or senior members of the Greek Government.  This is in preference to just happening upon them at European meetings.  I asked this because I have spoken to public representatives in Greece recently and the Taoiseach would find it illuminating to do so.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has already done this.  In order to secure a 1% reduction in the interest rate, Greece has had to agree to sell its ports and harbours, power generation and the water and telecommunications systems.  It has also had to close down and merge hospitals, agree to cancel the minimum wage and sell the Popular Bank, which is the Greek equivalent of a credit union.  Interestingly, there is a review of that required in the EU and IMF deal.The country is faced with a position where it is unable to meet the terms of that deal.  I was informed by the same public representative that the Greek authorities are now being asked to put up other State assets, including land banks, as collateral against future loans.  This looks like the asset stripping of a country and it is required in return for reductions in its loan rate as part of the overall package.  It certainly does not look like a bailout.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It looks like the destruction of a society.  Did the Greek Prime Minister or any of the other senior Government officials with whom the Taoiseach spoke inform him this was the price of signing up to EU-IMF deals?  This is the future we will face if we continue with this deal instead of doing what the people in the streets of Greece and some of us in this House advocate, namely, walking away from the bankers' debt and telling them to pay for their own losses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask a supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not ask a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not.  Every other Member asked a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not.  This is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me that €20 billion relief for the Irish taxpayer, in terms of senior unguaranteed bank debt, would be a huge relief for our people and would provide money for a real job stimulus.  Did the Taoiseach ask President Obama about the allegation around that matter?  If not, will he ask the US Government whether the allegation is true?  It is a serious allegation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Minister has read the McCarthy report, which has yet to be discussed in the Dáil.  It "recommends that privatisation of some or all of the ports should be considered, ideally after the recommended restructuring".  I would like an assurance from the Minister and the Government that there will be absolutely no question of selling Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which the Minister correctly indicated is one of the most important amenity harbours in the country.  It is of historic, cultural, heritage and economic value to Dún Laoghaire, a town that is in considerable economic difficulty.  I would like the Minister to assure us there will be no consideration given to the sale of the harbour.The Minister referred to the efforts of the harbour company to reduce its cost base.  Some aspects of that are worrying and might imply to workers and locals that the restructuring prior to possible privatisation is already under way.  For example, five harbour police had their jobs axed recently, with a detrimental effect on the security to walkers and users of the port.  Other workers were supposed to enjoy the protection of the Harbours Act, having been transferred when the port moved from direct Government ownership to semi-State status.  They were given protection under the Harbours Act in terms of pay and conditions but were recently asked to accept a 35% pay cut, while the management of the harbour company is refusing to entertain pay cuts for management.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like the Minister to assure us there will be fairness in any restructuring and that the fairness will include negotiation on a reduction in pay for workers, protecting workers' jobs in the harbour, ensuring management is required to share in any reduction they ask of the workforce, that there is real consultation with the workforce and local people on how to develop this vital amenity and that it is not facing sale or will not be commercialised——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——in a way that will damage and be detrimental to the future of the harbour as an amenity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask a supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We probably do not have time to go into this proposal in detail but following the Minister's earlier comments about developing our ports and harbours and the need for tourism and jobs flowing from it, I ask him to consider seriously this proposal, which would ensure better deployment of existing resources to the benefit of tourism, the port and Dún Laoghaire generally.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently passed a capital budget of which I believe the Minister must approve before going through.  That is my understanding but that can be checked.The capital budget includes one of the flagship projects of €35 million for a library headquarters in Moran Park, which is near the harbour.  This proposal is that we do not need to spend €35 million on a new library headquarters as there is an empty building owned by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company nearby in public ownership and which could be used for far lesser cost for this purpose.  The money which would then be available could be used to develop the Carlisle Pier project in Dún Laoghaire, containing a diaspora museum which could provide a significant boost to the area.  The harbour and heritage facilities would be developed and tourism would be boosted.  It would be a little like the Titanic proposals.  The money could also be made available for developing Moran Park as a central park and redeveloping the Dún Laoghaire baths, for which very little money has been allocated despite significant public demand.Will the Minister consider this as a better way to spend €35 million?  Will he use his influence to bring about joined-up thinking on the matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is making a mistake.  I am for local democracy but an argument can sometimes be made for better use of resources.  We could get three amenities for the price of one because an empty building which is in State ownership could be used for a library headquarters, thereby freeing up €35 million to develop the amenities which have been strenuously demanded by local people.  It would represent value for money as well as providing a significant economic boost.  I ask the Minister to exert his influence on his colleagues in the Labour Party and Fine Gael who form the majority on the council to reconsider a potential waste of money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is empty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about value for money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister not worried about how it spends its money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The new Department would be better titled the Ministry for cuts, slashing jobs and smashing our public services to pay off the bankers' gambling debts on orders from the EU-IMF.  That is a longer title but a more accurate one.  We all want to see reform.  Reform is a beautiful word.  Who could not want reform?  Ordinary people are crying out for reform of public services.  However, what they mean by reform is that they want better public services.  They want more teachers in our schools so that pupil-staff ratios improve rather than get worse, as is currently the case.  They want more special needs assistants and resource hours for the most vulnerable children in our education system.  What they get is cuts and caps in those vital resources.  Every community is crying out for more public service workers to fix the broken roads, the cracked paths and to get rid of the graffiti plastered all over the walls of estates.  They want proper maintenance of estates and parklands but they cannot get it because there are not enough people employed in the public service to do these jobs.  We need more public servants employed as community workers in vulnerable communities, where young children have nothing, no support, and desperately need such workers to help them get a decent start in life.We need more public sector workers in our health service.  We need more nurses in order to open the thousands of hospital beds that are empty because we do not have enough nurses and health workers to provide desperately needed health services, to deal with waiting lists and with those sitting on trolleys for days due to lack of investment in staff and facilities in our health service.  We need to deal with the myth, the lie and the spin that the problem in the economy and our society is the public service and that the answer to society's problem is to butcher the public service, as this Ministry will set out to do at the behest of the EU-IMF.  In public debate and the vilification of the public sector deployed over the past number of years since the economic crisis started, it never gets out that we spend less, as a proportion of GDP, on every single area of public service compared to our European counterparts.  As a proportion of GDP we spend less than our European counterparts on health, education and other public services.  We do not have too much public service, we have too little public service.  We have fewer people employed in the public service than most of our European counterparts.  Our public services are in a desperate crisis as a result of that, which is inflicting real suffering on the elderly, the sick, the vulnerable, the disabled and the young.  It is shocking.  This Ministry is a special Ministry set up to make a bad situation worse, to slash and carve our public services and to make more people unemployed.That is not to say we do not need genuine public service reform.  We certainly do need it but let us start with politicians' salaries.  It is outrageous that the Taoiseach pays himself eight or nine times what the average worker earns.  It is outrageous that Ministers are on €140,000 or €150,000 a year when people on social welfare have to live on less than €200 a week.  It is outrageous that this is being cut and other charges are being imposed.  If we want public sector reform, let us start with slashing the salaries of politicians and Ministers.  Let them see the pay cuts.  Let us start slashing the salaries of top civil servants, the Secretaries General who earn €200,000 or €150,000.  What about the public servants in the banking sector?  Some are still being paid more than the cap of €500,000 for bankers who helped to wreck our economy.  It is obscene.  How can we justify paying bankers who wrecked this economy with public money and paying them 20 or 30 times what the average worker earns?  It is outrageous.Deputy Ross referred to the waste of money in the public service and he is correct.  However, the problem is that most of the money is wasted because the work done by local authorities and Departments was outsourced to the private sector.  Massive overruns were not because of public servants.  Previously, much of the vital infrastructure projects and public housing was built by directly employed public servants.  There was no profit margin creamed off by cowboy builders and cowboy contractors.  The waste in public spending resulted from the outsourcing of this to the mates of people working at the top in the public sector.  They creamed it when they were working in the private sector.  Private developers ripped off the public with massive overruns.  The answer is not more privatisation and more cuts in public services but for the people now rotting on the dole, including skilled construction workers and teachers, to be employed in the public service to provide vital infrastructure.  This can take the profit motive out of the equation.  The profit motive was a corrosive cancer at the heart of the public sector.  Why have we seen the obscene high salaries at the top of the public service?  It is precisely because the people at the top of the public service benchmarked themselves against the bankers and multimillionaires in the private sector.  If the CEO with whom the public sector worker was negotiating earned €500,000 or €750,000, the public sector worker believed he should earn at least €250,000 or €500,000.  That is where the obscenity started.  The EU-IMF deal and this new Ministry is about accelerating the problem that caused the crisis.  We need to move in precisely the opposite direction.A typical example from my area indicates the lack of willingness of this Government to listen to serious proposals for saving public money.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council passed a capital budget to build a new super library headquarters on a public space for €35 million.  The council is controlled by Labour and Fine Gael and they passed the budget.  We all like to see investment in libraries but no one asked for this library headquarters.  People have asked for investment in public swimming baths but no money was allocated to that.  Instead, they built a library headquarters because Labour and Fine Gael wanted a trophy project in Dún Laoghaire.  Today, I pointed out that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was supposed to be interested in saving public money and public sector reform.  Beside the proposed site for the library headquarters, there is an empty building owned by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company.  It is an office block and is perfectly suited for use as a library headquarters.  It is owned by the public and has been sitting empty for several years.  I asked why we should not put the library headquarters there and use the €35 million saved for other projects that are wanted by local people, that would create jobs, enhance tourism and so on.  The council will not do that because it is more interested in its pet project than in spending public money sensibly in a way that would create jobs.  There is no doubt that private developers will make up the architects and companies given the contract for this new library headquarters that nobody asked for and that does not need so much money spent on it.  These developers will be paid exorbitant amounts to build a facility we do not need.  All the activities that led to the property bubble are ongoing and there has been no serious attempt on the part of this Government to do anything about it.  I will be opposing this new Ministry and the policies coming from it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Stagg should wait until he hears me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is in trouble now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Stephen Donnelly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In response to the Labour Party Deputies, who have left the Chamber, it is important to point out that the motion put forward by the Technical Group is not meant to be a comprehensive response to the urgent need for political or Dáil reform, because there are divergent views within the group on that matter.  We understand that there must be a real debate in society and between political parties and public representatives about how we make our system more democratic, responsive and participatory and in putting forward this motion, we wanted to prompt that debate.The fundamental and radical change needed to democratise our society and make our political systems responsive to the needs and aspirations of the majority of the people goes way beyond Dáil reform and beyond tinkering around with its business.  It is about deep, fundamental change.  I want to speak about those deeper issues and the more fundamental change required.  However, we put forward some points about Dáil business, because we know change is imminent in that regard.  Change will happen because the Government has proposals on the table.I support and welcome some of the proposed changes.  The abolition of the Seanad is long overdue.  The Government deserves credit for that proposal, although it was not the first to make it.  Fair play to the Government which intends to go through with the proposal, because as far as I am concerned the Seanad is a disgraceful, elitist institution.  The fact that only some people get to vote for a representative body and the majority does not makes it an institution that has nothing to do with democracy, one we must get rid of.  That proposal is positive.  However, whether what is left will be truly democratic or representative is something on which we need further discussion.I also welcome the promise of whistleblower legislation and although we have yet to see the detail on that, it is a positive move.  I agree with Deputy Wallace and others that the Government proposal to introduce a system for parliamentary questions which will mean Deputies must be in the Chamber in order to have their questions accepted is a positive and long overdue change.However, with regard to smaller and more technical issues, some of the Government proposals move in the opposite direction from making the Chamber more responsive and democratic.  Reducing questions to the Taoiseach to one slot a week, from the current two slots — which I believe used to be three — will reduce the exposure of the Taoiseach to public accountability.  That is wrong and regressive and the Government should ditch that proposal.  The suggestion put forward for topical debates is a good idea, but it is important these debates take place early in the day and that they are not shunted to late at night.  We also need to do something about the fiasco that is the Order of Business.  What needs to be done in that regard is not to remove the Taoiseach from that slot, but to open the slot up and regularise the de facto situation.  Deputies want to raise topical issues early in the day with the Leader of the Government.  They should have the right to do that and should not need to play games with the Ceann Comhairle based on an archaic mechanism of Order of Business which only seems to limit discussion.  I do not blame the Ceann Comhairle for that but there is an urgent need to regularise the de facto situation which is that people want to raise topical issues early in the day.These are technical details and even though I have made some proposals, as has the Government, the phrase rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic comes to mind.  While I do not know who said it, he or she was right in saying that politics is concentrated economics.  The bottom line is that no matter how wonderful our democratic structures are, they mean nothing if people have no real power and control over the things that matter to them — their ability to get a job or a house, to have industry, to have economic and social development.  The problem is that in signing up to the IMF-EU deal, whatever tinkering we do with the political system is all irrelevant because the decisions on the things that really matter and that will affect the day-to-day lives of ordinary people have been handed over to a body that is completely unaccountable to the people of this country.What is happening in Greece is terrifying.  It also relates to the issue of privatisation which the EU and IMF are pushing, on which I do not know the Government's attitude.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make an elementary point that relates to the point Deputy Stagg made about quangos.  Quangos are unaccountable.  They are areas of public endeavour that are at one remove from public accountability through this Chamber.  Privatisation does that to an even greater degree.  It is about giving away land, resources, vital infrastructure, strategic industry, vitally important companies and so on, which belong to the public.  Therefore, through their public representatives members of the public have at least theoretically some influence over how those things are utilised in the interest of society as a whole or whatever.  Privatisation means the end of that.  It also means we are increasingly reduced to being a talking shop because it does not matter what we say as somebody else owns those things.In order to get a 1% reduction in its interest rate Greece has been told to sell the telecommunications and power infrastructure, and hospitals and the credit union system are to be privatised.  That is a systematic destruction of democracy.  If the EU and IMF are willing to do that to Greece, why should we think they want to do anything different to us?  Regardless of how much we get down on our knees and claim to be good boys in adhering to their programme, it is sinking our economy, yet they come back for more.  Even to get a small concession from them we have to promise to give away more of our public resources and in the process give away our democracy.Having a real and responsive democracy requires walking away from a deal that has handed over that democracy to forces that are completely unaccountable.  If public representatives were to be truly representative of the public, they should have wages and conditions commensurate with what ordinary people have to deal with.  Would we not be fighting much harder for the ordinary working people of the country if our economic situation was the same as theirs, which is what I propose?
