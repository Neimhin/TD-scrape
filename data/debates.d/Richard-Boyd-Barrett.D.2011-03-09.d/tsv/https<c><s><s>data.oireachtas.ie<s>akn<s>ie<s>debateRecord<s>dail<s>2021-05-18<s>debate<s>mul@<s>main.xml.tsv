RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The revelation that Ireland Strategic Investment Fund was financing cuckoo funds is really quite shocking. I am referring to the financing of entities that are worsening the housing crisis, pricing people out of the market and charging extortionate rents. In many cases, the State and the people pay again, with local authorities leasing properties from the same entities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that we need an explanation. Hundreds of millions of euro in public money are involved in financing these entities. We need a detailed explanation immediately this week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am proposing that the Minister come in here and give us an explanation stating precisely how much money was invested and the rationale behind the investment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government stated explicitly that the annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel was a crime against international law and that the Government would respond appropriately using its positions. What will the Government's response be? I believe it should expel the Israeli ambassador and impose sanctions immediately. Israel is not just annexing territory. It is ethnically cleansing Palestinian land, most recently the ethnic cleansing of 28 families from Sheikh Jarrah, inciting the current escalation. As we speak it is committing war crimes for the fourth time in the past decade against the people of Gaza. It is involved in systematic apartheid policies. At what point will the Government expel the Israeli ambassador and acknowledge that the apartheid state of Israel is a rogue state that needs to be isolated? This morning I heard credible reports that US military aircraft, en route to Israel, refuelled at Baldonnel Airport. I do not know if that report is true, but it comes from credible sources. Does the Taoiseach know anything about that? Will he find out if it is true? Let us not forget that the US is arming the Israeli regime, giving it the missiles to fire at people in Gaza. It is absolutely shocking if US military aircraft are having their planes refuelled in Irish airports and that we would in any way be facilitating the horror that is going on in Palestine.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It worked with apartheid South Africa.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a myth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I got my notification that I will get my vaccine tomorrow in the Aviva Stadium. I am delighted with that and I would like to thank-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would a football match not be nice? I wish to thank all the front-line healthcare workers and all those involved in carrying out the vaccination programme. Nothing tangible has really been done in terms of a meaningful "thank you" to all healthcare workers. There should be some sort of financial acknowledgement for healthcare workers and, indeed, other groups such as the student nurses and midwives whose issues I and my colleagues have raised many times in the House and who should be paid for their placements. Along with the psychologists and all the other healthcare workers and allied professionals who have been undervalued, they need payback from the Government after Covid. No matter how successful the vaccination programme turns out to be, if large swathes of the world are not vaccinated, we will get variants and we will have problems and this crisis will continue. I do not for the life of me understand why the Government and the EU do not understand the absolute urgency and imperative of sharing the vaccine technology and lifting the intellectual property restrictions and patent restrictions on getting the vaccine produced globally at the levels necessary to vaccinate the global population. I wish to make one additional point on Israel and Palestine. If the Taoiseach wants proof that Israel is an apartheid and racist state, not a normal state, its vaccination programme is a perfect demonstration of that. It vaccinates Israeli citizens but not Palestinians, which, by the way, is very stupid from a health point of view apart from anything else, but also demonstrates the apartheid nature of the state and why we need to treat it the way apartheid South Africa was treated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be sharing my time. I will take seven minutes and Deputy Barry will take three. I thank Deputy Ó Broin for using his party's Private Members' time to bring up this important discussion on affordable housing. It is very difficult to know where to start with the Government's narrative. It comes in here and says that the Opposition just criticises for the sake of criticising and that we have no constructive proposals. That is such a dishonest narrative. I am really quite sick of it at this stage. The Government continues to play politics with this issue, which is a crisis for great numbers of people. The majority of people are now affected by the crises in housing and affordability or by the extortionate cost of rent in one way or another. The vast majority of working people cannot afford the prices at which the market is delivering, or not delivering, houses or the rents being charged. They are simply unaffordable for the vast majority of people. Rather than acknowledging the mess it has made of this, the Government keeps firing back dishonest criticism at the Opposition. Every single year since I got into the Dáil, People Before Profit has submitted an alternative budget. Since year one, 2011, we have been warning about the Government's policies on housing, and particularly its decision to sell off all the NAMA properties. We had the opportunity to take control of this land bank and to deal with the housing crisis by delivering affordable housing on a massive scale. In 2011, we warned that the Government was making a disastrous decision.In that year, the same Fine Gael-Labour Party Government made a decision, one that was also criticised by us, to stop the capital construction programme of public housing and outsource the delivery of social housing to the private sector. In what was essentially a counter-revolution in social housing, social housing was transformed overnight into social housing support, which was code for outsourcing it to the private sector. These two decisions - offloading the NAMA portfolio and stopping the building of council housing - have led to this disastrous situation. It is not just a disaster for the 70,000 to 100,000 families on social housing waiting lists. If the State is not delivering public and affordable housing on its own land, it means that the for-profit entities - vulture funds, cuckoos and speculators - control the market, prices and rents, destroying things for everyone. The public land bank is the way to dampen the market and have a counterbalance to these unaffordable rents and property prices. I should add to this debate the banks, which have not been mentioned yet. In 2019, the Central Bank pointed out that people in Ireland were paying €80,000 more in interest on an average mortgage of €300,000 than their European counterparts were. This is another component of the unaffordability issue. The banks that we bailed out are essentially extorting their mortgage customers with the highest interest rates anywhere in Europe. How do we solve this crisis? We should do the exact opposite of what the Government is doing. People Before Profit has been saying this in budget submission after budget submission since I entered the Dáil in 2011. We should use the public land bank to deliver public and affordable housing directly. Affordability must not have anything to do with the market. The whole point of affordability is that it should be related to someone's income. If it is related to market conditions or market prices, it is not about affordability, but something else. If we want to unravel the mystery of why the Government, despite making announcement after announcement about affordable housing for five years or God knows how long, has not delivered a single affordable house, there is a simple reason. The same property developers the Government is talking to and being lobbied by - we have now discovered that the Government is giving them hundreds of millions of euro and designing laws in order to involve them further in public land banks through the Land Development Agency - do not want houses being sold at affordable levels. If they were trying to flog houses at €400,000 or €500,000 but the State was building €180,000 or €200,000 houses, who would buy houses from them? The Government should not care about them. It should care about delivering housing. This can be done on public land at rates that are affordable. It would drive the speculators, vulture funds, cuckoos and so on crazy, however, which is why the Government does not do it and we either do not get affordable housing or get "affordable" housing that is unaffordable. The cap in Dublin will be €450,000. The Minister called it a local area ceiling price cap, but that would defeat the whole point of affordability if the cap is based on market conditions in Dublin, which are off the Richter scale. The cap must be about income. A teacher, nurse, council worker or retail worker does not earn a higher wage just because he or she happens to live in Dublin where rents and property prices are higher. Affordability has to be linked to the actual incomes that ordinary workers earn, and the average income in this country is approximately €40,000 per year, with many earning much less. Rents and mortgages have to be set at actual affordable levels. This means rent controls where local authorities tell landlords that they are not allowed to charge more than a certain amount for a property. The rent would have to be affordable for the incomes of ordinary workers. We have proposed solutions. They could be used, but the truth is that the Government is not interested because it is dancing to the tune of the speculators, vultures and investment funds that want to profit from the housing crisis and have no interest in solving it.
