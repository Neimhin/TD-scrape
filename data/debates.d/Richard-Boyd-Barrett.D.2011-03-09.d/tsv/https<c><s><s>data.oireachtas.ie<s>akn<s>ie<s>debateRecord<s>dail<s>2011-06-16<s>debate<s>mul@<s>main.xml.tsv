RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I oppose this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have leaders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am opposing the proposal on the basis that when the same proposal to raise the pension age was proposed by the Slovenian Government the people of that country demanded a referendum, such was the seriousness of forcing people to work longer and harder for less.  The people of Slovenia got their referendum on the matter and they said "No".  The Government will not give us a referendum.  It will not even give us a proper debate because it is cutting our time short and it appears as if democracy is being fundamentally undermined at the diktat of the IMF and the EU.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that basis I oppose the proposal and I appeal to the Government to stop kowtowing to the IMF and the EU and allow for a democratic debate on a very serious matter which attacks the basic rights and entitlements won by working people in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Deputy Ellis not get to go first?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise if I cover ground that has already been covered, as I came in late.Could the Minister tell us whether we are facing fines?  Where are we in terms of our EU targets for reducing emissions?  Are we on track to meet these targets?  I believe, although I cannot swear to it, that we are close to meeting our Kyoto targets, but are we close to meeting the EU targets, and are there fines pending if we do not meet them?I was contacted by a resident of Bettystown, which is not in my own constituency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There you go.  The Minister of State must not have responded to the call.  Anyway, he had a very good idea, which I think is fiscally neutral — I see the heads pop up — for large-scale retrofitting of houses with insulation, thus reducing CO2 emissions, saving energy and potentially creating jobs, on the basis of a loan scheme at reasonable interest rates.  This would make up the gap between the grants that are available, which do not cover all the costs, and the rest of the cost, which people might not be able to pay upfront.  Who should we go to with good ideas such as that, and how can we discuss and make progress on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course Joyce was a socialist who left the country because he felt those who were going to inherit the Irish revolution would replace one form of subservience with another.  The IMF-EU deal seems to vindicate many of Joyce's thoughts on the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many people are already being forced into exile because of the deal and let us hope that more are not forced out if we continue along this disastrous path.  One more victim of the austerity being forced on the country by the IMF and EU is our hospitals.  In a shocking announcement yesterday, Loughlinstown hospital's 24-hour accident and emergency service is to be abolished and replaced with a daytime minor injuries service and surgical procedures are to be limited at the hospital.  This is an appalling move, which will have a very damaging effect.  The hospital serves a catchment area of approximately 160,000 people.  It is the only 24-hour accident and emergency service between St Vincent's Hospital and Wexford General Hospital.  It treated 21,000 accident and emergency patients last year so it is clearly a service that is being used.A number of years ago the 24-hour accident and emergency service in St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire was reduced to an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. service.  This is a retrograde, disgraceful move which is inexplicable given the commitments the Minister, Deputy Reilly, gave to me in response to a question on the future of Loughlinstown hospital a few weeks ago when he stated: "The HSE recognises that it is of paramount importance that there is no impact on services to patients as a result of the recent redeployment of staff from St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown and community services".  That was in the context of me asking why staff were being moved from there against their will to work on the other side of the city.We now discover that his assurances were empty and that those redeployments were part of a deliberate run-down of services, which pre-empt the review the Minister promised after which the Government would consider the services that might be impacted.  However, we now discover that the 24-hour accident and emergency service in Loughlinstown is to be shut down, causing extreme hardship and anxiety for many people.All of these people will now be forced to go to St. Vincent's Hospital or to Wexford General Hospital.  That means 21,000 additional people into an already over-stretched service in St. Vincent's.  This is a disastrous move, the background to which is the €1 billion reduction in health service funding, which the Government has refused to reverse as a result of the IMF-EU deal.  I appeal to the Government to reverse this move and retain the 24-hour accident and emergency service which is desperately needed in the area.  If that does not happen I would anticipate rage in the County Wicklow as well as in the Loughlinstown, Ballybrack and Dún Laoghaire areas.  We are already planning meetings and protests about the issue.  I appeal to the Minister of State to save me the trouble of having to organise demonstrations and the anxiety of the people in the area by ensuring this accident and emergency service remains open.
