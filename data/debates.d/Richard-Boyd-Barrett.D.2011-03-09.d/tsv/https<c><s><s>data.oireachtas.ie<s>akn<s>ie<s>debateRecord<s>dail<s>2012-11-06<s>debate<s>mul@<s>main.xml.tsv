RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to the new requirements for teachers working in VECs to be members of the Teaching Council. While this is proper regulation that has been introduced, it has meant that some teachers working in VECs for many years but who did not have degrees-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did so but I cannot get an answer. Moreover, I have tabled it 16 times as a Topical Issue and I cannot get it on the agenda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, both People Before Profit and the United Left Alliance are utterly opposed to this Bill and the commitments into which it locks this country essentially to pay off the gambling debts of banks and bondholders across Europe for years to come in a way that we believe will amount to a near death sentence for the economy in the medium term and really choke off any possibility of serious economic recovery. We believe that is even more the case given the admission now by bodies such as the IMF that the narrow focus of austerity and meeting debt and deficit targets has had a far worse effect on the economy in this country and in Europe generally than they projected and anticipated previously. Crucially, the IMF has admitted it has had a far worse impact than the Government was willing to admit during the course of the referendum campaign. It is folly in the extreme to plough ahead with this given those admissions and given the obviously devastating effect this approach to dealing with the crisis is having, particularly in the absence of the Government getting anything concrete in terms of write-down of Irish debt. We are being put into a straitjacket which guarantees devastation of our economy and further pain for the people. However, we have made all those points clear and that argument has been had elsewhere and will continue to be had elsewhere. Obviously, the Government intends to press ahead with this commitment to these rules. Given that it has done that, it seems Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendments are eminently sensible fail-safes to insert into the Bill. While we may have committed to targets that some of us believe are absolutely crazy, we should at least put in some sort of fail-safe mechanism where if it is absolutely obvious that the demands of the European Commission to meet these targets are going to mean that we have no growth, damage to the employment situation in this country or other adverse effects on the economy, then those issues will be considered as part of any plan the Government is required to serve up to our masters in the European Commission.This, to me, appears to be an eminently sensible fail safe. Equally, we should have a fail-safe which ensures that criteria such as poverty, income inequality and social inclusion rather than only narrow accountancy targets of debts and deficits, expenditure ceilings and so on are taken into account in any plan which the Irish Government would be required to draw up for the Commission. This is about the Government admitting that the troika might be wrong and that it is possible that those of us on this side of the House who opposed the fiscal treaty may be right. The Government will probably not admit so now - it obviously it will not - but this would at least acknowledge that we may be right that these two measures of meeting these targets while promoting growth, employment, economic and social justice in the country may be at odds. This should at least be a consideration in any plan that we may have to come up with if we find we are unable to meet these debt and deficit targets. I do not understand how the Minister cannot see the wisdom of including this type of fail safe so as to ensure we are not tied completely to a policy that may do extreme damage to our economy and society. I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that the plan we will be required to serve up, if issued with a warning by the Commission, is the outlines of another troika programme. It will require us to give detailed commitments to it on different sectors of public spending, including specific targets for cuts, Department by Department, in order to meet these debt and deficit rules. Surely, if we find ourselves in the desperate situation of being forced to do this, such a plan should at the very least be put before the elected representatives of the people of this country so that we can debate whether continuing to sign up to such a programme is in the best interests of the people, the economy and our society.  I believe these are reasonable amendments which should be included in a Bill which we believe is foolish in terms of its being a form of economic madness. The inclusion of these safeguards would be a reasonable move on the part of Government. I support Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendments and hope the Government will consider doing likewise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Minister vote in favour of the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Mattie McGrath on tabling the motion. This is an issue on which there is strong public feeling and it is not to be taken lightly. People are raging at the injustice of what is going on. The view of the people, and it is not just a slogan because they can see it in front of them, is that there is one law for the rich and another law for the rest of us. That is their view when they see ordinary working people, the vulnerable sectors of society, pensioners and young people being crushed by income reductions, reduced services, levies, charges and taxes that are pushing them into poverty and into a situation where they can barely pay their bills or cannot pay their mortgages. They are being pushed into homelessness. People are in a state of despair and they bear no responsibility whatever for the economic crimes - the economic treason - that was perpetrated in this country by a cabal of bankers, politicians and top civil servants. Ordinary people pay the bill while being driven into poverty, unemployment, emigration, suffering, despair and, worse, suicide. They then see the cabal that was at the helm of the financial institutions and the State apparatus walking away with obscene pensions and lump sum payments. The people who were in positions of power and made the key decisions that brought the country to its knees are walking away with pensions that are disgusting. They would be disgusting at any time, but it is outrageous in the current climate when ordinary people are being crushed, to see bankers, politicians and top civil servants, who were at the helm when the country was dragged to the edge of the abyss, receiving these pensions. The figures are shocking. The former AIB boss, Mr. Eugene Sheehy, has €529,000 per year for the rest of his life, almost 20 times the average industrial wage. He was the head of a bank which helped bankrupt the country. Mr. Colm Doherty, also of AIB, will receive €300,000 per year. Mr. Brian Goggin of Bank of Ireland, who will have €650,000 per year for the rest of his life, was the chief executive of the other major bank that helped bring the country to its knees. What about the politicians? The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern has a pension of €152,000 per year for the rest of his life, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen has €151,000 per year for the rest of his life, the former Minister, Ms Mary Harney has €129,000 per year for the rest of her life. What about the top civil servants? Mr. Dermot McCarthy, former secretary to the Government, will go away with a lump sum payment of €713,000 and €142,000 per year, the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance who was there on the infamous night of the bank guarantee walks away with €115,000 per year, and the former Financial Regulator who was asleep at the wheel while all this was going on walks away with €143,000 per year. It is disgusting and simply not good enough to say the contractual obligations mean there is nothing we can do about this. One wonders whether there is a serious commitment on the part of the Government or whether the contractual obligation issue is just an excuse given that the Cabinet will walk away with pensions worth €36 million after it finishes its term of office. There is not a legal impediment to doing something about this. If there are problems with legalities, there is a simple way to do it. A super-tax can be imposed on these people. That is what needs to be done. We need to get the money back. If people have to suffer any more and have to go through what is likely to be done to them in the budget and at the same time see people walking away with annual pensions of obscene proportions, that rage will explode. People are not willing to take it any more and the Government, if it is serious about being fair, will have to do something about this. It can be done by imposing a super-tax on bankers, politicians and top civil servants who presided over the economic disaster that has been visited on the country.
