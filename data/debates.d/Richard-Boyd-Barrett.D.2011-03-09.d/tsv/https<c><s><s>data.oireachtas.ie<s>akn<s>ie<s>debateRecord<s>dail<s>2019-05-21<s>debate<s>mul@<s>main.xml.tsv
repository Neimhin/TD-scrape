RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last Thursday, I was the first Deputy to bring up and condemn the proposed Bartra so-called co-living development in Dún Laoghaire, which has now sparked a national controversy. Indeed, we have been campaigning in the local area against this shameful, greed-driven development for the last number of weeks and have submitted an objection under the strategic housing development, SHD, process. I brought this up with the Tánaiste last Thursday. Has the Minister reflected, given the response from housing NGOs and so on, as to whether a 16 m² room with a fold-out bed, for which people will be paying €1,300, is the sort of accommodation we need to address the housing crisis? On a question I asked him last week, although he did not answer, is it not an abuse of the strategic housing development fast-track planning process to even consider such a proposal? Is it not, in fact, a manifesto for modern day tenements, with 42 people sharing a kitchen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister reconsider this? This is just greed and profiteering by some of the Celtic tiger developers who helped crash this economy. Now, they are at it again on a site-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will conclude on this. Now, they are at it again on a site that local people have been campaigning to get public and affordable housing on for years, and these greedy people want to grab it for tenements. It is absolutely shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A choice to live in a box. It is worse than a hub.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not what we need in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ask the people in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not allowed under this SHD process. They cannot even have an input.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 in order to restrict certain developments in oil, gas (including liquefied natural gas terminals) or other fossil fuels from certain strategic development infrastructure projects, to revise the procedure for making applications directly to An Bord Pleanála and to ensure that regard be given to the State’s climate goals and to provide for related matters.This Bill proposes to remove any application for fossil fuel related infrastructure, such as gas, oil or other fossil fuel related infrastructure, from the provisions of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act that allow fast-track planning for what is called strategic infrastructure development.If we are serious about the climate emergency that was declared, it is simply unacceptable that fossil fuel companies seeking to profit from the destruction of the environment could develop infrastructure to lock us into further dependency on fossil fuels, which are choking and poisoning the climate, under a fast-track process whereby they essentially pay €100,000 to go straight to An Bord Pleanála and bypass the normal planning process. There is a great deal at stake. In the past ten days or so, we had the Dáil declare a climate emergency, and rightly so. That was done as a result of the agitation of school students who went on strike, the extinction rebellion and the growing mass movement demanding that the political establishment take emergency measures to address the climate emergency. The Government did not oppose that but while its representatives were paying lip service to dealing with the climate emergency, others were busy in Europe at the European Commission adding the Shannon liquefied natural gas facility to the list of projects of common interest within the European Union. The Government was seeking to add to that list, in other words backing further fossil fuel related infrastructure to import US fracked gas into Ireland and, in doing so, lock Ireland further into dependency on fossil fuels for decades. A better example of climate hypocrisy and of a Government speaking out of both sides of its mouth when it comes to the issue of climate change could not be more evident. Such hypocrisy also extends to the European Union, which is now supporting €1.3 billion worth of gas-related infrastructure projects. The EU is fast-tracking these projects to the benefit of fossil fuel companies. Sometimes the Government will try to justify this by suggesting that gas is transitional and better than coal or oil. All the bodies seriously looking at this have made it absolutely clear that gas is every bit as bad as coal and oil. It is a fossil fuel. Moreover, fracked gas from the US has significant methane leakage and the net impact of fracked gas on the environment and climate is every bit as bad that of coal or oil. It is simply nonsense, hypocrisy and dishonesty on the part of the Government to maintain that gas is transitional. Such infrastructure is tying up resources and crowding out the investment that should be going into developing renewable energy. It will lock us into dependency on highly expensive infrastructure that promotes and continues the use of fossil fuels. I want to say something important, which may be news to some. The High Court action taken by Friends of the Irish Environment is the only reason the Shannon facility is currently blocked. That action is blocking the application for the time being. It may be worth noting that New Fortress Energy, the company behind the facility, essentially offered to bribe the organisation with €1 million to drop the case. Thankfully, because those involved are principled environmentalists they refused the money and are maintaining their High Court action to block the Shannon LNG facility. The Bill is about saying that we should not give favoured planning status to this kind of fossil fuel infrastructure. This infrastructure will continue to poison our environment as long as the Government continues to support it. This position exposes the Government's complete dishonesty in claiming it wants to deal with the climate emergency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit believes in the complete separation of church and State, particularly in health and education, and we think the Government has failed, even in its own terms, in the school divestment programme. Despite the rhetorical commitment to divestment, 96% of schools continue to be controlled by religious bodies, particularly the Catholic Church. The Taoiseach is always going on about wanting choice for people, but I will give an example of the failure of the Government to deliver for those who want multidenominational, rather than faith-based, education. Last night, there was a big public meeting in Dún Laoghaire attended by hundreds of parents to discuss the Dún Laoghaire Educate Together school. After a rather convoluted voting process two years ago, in which people had to vote for which school patron they wanted, there was an overwhelming preference for an Educate Together school but the kids whose parents voted this way have been in prefabs ever since. One of the parents said, very emotionally, that she had to take her child out of the school she wanted the child to be in, because the child's needs were incompatible with being in prefabs. The parents asked where the permanent site was, which parliamentary questions had indicated would be provided a year ago. It is not on. This is an aspect of how, even at this level, the choice the Government talks about is not being provided. It is completely unacceptable for kids to still be in prefabs. It has been revealed today that €100 million has been spent over the past six years by the Government to keep children in prefabs rather than permanent school buildings. Can the Taoiseach comment on that? Will he look into the issue a permanent school for Dún Laoghaire Educate Together?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it next year or this year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no doubt that the world we live in has been transformed fundamentally by digital, social media, communication, Internet technology and so on. There are many advantages to that at many levels in our society, but it has also produced many challenges, of which online bullying is one. There is also arguably a concern about the overuse of digital technology, social media and so on.It strikes me that as the landscape changes, the companies that are making gargantuan, astronomical and mind-boggling profits from the digital transformation should make a contribution to the society in which they function, and from which they profit, to help us to put in the infrastructure, supports and oversights needed to manage the digital revolution. These precise IT corporations - Google, Facebook, Apple and all the rest of them - pay pitiful percentages in tax. In most cases, they pay less than 1% in tax. As we know, many of them are based here. In light of the challenges for our society that are posed by the IT revolution, some of the impacts of which revolution are adverse, does the Taoiseach not think it would be fair and reasonable for these people to pay a little bit more tax? A digital tax of some kind could be used to funnel money into the infrastructure, services and supports for young people that are needed to ensure the digital revolution benefits society, rather than having an adverse impact on it.
