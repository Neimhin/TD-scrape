RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the German Minister for European Affairs was in Dublin he confirmed that the Government conspired with our so-called European partners to try to avoid a referendum and deny the people of this country the right to have a say on this treaty that will have such far-reaching effects.  The Constitution has saved democracy and the right of citizens in this country to have a say despite the conspiring and manoeuvring with our so-called European partners.  It says everything about the austerity agenda being pursued by Europe and the thrust of this treaty, which is just the latest instalment in the austerity agenda, that we have already seen two elected prime ministers deposed in order to ram through the policy of bailing out banks and inflicting austerity on the citizens of Europe, and that the Government then also conspired with our European partners to try to prevent a referendum in this country.  However, thankfully, the Constitution has ensured that the people will have their say.Therefore, we must discuss the substance of the treaty, which is very simple.  It seeks to deny democratically elected governments the right to borrow, virtually at all.  To deny that right at any time to invest in jobs, infrastructure, industrial development, and economic and social development is madness.  It is anti-democratic and it is economically stupid, but to do it at a time of recession is crazy.  The evidence is clear everywhere.  It is not just the left that is saying this, mainstream and prominent economists across the world are saying that especially in times of recession one needs flexibility to be able to borrow to invest in the economy, to provide stimulus.  The treaty denies us the right to do so.The evidence of what the policy is resulting in is everywhere across Europe, most dramatically in Greece.  Greece is in trouble, not because it resisted the austerity agenda - the people resisted it - but because the Greek Government capitulated to the austerity agenda and the result has been catastrophic for the people of Greece and for its economy, which has collapsed under the impact.  Those same consequences are now becoming clear in this country with the downgrading of growth forecasts for this economy and now for the entire European economy.  Austerity is suffocating our economy and the European economy and choking off any possibility of economic growth and development.The supreme irony and hypocrisy of the treaty is that it tells us that, on the one hand, we cannot borrow to invest in jobs, nor in industrial, economic, social or infrastructural development and, on the other, we must borrow tens of billions of euro to pay off the gambling debts of casino banks and financial institutions.  It is one law for the people, their futures and jobs and the prospect of economic growth and another for the banks and financial institutions.  We must borrow at a desperate cost to the country to pay off the bankers and speculators but under no circumstances will we be allowed to borrow to fund job creation or economic and industrial development measures, which are precisely what we need to offer us a way out of the crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no point in appealing to the Government but we will appeal to the people strongly to say "No" to this austerity agenda and to fight for a different type of Europe.  It is not a question of being in or out of Europe, but of a social Europe with an economic future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will agree the treatment of the workforce in Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick, La Senza and Jane Norman was outrageous, unacceptable and should never be repeated.  Given the current recessionary environment, it is very likely, although I hope it will not be the case, that we will see workers in other firms which go into liquidation or administration finding themselves in the same unacceptable circumstances.  The Minister seems to be saying it is the status quo, however, that we do not have to do much.  He suggested some possible review of how redundancy is communicated to workers.Unless something changes in this regard, workers will draw the conclusion they need to engage in occupations to vindicate their rights with rogue employers.  The workers in the companies in question only gained some, not full, satisfaction because they engaged in occupations.Will the Minister ensure companies cannot be allowed to hide assets elsewhere in other companies or subsidiaries in their possession to avoid paying workers what they owe them?  In cases of administration or liquidation, can we not put an obligation on the employer to ensure workers get first call on moneys owed to them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the second point, it is not just a question of whether there was illegality.  It is a question of whether the law is robust enough to vindicate the rights of workers in a case where the owner of a company has assets and moneys elsewhere which, if they could be accessed, would discharge his redundancy payment obligations to the workers instead of leaving them high and dry.  The Minister should be considering legislation to ensure this will be the case.I welcome the fact the Minister is reviewing the exemptions under industrial relations legislation.  Would that ensure there could be no question that employers or the administrators who are subsequently appointed could act in the same manner as Jane Norman?  Jane Norman is up and running again and is employing other people on lower rates while the company still has not paid off the workers it let go last summer.  Is it the purpose of the review to ensure that this will not happen again and that those workers will be paid?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The goodwill was built up by the workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister examine the possibility of introducing legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to use this opportunity to appeal to members of the public to resist with every fibre of their being the agenda to begin to sell our vital State assets in order to pay off gambling debts of bankers and speculators.  It is one of the most obscene aspects of the austerity agenda.  The obscenity and madness of it is summed up in the consideration of the sale of Coillte.It has 7% of the land mass of the country.  Any State enterprise with 7% of the land mass of the country and which presides over a huge chunk of our natural heritage, vital public amenities and something that could produce employment, revenue and wealth for the State is, by any definition, a vital strategic asset.  How could it be defined as anything else?The idea of a private company owning that sums up the image that people will be charged to visit our forests and that private companies will cut down trees and deforest the country to sell trees for cash.  The real obscenity comes when one considers what private companies might bid for Coillte if it comes up for the sale.  The chairman of the International Forestry Fund is former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  It is a subsidiary of Helvetia Wealth, a Swiss wealth asset management company, in effect a money-laundering company for the super wealthy.These are the sort of people who could potentially own 7% of the land mass of this country.  It is an obscenity and has to be resisted.  How the Labour Party Government could even contemplate selling it or other vital State assets is beyond me.
