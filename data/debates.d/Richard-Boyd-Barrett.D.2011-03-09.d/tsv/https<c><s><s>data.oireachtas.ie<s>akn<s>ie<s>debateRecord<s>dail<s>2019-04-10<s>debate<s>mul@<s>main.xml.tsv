RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The Acting Chairman is suggesting the Minister just give her response, after which I will ask her supplementary questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The top news item today is that there is a major investigation into a loan of €100,000 by John Delaney to the Football Association of Ireland. It is currently being explored at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. Each year, approximately €100 million in loans and tax relief goes to the Irish film industry. Very serious issues are being raised by workers in the industry regarding wholesale blacklisting, including blacklisting of people who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht in January of last year alleging major abuses of section 481 and the rights of employees. Evidence was given to the committee by the chair of Screen Ireland, Mr. James Hickey, that there were 17,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the Irish film industry. We questioned that claim. When the Department of Finance looked into it, it found that there are 2,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the industry, a fraction of what the Oireachtas committee was told was the case. The same film producers in receipt of this funding are refusing to attend the film stakeholder forum recommended by the all-party Oireachtas committee. This situation is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will put it very simply for the Minister. I appreciate that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has agreed to meet me and film workers next week, as well as the engagement of the Department of Finance and Revenue. However, I wish to put certain points to the Minister. I challenge her to find one film worker with a contract of indefinite duration. The State gives €100 million a year to provide quality employment and training in the Irish film industry. In spite of that, she will not be able to find a single film worker with a contract of indefinite duration. There are not 17,000 full-time equivalents as was claimed by Screen Ireland. I do not have time to go into it in detail. One calculates a full-time equivalent by dividing the number of production hours by the number of employees based on a 39-hour week and employees receiving holiday pay and so on. No film worker works a 39-hour week or receives holiday pay or any such benefits. This needs to be investigated and the people who are getting this money need to be brought before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht and questioned on where are the jobs in the film industry.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For several years I have asked repeatedly for the income thresholds for social housing to be increased. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has promised repeatedly that they will be reviewed. The failure of the Government to honour its promise to do so is resulting in a cull of working people from housing lists. For example, I have written to the Minister this week about a woman who works for the HSE as an environmental health officer. She is likely to be given a new Brexit-related job with the HSE and if she gets it, she will receive a slight pay increase. If that happens and unless the Minister raises the income thresholds, she will have to resign from her job because she will lose eight years on the housing list and on her income she will have no chance of being able to buy or rent. She is paying over 50% of her income on rent she absolutely cannot afford. This is happening to hundreds, if not thousands, of workers who are being culled from housing lists. When will the income thresholds be increased to stop it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been hearing that for years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, we will have three and a half minutes each.The most important thing one can say to people who are angry and frustrated about the worsening and ongoing housing crisis is that they should come out onto the streets for the Raise the Roof demonstration on 18 May. People are sick and tired of the discussion here and the failure of the Government to address the problem. Just as we defeated the unfair and unjust water charges through mass mobilisation, the only way we are going to force a change to deliver the public and affordable housing we need, have the rent controls we need, stop the land speculation and land sell-off, stop the flow into homelessness, have the right to housing inserted into the Constitution is by getting the people out onto the streets. The people who are on housing lists, in the hubs, living with their parents and grandparents because they cannot afford to buy a home and spending more than 50% or 60% of their income on rent, as well as the young people who have no prospect of having a house they can own or rent in the future unless we address the crisis need to get out onto the streets on 18 May. The motion the Labour Party has brought forward has aspects with which I agree. We have kept much of it, although we have sought to amend other aspects. There is a role not so much for the banks but for a State construction company that would work with the local authorities as the primary deliverer of local authority and public housing on public land. However, we have added in that we should not just maintain public land but also that there should categorically be no sell-off of public land of any description, in any circumstance, by the State, semi-State companies or local authorities - that is critical - and that there should be aggressive measures to stop land boarding and speculation. I was hoping the Minister would be present in the House for the debate as I had asked him about this issue today. I want to give a couple of examples to highlight the problem we have to address. First, we need to raise the income thresholds to qualify for social housing. Working people, the people who the Taoiseach said get up early in morning, are being axed from the housing list in their hundreds and thousands because their earnings are ever so slightly above the income thresholds such that they are left in limbo, unable to pay market rents or find affordable housing because it is not available. That has to stop. I asked the Minister about this issue and ask him again about it now. A woman who is working for the HSE has a job that is going to change because of Brexit. She will have to check food imports. Her wages will go up slightly, which means that she will lose eight years on the housing list. As a result, she is thinking of resigning. A man who is a council worker effectively has to do mandatory overtime on a Saturday. As a result, he has been taken off the waiting list having been on it for ten years. I have lots more examples, but I do not have time to go through all of them. It is wrong. If we want to have a social mix, the last thing we want to do is constantly cut people from the social housing application list just because they are working, but that is what is happening. The other thing I have discovered this week is that much of the Part V social housing that has been delivered is of a lower spec and substandard compared with the housing provided in private developments, which is wrong.  My last point concerns the scandal of selling off public land, including NAMA lands and property, to speculators and land hoarders, including the Sentinel building in Sandyford. It is a scandal.
