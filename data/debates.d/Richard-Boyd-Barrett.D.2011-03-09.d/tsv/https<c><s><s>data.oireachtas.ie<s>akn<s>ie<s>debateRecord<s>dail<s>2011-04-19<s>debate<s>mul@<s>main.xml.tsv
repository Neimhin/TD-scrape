RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I welcome the news that no definite decision has been made on deploying military personnel, I ask the Minister to indicate that Ireland will not consider deploying military personnel as part of this operation. Notwithstanding the humanitarian justification that may be provided, NATO forces are engaged in aggressive military action in Libya which goes far beyond the scope of humanitarian intervention, particularly in the aftermath of the joint statement made by Prime Minister Cameron, President Obama and President Sarkozy in which they refer to regime change.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister provide a firm assurance that Ireland will not in any way provide assistance or deploy military personnel to what is revealing itself increasingly as an aggressive military action for regime change which is contrary to international law? It is increasingly clear that this is about big powers trying to secure their oil and other interests in Libya and does not have anything to do with humanitarian intervention.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the anti-war movement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to withdraw what is an outrageous and unfounded claim that I am supporter of the Gadaffi regime. Not only am I not a supporter of Gadaffi, who is a brutal dictator, but I would like to see him overthrown. I have stood on a number of protests in recent weeks with members of the Libyan community who are opposed to Gadaffi and seek his overthrow and did not notice the Minister on any of the demonstrations. One of his former party colleagues, Peter Sutherland, signed an oil deal with Gadaffi in 2004, while Western governments have armed and financed the Gadaffi regime, thereby giving him the means to butcher his own population.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has no lessons to teach me about opposing dictators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister accept, as many are now saying in Britain, including the British political establishment, and throughout the world, that the Western military intervention in Libya goes way beyond the remit of a claimed humanitarian mission and is actually about regime change, as stated explicitly by Mr. David Cameron, President Nicholas Sarkozy and President Barack Obama? Will we state clearly that we will not involve ourselves in supporting, in any shape or form, an aggressive military intervention to secure oil interests in Libya?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister withdraw the claim that I support Colonel Gadaffi?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Neither have the bombings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It got rid of President Mubarak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the shocking revelation that yet another banker will walk away with €3 million in a pot of gold after helping to bankrupt——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question on legislation. This €3 million is for helping to bankrupt the economy and forcing crushing austerity on the working people of this country. Is it not time to bring forward emergency taxation legislation to claw back some of the wealth that these people have walked away with? These people have robbed the country and left it bankrupt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we not bring forward legislation to claw back some of this money through wealth taxes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is from "Genuinely curious in Dún Laoghaire".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the programme for Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach restated at the weekend his intention to go ahead with the sale of €2 billion worth of State assets. When can we expect the assets to be identified and the proposal introduced to the House and discussed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not be supporting the motion. As others have said, this is Big Brother-like in how it intrudes upon the private information of our citizens and citizens across Europe. It is completely unjustified and unacceptable and it is not just me or those who have spoken tonight who have said that; the European Parliament has expressed deep concern about it, saying the proposal lacked legal certainty on its compatibility with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and that there was a failure to adequately demonstrate the use of PNR data for the purpose of law enforcement was necessary and proportionate.Many other bodies such as the Data Protection Commissioner, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on EU Scrutiny have expressed concerns about the justification and proportionality of this measure in terms of the objectives it sets. I do not see this as justified but the key is that it is being pushed for by the United States as part of the so-called war on terrorism. That is the real agenda. If the Minister and Government wish to address the serious problem of terrorism in the world, instead of introducing Big Brother legislation that will pry into the movements of citizens and give the information to God knows who in the United States or other jurisdictions, they would be better dealing with the root causes that have driven people to misguided terrorist actions.As the Minister knows but will probably not acknowledge, in so far as a terrorist problem has developed, much of it has to do with the foreign policy of the United States and the other major Western powers in respect of regions such as the Middle East. Essentially, the powers to which I refer have set out to secure their interests at the expense of people within the Middle East. This has fuelled bitterness and anger and people have misguidedly engaged in terrorist actions as a result. We have no compunction in condemning such actions, the root cause of which is US and Western foreign policy in the Middle East.Would it not be better for the Government to begin to condemn, for example, the continued support on the part of the United States and certain European countries for brutal dictatorships such as the regime in Saudi Arabia which deny any rights, civil liberties or freedoms to their citizens? The Saudi regime is engaged in supporting the Government of Bahrain's attempts to suppress a pro-democracy movement. In the past, the regime to which I refer has armed, financed and done business with dictators such as Muammar Gadaffi. If we are serious about removing the root causes of terrorism, would we not be far better devoting our energy to breaking links with these dictatorial regimes? Would it not be better if we were to cease doing business with and arming and financing them? Would we not do more to undermine terrorism by allowing justice and real democracy to prevail in these regions rather than approving the Big Brother legislation that is the subject of the motion?
