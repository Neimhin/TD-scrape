RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle very much and I appreciate this. I raise the issue of the residents of St. Helen’s Court in Dún Laoghaire, which is a multi-unit apartment complex directly across from my office, which was bought out by vulture funds a number of years ago. The first vulture fund made two attempts to mass evict on the grounds of sale, refurbishment or various other ruses. Because we fought them at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, it then flipped the complex to another vulture fund, which has made two successful attempts to mass evict and has now succeeded. The tenants are now over-holding and are faced with homelessness unless there is an intervention. I just want to know what can be done here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the Minister has engaged and that efforts have been made. Here is the irony. This vulture fund went into the RTB and the tenants said they thought that the claim the fund was going to sell was a ruse because the fund owns 20 apartments and said that it was only going to sell the ones where there were tenants, and the ones that were sitting empty, where the fund had managed to drive the other tenants out, were not being sold. This was totally not plausible. The fund then evicted tenants on the grounds of sale but then told the council that it is not selling. It is a joke. We all know what they are up to. The fund just wants to drive up the value of the property and the rents it can charge. The council is then saying that it cannot buy the ones that are supposedly for sale because there are tenants in them and that it does not buy apartments with sitting tenants as it can only buy the empty ones.That means they will be homeless unless we change that view. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind the Minister that this is a precedent, a point I put to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. There have been comments that people are skipping the queue. They are HAP tenants. They are on the list. Some are quite elderly. Some have children and are very vulnerable. They are well up the list. We have to remember that 13 empty apartments have been sitting there for two years while people are crying out for places. The whole thing is an utter scandal. Do not let bureaucratic box ticking stuff get in the way of preventing people from being made homeless. They are currently being threatened with court action and have been told that they will pay the costs if they do not get out. They have nowhere to go. I am pleading with the Minister to get around this. These people cannot be allowed to evict these tenants. Even now, the tenants are paying their rent and have never missed a payment. They have done absolutely nothing wrong. The representatives of the vulture fund went to the RTB and said they know it is ugly, but they are maximising the value of their asset. It is disgusting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the dead of August, a time when shady deals are often done, Ardmore Studios was sold to an American capital investment firm called Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital, an American real estate firm. This is the former national film studios set up in 1958 with State assistance. It was the National Film Studios of Ireland in the 1970s and it has now been handed over to a real estate investment firm. Is that not a form of cultural treason and privatisation that is absolutely indefensible?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is quite an extraordinary response from the Minister. In the beginning it was referred to as "a studio". This studio was set up with the assistance of Seán Lemass in 1958. It then became the National Film Studios of Ireland in the 1970s. It was where "My Left Foot" and "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" were filmed. I could go through the list of classic films. This is part of Irish cultural heritage and history. I should also mention Troy Studios. Is the Minister joking in suggesting that public money did not go into it? I believe that Troy got €9 million or €10 million from Limerick County Council, which extraordinarily ends up in private ownership. Section 481 tax relief to film producers has probably come to €2 billion to €3 billion in recent years with about a €250 million in Screen Ireland grants and the State owns nothing. IDA Ireland sold off its share for an undisclosed price in 2018 and then it was flipped to an American company in a deal rumoured to be worth about €80 million to €90 million. Somebody has made a lot of money here and we used to own this studio.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the EU says is countries are supposed to create with state aid to the film industry a permanent pool of skills and labour. Virtually nobody has a job in the Irish film industry. They go from film to film, as the producers keep saying. In cases before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, at the moment, film producers have come in and said to people who worked on those film productions funded by public money, "You are not my employee and you never were." That is what is going on. Every film production is funded with section 481 tax relief and with grants from Screen Ireland. The people are paying - this is the people's money - but the money ends up in the hands of a small number of film producers. IDA Ireland sold off the bit of film infrastructure that it had. It had a one third share in it. We put money into it and into Troy Studios, which now end up in the hands of an American real estate firm. It is cultural treason and it is shocking. The EU requires us to build up companies of scale for state aid and a permanent pool of workers. We have neither but we pumped out billions of euro and got nothing for it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will transform their lives with a lot of cash. It will put big money in their pockets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to the basic income pilot scheme for workers in arts and culture sector. Will the Minister give assurances that all disciplines of arts, culture and music and the crew that support the artists and performers, will be eligible to apply for the pilot scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate what the Minister said. I and, more importantly, people in the sector have campaigned for this for a long time because income and employment insecurity is rampant. While I welcome this measure, let us not sit back on our laurels and act as if this is a panacea. We should remember that the background to this, which I acknowledge predates the Minister's tenure, is that we see spend six times less on the arts and culture sector, as a proportion of our GDP, than most countries in Europe. It also does not help for us to sell off infrastructure that we helped to pay for in the first place. Imagine if the Abbey Theatre was flogged off and people had to apply for a job each time there was a play on. The backdrop to this is that we need more income and employment security in general and more funding to create that security in the film, art and music sectors. It is important that everyone be eligible for this pilot scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I said, I genuinely welcome this pilot. It is a step forward. It is a pity it took a pandemic for us to realise just how important culture and arts are to us and how life is so much diminished when those in the sector are not able to perform live and so on. I hope we have learned something from the pandemic in this regard. While I welcome the scheme, does the fact that it is for three years mean that we cannot expand it before those three years are up? Perhaps the Minister could clarify that. I would hate to think that this would become a substitute for much more thorough reform of the sector and increased investment to tackle the more general problem, which is the lack of overall investment in permanent infrastructure in arts, music and culture and the jobs that go with that infrastructure. I always contrast our situation with that of Germany. Virtually every village in Germany has a theatre with a full complement of performers, artists and crew who are securely employed. A great many of our artists and culture workers lack that security. That is what we should be aiming towards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister first became a Minister in the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in 2011. This was the Government that in its programme said it would eradicate homelessness in five years. That Government made a decision in June 2011 to discontinue capital investment in social housing and to rely instead on the outsourcing of social housing to the private sector. Since 2011, average rents have increased from €740 to €1,500 nationally. In Dublin, average rents are now €2,082. My area of Dún Laoghaire in south Dublin has the highest average rents anywhere in the country at €2,280. The policy of outsourcing is being discussed in the media today, although I received these answers in July. By the end of this year, housing assistance payments, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS and leasing arrangements will have cost €1.8 billion. This will go to the private sector. In most cases, it will be to pay for properties that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, sold, another decision made by that Government. This is, in itself, fairly extraordinary. One target in Rebuilding Ireland that the Minister met when he had responsibility for housing was to get to 80,000 RAS, HAP and leasing properties. To get another bit of information out there, we now have 61,312 HAP tenancies, 17,507 RAS tenancies and 952 leasing arrangements. There are 10,000 to 15,000 more projected for the course of 2022. This far exceeds the amount of local authority housing or public housing that will be built in that period. As if all of this, landing us with the housing crisis we are now in, were not bad enough, during the same period, including the period the Minister was the Minister with responsibility for housing, the HAP limits in this dysfunctional incredibly expensive system have not increased since 2017 while rents have continued to increase. Given the average rents in some areas of Dublin, including my area, people are, by definition, homeless if they need accommodation and are relying on HAP limits. The maximum HAP even for people who are homeless is €1,950 and the average HAP is €1,300. In the same period since the Minister entered Government in 2011, the income thresholds for eligibility for social housing have not changed. If people are knocked off the housing list, as many are, because they exceed the income threshold they are not entitled to HAP either. This means they are, by definition, homeless. Does the Minister accept this was a disastrous failure? What will the Government do to compensate those who have suffered as a result in terms of delivering them affordable and secure housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not an accident, it was not an emergency, it was a policy. Let us just be honest about it. It was a policy. The reason so few houses were built in the year the Minister referred to was because a policy decision was made in 2011 to discontinue them. Meanwhile, we were selling properties, which we are now renting back at extraordinary cost. The target for HAP, RAS and leasing was not an accident. It was a policy. It is in Rebuilding Ireland. It was the Minister's policy that the amount of HAP, RAS and leasing would be 2.5 times what we were going to deliver in terms of actual local authority housing. Is it a contradiction to say I want the thresholds raised? No, it is not. I am sorry. The Minister has created the mess but I am afraid the consequence of this mess is that while the Government ramps up, and it has to do so at far greater speed than it has been doing, it cannot have a situation where people who are ten years on the housing list get made homeless because their average income briefly goes over the threshold. Huge numbers of people have lost out. They cannot afford the rents. They are then thrown off the housing list. HAP levels are not enough in the capital and many other areas for people to get properties. They are, by definition, homeless. I am afraid the Minister is going to have to do something about it. This week, I met a family, who are solely dependent on social welfare and who have been in homeless accommodation for three years, who have been taken off the housing list because they exceeded the limits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should not be so modest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to mention the students of Coláiste Éinde in Galway, because they get it, in asking for the forest of the children, foraois na bpáistí, initiative of planting a native broadleaf tree for every child in the country. Monty Python came to mind for many reasons when I was thinking about this debate, partly, because we just keep going around in circles in a debate that has been going on for years and we are witnessing the sort of slow train crash of the Irish forestry sector, but also partly, because when you think about forestry, it reminds you of that scene in "The Life of Brian" where they ask what the Romans ever did for us, and then list all the things the Romans did. They gave us the roads and the aqueducts. What has forestry ever done for us? It gives us the air that we breathe, sequesters the carbon, filters the water, regulates the weather, provides a place for animals to live, creates the biodiversity we need, gives us fuel if we use biomass fuel correctly and provides amenities. I could go on. In fact, forestry does everything for us. Without forestry, there would be nothing. It can help solve the existential crisis that we face in terms of the climate and it can provide jobs and a living for farmers and those working in the sector. That is the possibility that the students in Galway and the climate protesters grasp. What is the reality of the Irish forestry sector? It is totally broken. It is a broken model of forestry. The licensing debacle is a symptom - not the cause - of a broken forestry model. Of course, it needs to be addressed. We have been talking about the ecologists and so on for years, but it runs much deeper than all of that. In preparing for this debate, I went back to a motion that I brought to the House on 27 February 2013 to oppose the then plan to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, which had been agreed by the Fine Gael-Labour Government at the time. I argued for all the things that we are arguing for here, including a different forestry model, a focus on native woodland, a support for farmers applying to plant trees, and so on. It really tells a story, because at that time, the targets for afforestation were 10,000 ha to 15,000 ha a year. The objective was to get to the EU average level of 30% forest cover. Now the targets are 8,000 ha - half that - to get to 17% forest cover. This is against an actuality of around 2,500 ha being planted, woefully missing the targets, as we have every single year.Our forest estate is one of the only forest estates in Europe that is a net carbon emitter because we have a fundamentally misconceived forestry model, which is about monoculture and exporting pulp to the UK, with 90,000 truck journeys every year blasting out carbon instead of having a forestry model that is sustainable and can create employment. To make a comparison with a country half the size of Ireland that knows how to do forestry, in Switzerland there are 100,000 people working in forestry. In Ireland, which is twice the size of Switzerland with better conditions for growing trees, we have 12,000 people working in forestry. It is fundamentally broken. As well as the fact we need to bring in payments for farmers so they have a viable income if they plant trees as part of CAP and they do not have all of this bureaucratic nonsense to deal with, a big part of the problem is that we need to change the mandate of the State forestry company. In the past week, I discovered that while the Minister was in Glasgow and the Taoiseach was saying we are going to protect the trees and take climate action, the State forestry company was trying to sell off a forest in Enniskerry, just as it tried to do in 2013 with the entire forest estate. Only because people acted did we stop it doing so. We can go through the list of the forest sales by Coillte. The sale to Apple in Athenry is unbelievable. Coillte sold 200 ha for a data centre in Galway. It is unbelievable. In the Kilcooley Abbey Estate, 950 acres were sold by Coillte and the following day, the person who bought it for a reported €1.5 million was boasting that it was probably worth €10 million. There is something fundamentally wrong. We need to change the mandate of Coillte. We need to support the farmers in expanding the forest estate and have a fundamentally different sustainable forestry model.
