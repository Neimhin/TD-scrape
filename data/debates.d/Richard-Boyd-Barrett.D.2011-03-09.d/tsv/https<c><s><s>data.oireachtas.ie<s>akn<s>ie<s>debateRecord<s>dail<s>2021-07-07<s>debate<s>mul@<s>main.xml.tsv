RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today is the last day you can sign on for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. Despite the Government's promises that there would be no cliff for people on income supports such as the PUP, that cliff is now being created. For example, if you are a musician or a performer, and you benefit from the live performance support scheme, LPSS, over the next two months, you cannot go back on PUP, even though you may only get one bit of work. That is a cliff for all of those people. There is also a cliff for anybody who goes down to the €203 payment rate, regardless of the fact that they want to return to their industry, whether it is travel, tourism, taxi driving, music or live performance. They are now going to be told that they have to come off the PUP and apply for jobseeker's allowance, when in fact they want to return to their own industries. That is a grossly unfair punishment and represents a cliff for people who have been affected by pandemic measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many in the Opposition have pointed out what a disgraceful move it is to push through this amendment which will incentivise vulture funds to buy up estates if they can lease them back to local authorities. The Taoiseach asked a legitimate question but no one has really answered him. He asked whether we want to turn off the supply of social housing, as if it is a choice between having vulture funds and not getting social housing. What is the answer to that question? If we need to deliver social and affordable housing, and we do, we should not incentivise the vulture funds to purchase them and then lease them back to the local authorities. We should cut out the vulture middleman and get the local authorities to buy these properties directly. By the way, this is better value, will cost less over the long run and will mean that the State will actually have an asset which can be allocated for both social and affordable housing. Why is the Government not doing that? It is the obvious answer to the question posed by the Taoiseach. He was right to ask it and nobody else has answered it but that is the answer. That would be a long-term sustainable solution and would prevent the turning off of the tap for social and affordable housing until we can get the direct construction of social and affordable housing up to the level it should be at.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is better than letting the investment funds do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Purchase them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It still does not justify-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I gave the Taoiseach a proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should, to get the answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following the attempt at ethnic cleansing in Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem and the conflict and military brutality from Israel that provoked, the Government agreed to pass a motion that acknowledged illegal settlements were taking place on Israel's part, but it voted down an amendment I tabled that sought to characterise the situation as it is, not simply as illegal settlements but as an ongoing process of ethnic cleansing by an apartheid state, and consequently the state of Israel needs to be treated as the apartheid South African regime was with sanctions and boycott. In the past week, there have been more instances of the point I was making. Early on the morning of 29 June in the Silwan area, south of the Al-Aqsa mosque, a town of 15,000 people, 40 Israeli military vehicles piled into the area in an attempt to demolish 96 homes of Jerusalemites. They used a bulldozer to knock down a butcher's shop. Israel has introduced a new law that essentially prevents those Palestinians from resisting the demolition of their homes. This week, there was also the spectacle of Naftali Bennett, the Israeli Prime Minister, trying to prevent Palestinians who marry Israelis from gaining Israeli citizenship. Is this not proof that it is an apartheid state and a state involved in the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, as I said?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, I am worried about this legislation and what it is trying to achieve. In theory, the principles of having proper grievance procedures, having a charter for parents and students, having proper information that is available about how the school operates, its funding and where the funding goes, are not bad ideas. However, I worry that it essentially lets the Government off the hook and brings with it an internal focus, wherein the school board and the staff are held responsible for failings which are actually the failings of the Government. If you were to ask school communities - parents, teachers or, most importantly, pupils - what their list of priorities were and what rights they would like to have in terms of their education, I strongly suspect the sort of rights which are not going to be in this charter, because they are actually the responsibility of Government, would be the things they would be asking for. They would be asking for the right to have class sizes that are not the highest in Europe and where the quality of education is seriously undermined by excessive class sizes. They would certainly be asking about the right to have a proper school building and not to be in a temporary building for years. They would ask about the right to proper equipment - computer equipment and other equipment and facilities in their school. They would ask for proper sports and recreational facilities, including sports halls and amenities. They would ask for the right to services where they need them. They would ask for the right to SNAs and the special education resources that they need. The might ask for the right to a properly ventilated classroom. They might ask for the right of teachers to have funded professional development to deal with issues like special educational needs and emotional behaviours. They might ask for the right to have hot school meals. They might ask for the right to have free school transport and free school books. They might ask for the right not to have to fundraise in order to pay for basic things within the school, or be forced to make voluntary contributions to provide those things and spend huge amounts of time fundraising for things that, in fact, should be funded by the Department of Education and the Government.They might ask for the right not to have religious patron bodies sell off their school facilities while the Department washes its hands of it, saying it has nothing to do with it because, even though it funds the schools in question, a religious school patron body can just sell off sports facilities, as has been done at Clonkeen secondary school. They might ask for the right not to be put through an archaic and stressful examination system such as the leaving certificate system, which dictates to a substantial degree their life chances, opportunities and choices, putting extraordinary stress on them and their parents. This system is unnecessary and archaic and should be done away with because it is simply a way of gatekeeping access to higher and further education, which should be a right in itself. Those are some of the rights I suspect people would ask for. They are all rights that the Government should be obliged to grant. That is what the charter should include. I am not saying the other matters in the Bill are matters of inconsequence but all the focus is on internal responsibility for structures that exist. We have the Teaching Council to deal with grievance procedures and complaints against teachers. We have school boards of management, parent-teacher associations and so on. As even a Government Deputy said, most schools are doing what this Bill is requiring them to do anyway. Therefore, the problem is not teachers. By and large, we have fantastic teachers. The problem is not school staff or school secretaries. School secretaries were rightly mentioned earlier because the ability of a school to deliver on many internal matters concerning parents and teachers depends on them. Many of them have to sign on to the dole during the summer because the Government will not give them a proper contract of employment. I worry about where this is going. Having spoken to several teachers, I have learned they are concerned. I suspect this is the reason for Deputy Gannon's reference to neoliberal models and so on. Even Deputy Ó Cathasaigh was alluding to these when he spoke about performance. The main concern has to be that, because of the removal of the responsibility the Department and Minister should have regarding school students and the placing of responsibility within schools' internal structures, schools will end up in a league table situation. That is a significant concern. The measure encourages competition and performance targets for schools. It pits schools against one another in meeting targets. Inevitably, if education is pushed in that direction, as it has been in England, where similar charters were set up very much according to a Tory neoliberal idea of pitting schools against one another in a competitive process, the schools that will lose out will be those that inevitably and invariably lose out, namely those in more disadvantaged areas catering for families with less income. Such schools are less able to meet the demands or targets the charters oblige them to meet; they do not have the resources to do so because they are not given them by central government. We are concerned about this, the logic behind it and where that logic leads. The Government should focus far more on giving people the right to a high-quality education, with minimum standards in class sizes, which should be substantially smaller than those we now have, with quality school buildings and without the shocking circumstances that certainly persist in many of the schools in my area. In my last minute or so, I will mention some of these circumstances. We have a system in which it is recognised that an area needs a certain number of schools. There is a democratic process whereby people decide what patron body their school will have, be it Educate Together, a Gaelscoil or another. The school is recognised, yet school after school in my area does not know where it is going to be located.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pointed out to the Minister and to other Ministers previously that certain cohorts of people who should get support and tick all the boxes for the support schemes are mysteriously excluded from them, which is really unfair. Obviously, I support the CRSS and have done so previously. I agree that the new business resumption support scheme dealt with in the Bill should be established but, once again, unless I am wrong - the Minister could just answer the question directly - I am assuming that drivers of public service vehicles, that is, taxi drivers, are being excluded from this scheme. Similarly, jobbing lone trader musicians and many of those who work in live performance have been excluded from all of the support schemes for no good reason, although I accept there are other supports for elements in the music, arts and live entertainment sector. I would love to hear that will change under this new scheme, but I am assuming that, for reasons that are inexplicable and, to my mind, completely unfair, the Government has once again excluded those particular cohorts, who continue to be impacted by the pandemic in both cases because they are linked to things like travel, tourism, hospitality and so on and, therefore, are not able to earn the sort of income and livelihood they were able to earn previously. Many taxi drivers have not even returned to work because they know there is not enough income out there. Rather, they are waiting for a full recovery of their sector. To add insult to injury in that regard, they are now discovering that they are facing a cliff in terms of the one support they did get, namely, the PUP. They are being told that as soon as they hit the €203 rate they will be pushed onto a jobseeker's payment even though they are not jobseekers - they are taxi drivers, musicians or performers. If they do not accept that, they will face the loss of the PUP altogether, even though they cannot earn a full livelihood on the road or, in the case of music or whatever, because gigs have not recommenced.There is still huge uncertainty around these areas. These people will almost certainly not be able to make a living. They seem to be losing out on both fronts, in terms of the PUP and their exclusion from the support schemes, when they have carried many costs and incurred debts because they have been hit, effectively closed down or had their earning capacity dramatically reduced as a result of the pandemic and the pandemic measures. I ask the Minister to come back and tell me that they have not been excluded this time or if they have, why they have been excluded. It is grossly unfair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since I entered the Dáil in 2011, I have been railing against the policies pursued by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, the Fine Gael-Independents Government and the current Government in that they have actively encouraged vulture and cuckoo funds to come in and take over what was virtually the entire NAMA portfolio. Now they are coming in to buy up new estates and they are pricing the first-time buyer or ordinary working person who wants to buy out of the market. The policy is inexplicable. The only beneficiaries are the vultures and cuckoos, which make an absolute fortune. They have directly contributed to the dire housing crisis. They have played a large part in creating the dire housing crisis that we now face, that affects vast swathes of our population and that has effectively locked out a whole generation of young working people. It is not just the young, however, because anybody trying to buy or rent is now faced with extortionate house prices and rents that are controlled and manipulated by the profit-driven entities. The uproar over the latest scandal concerning the buying up of estates forced the Government to offer a token measure. Even the rate of 10% is a bit of a joke. It is a total joke. A stamp duty rate of 100% should be applied to purchases by the funds to completely exclude them from the market. That should be the policy. Consider the proposal to impose a 10% levy if the funds lease the homes back to the local authority. The Taoiseach's excuse for this over the past two days was to say that before we build our own housing, we must have a stopgap, meaning a small amount of leasing is not a bad thing on the grounds that it will help to deliver social housing. He even tried to pit the need to provide social housing against the needs of first-time buyers or young working families who want to buy. There is a simple answer to this. I want to put it to the Minister. I put it to the Taoiseach today and he did not answer. We should be building our own housing and excluding the entities but, if in the short term we have to source some housing from private developers as a stopgap, we should purchase it directly from the developers, not lease it from an intermediary, namely, a cuckoo fund or vulture fund. The latter is shockingly bad value for money. As the Minister said, there is only a ten-year guarantee on the lease so the funds can walk away after ten years with the asset, making a massive profit. Alternatively, if we purchased the houses directly, we could allocate them for both social and affordable housing while ramping up the programme for the direct construction of public and affordable housing on our own land. What is being done is outrageous. There is no justification whatsoever. The Minister should not proceed with the measure and he should take it out of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is for the whole debate. Let us get to the vote.
