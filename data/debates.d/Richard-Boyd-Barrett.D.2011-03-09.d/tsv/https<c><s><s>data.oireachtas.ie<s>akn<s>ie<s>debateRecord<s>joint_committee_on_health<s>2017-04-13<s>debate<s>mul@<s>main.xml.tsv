RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are committee members being called first?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The term "expertise" has been used a lot. What specific experience, knowledge or expertise do the Department of Health officials or the PSI representatives have in the area of medicinal cannabis, research in that area or clinical expertise in the specific area of medicinal cannabis products? My understanding - I am happy to be contradicted - is that they have no such knowledge, expertise or experience. Also, what specific experience, knowledge or expertise does the HPRA have in the area of medicinal cannabis products because it has cited none in its report and to my knowledge it has none. Again, I am happy to be contradicted. Why do the Department of Health recommendations run counter to the evidence provided by people who have extensive knowledge and expertise in the area of medicinal cannabis, namely, Professor Mike Barnes, consultant neurologist, professor of neurological rehabilitation and author of the authoritative report on medicinal cannabis for the UK Parliament? According to Professor Barnes the evidence is strongest for the efficacy of medicinal cannabis in the area of pain whereas the so-called access programme being proposed excludes this cohort. Professor Mike Barnes and Professor David Finn, who has spent 16 years researching the area of medicinal cannabis, say that this is the area where the evidence is strongest yet this is the area excluded by the access programme.I would like an explanation for how that could be the case. Could the witnesses explain what they will do for the 800,000 people in Ireland who suffer from chronic pain, of whom 40% do not get relief from existing authorised pain killers, according to Professor David Finn? Do the witnesses believe it is acceptable that cohort, a very significant number of people who get no relief from existing authorised pain killers, should continue to be criminalised for using medicinal cannabis products? If we adopt the witnesses' recommendations, that will be the case. They will be criminals. They are currently criminals and they will stay criminals. Do the witnesses think that is acceptable? How would the witnesses respond to a survey of GPs in this country which showed that 58.6% of GPs, the people who do not regulate and do not sell medicine but who actually prescribe it and are medical professionals, favour the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use? An even higher proportion of GPs with advanced addiction specialist training level 2 agreed or agreed strongly that cannabis should be decriminalised, bringing the percentage to 60%. Do the Department of Health, the PSI and the HPRA think they know better than GPs, particularly GPs who specialise in the area of addiction? I put it to them that they do not. I find it incomprehensible that they are second-guessing them. Could the witnesses tell us what they have done to look into the five other EU countries, subject to the same EU directives in terms of the regulation of medicines, which have adopted legislation similar to that proposed by Deputy Gino Kenny allowing for wide access to medicinal cannabis based on the prescription of certification of GPs and not requiring consultants? Could they confirm that consultants have no legal status in Irish law? Could they tell us how many people die from products that are authorised pain killers or other drugs authorised by the HPRA, specifically benzodiazepines and opiates, every year in Ireland? That would be useful. Following that, could they then tell us how many people are known to have died from medicinal cannabis products anywhere, in Ireland or elsewhere? We have testimony from Professors Mike Barnes and David Finn that the side effects of medicinal cannabis products, and they acknowledge there were some, were moderate. Is that how they would describe the potential side effects or adverse consequences of the misuse of drugs that are already authorised, particularly opiates and benzodiazepines? How do they square that circle, or inconsistency, that we already regulate, authorise and sell drugs that are toxic, that kill people and that are regularly misused but that we propose to have a higher level of restriction on a medicinal product which although it may have some side effects, there is no evidence they are anywhere as serious as the effects of drugs already authorised and sold in chemists up and down the country on the basis of a GP's prescription? Some red herrings have been thrown into this debate. Could the Department of Health confirm that we have stated repeatedly in both public and private meetings, in the DÃ¡il and elsewhere, that we are more than willing to amend this Bill in many of the areas on which concern has been raised? For example, we would be quite happy - in fact, we agree - that the Minister of Health is the Minister who should be referred to. The reason we referred to the Minister for Justice was because of the current criminalisation. All we want with this Bill is one that will allow access to people who could medically benefit from cannabis products on the recommendation, or prescription if people want to change it to that, of a medical professional and that it would be regulated. There would be continuous research in the area on an ongoing basis to establish the efficacy, effects and consequences of medicinal cannabis use. That is the centrepiece of this Bill. We are quite willing to consider amendments on everything else which has been raised, whether on penalties or on where in the Schedule it should go, and which are incidental to the central thrust of this Bill which is one to allow medical professionals, not just consultants, but GPs or other medical professionals to be able to prescribe or recommend medical cannabis to any patient who would benefit from it. That is the core of this Bill. Does the Department of Health not know that we are happy to accept amendments? Could it explain why that is problematic?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want the Department of Health's comment on those allegations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Department not trust doctors to prescribe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what the Bill is proposing. That is factually incorrect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not. It says a doctor prescribes authorised products.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Bill would allow them to be authorised. What Mr. Lennon says is complete nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Department says and we say the HPRA can do it. We are saying that doctors would prescribe medicines authorised by a regulatory body. The latter would be either the HPRA or a cannabis regulatory authority, we do not care which. That is what it says and Mr. Lennon knows that damn well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the people selling the stuff that is out there now are making a lot of money out of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Lennon is saying that the Department does not trust GPs to prescribe a product that we are proposing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Lennon expressed concern about GPs. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the concern? Does Mr. Lennon think general practitioners are going to prescribe a dangerous product?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For epilepsy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Lennon did not answer the question about pain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Experts who know nothing about cannabis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is unfortunate that many of my questions have not been answered. I asked the following direct question. What specific expertise and knowledge does the Department of Health, the PSI or the HPRA have in the area of cannabis? I do not doubt that the organisations employs experts in their fields. I want to know who we have taken advice from. Are they experts who know nothing or a lot about cannabis? I suggest to Mr. Lennon that we would be better off taking advice from experts who know something or a lot about cannabis. I wish to advise the committee that I shall formally write to the clerk of the committee requesting that the committee arranges an engagement with Professor Mike Barnes. It is the least that we can do if we want to have a comprehensive view of this matter. I say to Mr. Lennon that the fact the British political system has not responded to the recommendations made by Professor Barnes is irrelevant. Will our attitude to medicinal cannabis be informed by somebody as expert and knowledgeable as Professor Barnes or by people who have no knowledge whatsoever about cannabis? Professor David Finn is professor of pharmacology and has studied cannabis for 16 years. He explained in great detail how there was strong evidence at every level to support the efficacy of cannabis-based products to relieve pain, as did Professor Barnes. Professor Finn told this committee that there was a significant unmet need. I asked the witnesses what they would do to solve the unmet need. Mr. Lennon told me how many or how few thousand people availed of access programme in other countries but he did not answer my question. What will the Department's access programme do for the unmet need whereby people do not get pain relief from existing drugs? I put it to him that the programme will leave them out in the cold and label them criminals if they attempt to access the product. I asked the witnesses whether they thought it acceptable that such people were criticised and that the access programme left them out in the cold. I put it to them that it is unacceptable. I further asked them to respond to the fact that the majority of GPs in this country, and a higher proportion of GPs with specific knowledge in the area of addiction, favour the decriminalising of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Why have the witnesses not taken the lead from them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not implied.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is misrepresenting what was said. It is really annoying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not implied. I asked if they had expertise in the specific areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like some of my questions answered that have not yet been addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Lennon did not answer them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, he has not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked him a direct question about whether he believed it was acceptable that people with chronic pain who took medicinal cannabis products should continue to be criminalised and whether that was the effect of the access programme that he was proposing. It is a simple question and is in line with the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to testimony given to the committee, chronic pain is being left out, the Department does not want to support the Bill and, therefore-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not accept there is any process at all for people with chronic pain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My other question was on EU countries that had adopted regimes with a wide access similar to what is proposed in the Bill, but the witnesses have given no explanation of what is wrong with those models and why the HPRA rejected them without argument or justification in its report and opted for regimes with more restrictive access programmes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed we are.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Acting Chairman.
