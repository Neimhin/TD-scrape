RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following: “(ea) details of the manner in which obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability, with due regard to the principle of universal design and regulations under Statutory Instrument Number 513 of 2010, have been reflected in the proposed development;”.What are trying to do here is ensure the large-scale residential development would be required to adopt the principle of universal design in terms the housing being accessible to people with disabilities. We need more disability accessible housing. We have a similar logic in a number of our amendments and in some we intend to add. The developers here are getting a special pass. We are sceptical about whether we need a special process for them at all, now that we are getting rid of the strategic housing developments, SHDs. They should just have to go through the normal planning process. We do not really see why they should get a special process of their own. Given that a special process is being established for these large-scale residential developments, there should be a quid pro quo, one of which being that the housing delivered under it will be universally accessible to people with disabilities and that it will be to the highest environmental standards. We have not submitted an amendment on this at this stage, but will be saying there should be a higher proportion of social and affordable housing. There needs to be strings attached to getting a special process, which are about meeting social and environmental objectives, the first of which is around universal design.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 12 requires developers to state the level of likely greenhouse gas emissions and how the construction of the development will meet our climate objectives and be built the highest standard in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I expect a clamour of support from others on the committee for these amendments. I dispute that this is not a special planning process. There is access for the planners to meetings in advance of large-scale developments. We will be discussing later how they consume significant resources, about which local authorities are concerned. Staffing resources and so on that the local authorities do not have will be consumed to facilitate large-scale developments. I do not see any reason they should not just go through the process under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021. It is a special process and they will have access to the planners in advance, to try to get their development through in a contracted timeframe. Given that, I want strings attached. Frankly, I want strings attached to all development to ensure it is meeting social and environmental objectives. We need more of that.If there is a new process being established, it should guarantee equality for people with disabilities that we are required to deliver under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. It should guarantee that it will significantly contribute to meeting our climate objectives and energy efficiency targets that will benefit the inhabitants of these residences with lower energy bills and so on. This should be tied to any planning process but in particular to large-scale planning and development proposals and especially where they get a bespoke process for the large-scale developments. I need to get something on the record in case I have to fly to the debate on the Finance Bill and try to bilocate. There should be a greater obligation for social and affordable housing and student affordability in accommodation. Why else would we give them special treatment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 12:In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(ea) a calculation of the expected greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from embodied energy, expected through construction or demolition in the proposed development;".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(ea) details of the manner in which the local development plan or county development plan of the local authority in which the site is located is reflected in the proposed development;".This would require that any application for a large-scale residential development include specific local objectives, essentially, in what it must set out in adhering to the development plan. It would also set out in general how it is complying with the county development plan in the local authority area in which the proposed development is taking place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we are speaking to the group, amendment No. 14 refers specifically to the specific local objectives. These are not mentioned in the amendment to the Bill to which the Minister referred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will consider the Minister's response and reflect prior to Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 14:In page 6, line 14, to delete "relevant objectives of the development plan or" and substitute "objectives, the provisions and any SLO’s in both the county/city development plan and any".Again, I reserve the right to bring this back on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. They are along similar lines to Deputy O'Callaghan's, which I support. Deputy Ó Broin also had one, which I presume I support.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the left coming together.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are major developments that will have a big impact. They are not just an individual house or small development but will comprise 100 or 200 units, depending on whether they are residential or student, and will have a big impact on areas. If they are going to work and not negatively impact on a community or get a hostile reaction, and be a good development that will add to any area, we need to consult with all the people who are likely to be impacted to get their input and expertise. We need to give people advance notice so we get the best development we possibly can that will meet the objectives not just of developers but of the locality and its need for quality, affordable and accessible housing, which meets the best environmental standards and so on and so forth. It is critically important, at the earliest possible stage, to engage with people. It is against the backdrop of the public always feeling they are last to know about developments and that stuff is hatched behind the scenes and then unleashed on them. This amendment outlines a way of preventing and pre-empting that and involving all the relevant stakeholders at the earliest stage. Amendment No. 19 specifically refers to student accommodation and the need, in addition to generally consulting with stakeholders, community groups, residents' groups, councillors and so on, to engage with student unions and third-level educational institutions in an area, in order to get input from them as to whether a development will meet the needs of students. We also believe the LRD opinion should be published on a website so everybody can see it and interrogate it. That is what we are proposing. I am confident the Minister will take all that on board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am going to go and vote so I will be quick. This is particularly important in the context of large-scale developments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hear what the Minister is saying. I want to amplify Deputy Ó Broin's point in the context of big developments in particular. There are hundreds if not thousands of small-scale developments so to have public consultation on every small development proposal would not be practical or workable. We are talking about relatively small numbers of big developments that will have big impacts. If you are talking about a big development that will have serious impacts but that could be beneficial and if you get people involved in the consultation on the ground floor rather than when the process is further advanced, you will get better development proposals. As Deputy Ó Broin said, this could potentially even benefit the developers. It will lead to a more bottom-up and participative planning and development process, which is what we need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 16:In page 6, to delete lines 40 and 41, and in page 7, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:“(4) The planning authority shall, prior to the LRD meeting taking place consult members of the local authority, relevant community groups, residents associations, other stakeholders and any person who may, in the opinion of the local authority, have information that is relevant for the purposes of the LRD meeting in relation to a proposed development.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19:In page 7, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“(6) With respect to information provided under subsection (3)(a) with regard to student accommodation, the Minister shall provide for consultation with educational institutions, representative student bodies and elected members of the planning authority, who may in the course of such a consultation set out conditions in respect of student accommodation, which the planning authority must have due regard to in rendering an opinion under section 32D.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 25:In page 8, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“(1A) The planning authority shall make the opinion available on its website, together with a copy of plans and other details discussed at the consultation meeting, upon lodgement of the LRD application.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to get over to the Finance Bill shortly so I will not be here to move any further amendments. I am not being rude. I will say two things on this section. First, we had an amendment ruled out of order but the Minister should take it on board because his colleagues in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown are concerned and there was a vote at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in relation to the staff resources that would be necessary in order to deal with large-scale residential development. They will write to the Minister about this. To put it starkly, the officials in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown said there could be cuts in other services because of the staff resources that would be necessary to deal with large-scale residential developments. That is pretty serious stuff. As a consequence, the councillors, including the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues, unanimously approved a motion to request that the additional staff resources be provided to local authorities to deal with large-scale residential developments. Otherwise, this could have serious knock-on effects for other services. The Minister should take that seriously. It is not just me but everybody in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the Minister will probably find the same elsewhere. The second point links to some of my earlier amendments. I do not see why we need anything that is not affordable at the moment. At the very least, there should be a higher requirement for public and affordable housing in any large-scale development than 20%. We are in a bad state and are limited in the construction resources that we have, including construction workers. There is only so many people to build stuff at the moment. Everything has to be thrown at upping the amount of affordable and public housing we deliver, given the place we are in. There should be no LRD process where there is not a requirement for an additional minimum of, I would say, 50% social and affordable to try to address the housing crisis. I do not have an amendment in on that but I will put one in on Report Stage to the effect that there should be a higher obligation for social and affordable housing linked to any consideration of a large-scale residential development.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section has to do with appeals to the board regarding large-scale residential developments and the time limits for appeals. Will the Minister remind me what is the quorum required on the board for making decisions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to signal at this point that I think this is inadequate. It is a problem that such a small group of people can make decisions in general on the board, especially in the context of large-scale developments. The quorum on the board for making decisions needs to be increased significantly. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. I want to say this now because I will probably table an amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, on a point of order, I am speaking to the section so it is relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 45:In page 17, to delete lines 6 to 39, and in page 18, to delete lines 1 to 7.This is the section that repeals the strategic housing development legislation. This is good, but we do not think there should be any get-out clauses on the repeal of the section. We want to delete everything after the line repealing section 4(1) of the Act of 2016. We believe the end of the strategic housing development legislation should be the end of the strategic housing development process. This is what we are trying to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will you let Deputy O'Callaghan go first, Chairman? I want to read something in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not as well versed on this as everybody else here. The Minister is saying that if we just repeal and do not have these transitionary arrangements, as the SHD legislation is currently framed, you could be open to legal action because the applicants are already in a pre-planning process or because they have indicated that they want to get into a pre-planning process. Is that what the Minister is saying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want the answer to that so I may understand why-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anybody who has just signalled that they intend to enter into consultations is one cohort, if I understand correctly. Then there are others who have got-----
