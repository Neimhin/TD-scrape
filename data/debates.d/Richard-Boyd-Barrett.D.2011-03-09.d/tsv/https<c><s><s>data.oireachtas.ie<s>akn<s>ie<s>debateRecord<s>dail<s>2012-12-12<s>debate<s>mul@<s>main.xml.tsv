RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Struggling families throughout the county are all too aware of the cruel and impossible cuts and taxes the Government has imposed on them, and that its grim determination to impose this suffering is in order to pay off the debts of bankers and bondholders. Will the Taoiseach explain to me and the nation how, at the same time it imposes this suffering on ordinary people in order to obey the diktats of the troika, the Government is simultaneously maintaining a planning, licensing and tax regime that effectively gives away an estimated 180 billion barrels' worth of gas and oil sitting off the coast of this country? Will he also explain how, in the case of Rossport and now also in Dublin Bay, he is awarding licences to multinational oil companies to ride roughshod over the concerns of local communities-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----refusing their demands for public inquiries to look into the environmental dangers posed by drilling for oil six kilometres off the coast of Dublin Bay? Why is he refusing their demands to look into the benefits - or lack of same - for ordinary citizens of this country of these unprecedented deals with multinational companies? That amount of gas and oil, which is given in detailed estimates provided by the actual companies, could pay off our national debt five times over. Why is the Government giving away these resources to private multinational companies when our nation is being beggared? Why is it allowing them to ride completely roughshod over the legitimate concerns of local communities, both in the Taoiseach's county and in the capital city? Will the Taoiseach revoke the licences of these companies to drill or extract oil until we know that our environment is safe and that the benefits of this gas and oil will go to the citizens of this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The estimates come from the oil companies. I brought a little file to hand over to the Taoiseach which details the oil company estimates and shows 90 billion barrels off the west coast and a similar amount found off the rest of the country. At current market prices that is approximately €1.5 trillion worth of estimated gas and oil. If even a small fraction of that is commercially extractable it would pay off the debts imposed by the troika on this country. I am glad the Taoiseach mentioned Norway. I have a simple question for him. Will he adopt the Norwegian model? Norway does not allow any drilling unless there is a public inquiry and thoroughgoing public consultation. There can be no drilling within 25 km of the coast; 78% of the profits go to the state in taxes and royalties; and ownership of the gas and oil stays in the hands of the national company, Statoil, which is owned by the state and the citizens. Will the Taoiseach halt any permissions for drilling or extraction by oil companies until we have established a Norwegian model to manage our natural resources in order to keep the environment safe and so that the citizens of this country can benefit from the resources in our waters?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just do not grant the licences in Dublin Bay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here is the map. There are 87 prospects in specific locations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach propose to instigate a public inquiry with regard to what is happening in Dublin Bay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to add my appeal to the Taoiseach to remove the guillotine on the debate on the Social Welfare Bill. These issues are too important and touch too many lives to truncate the debate on the Bill in the way he intends to. There is a way out of this that is reasonable and fair which is to defer the debate on the property tax Bill until after Christmas. There is no rush with it as it is not to be introduced until July. Why can the Taoiseach not agree to defer the debate on that Bill and allow more time for the debate on the Social Welfare Bill? A little extra time, which is inadequate, has been granted for the debate on the Bill but the Technical Group will not have any extra time because of the rotation system. We number a third of the Opposition and we will not be given any extra time in the extra that has been given. That is completely unfair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Taoiseach to lift the guillotine on the debate for those specific reasons but also, more generally, because we need adequate time to debate the Bill and discuss amendments to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality that Fianna Fáil's miraculous conversion on the road to righteousness and political transparency is not the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those double standards are not the issue. The Government promised no less than a democratic revolution in how we do business in the House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is not only betraying promises he made to the families of those with disabilities and promises made by the Labour Party on child benefit; he is now betraying the promise to have a new kind of politics. Will the Taoiseach please allow a debate on the Social Welfare Bill? It will seriously affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of families in the State. He should allow us to debate whether there might be some alternatives that could lift this terrible burden off those families. Will the Taoiseach please allow that debate and discuss it with the Whips or whatever needs to be done? There are ways to find more time for this discussion. The Taoiseach should have the courage and show a commitment to his own pre-election promises to allow for that debate to take place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All of the political point-scoring - the jibes about Fianna Fáil, about what happens in the North and about the Labour Party - has to be set aside at this juncture, frankly. Notwithstanding the ideological differences we might have or where we might stand on the left-wing spectrum, I appeal to the Labour Party Deputies to think hard about what they will do tonight and tomorrow. If these measures had been introduced two years ago, they would have been screaming in denunciation of them and rightly so. These measures will drive people who are on the edge over the edge. It is as simple as that. The statistics make it clear. I am sure all Deputies are hearing about this on every street corner and in their clinics. People cannot take what the Government is planning to impose on them. There is no justification for it. The Labour Party knows there are alternatives. Fine Gael does not believe there are alternatives. The idea of imposing higher taxes on the rich is anathema to Fine Gael Deputies because they represent that section of society. The Labour Party Deputies do not represent it, however. They know there is a just alternative to this budget. It would require the imposition of modest increases in income tax on those earning over €100,000. It would eliminate the need to impose these measures on the poorest people in our society. I assure the Deputies in question that the people who voted for them will never forgive them for this breach of trust. They must know it. We are getting it all over the place. The leader of the Labour Party, who cannot be pinned on many things, was pinned on one thing three days before last year's general election. He said solemnly that the Labour Party would not participate in a Government that would cut child benefit, but he has breached that line. He has crossed the Rubicon. That is a betrayal for which he will not be forgiven. I remind the House of the price Fine Gael paid for its attempt to impose VAT on shoes. I would like to put a political point to the Labour Party. If there is one thing that could rehabilitate the fortunes of Fianna Fáil, which destroyed this country's economy and plunged us into this crisis, it is what the Labour Party is doing tonight. Those who represent the Labour Party in this House could be responsible for the return to power of Fianna Fáil when this Government is swept out of office, which is going to happen sooner or later as a result of what is going on. That would be a terrible testimony to the betrayal they are engaging in now. I appeal to the comrades of the Labour Party not to do this. I urge them to stand with the people who voted for them by defending working people, the vulnerable, the families of people with disabilities and the unemployed. I plead with them not to do this to the ordinary people who are the innocent victims of this crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have tabled amendments.
