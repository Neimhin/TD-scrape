RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Harkin for bringing forward this Bill, which we are very happy to support. When the for-profit banking system drove this economy over a cliff, along with its developer friends, the Government moved heaven and earth to prop it up.Emergency legislation was flowing like confetti. It involved late-night sittings, huge urgency and €60 billion to keep them going. As for how they thank us, Ulster Bank, although not a beneficiary of the bailout, it got bailed out elsewhere, is upping and leaving, and the other banks, the pillar banks, are shutting down branches left, right and centre. We have the highest interest rates in Europe. There is a general disregard for the public, for any social objectives and for any objective other than the bottom line as far as they are concerned, and yet we did everything to sustain them, as previously we had done everything essentially to facilitate their racing greed with the dire consequences that had. In contrast, there is a lack of urgency in terms of supporting credit unions and their members. Credit unions have completely different, absolutely benign objectives to serve their members. They are not about profit and instead are about trying to achieve social and community goals. They are the model of what banking should look like, not for-profit banking. Of course, in my world, we would scale up the model of the credit union to a full-scale publicly and democratically run banking system and remove the for-profit banking system, which in my opinion has failed us. While I doubt the Minister of State would necessarily endorse that socialist aspiration for a fundamentally different type of banking model, the least the Government could do is show the sort of urgency it has shown for the for-profit banking system in terms of supporting the credit union movement. It seems we have had this debate repeatedly for years. Year after year, they have their briefings and ask us to put forward these asks Deputy Harkin has put forward in the Bill to Government. It is always tea and sympathy and lip service but not much in terms of advancing the requests of the credit union movement, namely, understanding that credit unions are fundamentally different, that they have to be treated differently from the for-profit banking system, and that the failure to do so threatens their very viability; that they be allowed increase the level of services they make available to their members; and that we would have, as the Bill proposes, a credit union policy committee that would look after the interests of the credit union movement and ensure Central Bank regulations were not such that they would threaten the viability of credit unions but would fully understand the need to protect the ethos of the credit union movement. As other Deputies have suggested, while I note the Irish League of Credit Unions welcomes the Minister of State's review and is glad that review is happening, moving from the review to advancing the requests the credit union movement is making needs to happen as a matter of urgency. It has been asking for a long time and the Minister should show the same urgency as was shown to the for-profit banking sector. I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, say in terms of one of the asks in this Bill that it would be inappropriate for Ministers to set the reserve ratios for credit unions. As I understand it, the Bill is not saying the Minister should set them but rather the Central Bank would have to check in with the Minister in terms of the setting of those ratios, that there would be an opportunity for the credit union movement via the political system to question the imposition of certain regulations, in this case the regulations around ratios, on the credit union sector where the regulatory excess of the Central Bank in imposing on occasion more excessive regulations than it imposes on the rest of the banking sector is threatening and inappropriate for the credit union movement. That is what the movement is saying and the Minister of State's response is inadequate. It is not about saying politicians should set the minimum reserve requirements but that the Central Bank should check in with the political system and there should be an opportunity via the political system for the credit union movement to have its voice heard in these matters. Its voice has not been adequately heard and that is what it is asking for. The importance of the credit union being a fundamentally different animal cannot be overstated. We need a particular type of regulation for the for-profit banking sector because it is out to make profits and, therefore, to put it bluntly, it cannot be trusted. The State needs to keep a close eye on it because its drive for profit leads it to do things which can drive, and have driven, us over a cliff and can have very damaging impacts on society, communities and economies. The difference with the credit unions is they do not have those objectives. That does not mean they do not need any regulation at all, but fundamentally they are about trying to contribute to the well-being of society. It is a fundamentally different thing they are trying to do and it is inappropriate to impose on them the same kind of regulatory regime as is imposed on the for-profit banking system, particularly where it is excessive and threatens credit unions' very viability and gives them less entitlements than the for-profit banking sector to provide services for their members. I strongly appeal to the Minister of State to support and progress this Bill. If there are particular technical or specific issues in the Bill he wants to amend on the next Stage, nobody would object to having a serious debate about that. The credit union movement is a responsible movement. It is a socially and economically responsible movement. I am sure it is happy to engage with the Government but let us move the Bill on and ensure we protect and develop the sector and give it the support it deserves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume we will get the same amount of time as the two previous speakers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should be shared out fairly. I was going to raise the issue of the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021, which the Taoiseach mentioned, but for the week that is in it, I will raise an issue regarding forestry, which I assume this Cabinet committee also deals with because the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the various other Departments that deal with forestry are also under its remit. As I understand it, the division that deals with fisheries and ports also deals with forestry. I will ask the Taoiseach about that. I put it to the Taoiseach that, this week, the week of the Conference of the Parties, COP26, the Government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth on the issue of forestry. I was shocked to see the forestry dashboard figures. To be honest, I was not shocked because the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has made this point. While we are talking about protecting the forest estate, in reality, five to ten times more trees are being cut down than are being planted every year. Five to ten times more felling licences are being issued than afforestation licences. This is happening year after year so there is net deforestation while we hear high-flown speeches in Glasgow about protecting the forest estate and expanding it to deal with climate change. That is hypocrisy. If we are seeing net deforestation, that is a serious problem.  I must raise something that was brought to my attention in this regard this week. I refer to Coillte selling off forests. I am holding an advertisement for 37 acres of forest Coillte is selling off in Enniskerry, on the Wicklow-Dublin border. Does the Government know about this? Does it think it is okay? There is a right of way through this forest, which is a public amenity forest. There are bronze age cooking pits in it. It is of great geological significance and Coillte is flogging it off. We fought, and I organised demonstrations, back in 2013 to stop the plan to sell off harvesting rights for the entire Coillte forest estate. We got commitments at the time that the forests would not be privatised. I have put in parliamentary questions on this and I contacted Coillte this week, although I have not got a response. That is absolutely shocking. Will the Taoiseach look into that? Does Coillte have to ask the Government for permission to flog off public forest? It certainly should have to. It is being advertised for €250,000, by the way. That is 36 acres of forest for €250,000. That stinks, apart from anything else. We have to do a hell of a lot better than we are doing on forestry. We are getting net deforestation and the State forestry company, which is entrusted with being the steward of the public forest estate, is flogging off public forestry. That is utterly unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May we have two minutes extra for this grouping to allow the Taoiseach to answer our questions? We kept within time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We kept within our time. Could we even have a minute and a half?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two minutes, yes. We need it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I need an answer as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a copy of the advertisement to sell off forests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not your slot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any talk of economic recovery is rendered meaningless if the cost of living skyrockets, as it is doing for ordinary working people. The amount of tax relief the Government gave them in the budget was miserable for the average worker, against a background of an increase of between €500 and €1,000 in energy costs for many households, disproportionately hitting the less well off. Moreover, waste charge bills are increasing, private operators are profit-gouging, the price of TV packages is increasing, carbon tax, of course, is loaded on top of that, and rents continue to rise. What is the Taoiseach going to do? Profits have gone through the roof in this country during this country, exponentially increasing, but the benefit of any recovery is wiped away by inflation and profit-gouging by State actors and private actors through taxes or price increases. What is the Taoiseach going to do? Does it not justify what we have for a long time called for, namely, actual controls on rents; abandoning plans to increase carbon tax and doing something to reduce energy prices; and controlling or even abolishing charges such as property tax, or at least ensuring people are not hit with it, and waste charge increases by private companies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on a second.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all have questions tabled, and some people should not get more time than others.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on. That is just not on. On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have equal entitlement to that time allocation-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and normally there is a one-and-a-half-minute or a one-minute restriction on the questions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----so everyone gets to ask a question and the Taoiseach gets time to reply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is your people speaking longer than everyone else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So am I.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not. That is rubbish.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a lifelong opponent of antisemitism. More than a decade ago, I brought an Auschwitz survivor to this city, organised meetings and got her on "The Late Late Show" to remind people of the horrors of the Holocaust, and I would do it again. We should always remind people of how horrendous the Holocaust was. The point we were making is that Israel consistently equates criticism of the apartheid policies it practises against the Palestinians with antisemitism. It promotes a definition of antisemitism that includes labelling those who criticise the apartheid structure of the state as antisemites, and it threatens ten-year prison sentences on those who support the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign. That, by the way, would include Desmond Tutu or Nelson Mandela, if he were still alive, who called for the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign. Under that definition, they would be antisemites. That must be roundly rejected and we need to be clear that while condemning, as we must, antisemitism, it should never slide into giving some sort of absolution to the Israeli state, which is an apartheid state. On the issue of the hunger strikers, which I also raised before the European Council meeting, the Minister of State said this issue was not on the meeting agenda, but the point is we asked the Taoiseach to raise the issue of the hunger strikers. If you look at the photographs of Miqdad al-Qawasmi, it is horrendous.This man is on the brink of death as a result of his hunger strike over the horrendous system of administrative detention, as are many other hunger strikers. There is also the designation as terrorist organisations of six organisations that have a long history of standing up for human rights, protecting the rights of children in administrative detentions and organising women's committees, agricultural committees and so on. They have been designated as terrorist organisations. When are we going to move beyond words and take action? I ask the Minister of State to please not say we have opponents on the UN Security Council. We know that but, given that is the case, what are we going to do? Are we just going to be paralysed by that? Will there ever be sanctions against Israel for its routine, systematic and brutal denial of civil and human rights?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not sure if Deputy Barry is coming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record, it is People Before Profit-Solidarity by the way. I have just come from the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which was an unfortunate clash so I missed the Minister's introduction. I heard some but not all of it and I apologise for that. At the meeting, Professor Niamh Maloney discussed the consultation process the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will have. It was an interesting contrast in that the group is trying to step back from the taxation system and obtain a strategic view of what we are trying to achieve in the taxation and welfare systems, and to get wider public opinion on big questions about the purpose and strategic direction of our tax system. This is a welcome development because all too often - this is not necessarily a criticism - finance Bills contain many bitty parts, and the Bills can be large and quite technical which makes it difficult, and one does not understand how it all knits together into an overall strategic direction for taxation. The contents of a budget can often be the result of a reaction, understandably, to individual pressures at a given time rather than being considered in an overall strategic context. I wanted to start with that point because it seems to me that we never consider that. In the week when the Conference of the Parties, COP, has been discussed more than ever before, we must do this. The discussion on the climate emergency, and the radical measures we need to introduce to address it, give added weight to arguments we have made on the left for many years about wealth and income redistribution, in regard to the concentration of wealth controlled by corporations and a relatively small number of billionaires who control those corporations, and wealthy people who tend to control a disproportionate amount of wealth and income in this society and societies throughout the world. In the context of climate change, we must ask the question whether it is possible to address the climate emergency if we do not do something about the grossly unequal distribution of wealth in our society. The answer is that there is no chance at all of doing that. We need to think about that from a strategic point of view. It is apparent when one considers carbon tax and some of the measures in the budget, from the reaction of those who are less well-off, how people perceive these measures. They view climate action as an economic and financial threat to them. They are right insofar as even the Economic and Social Research Institute has stated that measures, such as carbon taxes, are regressive. The Minister might respond by saying he has taken countermeasures to obviate that, but it is a fact that people who are less well-off perceive climate measures like carbon tax - and rightly so at present - as a threat. They should not, and we will lose the battle if that is the case. When one considers the massive investment we need to make the transition to address the climate crisis, who has the wealth and resources to do it? We know the answer from the figures on the concentration of wealth in the world that are repeated year after year and become more obscene and staggering, in the hands of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Elon Musk. I could go through the list of these spectacularly wealthy individuals who have staggering amounts of profit that grows and, indeed, grew during the Covid pandemic. It also includes the fossil fuel companies etc. When we consider data centres we think of Jeff Bezos and other people. I used to think the cloud was something in the sky but now I know it is in a warehouse on the Naas Road that is pumping out huge amounts of CO2 emissions to make money for Jeff Bezos. These people are doing things that are destroying the environment. They control massive amounts of wealth. Governments are frightened of them in that they dare not impose extra taxes on them in case they run away. Those actions are a problem in addressing climate action and we are afraid even to think about taking some of their profit off them in order to get the funds to make investments in the areas needed to address climate change. That is a problem for us. One can go through the list of big industries and corporations - the fossil fuel companies being another obvious example - that have no interest in addressing the climate crisis. If we do not wrest some of that money from them, we will not have the resources to make the massive upfront investment needed in public transport, in the development of renewable energy, in the massive retrofit programme in housing - I will not exhaust the list - in forestry and biodiversity measures to address the crisis, because they control all that wealth. I always found the inequality in wealth distribution was obscene and gross, but it seems to me now that we cannot talk about addressing the climate emergency unless we talk about the redistribution of wealth. That is where the micro measures come into view. I refer to the examples used by the Minister in his Budget 2022: Tax Policy Changes report. He said that most people would be better off as a result of the budget. However, he explained in the budget booklet, and based on his comments on inflation, how that is not true. He rightly pointed to the fact that inflation will be at 3.7%, and possible higher. Let us consider the examples provided, which I went through in a speech after the budget. The Minister gave the example of Roan and Nicole as a case study, who will receive universal social charge, USC, changes that will amount to 0.45% of their net income. They will receive €165 a year from the USC changes the Minister introduced. This is a couple who receive €40,000, which is about an average income. Another example was given of Mairéad who has an income of €30,000. I picked these two examples because they are median to average industrial wage earnings. Mairéad will receive an increase of 0.5%, which equates to €115 over the course of a year. Half of a percentage increase as a result of budget changes against an inflation rate of 3.7%, which the Minister highlighted, does not mean these people will be better off. It means they will be worse off. Let us consider energy costs. Even before the carbon tax, there were several energy-price hikes. Bin charges have also increased. Not only are the benefits wiped out, but I argue there will be a net loss in income. In addition, the cost of rent continues to rise. Therefore, people will actually lose out. On the other side, we know corporate profits of the people I referred to earlier - this is where it relates to the big picture - increased dramatically this year and have consistently done so for the last ten years. In our budget submission, we set out a table which detailed that 2012 corporate profits amounted to €74 billion. In 2020, profits amounted to €203 billion, which is extraordinary. That equates to a 127% increase in profits in less than a decade's time. How much do corporations, which include the Besozes, the Gates, and the Microsofts of the world, pay in tax? In 2020, they paid €11 billion while generating €203 billion. Let us contrast that with pay-as-you-earn, PAYE, workers and self-employed people.How much did they earn in 2020? They earned €130 billion. These figures should be borne in mind. Corporations took in €203 billion last year and paid €11 billion in tax. Some 2 million or more workers earned €130 billion between them. How much tax did they pay? They paid €27 billion. That is more than twice what the corporations paid in absolute terms having earned a little bit more than a half of the corporations' income between them. That is extraordinary. It is not a slogan to say the rich are getting richer and the poor and the workers are getting poorer. Looking at those figures proves it is a fact. They are absolutely stunning figures. With this Bill, we are looking at some more tax reliefs for them but workers will get less than nothing when inflation is taken into account. That accumulation of wealth by the rich is borne out again in Central Bank figures. I now love it when the Central Bank's quarterly reports come out because they show the accumulation of wealth in this country which, again, is absolutely extraordinary. The net worth of households in this country is now at a record high of €883 billion. That is up €89 billion in one year, the year of Covid. Do the vast majority of workers out there feel they have seen a massive increase in their household wealth? They do not because it has not happened. However, the Central Bank does not lie. Some have seen a massive increase in their wealth. The Minister's own Department showed the distribution of wealth a few years ago. It should do that more often. The top 10% held 53% of that wealth while the bottom 50% have less than 2%. We know who got a massive increase in wealth last year. It was the top 10%. That is absolutely extraordinary. The top 5%, some 85,000 households, are worth an average of €3 million each when the figures are broken down. Between them, they have €331 billion. It is so mind-boggling that people cannot believe it but it is a fact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Central Bank reports do not lie. This is from the Central Bank quarterly report at the beginning of this year so Deputy Durkan can say what he likes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here is a more down-to-earth example. What does the Finance Bill not do? It does not get rid of the special assignee relief programme, SARP. There are still not enough people who know about this. It is really a shocker. I genuinely thank the Minister for giving me the figures and details on it. He sent a paper out on it recently. I do not know what the figure was last year, but the year before that the cost of the special assignee relief programme, a tax relief only available to people who earn more than €70,000 a year, was €42 million. This can be claimed on earnings up to €1 million a year but, even if claimants earn more than that, they still get it. The Minister's figures helpfully show that, for example, 50 people who earn more than €1 million are benefiting from this tax relief. Imagine a tax relief that is only given to those earning the highest incomes, incomes of more than €70,000, 50 of whom earn more than €1 million and a handful of whom earn more than €3 million in a year who get a tax break which includes credits to send their kids to private schools. Come on, that is totally unjustifiable. Yet, we continue it. We have to start to talk about the redistribution of wealth. We should do this on the grounds of equity, fairness and justice but also in the context of the climate emergency. If we are to learn anything from the Covid emergency, another existential thing that has happened to us in the last year, it is that if we are going to build the capacity we need in our health service and if we are going to have properly ventilated classrooms in schools that are not overcrowded, we are going to need massive investment in all of these key areas of infrastructure and services way beyond what is currently being invested in them or even envisaged in the national development plan. It simply will not happen unless we start to redistribute some of the enormous accumulation of wealth and profits at the top and close down the extraordinary number of loopholes that exist, including SARP for the top executives and the really big loopholes in the area of corporation tax relating to such areas as capital allowances, intragroup transactions, amalgamations and reconstructions, capital allowances brought forward, research and development tax credits, group relief and the knowledge development box. According to the Revenue figures, the tax reliefs that I have mentioned alone cost €17 billion last year. That is a cost of €17 billion to the Exchequer. That is how Revenue described it. Imagine if the corporations had not got all that and we had €17 billion to put into education, health, housing and so on. It would make a big difference. On some specific things that are mentioned in the Finance Bill, I have said why the USC ceiling changes are absolutely miserable and derisory against that background. I do not think the help-to-buy scheme should have been kept in. It is just chasing a market that is out of control. The Minister will say it is helping people to buy but it is helping them to buy houses at grossly inflated prices rather than dealing with the problem of prices that are out of control. It is actually contributing to price rises. The Minister mentioned the residential zoned lands tax. One of the things that rightly drives people crazy about the housing crisis is the amount of empty property that is sitting around doing nothing. This does not apply to such property. Habitable property is not taxed under this measure at all. Only zoned land is. The rate is only 3%, which is lower than the rate of the vacant site tax, which was 7%. I think it is to cover a wider group of people but that is not a disincentive when you look at the capital appreciation of zoned property that developers can sit on, which is racing ahead. It will not be a disincentive to land hoarding or speculation and it does not cover the issue that really drives people mad, namely, the empty properties sitting around our towns and villages all over the place. We need punitive vacant property taxes. Regarding the 10% rate of residential stamp duty the Minister has made a change whereby if companies buy more than ten units but agree to lease them within a two-year period, the 10% rate will not be slapped on them. That is another let-off. These vulture funds, cuckoo funds or whatever can buy up an estate, see if they can flog it off at the price that will make them the most profit and, if they cannot manage that, they can knock on the door of the local authority two years later and ask it to lease the properties off them. They will then get a backdated reduction in stamp duty. That is crazy and fairly criminal. With regard to the extension of the bank levy, it should be extended but why are Ulster Bank and KBC getting off the hook? Is it because a lot of their business is to be transferred to the pillar banks? Is it actually AIB, Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland that are to get off the hook? Either way, it is a dramatic reduction in the amount of money we are getting from the bank levy when it will be the same customers and business. Two banks have decided to pull out but the business will be the same and less of a levy is going to be imposed on the banking sector. There are many other things I wanted to ask. I will ask about section 481, which the Minister has mentioned. Despite the changes, which I welcome, that he has brought in on foot of representations that were made to him and issues I brought to him, film producer companies who are getting section 481 relief went to the Workplace Relations Commissions, WRC, last week and said that those who worked on their film productions are not their employees and that they have no responsibility to them. They are doing so regularly, every week. They are still doing this. I wish somebody from the Department or Revenue or somebody else would go to the WRC and say that these companies got section 481 relief, that they are the employer, that they are responsible for these people and that they must stop denying that they are. That is what is happening and something has to be done about it. Now there is going to be a similar relief for the gaming sector and so on. I am for encouraging the gaming sector and the employment that will come from that, but it has to be tied to strict conditions regarding proper employment rather than what is going on in the film industry. Perhaps the Minister can explain the change to section 481 relief in respect of labour-only services. I am a bit worried about that and I do not know what it means. Perhaps the Minister will explain where that came from, who lobbied for it and what precisely it means. I hope it does not refer to people who are not directly employed but instead are sort of contractors, which is what producers are trying to do. They do not want to take responsibility for employees directly so that they can then write that off as eligible expenditure. There should be nothing, although maybe this is not the case, that incentivises bogus self-employment or not employing people directly in the film industry.
