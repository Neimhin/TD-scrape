RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the context of the questions posed by Deputy Higgins, I will be interested in hearing the Taoiseach's comments on workers and service users.  Will the proposals regarding reform of the process relating to appointments to State boards extend to dealing with the outrageous salaries paid to executives on such boards?  These individuals are being paid hundreds of thousands of euro at a time when workers are being asked to take savage pay cuts.In addition to the reform of the appointments process, will there be a greater level of accountability to the public and to this House with regard to the policies pursued by and activities of the executives and boards of State companies?  Many of these individuals appear to be a law unto themselves and are able to do whatever they like.  We do not seem to be able to obtain accurate information on their actions and the policies they pursue, and we are not in a position to influence those actions and policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the salaries paid?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only the socialists called it right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has rightly and justifiably criticised the previous Government for its policy failures and actions which contributed to the property bubble and crash, the banking crisis and so on.  However, while the Government may be able to excuse itself from what the previous Government did, it is signing up to a pact which will be as destructive of our democratic right to control our economic policy as the IMF-EU package.  The pact, essentially, hands over control of economic policy in this and every country in the European Union to the European Commission and gives it power to decide on an annual basis what it calls "country specific" policies through which it will set out in key areas of economic policy what we must do.  We will have to do what is proposed and the Commission will impose penalties on us if we do not.  Is this not a handing over on a permanent — not just a temporary — basis of control of key economic issues?  Is it not amazing that we are doing this in a situation where the general outline of the economic priorities set out in the euro pact perpetuates the same failed economic doctrine that led to the financial crisis in Europe — a constant obsession with what Mr. Nyberg rightly called in his report the "naive belief in the efficiency of markets"?   It is still all about us being forced to accept the efficiency of markets model to dictate what happens to the economy, which means austerity, cutbacks and privatisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I supported the revolution that led to the overthrow of the dictatorships in eastern Europe and support the democratic revolutions in the Arab world.  It is precisely because of my commitment to democracy that I am worried about the pact for the euro, on which the Minister has not responded.  This is not about his view of my ideological position but about whether there is a recognition on his part or on that of the European Union of the key responsibility for a particular economic philosophy that let the banks to run riot and cause the economic crisis.  It is not me who is saying this but Mr. Nyberg who said the financial crisis resulted substantially from the naive belief in the efficiency of markets.  Why are we signing up to a pact that will lock in and copperfasten the naive belief in the efficiency of markets to the economic perspective of the European Union and which will force us, regardless of what the Government or the people think, to subscribe to that doctrine, particularly given its role in causing the financial crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was competitiveness not responsible for the banking crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People's wages.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to press the Taoiseach on whether there will be a debate——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has a debate been promised on the health service, given the long overdue decision of the Minister to get rid of the HSE board which has made such a mess of the health service?  Following that decision and the news a few days later that waiting lists were increasing again, will there be a debate on the escalating crisis in the health service?
