RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind the Taoiseach and his Government about commitments they made to people with disabilities in the programme for Government because he seems to have forgotten about them. The Government said it would improve services, increase supports for people with disabilities, remove barriers to access and provide greater independence in accessing services they choose and place them in a stronger position to tailor supports to meet their needs and plan their lives. Last week, I asked about the utterly disgraceful decision of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, which is funded by the HSE, to close down the NCBI office that provides supports to the blind and visually impaired in the entire DÃºn Laoghaire area, as far down as east Wicklow and up to Ringsend. I got something that looked like assurances from the HSE, although they were slightly ambiguous, that there would be a review and nothing would happen until the review had taken place then, lo and behold, staff were let go this week. The staff, as the visually impaired and blind community will say, are the service. They are distraught that the local office is being closed. People who are elderly and find it difficult to travel are being told they have to go to Tallaght to access services. It is utterly disgraceful. I got a letter from the Minister with-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach was reported as having made at the weekend what I consider to be extremely alarming comments on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Frankly, they confirm some of the worst fears of Solidarity-People Before Profit about assurances the Taoiseach, Mr. Michel Barnier and the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, have given on the issue of the Border. The Taoiseach was reported as having said:I think in a no-deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border. As Ireland [is] remaining part of the European Union, we would no doubt be required to implement European law...If there is no deal, it sounds to me as if the Taoiseach is saying the European Union will require us to impose a hard border to protect the Single Market and that he is willing to do so. If that is not the case, I would like clarification on the matter. If it is the case, it is a very significant development. I have always feared that it is the case and sought multiple assurances that in the event that there is no deal, we will simply tell the European Union and Britain that we will not be co-operating in any way in the installation of a hard border. I would go further. If the Taoiseach believes this is a real possibility, he should be arguing that if that is the threat, there should be a Border poll, North and South, to give people the opportunity to make a decision democratically on whether that is what they want. I am interested in hearing the Taoiseach's response to that question. It will have a considerable bearing on the outcome of the vote that will be taken on the motion we will discuss tonight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach stated that it was agreed that under no circumstances would there be a hard border. If that is his view, he did not say how he could have been reported as saying that in a no-deal scenario, it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border.As Ireland is remaining part of the European Union, we would no doubt be required to implement European law. Will the Taoiseach clarify that statement? He continually says that we are doing everything not to impose a hard border, but in his statement he appeared to imply that there are circumstances - a no Brexit deal - in which he would have to impose a hard border because the EU would require him to do so. This deserves clarification. News has just broken in Belfast that Bombardier is to cut its workforce by 500, which is a pretty devastating blow for the area. We might have been able to assist by buying from Bombardier desperately needed buses for the Dublin Bus fleet, which is way below what it should be. That aside, did the Taoiseach suggest to Mrs. Arlene Foster that she would be better off worrying about the potential economic damage to people in the North if such a border were to be erected and that she is playing a dangerous game in the politics she is engaging in around this issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should not have said what he said, then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not forget People Before Profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. To clarify, do we need to move our amendment now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but I may speak to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As socialists and internationalists, our imperative in the whole Brexit drama is twofold: one, to protect the interests of working people, and two, to oppose any attempt to impose a border, North and South. These two immediate imperatives flow from more general principles we hold which are internationalist in outlook. We think borders divide people, whether they be north-south, east-west or around fortress Europe. We do not like borders because they divide people, set them against one another and encourage them to see themselves in competition with one another. Workers always lose in this. This is our guiding principle and it is the logic behind the position we will take on the motion. As to the question of the North-South Border, there is no doubt that the Government and the officials have achieved something significant in getting a commitment not to have a hard border, or to avoid a hard border, to be strictly accurate about what is in the document. For this reason we will certainly not oppose the motion. We do not, however, have the same guarantees on the fate of workers in the Brexit drama. I noticed that ICTU came out today in support of the agreement, although its slogan, that workers should not pay the price for Brexit, was a good one. This is an important thought and one that has not been discussed sufficiently throughout the Brexit drama. As Naomi Klein pointed out in respect of the economic collapse, there is a thing these days called disaster capitalism, whereby certain people - big business, primarily, and states - use the opportunities presented by crises to push forward their own agenda, and the losers are working people. We saw this most dramatically with the crash of 2008, a crash that was caused by bankers but paid for by working people with horrendous consequences not just in this country but globally. Our amendment concerning workers aims precisely to trumpet the demand that, whatever else happens in this drama, working people should not suffer nor be asked to pay the bill and that any agreement, or lack thereof, should not be used as a pretext to attack incomes and wages, demand wage restraint or cut public services. This is a very important demand, particularly given, as previous speakers have mentioned, the fatigue that is setting in, with many people listening to talk of backstops, longstops, long backstops and back longstops and wondering when this stuff will end. What they want to know is how it will impact them. What we are setting out in our amendment and our general attitude to this is our determination to fight on behalf of working people to ensure they do not end up paying the price as various, frankly unsavoury, political forces politically manoeuvre for their own narrow agendas.Looking at the leadership of Britain, or the people who have led the narrative on the British exit from the European Union, the threat to worker's rights is obvious. The particular form of exit from the European Union that those people want is that which leads to a bargain-basement Fortress Britain. It will lead to a race to the bottom at every single level in a way that will impact detrimentally on working people in the interests of narrow sections of British capital. It sees Brexit as an opportunity to attack workers' rights and advance its own particular interests. Those people have also very cynically used xenophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment as a mechanism to deflect attention away from their own failings and the disaster they have inflicted on many sections of the British working class. They want to deflect attention away from their responsibility for that and to attack vulnerable people such as immigrants, minorities etc. The danger from those people is pretty obvious. The other danger is not so obvious because the narrative that has dominated in this debate has been that of Tory Brexiteers, the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, and all of those sorts of people. They are bad, so anybody on the other side of the debate must necessarily be good. That, of course, is not necessarily true. I do not buy into the lesser of two evils theory of politics. It is a bad theory of politics. The enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend. When we look at how Europe has similarity treated immigrants, and the thousands of dead drowned in the Mediterranean because of Fortress Europe policies, the idea that Europe is the good guy when it comes to immigration and the treatment of minorities and the vulnerable does not really stack up. Europe is also not the good guy in protecting working people's rights. As we know, when the crash happened in Europe, there was a determination to make working people pay for it to the extent of threatening to let off financial bombs in Dublin if we dared to burn the bondholders. That is what was said. Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, the then President of the European Central Bank, said that a financial bomb would be let off in Dublin. Are these people our allies? I do not think so, not at all. Do I trust them with the best interests of working people? I certainly do not. Do I trust them with the whole question of the increased militarisation of Europe and the advance of a military project focused on a European army? How could we possibly do that when some of the leading figures in Europe are now blatantly talking about wanting to move towards a European army? It is good that the Irish Government, with the support of everyone in this House, has secured a commitment to avoid a hard border. Do I trust either of our interlocutors in this to guarantee that? I absolutely do not. I thought it was telling in that regard that at the weekend the Taoiseach said, "I think in a no-deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border because of the obvious fact that, Ireland remaining part of the European Union, would no doubt be asked to implement European Union law". That is a very alarming comment. I made this point when this whole debate started and I have made it successively since. There is a real danger this deal will not be agreed, no matter what happens in the DÃ¡il tonight. It will go through the DÃ¡il and we will not oppose it. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, however, or this deal not going through or a situation where it unravels and does not succeed, there may be a hard Brexit. If that is the case, what the Taoiseach is saying is that pressure is going to come on from Europe to secure the Single Market and that its priority is going to be the market over averting a hard border. That is the unmistakable logic of those words.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the TÃ¡naiste stating that quote is not accurate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the people out there listening, I will read it. "I think in a no-deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border because of the obvious fact that, Ireland remaining part of the European Union, would no doubt be asked to implement European Union law". That sounds clear to me. Pressure will come on to protect the integrity of the market and, therefore, the issue of averting a hard border could also come under pressure. It is in that context that our second amendment has been put forward stating that the Irish Government should seek a Border poll, to happen simultaneously North and South, if there is any inkling that a hard border might be established. That is on basic democratic grounds. If there is a possibility of a hard border, with pressure from Britain or Europe, then on basic democratic grounds, people North and South should have the right to have a say on whether they want or are willing to accept that. That is a simple thing we should say. To be honest, it is also a warning shot to Europe that if any pressure comes on us we will have to do that. It is also the case that the logic of all of this crisis and drama is to state that a border does not make sense. This is the time to advance an argument about the benefits of a united Ireland. The 500 redundancies in Bombardier in Belfast this week gave a sense of how we could begin to advance that argument. I refer to the common interests of working people and uniting in their common interests on the basis that they are workers. I refer to opposing a Border, having unity and breaking from the green-orange tribal politics which has divided and weakened working people. It has resulted in a rotten little statelet up in the North which has done little for working people. This is an argument that can gain an echo not just among people who see themselves as nationalists but also among working-class Protestants. That is the logic behind our two amendments. I will conclude by saying that while we are not going to oppose this motion, neither can we vote for the agreement. I will explain why. It is precisely because I am an internationalist. The agreement makes reference, for example, to the need for Britain and the European Union to continue their commitment on the EU-Turkey deal. That deal is an absolutely rotten Fortress Europe anti-immigrant deal. It is a deal with a rotten and brutal regime that has no respect for human rights in Turkey. We have essentially used Turkey by paying it to be a buffer against desperate Syrians trying to flee from the horrendous situation in Syria. I refer to trying to keep them out of the European Union. The need to maintain that commitment is referred to in the agreement. I could not possibly support that in an active way. I am not going to oppose the deal because it has a commitment on the Border issue but neither am I going to endorse it. I am also not going to endorse references to EU policies on state aid. They are a real problem. I disagree with Deputy Howlin on this. EU state aid rules are a problem for us in being able to invest in key strategic public enterprises without having to be subject to the rules of competition according to the fiscal treaties. They insist on competition when there are key areas of public investment and infrastructure that do not need competition. The last thing needed is competition. What is needed is public investment in key services and infrastructure. That is our position. We should hold fast to having no Border North and South and insist that working people should not pay the price for whatever resolution finally emerges from the Brexit drama.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:To insert the following after âan integral part of the Draft Agreementâ:ââ declares that the Brexit crisis must not be used as a pretext by employers or the Government to enforce wage restraint, reduce income of workers or cut public services; andâ commits to seeking an agreement with the British Government to hold a simultaneous border poll on partition, North and South, to protect against any possibility of a hard border.â
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been much discussion on section 481 both on Committee and now on Report Stage. We focused on those topics last night.Specifically, we discussed the economic benefits of section 481 in terms of jobs, social impacts and so on, but I would like to hear more from the Minister about the rationale for the regional uplift measure that he has proposed. Do not get me wrong - we need to stimulate, promote and encourage film making in the regions and in areas beyond where it is currently taking place. As Deputy Michael McGrath's amendment implies, though, there may be a difficulty, in that the measure is encouraging film production and film investment to go to particular places, possibly at the expense of other places that would equally like to develop a film industry or where a film industry already exists. Could this underpin the decline and demise of Ardmore Studios in Bray? The Government made a terrible decision in selling its share to the people who own Troy Studios and who now have a serious conflict of interest between their ambitions for Troy Studios and the fact that they also have Ardmore Studios. The latter is potentially prime real estate and there have been attempts to rezone it. Whoever gets it rezoned will make an absolute fortune. There may be a material interest for the owners of Ardmore Studios and Troy Studios in redirecting investment and production to the latter at the expense of the former. I do not raise this as a parochial matter, as I would argue that the local concerns about employment and the tradition of Ardmore as effectively the national studio are also national issues. The bigger questions are whether this could happen and would it be desirable? It would be desirable for some, but not for the development of the film industry as a whole. We should stimulate the development of film production in places other than where it is currently being done. It might be of interest to the Minister to note something in this regard. I attended one of the pre-screenings of "Black 47", the director of which said something interesting when speaking about the production. He basically said that the film did not really work out quite as he had wanted, as the production did not have sufficient investment. Interestingly, it could not afford to go to Mayo to film parts of "Black 47" as desired. A digital landscape had to be used for part of the film. I do not know whether people have seen it. Do not get me wrong - it was a great effort by the writer and director to do what they had to with limited resources, but the director said that, for the lack of â¬50,000, the production could not go to Mayo. This film about the Famine, which is a seminal moment in Irish history, was made on a shoestring. I will not go into the other issues that arose on the employment front, but many of them also revolved around a lack of investment and so on. To cut a long story short, if we want to develop the Cork film industry, a film industry in Connemara and a film industry in Limerick while maintaining the industry in places like Ardmore and Dublin, and given the suggestion made by some film workers in my area that we should build a film studio in the old terminal building on DÃºn Laoghaire pier - it is not a bad idea, as the terminal is almost ready made for it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, there has also been talk of building a new film studio-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not to be parochial about matters, but there has been talk of building-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----a film studio on the Poolbeg Peninsula. To my mind, all these options would be good, but what would not be good would be us robbing Peter to pay Paul, with one area benefitting and others losing out. Given that we have such a pool of talent at every level in this industry and the associated sectors, we should start looking at this matter in the way we look at theatre. The Abbey Theatre's existence is not an ad hoc one based on tax reliefs, where it gets reliefs if it happens to put on a good production but otherwise disappears. Instead, we say that we want a national theatre as well as theatres in Cork, Galway, DÃºn Laoghaire, Limerick and so on. I do not know why we would not build studio capacity and a standing workforce that is trained and specialist in the various areas of film production in a few locations around the country. If we created that capacity, we would get much more State and external investment, allowing us to produce more and better films in a way that benefitted everyone. It might also end some of the scrapping that is going on in the background in the industry. I would like to hear from the Minister whether he accepts that there is a concern about this measure inadvertently favouring just one or two locations, most likely Troy Studios, at the expense of everywhere else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment. It could be called the let-us-tax-the-leprechaun amendment given this window was opened after the double Irish arrangement was closed down because of political pressure. This window was the mechanism through which the companies that had availed of the arrangement then moved into a new tax avoidance mechanism which seemed to be designed for them. It is a scandal. The consequence of that was a massive onshoring of intangible assets that spiked Irish economic growth rates to the levels where we became the laughing stock of the entire world and gained the name leprechaun economics. It is not glib to say the leprechaun should be taxed because we are talking about hundreds of millions of euros from these companies which are making staggering profits and even granting an 80% relief on these intangibles is extraordinarily generous to these companies. The intangibility of assets is precisely the means through which these large multinational corporations can essentially put whatever price they like on their intellectual property and move it from one arm of their company to another, with one arm charging for the use of that asset, or paying for that asset or the royalties on the use of that asset, and, through that mechanism, they can essentially write their own tax bill. To give those companies 100% relief was extraordinary and inexplicable. I believe it was explained by several high level meetings that took place that year between Ministers and executives of a certain company, called Apple, after it was obvious that the double Irish had to close down and there were moves which were going to lead to it being closed down. I cannot explain it any other way and particularly when we then discovered afterwards that officials were saying this should not be done, but it was done anyway. The minimum we could ask is for a report on why we should not do this. It is not just the left saying that. The fact that Mr. Seamus Coffey recommended this suggests that it is not an ideological demand. It is a reasonable demand to close a window that should not have been opened to allow extraordinarily profitable companies avoid vast amounts of tax. At the end of the day, we lose out. Those revenues would make a substantial difference in housing or health. We also lost out, and are losing out, because we have to pay larger contributions to the European Union because of artificially inflated growth rates. I do not have the figures in front of me, but I think we are talking about a couple of hundred million euros worth of additional contributions to the EU based on the size of our GDP, which is inflated because of the tax avoidance mechanisms being used by these companies.
