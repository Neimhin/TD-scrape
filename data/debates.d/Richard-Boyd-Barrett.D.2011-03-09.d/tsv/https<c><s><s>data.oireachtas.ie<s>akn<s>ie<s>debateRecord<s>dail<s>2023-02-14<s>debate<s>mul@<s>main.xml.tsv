RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In one of the richest countries in the world we now have tens of thousands - if not hundreds of thousands - of people dependent on food banks for food.Hundreds of thousands of people are now in arrears with their energy and utility bills. Some 12,000 people are officially homeless in emergency accommodation, but actually the numbers are multiples of that. I believe the Government's economic subcommittee is meeting this Thursday to discuss possible measures to address all of this. I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government has been fiddling around the edges and has been totally ineffective in preventing the cruel hardship and the drive into poverty and homelessness for tens of thousands of people. We need dramatic emergency measures to address the cost-of-living housing crisis, such as increasing pensions, welfare and wages at least to the level of inflation,-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----introducing rent controls and, crucially, stopping evictions into homelessness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are they going to food banks if they are all doing so well?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to the people going to food banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Israel is involved in a brazenly naked illegal occupation of Palestinian land and territory. This week, its cabinet authorised further illegal settlements on land that, under international law, is designated for the Palestinians. In the first month of this year, 50 Palestinians died in what was the deadliest month we have seen in decades, with the Israeli army running constant military raids into Palestinian territory, as they did last year. International human rights organisations have said, categorically, that the entire apparatus of the Israeli state has been operating on an apartheid basis against Palestinians since its foundation. Will the Taoiseach explain why the EU and our Government does nothing about this? Will he explain to me, to the world and to the Palestinians why the EU says that any and all means must be used to support the Ukrainian people in their fight against the illegal occupation of their country, but not a thing is done to support the Palestinians in their fight against the illegal occupation of their land and territory, the crushing of their right to self-determination, the apartheid system that is obnoxious to international law and to human rights and the 17-year-long siege of Gaza? The murder, oppression and persecution goes on and nothing is done. No sanctions are imposed. Will the Taoiseach explain the double standards?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Israel does not recognise Palestinian elections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Palestinians in Jerusalem do not get to vote at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For a very long time, some of us campaigned for the Government to introduce a policy of using public money to buy the homes of people threatened with eviction. Very slowly, and not very consistently, the Government has started to do that. It is not doing enough. A cohort of people is not getting any benefit from this, namely, those who happen to be over the social housing income thresholds.This is because the Government will not sanction the purchase of homes if these people are not on the social housing list. These people are not entitled to HAP and, therefore, are in many cases in a worse position. I know of a family who are going to court for an enforcement order to evict them from the home in which they have lived all their lives. They have written to the Taoiseach and the Minister and they believe they will probably be living in their car with their two children by next week. These are working people who have paid their taxes and have always paid their rent. Will the Taoiseach do something about that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The tenant in situ scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can it apply to people over the threshold?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People who are over the threshold are being evicted. They are not entitled to anything.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because it is not a full eviction ban.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that the Minister has taken measures, but it is self-evident that they are not working. We have 600,000 people living on or below the poverty line, hundreds of thousands utilising food banks, hundreds of thousands in arrears with their energy bills from last year, and the highest number of people in emergency accommodation that we have ever seen. The numbers mask the reality of the dire housing crisis we face. The Minister must do a hell of a lot more but the Government seems reluctant to do so. I thank Sinn Féin for giving us the opportunity to put forward alternative proposals to do that. First, while this is not in the Minister's brief, it must be done. It is insanity and cruelty to let anybody else end up homeless in the current situation. The Minister can stop people going into homelessness but the Government is equivocating. Even the moratorium that was introduced is not comprehensive. I have raised a case on multiple occasions in this House, which is demonstrative of the Government's failures at multiple levels. A woman and her husband are going to the District Court this weekend with their two children. He is a working man, who has worked all his life. They have never claimed anything off the State in their lives. They are going to be evicted from the home where they have lived all of their lives on grounds of sale. They paid their taxes and paid their rent. There are two children, one of whom has special needs, but because they are slightly over the income threshold for social housing, they are not entitled to the housing assistance payment. They are not entitled to social housing. When they are made homeless, which is going to happen, there is an open question as to whether they are even entitled to emergency accommodation. They looked on Daft for somewhere to rent. The family is a single-income one, with somebody working for a well-known semi-State company. There are new apartments just completed on the N11 and the rent is €2,700 a month. That is totally unaffordable. The family can afford €1,000. Jackie told me that if they pushed it, but it would really impoverish them, they could perhaps get that up to €1,500. They are not entitled to anything. There is no HAP support. They are absolutely goosed. Again and again, I have asked the Government if it will give HAP payments to people whose incomes are over the threshold and who cannot afford stuff, but nothing was done. I asked if the Government would authorise local authorities to purchase houses in cases where people face eviction and are not on social housing lists because their income is slightly over the threshold, but that has not been done. They are goosed. Jackie believes she will be living in her car at the end of the week. Imagine doing that to working people who have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and so on. They are going to end up homeless. I will cite another case concerning people on illness benefit who are not given the fuel allowance. I mentioned a case to the Minister the other day of a man who cannot turn down the heating because his wife has cancer. They do not get the fuel allowance because they are on illness benefit and they do not get any of the extra payments. Could the Minister please do something about those things?
