RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's response does not fully take into account that there is a need for a radical reconfiguring of the tax system as a whole in order to redistribute wealth because of obscene inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth.That is what is driving people onto the streets and making them so angry about the regressive nature of water charges. Regardless of what the Minister says or how he argues the percentages, those who cannot pay their bills and those who are on the minimum wage cannot see the fairness of the decision to give multiples of what they are being given to people who earn more than €70,000. Given that 20% of children in this country are living in poverty - that is one in five - I do not see how any Government that is making decisions about where benefits might be given back, or concessions might be given out, can say that anybody who earns more than €65,000 deserves anything back, if it is a choice between giving money to such people and giving it to people on the breadline or children in poverty. That comment does not arise out of a sort of vindictiveness against people who are earning over €65,000. I would say that when we sit down to look at scarce resources and decide where relief should be directed, we have to start with the families of the 20% of children who are living in poverty. The first priority of any Minister for Finance in any budget should be to take budgetary measures that put enough income back into the pockets of the parents of those children to lift them out of poverty. Rather than doing that, the Minister is giving €600 or €700 to somebody who is on €65,000, €70,000, €80,000, €90,000 or €100,000. Why does anyone on more than €100,000 need to get anything back? Such people are already on very high incomes. They are not struggling. They will not have difficulty. The Minister might say they are not super-wealthy, and that is okay, but they are not struggling. They are not even on the same planet as a family that does not know whether it will have enough money to feed the kids. I think that is the point being made. It was made by the tens of thousands of people who were out on the streets. There has to be a radical shift towards addressing the despair, intolerable poverty and dire circumstances faced by tens of thousands of families. They cannot understand why any extra burden, such as the water charges, is being imposed on them. They do not understand why the Minister is not using the latitude he has - the relief that is available under the universal social charge or anything else - to help people in this group and help those who are in poverty out of poverty as an absolute first priority. I was looking at the Credit Suisse global wealth report for 2014, which is a real eye-opener. I honestly suggest that the Minister should have a look at it, if he has not already done so. The report estimates that there are 88,000 millionaires in Ireland. Like the Central Bank, Credit Suisse has shown that over the last two years, the total net assets of households in this country increased by 13% to €508 billion. Over 20% of this is owned by the top 1% and over 40% of it is owned by the top 5%. If one examines Credit Suisse's methodology - how it works out these estimates - one will see that it uses a few different models. To a very large extent, it extrapolates its figures on the basis of how income is distributed in each society. It can correlate from that how wealth is accumulated and distributed. Even if this report is not absolutely accurate, it is shocking if it is close to the truth. I do not understand why the Minister cannot hear the voices that are raised in the Dáil or on the streets. I refer to those who are saying we need a redistributive taxation system that prioritises people who are living in poverty. That is really the point. The system should take more tax from the top 5% or 10%, whose income and wealth levels are more than adequate to bear a significantly increased tax burden.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is 30%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Underlying what the Minister said and what we on the left claim is a philosophical difference of opinion translated into tax policy.  I would go further than Deputy Doherty’s proposal.  In our budget submission, we proposed four bands on salaries over €100,000, the first on incomes between €100,000 and €120,000, the second, €120,000 to €140,000, the third, €140,000 to €160,000 and the fourth, all earnings over €160,000.  In replies to parliamentary questions on this proposal, the Department of Finance claimed such a measure would raise €920 million.  That would just about pay for taking people earning up to the average industrial wage out of the USC completely and reduce it for those earning between €35,000 and €70,000.  It would be a serious redistributive measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We proposed 45%, 50%, 55% and 60% respectively.  The Minister claims this removes incentives and would discourage talented or educated emigrants from coming home.  I do not accept this argument.  Much of the time when the Minister answers questions on these rates, he talks about a marginal rate of 50% or more.  It would be more honest to conduct the argument if we talked about the proportion of people’s income paid in tax.  Those on €100,000 and over are paying somewhere between 29% and 33% in tax.  That is according to the tables the Department has supplied me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It also includes USC and PRSI.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just let me finish my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still do not accept those people over €100,000 are struggling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say they are very wealthy.  However, when one gets up to €200,000, we are talking about very wealthy.  I am not saying anyone over €100,000 is superwealthy but they are not struggling.  Those earning the average industrial wage or below it, which comprises the majority of workers, are really struggling, however.  Set against that, if one shifts the tax burden from those earning over €100,000 to provide significant relief for those earning below that figure, can the Minister imagine the incentives for those on low and middle incomes?  We never talk about that.  The argument seems to be that the people over €100,000 must have all these incentives, otherwise they will not come back to the country or work.  What incentive does someone on the minimum wage have?  Where is the incentive for someone sweeping the road?  Where is the incentive for the student nurse?  The argument about incentives never seems to apply to the low-paid workers, those who are struggling.  Instead, they must be there for high-paid earners.  The Minister said many of our graduates have emigrated and will not come back because of tax rates here.  That is not true.The biggest reason they are not coming back is because they cannot afford a house because we have made an absolute mess of housing policy, rather than it being about marginal rates of tax or income tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Similarly, in all our budget submissions in recent years, we have proposed a wealth tax.  I find it indicative of the priorities of this Government and of previous Governments that when they want to take money from low and middle income earners, they go to extraordinarily lengths to bill them or to find out what means they have in order not to give them something.  The most obvious current example is water metering which, to my mind, is an utter waste of money.  Some hundreds of millions of euro are being wasted.  Immense effort has been made to ascertain how much one can charge somebody with a regressive tax.  Similarly, there is very invasive means-testing for a number of social welfare benefits.  The State went to extraordinary lengths to try to establish the value of family homes in order to charge for the local property tax.  All this can be done but what we cannot do is work out how much money the very wealthy have because that is just too difficult.  I do not accept that for one minute.  Just to inform Deputy Walsh, both our wealth tax proposal and Sinn Féin's, although it can speak for itself, exclude the family home.  What we are talking about is a wealth tax on financial and other assets, excluding the family home.  I mentioned it earlier but I would like to see the same sort of drive from this Government, or from any Government, to find out the distribution of the €508 billion net, which is after liabilities are taken out, in household assets in this State, half of which, according to the CSO, are cash or financial assets.  The family home takes up a significant amount of that but half of it is financial.  If the wealth distribution estimates given by Credit Suisse for Ireland are even close to true, they indicate a shocking inequality in the distribution of wealth and, overwhelmingly, that wealth cannot be family homes.  If it is true, as Credit Suisse estimates, that the top 1% have 20% of that €500 billion, or the top 5% have 40% of it, that is €200 billion and 200,000 people accounting for that.  Some 200,000 people have about €200 billion, so even if one takes out their family homes, the majority of that is financial assets or commercial property, which is generating revenue.  That money in financial or other assets is just sitting there and is generating money all the time.  They do not have to do anything with it or lift a finger.  It is in investment funds and so on.  What is the average return on investment funds for people who have several million euro?  I would say that these days, it is 4% or 5% per year.  Could we not put a 2% tax on this?  They would still make money.  They would not lose out on anything.  If one is a millionaire, one's millions are making money all the time.  We would not even be hurting them but would just be taking a little bit of that money, which is just money making money, from them and putting it back into society, into our infrastructure, into redistributing the wealth and into narrowing the gap between rich and poor.   However, whenever one talks about these things it is said it is cloud-cuckoo-land economics, it is all too difficult and that these people will all leave.  These people are obviously not very patriotic in that if they are asked to pay a little bit of extra tax, they will all run away.  There is a thing called capital controls.  Iceland did not implode when it imposed capital controls.  These things can be done if there is a will.  There would certainly be fairness to it.  As Deputy Doherty mentioned, it averages out at approximately €200,000 per person in the State but the majority of people having nothing even approaching that amount.  I do not see why there is no willingness, or no will, to really delve into this and to show the same energy delving into this which the Governments so often demonstrate when they try to take money from the less well off. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is correct that much of this is philosophical.  There are fundamental differences and there is probably not much point on dwelling on them.  Suffice it to say that the notional progressivity of the Minister's budget, as presented in terms of percentages, masks the fact that both increases and decreases in percentages favour higher earners and disadvantage lower earners disproportionately.  The concept of notional progressivity, as set out by the Minister with his percentages, fails to deal with the sense of injustice that people feel.  They do not look at graphs and say they are progressive based on equal proportions for different earners.  They note the fact that they cannot pay their bills while somebody who earns five times more than them is getting four or five times more back from the Government.  In such circumstances, they cannot help but feel this is unfair and wrong, and that it is a misdirected priority of the Government.  The left has been very consistent on this.  It opposed partnership pay increases during the good times because they were percentage based.  A reason some of us on the left opposed social partnership was that we believed social partnership pay increases benefited higher earners disproportionately and that pay increases should have been considered more in terms of absolute figures.  While the Minister might not agree with our more broad philosophical position, he should consider the feelings that have been driving all the people onto the streets in recent weeks.  They were being driven onto the streets by the fact that a huge proportion of people cannot pay their bills.  What the Minister has given them back does not cover what they have lost elsewhere through water charges, property tax, increases in utility bills, public service obligation charge increases, etc.  They are in as bad a position as they used to be, or perhaps worse, while those who are able to manage are getting multiples back from the Minister.  He should acknowledge that this is a problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Higher income earners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, this provision will extend this tax break to landlords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  I supported the home extension scheme, the logic being that it would generate work for builders and so on and obviously would be of some benefit to ordinary householders seeking to carry out renovations.  However, when one starts to extend it to landlords - I might not have as much of a problem with small-scale landlords with one or two properties - against a background where major investors appear to be moving in and buying up huge amounts of property in this State over recent years on the back of the crash and then there are these REIT entities, with which they will get tax breaks thereon, will the biggest beneficiaries of this provision not be wealthy investors?  The Minister might argue it is worth it because it will generate some employment but my concern is that this is simply another tax break for wealthy investors and we are reverting to incentivising the kind of thing that led us into the mess, which was the property boom and bust that did such damage to this economy.  What does the Minister have to say in response to this concern?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have lived in some of those bedsits, some of which were less than pleasant and, consequently, I see the advantage of trying to do something about that.  As an aside, I note the real way to deal with the supply problem is for the State to engage in a far more ambitious public housing programme.  However, setting all that aside, my concern is that the unintended beneficiaries of this measure might be the very big investors, notwithstanding the Minister's intention to direct it at bedsits and to encourage smaller-scale landlords to renovate some of these unsuitable properties or those properties which no longer even fit within the criteria and to make them available.  What is to prevent this measure from being of major benefit to the much larger corporate investors in property?  Is there some way in which the benefit they can get could be limited in terms of their overall income, if the Minister knows what I mean?  In other words, very big earners of rental income should not get a proportionate tax break as against somebody whose income is relatively modest.
