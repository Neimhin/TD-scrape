I thank the two contributors for their extremely interesting presentations. First, I overwhelmingly subscribe to what Dr. Devine said regarding the people's understanding of neutrality. Let us be clear - the people's understanding is that we do not get involved in wars and we do not wish to be involved in military alliances. That is not from a parochial basis but from the opposite basis. It is from the basis of being good internationalists who wish to side with people who may be subject to the bullying of big powers. That is really the people's understanding of neutrality and why, for example, the facilitation of the war in Iraq flies in the face of the notion the people of this country have of neutrality. That was clearly demonstrated in opinion polls that were carried out on the matter by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA, and in the massive mobilisations against that war. One of the major reasons that people voted against the various EU treaties was precisely on this basis. Dr. Devine agrees on that but what does Mr. Smyth think about it? If we wish to have a notion of neutrality that is in line with the opinions of the people, is that not the opinion of the people in the first place? Linked to that, is the refusal of the Government to define neutrality due to the fact that it knows that is what the people believe neutrality to be and it does not want it pinned down because it knows what the answer is?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I can intervene on that point, Mr. Smyth appears to be saying that the people have a type of legalistic, narrow, UN-related notion of neutrality. Does he honestly believe that is the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Smyth is describing realpolitik, and that is fine as a description. However, is that type of pragmatic, political, somewhat Ã  la carte view of neutrality which the political elites in this country have, particularly when it came to the Iraq war, in line with the sentiment of the people on these matters? I do not believe it is. The people are much more consistent and, frankly, more principled in their understanding of neutrality. In so far as they are, the people's view of neutrality accords better with a meaningful definition of neutrality as set out in, for example, the Hague Convention.
