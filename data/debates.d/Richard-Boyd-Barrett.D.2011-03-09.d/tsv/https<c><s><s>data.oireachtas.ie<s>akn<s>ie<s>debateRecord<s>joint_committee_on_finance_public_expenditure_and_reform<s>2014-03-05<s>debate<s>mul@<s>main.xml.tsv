RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the financial ombudsman for coming into the committee.  It has been illuminating.  After two and a half years in the Dáil, I am still wading through the complex machinery of State and public oversight.  Today, I have learned quite an amount about what the Financial Services Ombudsman does.  The job of the Financial Services Ombudsman is to ensure the financial institutions play by the rules and by the law but it does not make the law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Financial Services Ombudsman adjudicates on complaints.  Does it have any role in alerting the Central Bank or the Government to problems or injustices that may not be illegal or outside the regulations but that any reasonable person might consider to be a problem?  Does the Financial Services Ombudsman have any role in that area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A number of points occurred to me.  Mr. Prasifka places an emphasis on the difference between the formal and informal approach of the office as opposed to the UK office.  From the statistics, it appears the formal approach leads to a lower level of complaints being upheld while the informal leads to a higher level of complaints being upheld.  If I understand the statistics correctly, the ombudsman in Britain upholds more complaints, which appears to be linked to the fact that it is more informal.  If I am correct, Mr. Prasifka seems to be concerned that he is being pushed in a direction that is too formal.  The further we go down that road, the more problematic it becomes.  Should we move to a more informal approach?  The informal approach appears to favour the complainant more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will this differ?  Can Mr. Prasifka elaborate on what informal means in the context of the alternative model that operates in Britain?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a very strong parallel between that and politics.  It is the difference between sorting out cases with the Department at the level of the clinic and pushing for policy change.  It is an interesting balance.  Perhaps we can have a bit of both.  Perhaps there could be an informal starting point.  If it does not work or if it is not appropriate, there can be a higher threshold of formality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not sort that out today but I appreciate it.  That is something to be examined.  There are two areas I want to ask about in respect of the volume of complaints.  In respect of reckless lending, there is no legal prohibition and no category of reckless lending.  Some of us argue there should be.  Did the Financial Services Ombudsman receive many complaints about reckless lending, which is something that may be hard to prove?  In many of the cases I have heard about, it amounted to a bank manager or someone selling loans in a bank saying that it is a good deal and that people should get on board.  That is difficult to prove.  Were there many complaints in the area?  There was uproar in England about RBS and Lloyds and what they did with their restructuring divisions for small business, with claims that, in order to maximise the money they could get back on loans that were in trouble to businesses that were generally held to be viable by the people in the businesses, the banks put massive pressure on the small businesses to liquidate assets.  This amounted to doing things to effectively close down the business so that the banks could get back the money.  Is this something the Financial Services Ombudsman came across?  One person told me that the global restructuring division of Ulster Bank is essentially trying to put him out of business.They were getting direct rental revenue and they were holding back VAT which should have gone to the Revenue Commissioners and were going into people's personal ---
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry but this was well publicised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Ombudsman receiving a lot of complaints about restructuring divisions and their relationship with small businesses?  Is there an apparent problem here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one case and I will not mention names but it concerns a complaint about ATMs.  A couple had €800 taken out of their account.  The bank suggested that they had taken it out themselves but they were adamant that they had not done so.  They had been customers of the bank for many years, both were working and were in a different part of the country at the time that the money was withdrawn.  They lived in Dublin and the money was taken out somewhere in Limerick.  They made a complaint but it was not upheld.  It would appear from this case that it comes down to one person's word against another's.  We know there are mechanisms through which cameras taking photographs of people inputting their PIN can lead to money being taken out of people's account without their knowledge.  What if someone cannot prove it one way or another?  How does the Ombudsman deal with a case like that?  If the Ombudsman does not uphold such a complaint because there is no evidence to prove the case one way or the other, is there somewhere else such people can go?  These people feel that their good name has been impugned because the suggestion implicit in the decision is that they must have taken out their own money and then tried to con the bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To show gross negligence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What would gross negligence amount to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do some cases come down to one person's word against another, in which case there is no evidence on which the Ombudsman can adjudicate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am confused as to why a complaint like the one to which I referred would not be upheld.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Ombudsman does not uphold a complaint, what can the complainant do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an expensive business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions following from earlier comments.  Is there a conflict between the legislation which informs how the ombudsman is to operate and a statutory instrument which disagrees?  The ombudsman is governed by the statutory instrument in the publication of details of individual judgments.  That situation is bizarre.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not fully following that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that.  However, I find it strange and bizarre that the legislation can allow for the ombudsman to do one thing and then the regulations put in place - presumably to implement the legislation - preclude the ombudsman from doing something that the legislation allows it to do, namely, a quite important issue of being able to report on individual rulings made by it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That appears to me to be an anomaly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to people with mortgage arrears going through the MABS process.  In almost every case of mortgage difficulty that I encounter, people tell me that they are making great efforts to contact financial institutions to engage with them but they receive no response or else merely a letter written by rote.  I wonder about this.  The banks have come to our meetings telling us that they are making great efforts and that the distressed mortgage-holders are not contacting them.  Which is the correct version?  I have met a series of individuals who have shown me the correspondence they have received from the banks.  They told me that they begged the banks to meet them in order to have a proper discussion of the situation.They are minimal, tick the box requirements. Does Mr. Prasifka receive many complaints about banks acting bureaucratically but not really engaging and how much latitude does the legislation allow him in terms of telling the banks they ticked the box but did not try to engage?
