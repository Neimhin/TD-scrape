RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed. The Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Bill 2021 will finish Second Stage at 4 p.m. tomorrow and will begin Committee Stage at 6 p.m. Meanwhile, Report on Final Stages of the Maritime Area Planning Bill, involving exactly the same spokespersons, will be on in the Dáil Chamber between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. That is completely unacceptable and people cannot be in two places at the same time. It is also unacceptable that the time allocated for the Maritime Area Planning Bill, which deals with offshore development, has been guillotined to three hours, which will not allow many of the amendments to this incredibly important Bill to be discussed. We still have not seen Thursday's Bill to deal with mandatory quarantine but it will also be guillotined. Friday's health and criminal justice Bill is to give sweeping powers to the Minister and his Government but there has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of that, despite demands from the committee that there should be.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The same spokespersons cannot be in two places at one time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is directly clashing.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	South Africa has done the world a favour by identifying the Omicron variant, and the way we repay them is that the European Union, with the support of the Taoiseach's Government, has consistently refused the calls from South Africa and many other nations, almost the entire global scientific community and many non-governmental organisations for the lifting of the intellectual property restrictions on Covid vaccines so that countries such as South Africa and other poorer countries can get the right to produce vaccines themselves, which they have been screaming for. It is utterly disgraceful now, as we face Omicron, that the European Commission continues with this position and the Irish Government supports it, putting the profits of the pharmaceutical companies ahead of the need to vaccinate the world. Will the Taoiseach revisit that position?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	South Africa is asking for the waiver, not me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	South Africa is asking for the waiver, not me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	South Africa is asking for the waiver. Will the Government give it to them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach have a special adviser on disability matters, or have any of the Taoiseach's special advisers ever suggested he heeds the call of disability organisations and advocate groups for his Department to co-ordinate implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and disability matters generally? There are people dealing with different aspects of disability across a whole series of departmental silos, and as a result we do not have a rights-based approach to disability matters in the context of the UNCRPD. For example, I met a woman recently who spoke about her son who has Down's syndrome and who is constantly having his medical card entitlement reviewed. In our own area at the moment there is a door-to-door transport service called Accessible Community Transport Southside, ACTS, for people who are wheelchair users and those with mobility issues. The service's lack of funding means several thousand people with mobility issues or who use wheelchairs and cannot use public transport are going to lose the service through the lack of a relatively small amount of money. I could go on. The problem is that all these things are dealt with by subsidiaries of departmental silos rather than having a co-ordinated approach, which the Taoiseach's Department should lead, towards ensuring a rights-based approach to disability matters in line with the implementation of UNCRPD.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mother says they will have to come back to review it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On repeated occasions I have raised with this Government and the one previous to this, the fury of parents, the school community and local residents at the decision of the Christian Brothers to sell off the school playing fields of Clonkeen College in Dún Laoghaire. The Government has failed to intervene and the Christian Brothers are continuing to push through with that decision to sell off to private property developers the school playing fields. In the past week the parents were absolutely shocked to get a letter from the Christian Brothers, from the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, saying that it was not reappointing a board of management to the school but was going to have one manager and no board. This is despite the fact that the parents and teachers have put forward representatives who could have formed a board. The trust is empowered to do this under a statutory instrument brought in in 1998 by the former Minister for Education, Michael Woods, which means that the school simply has to notify the Government - I would like to know if it has done so - that they cannot supposedly find suitable people for the board. This is retaliation by the Christian Brothers against the parents, teachers and school community because they oppose what the Christian Brothers are doing. Will the Taoiseach intervene and prevent them from doing this because this has wide implications for other schools?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the new public health measures and the injunction for people to reduce their social contacts, I have asked the Taoiseach on a number of occasions to resurrect supports for musicians, entertainers, taxi drivers and people in the night-time economy. On 2 November, the cross-party group on music and entertainment wrote to a number of Ministers asking that those sector-specific supports, particularly the part-time self-employed scheme, would form the basis of an income support whereby musicians, entertainers and taxi drivers, as was the case previously, could earn up to a certain amount and get some support, given that their work has dramatically reduced as a result of the public health measures at a time when they would have expected to make quite a lot of money coming up to Christmas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I wish to welcome the fact that we are discussing the situation on Palestine the day after the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I commend Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which voted to fly the Palestinian flag yesterday, following a motion proposed by Councillors Hugh Lewis and Melisa Halpin. I believe Galway City Council also flew the flag, as Dublin City Council has done before. That speaks to the enormous solidarity that exists in this country, historically, for the plight of the Palestinian people. There is a recognition of the persecution the Palestinian people have suffered - the oppression, the denial of rights, the displacement from their land, the status as exiles of millions of Palestinians, the cruel injustice, the colonialism and the apartheid laws that are so similar to the Irish Penal Laws that were imposed on the Catholic population here. We understand the plight of Palestine in a way few others can fully empathise with because it mirrors so closely our own history under colonial rule. In that context and on the day after the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, we have to say, and I do not mind admitting, that the Irish Government is better than most governments, at least in terms of the statements it makes about the mistreatment of the Palestinian people. However, the problem is that nothing ever changes. I got involved in politics because of Palestine. I spent a year living there in 1987, the year of the first intifada. I was shocked to my core to see the endemic racism in the treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis. Israeli farmers on the farm I worked in regularly used to say things like the only good Arab is a dead Arab. That is how bad it was; it was absolutely rampant. Young Palestinians who I worked with, and who travelled for hours from refugee camps in Hebron, brought me to their refugee camp as the first intifada began in 1987. They showed me the caves where their families lived for two years after they had been forced by Israeli terror gangs out of their homes in 1947 and 1948, the year of the Nakba, when they had to live in caves until the UN came along and built refugee camps. They, their parents and grandparents have lived in those refugee camps ever since. It just goes on and nothing changes.  Six peaceful NGOs have been designated as terrorist organisations because the Israelis can just get away with it and nobody does anything about it. A nation state law was introduced a while ago which gives only the Jewish people the right to self-determination, which is an international right that people have and Palestinians have.A siege of Gaza has been going on for years with the most inhumane conditions imposed on men, women and children in defiance of international law, yet nothing is done. Nothing has been done. Day in and day out there is administrative detention of Palestinian people and for their youth there is internment without trial. It goes on and nothing is done. It is 25 years since the Oslo Accords and from day one Israel was breaching that agreement with further annexation of Palestinian territory, which was the little bit of Palestinian territory that was left under that absolutely miserable and humiliating deal. They could not even respect that deal. They go on with ethnic cleansing and in Jerusalem seizing territory and annexing territory and the world does nothing. Before that they occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 and of course the horrible crime of the Nakba itself. Has anybody ever been to the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut? They are absolutely shocking. Three and four generations of Palestinians are living in the most disgusting and appalling conditions. Nothing is done. Even though under international law they have the right to return, nothing is done. We continue to entertain the nonsense that the State of Israel that does this is a normal state, which we should talk of as if it behaves in any kind of normal way when it clearly does not. I ask the question honestly of the Minister: when are we going to do something? When do those crimes, which have been ongoing for decades and generations day in day out and ever getting worse, finally prompt action by the European Union to end the favoured trade status that Israel has, or to impose some kind of sanctions? Instead, we just get words. There is no action and the suffering of the Palestinians continues. I ask honestly of the Minister if there is ever going to be action to stem the tide of injustice, brutality and oppression the Palestinian people have to suffer.
