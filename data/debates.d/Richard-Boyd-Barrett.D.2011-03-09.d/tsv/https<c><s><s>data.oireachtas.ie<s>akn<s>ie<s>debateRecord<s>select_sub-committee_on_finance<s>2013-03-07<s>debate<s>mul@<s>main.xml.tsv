RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have voted against these measures in this and the previous budget. This is clearly a revenue-raising exercise that will hit the least well-off. When considered alongside the reduction in the fuel allowance, it will hit yet again those who just cannot afford to be hit. It is spurious in the extreme to suggest it has anything to do with CO2 reductions. It is a straightforward revenue-raising exercise. If the Government was serious about reducing CO2 emissions, it could instead develop wood burning as an option, thereby expanding forestry. This would obviously mean not selling off Coillte's harvesting rights. As wood fuel we grow ourselves is carbon neutral, we could achieve the reductions in CO2 by expanding this sector but not by imposing an extra tax on those who cannot afford it, which is what this really is. It is spurious to suggest it has anything to do with carbon emissions; it is an unfair tax which I oppose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Significant numbers of older people die of hypothermia because they cannot afford to heat their homes during winter. The number of recorded deaths in this regard has increased in recent years. There is no getting around that what the Minister is proposing exacerbates that situation. I would like to hear the Minister's response to this issue. Organisations representing the elderly make this point year-on-year. What is proposed in this Bill will worsen a situation that is already unacceptable for elderly people. As I stated earlier, this increase taken in conjunction with the reduction in the period in respect of which the fuel allowance is paid, will hurt. Elderly people may die as a result of it. This is a serious issue. I ask that the Minister and Government give serious consideration to the issue of alternative solid fuels that are CO2 neutral, including logs, and expansion of that sector. People must have alternatives. If the cheapest way people can heat their home is to light a fire in a fireplace then they must be offered alternatives that are not damaging to the environment. Log burning is an alternative that is carbon-neutral because trees act as a carbon sink. There is a need to look at and develop this sector in the context of providing logs cheaply to people as an alternative to coal, briquettes and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister's answers in the sense he is engaging with the issues we are raising, but while moves are being made towards more sustainable forms and uses of energy to reduce CO2 emissions, it always seems to be that only those least in a position to do so bear the cost of these transitions or suffering most as a result of the transition. I am a firm believer that if one wants people to move in an alternative direction one must put the alternative infrastructure in place and overcome whatever technical difficulties there may be to do this. The Minister stated there is nowhere to store logs in urban areas and this is a fair point, but there is no reason we could not have depots in estates or particular areas where people could buy small amounts of carbon-neutral environmentally friendly fuels, in particular wood, because it links into an area the Government also has a commitment to develop and expand, namely, forestry, which could generate employment. It seems a no-brainer that we would move more decisively in this direction and provide people with this alternative instead of always having to hit people and see what we can come up with afterwards. I would say the same about insulation. As Deputy Doherty pointed out, there is a cost involved, and several times I have asked the Minister whether we could have a scheme, particularly for those who cannot afford it, whereby nothing would be paid upfront for the retrofit and insulation of a house but the cost would be added to energy bills afterwards. This would not be an extra cost because the householders will have made a saving in their energy costs. What they would be charged on an incremental basis would be the difference between what they used to pay and the saving, so there would be no extra burden. It would mean insulation could happen fast and people would not have to pay the money upfront. It would also generate a huge number of jobs for the many people trained in the insulation business. My local further education college teaches courses on BER energy ratings. People are being trained but there is nothing for them to do. We do not seem to be moving fast and decisively enough in this direction and those who cannot afford to be hit gets hit with the cost of it. This is unfair and, frankly, in the case of elderly people it is dangerous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this not the kind of thing for which we could go to the European Investment Bank? Deputy Halligan said he met with EIB representatives at a committee and asked them about this. If the public sector goes to the EIB with a good project that has a definite return and for which it can set out a business case, the bank does not care whether it is public or private sector; it is interested in such projects. There is obviously a huge employment spin-off if we can put together big projects such as this. It seems to me that it should be a matter of urgency. Given the savings and jobs that Deputy Donnelly mentioned, it is a win-win situation. Are we therefore engaging with the EIB to put forward proposals of this sort?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State elaborate a little?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is as clear as mud.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State explain in layman's language why they get this VAT exemption?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not a good reason.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not trying to be difficult here. I am simply looking at this change and other changes further down where there are exemptions from tax. I feel an obligation as a member of the committee to ask questions where tax is being foregone but we do not fully understand why, given that we are in a situation in which, as we are all aware, things are rather tight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to delay too long. It would be helpful to know what it is in particular about these investment limited partnerships that requires them to get an exemption. I am not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suppose Deputy Twomey knows it off by heart.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could debate that and certainly I would like to debate it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I need to know more. I have no wish to debate in the dark.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. Does Ireland's position on these matters compare with other jurisdictions in Europe? Are financial services exempt from VAT everywhere else, in most places or in some places?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are exemptions on VAT fairly standard throughout Europe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the Minister of State at his word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two issues. I learned about REITs yesterday and now we are learning about investment limited partnerships.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Clearly, the Minister of State knows all about them too because he can read his notes to explain them to me. Deputy Liam Twomey probably knows more about them. I refer to two issues. The information offered to Deputy Peter Mathews would be interesting because we need to scrutinise these issues to know who benefits from these tax breaks. The other aspect of interest is that of financial services. The Minister of State sees this as part of a policy on financial services, an area about which there is a dispute. I am not suggesting we should have a full-blown debate here, but if it is part of the policy and a planned strategy, in respect of which there is a dispute about the merits of a low tax regime for financial services as being the best way to generate jobs or investment in the State, it would be useful to have a proper debate. If there is a plan, as the Minister of State says, let us see it. As Deputy Róisín Shortall asked, what would be the implications? Have we modelled what might happen if we were to adopt alternatives such as not giving exemptions or, most obviously, the one being debated across Europe, a financial transaction tax? The Government regularly tells us we must not touch these because investment in the International Financial Services Centre would migrate to Britain. However, there is no evidence to back this up. These are important issues for all sides in the debate and we should have evidence to back up the assertions being made. I question whether, given our low corporation tax rate, a small additional amount of taxation levied on the financial services sector would do as much damage as is sometimes claimed by the Government. I, therefore, ask it for the evidence. Perhaps the Minister of State might tell us how we could have an informed debate on the issue. Can we have sight of any paper, plan or strategy available in order that we can debate them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an important issue, on which the Government has strong views, as is obvious during exchanges on it. However, big questions remain to be answered. The committee and the public would be assisted in making an objective judgment on the issues involved if they could have in front of them all of the information and evidence available. It is clear that other countries have moved ahead with a financial transaction tax-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not proposing to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was simply pointing out that there were different approaches.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, it would be helpful in dealing with such matters as tax exemptions in the Finance Bill, in order to make an informed judgment, whether it be good, bad or indifferent-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is actually related.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here we go again. We already have real estate investment trusts, REITs, investment limited partnerships, ILPs, and now we have enhanced equipment trust certificates, EETCs. The same logic runs behind all of these, namely, tax breaks for foreign capital supposedly on the grounds that the latter will bring with it jobs and investment. I am aware of the Government's view on this matter. It has been quite clearly stated on many occasions. There is no transparency around these vehicles. The note in the explanatory memorandum refers to investment limited partnerships, which we have just discussed, and states "exemptions for the transfer of foreign shares and certain financial services instruments will apply in the case of securitisation transactions". This is interesting stuff. Securitisation transactions were at the heart of the global economic collapse and we are now going to give tax breaks to the entities involved in them. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State elaborate on this matter in layman's language. I cited the example of the aviation sector, which others have also mentioned. It was reported in some of the newspapers that a subsidiary of General Electric involved in aviation leasing, based out of Shannon, was paying less than 1% in corporate tax and declared, if I remember correctly, €600 million in profits and that if it had paid the 12.5% rate, it would have paid approximately €90 million in tax. However, instead it paid approximately €600,000 in tax. This is a problem. At the very least it is something on which we need to shine a spotlight and get an explanation. How many people did that subsidiary of General Electric involved in aviation leasing employ in Ireland? Nobody. The argument that these exemptions are bringing jobs to the country does not stack up or at least we need evidence on that. We need to dispel the allegation being made or the belief that exists, which I share, that Ireland is operating as a tax haven. I ask the Minister of State to respond to some of those questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I seek in my contribution, and this has been stated in a number of contributions in this regard, to shine a light on these areas. There is a veil of secrecy hanging over them. I would point out to Deputy Twomey that I was not the only one who raised the issue of this company. It was covered in The Irish Times. I picked up on it in questions taken in the Dáil and put the issue to the Minister as others may have done as well. It was shocking to discover that an aircraft leasing firm that was a subsidiary of General Electric, one of the biggest companies in the world, was paying less than 1% tax here. That was written about in The Irish Times in the middle of last year. What we are dealing with here is stamp duty exemptions for firms in this sector. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know, but we are dealing with a section not just the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to query the amendment and the context in which it fits in because we need to shine a light on these areas. There is another way to put this and it is not about conspiracies or agenda. What the Minister of State said could be put another way, namely, that what we are engaged in is tax piracy. Did he call it "first move"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First move advantage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Another way of describing that is tax piracy. Whether we take my view or the Minister of State's view, what we need is some clarity on this. How many firms are involved? How many jobs do they create? Where is the evidence that jobs are being created? I have given one example of a company where no jobs have been created. Can the Minister tell us any more about this in order that we can make objective judgments about the value of these exemptions? If in the case of one firm we have foregone €90 million worth of tax. Just think about that - we are talking about big money here. A light needs to be shone on this area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad I asked about this amendment because what is coming out is revealing. This debate needs to come out into the open. I hear frequently that we must be careful because of the markets. We have been listening to that endlessly for God knows how long, and it has not got us very far. That logic seems to be operating at every level of policy, and the economic thinking is that we must be careful because the markets might get annoyed. It says a great deal about the reason there is a veil of secrecy and no transparency around much of these tax exemptions, allowances and so on because what is behind it is the fear of Government, and the fear of the political establishment generally, that we must not annoy the markets. I am not happy with that as an approach to policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State just said that we have to be careful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They came from a report in The Irish Times-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He also said, with respect to the Chair, that in conducting a review we must be careful about the signals we send out to the markets. That means there is a hesitation about shining a spotlight on these areas in case the markets take flight. The Minister of State was clear and explicit about that. I believe we need a review because the one example I have cited, which is the only one of which I know, is shocking in the extreme. We are discussing the aviation sector but in this section there is also reference to the extension of stamp duty exemptions to the area of securitisation transactions. As I mentioned earlier, securitisation transactions are the reason the global economy crashed. They were at the centre of the global economic collapse, and we are now extending tax exemptions to those things. We are giving them exemptions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is referenced in this section. The explanatory memorandum states that we will "ensure that the exemptions for the transfer of foreign shares and certain financial services instruments will apply in the case of securitisation transactions".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, section 78. I quoted directly from the note on section 78 in the explanatory memorandum.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had not finished. The legitimacy of what I was saying has been questioned. It is in the note on this section. We are talking about tax exemptions to areas which are murky and over which there are large question marks given their role in the global economic crisis of which we are one of the major victims. I would like explanations from the Minister of State as to why we give tax exemptions to these areas. I would like the Government not to tread carefully around the issue of reviewing these things and putting a spotlight on them so that we can all understand fully what they are, what purpose they serve and whether they are beneficial to the State. I would also like a commitment from the Minister of State that the Government will facilitate such a debate and provide such information.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made and I accept that the Minister for Health is the one responsible for this. We all subscribe to the principle of risk equalisation but the question arises of where this is heading and how it links in with the Government's objective of universal health insurance, particularly given the failing model of The Netherlands which the Government previously held up as an example. That is not much spoken about now because the system is becoming very problematic and unpopular in Holland. The most developed example of a place where private health insurance companies dominate the provision of health care is the United States. There is a big financial issue for the State in that the US spends more than any other country in the world on health but 40% of that money is spent on administration because of the predominance of private health insurers competing among themselves and having very developed structures for billing people, essentially gouging money out of people. Where is this leading? What model are we trying to adopt when it comes to providing health care? Is private health insurance the way forward? I have major questions about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State will notice there is a theme to my questions. The note in the explanatory memorandum says that this section amends capital acquisitions tax where there is an exemption for certain policies of assurance on the life of a person where neither the disponer, the donee nor the successor is domiciled or ordinarily resident in the State. The amendment extends the exemption from tax to policies known as capital redemption policies issued by life assurance companies where the disponer, donee or successor is both non-domiciled and non-resident in the State. We have a new creature now, in the form of the capital redemption policy, receiving a tax exemption. For some reason, this is provided where a person is non-resident. Will the Minister of State explain this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am against double taxation, so that is okay with me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our old friend, the investment limited partnership, appears here. We are providing an exemption for investment limited partnerships in cases where there is a transfer of units and where the disponer or donee is domiciled ordinarily in the State and will continue to be following the removal of investment limited partnerships from the definition of "investment undertaking". Will the Minister of State explain this? Why are investment limited partnerships getting this exemption on the transfer of units? They seem to be benefiting significantly from exemptions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister explain why exactly they are getting these exemptions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are they getting the exemptions? The amendment is for the purpose of clarity. The Minister says the exemption existed already and this clarifies that such an exemption can continue. If I understand correctly, the exemption applies to investment limited funds where those involved are not ordinarily resident in the State.I ask the Minister of State to explain why the investment limited partnerships get an exemption from capital acquisitions tax, CAT, because they are not resident in the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a double taxation issue, then, is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On this section, I have a question for the Minister of State. As I understand it, this is about the amount of information that needs to be submitted on a corporation tax return - I do not know if it is in certain, or all, cases - where that information relates to a company resident outside the State but with a branch or agency here. Is this section requiring more or less information from such companies? What change is taking place here in terms of the information we are seeking?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very good. I just wanted to ensure it was more and not less information.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Must we signal that now, even if we have raised questions about particular sections?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All my questions were signals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I reserve the right to table amendments on sections I have asked questions about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman will ask whether it should go to the next Stage. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Likewise, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for lively engagement on the issues. I thank the officials as well. Whatever about the debate on the content, I marvel at the capacity of the officials in the Department of Finance to deal with this stuff because there is so much of it and it is so complex. I thank them. Well done to the officials.
