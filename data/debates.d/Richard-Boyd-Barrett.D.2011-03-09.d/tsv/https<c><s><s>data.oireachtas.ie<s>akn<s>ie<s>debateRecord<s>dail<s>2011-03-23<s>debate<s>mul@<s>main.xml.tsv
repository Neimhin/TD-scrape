RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we failing to look reality in the face in respect of the unsustainability of the debt burden imposed as a result of this package?  It is not only I who say this — this is a view widely held, including by people such as the Nobel Prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, lead writers for the Financial Times and economists in this country such as David McWilliams and Constantin Gurdgiev, who all say the burden is unsustainable.  It is shocking that some 18% of tax revenue in 2014 will go to service only the interest repayments on this debt, never mind the capital debt.  Many people say we are sinking into a morass of debt which will cripple this economy as well as cause untold suffering for working people and the poor and vulnerable in our society.  Again, it is not only I or all those economists and international commentators who say that.  I remind the Minister of his own words in February: “It is neither morally right nor economically sustainable for taxpayers to be asked to beggar themselves to make massive profits for speculators”.  That was said at the launch of the Fine Gael Party banking policy when the Minister stated he believed the new Government, of which he is now a member, would be forced to restructure unilaterally the debt of Irish banks if agreement cannot be reached with Europe regarding senior bondholders sharing the cost of recapitalising the country’s insolvent banks.The Minister was absolutely right.  I could not have put it better myself.  At that time, he was in line with what everybody in the country felt and what all serious commentators were saying.  What has changed?  Why has the debt now become sustainable when at that time the Minister said it was not so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not time to consider the Iceland option of defaulting or, at least, giving the people the opportunity to debate issues concerning the possibility of defaulting so that instead of bailing out banks we might put the National Pensions Reserve Fund into a job stimulus programme?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister stated that there will be a review of the universal social charge, that the charge must be examined and so forth, which is fair enough in as far as it goes.  However, given the cruel injustice that the charge represents for low and middle income workers and families, the review must be undertaken urgently.  The universal social charge is damaging people who are barely making ends meet.  In some cases, people are in danger of going under in terms of meeting bills, paying mortgages and so forth.The review must address the injustice of imposing the universal social charge on those who cannot afford to pay it.  Instead of imposing it on people who cannot afford it, will the Minister examine or consider examining the case for taxing those with enormous wealth who have been untouched?  Was he not as shocked as I and most of the country were to learn in the Sunday newspapers published the weekend before last that the 300 richest people in this country have €57 billion in personal wealth and that their wealth increased by €6.7 billion in the past year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the same as the amount the previous Government took from ordinary people in its final budget.  The Government should tax those who are wealthy and have acquired more wealth in the past year and relieve the burden imposed on those who cannot afford to pay the universal social charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, may I, as a new Member, ask a question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a question that related to this subject but to which I did not receive a response.  Can we know the names of the bondholders, including those we have already paid?  I do not believe we should be paying them.  Can the names of the bondholders be made available to the House and the public?
