RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The whole point of this Bill was to respond to the expressions of outrage over and opposition to water charges, Irish Water itself and people's fear that the establishment of the company is a prelude to privatisation. It was supposed to be the Minister's response, proof he is listening and his reassurance that people's worst fears will not, in fact, be realised. Yesterday, we got a clear statement that people do not believe the Minister's assurances. For 70,000 to 80,000 people — that is my estimate — to have come out on the streets midweek after the Minister made his so-called concessions was an absolutely decisive rebuttal and rejection of his assurances, including those made in here.It is a decisive statement that people do not trust the Minister when he states that Irish Water will not be privatised. Lest there be any doubt, as I have heard some rather ridiculous comments on numbers yesterday, any demonstration that can fill three sides of Merrion Square, and where the end of it is at College Green and people who are arriving at College Green cannot move all they way up to Merrion Square, is vast. I got at least four telephone calls from people on College Green stating they could not move. It extended all the way up Nassau Street and on three sides of Merrion Square. The demonstration for the late Ms Savita Halappanavar was 20,000 people on one side of Merrion Square. We had three sides of Merrion Square and all the way down Nassau Street to College Green and some commentators stated there were 30,000. Who were these commentators?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where were they standing? Did they have eyes in the back of their head, did they have eyes that could see around corners, or were they, in fact, shivering in the cold near the back gate of the Dáil asking us how many people there were, looking at our estimates, looking at the Garda's estimates and deciding it was somewhere in between? According to those who were stewarding the demonstration, and calls we were getting, they were all the way down to College Green, there were more coming down from O'Connell Street and they were on three sides of Merrion Square. If that is not 70,000 to 100,000, I do not know what is. That happened mid-week, in the bitter cold. Fianna Fáil will be glad to hear this little story. Up the front, I heard a big gang of people saying they have been life-long supporters of Fianna Fáil and voted for that party all their lives, but they were protesting. They said they did not agree with my politics, but they were there because they are absolutely opposed to these water charges and they know it will lead to privatisation. There were grannies. There were young people. There were disabled people. Every sector of Irish society was represented. I was on the radio yesterday and in response to a Government spokesperson who said it was only the radical left and Sinn Féin supporters, a garda said, "You must be joking. I know of hundreds of off-duty gardaí who are on the demonstration". The Minister, Deputy Kelly, can no longer fool people. This is an attempt to fool people again. Having said that the Government will not privatise Irish Water, the Minister uses in the word "may" when it comes to a plebiscite. Do the people think it will be "may" or "may not", or "will not", as all three are open to interpretation given the wording in the Bill? Of course, we got that answer yesterday. In case there would be any doubt, the Minister will get that answer again on 31 January, when towns, cities and villages across the country will again mobilise. There will be no dispute about numbers then because it will be seen in every town. On the different provisions of the Bill, such as the use of the word "may", and what is happening in Irish Water, we learned from the people from Detroit. I do not know whether the Minister listened to what the people from Detroit were saying, but it was interesting. I had not been aware that the Detroit water system is still in public ownership. They said that while it is nominally in public ownership, like Irish Water, it is completely privatised. Everything is outsourced to the private sector. The private sector runs, controls and finances it. They made the important point that it also uses off-balance sheet financing for their water system. The people from Detroit pointed out it was precisely the issuing of bonds from the Detroit water system that had forced up water charges to astronomical, unaffordable levels. Should we not know this from what we have learned about bonds generally? If one borrows to finance a public entity but all of the funding comes from the private sector, the bondholders call the shots. Once the Government finances this entity through off-balance sheet financing, it is, in fact, already privatised regardless of the nominal status that the Minister may accord it in law. Of course, we can see that with our own eyes in terms of the hollowing out by private interests of Irish Water even at this point by GMC Sierra and all of the private consultants who have had a feeding frenzy on the set-up costs of the utility. The Minister's assurances are not credible. That a proposal "may" rather than "shall" be put to a plebiscite is the giveaway that the Minister knows his assurances are worth nothing, that they are a gimmick to defuse the unprecedented popular rebellion against these charges, against Irish Water and against the Government's plans to privatise Irish Water. The people have seen through it. The Minister should have the honesty to admit, at least, what is going on and explain how this sleight of hand has occurred but the people already know what the Government is up to. The process of privatisation has started. The Minister is trying to facilitate it and all of this is merely smoke and mirrors to confuse people. He believes people are stupid out there but, believe me, they are not. The people have woken up. They have seen right through the Minister. That was evident on the streets and the Minister can be sure it will be again in the new year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many filled out the forms?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think there is any prohibition on using that word in Standing Orders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Chair mean threats like that are not an issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If somebody made such a threat, they are a thug.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. The arguments have been rehearsed fairly extensively in the past year or two and there is probably not much point in dragging this torture out in terms of the Bill and what the Minister plans to do. The decision of the people on water charges has been made. They reject them but sadly the Government is not listening. If the Government is not brought down by this issue before the appointed time for a general election, it is signing its political death warrant by persisting with these issues. I am not saying that as a rhetorical point, it is just a fact. I do not really get it. Whatever the Government may have thought at the beginning, it is worth saying one thing. The Minister's party specifically told the people before the last election that it would not do this, but it did it. We have had the unprecedented popular mobilisation against water charges and the people have said they do not want them. I do not understand why the Government persists when the people have so decisively rejected them given that it is not so long since the parties themselves rejected it. Why does it persist with this when there is no rationale, no mandate and no justification for it? The suggestion that these charges are reasonable or affordable and will stay that way is preposterous. There is simply no evidence that can be pointed to anywhere that charges go in any direction other than up rapidly once introduced for a service that once upon a time was provided to everybody, without user charges, and paid for through general taxation. Everywhere it has been done, the charges have rocketed. It is not credible to suggest the charge will be kept affordable and that the Bill and its provisions will keep it affordable when we know that charges will go up and up and that there will be pressure from the European Union for full-cost recovery. It is worth stating once again that the EU treaties are clear on the pressure they will exert on any utility. I have more or less learned off the passage in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It states that any utility or service that has the character of a revenue producing monopoly will be subject to the rules of the treaties, in particular the rules of competition. Once user charges are introduced, Irish Water has the character of a revenue producing monopoly. If it does not have charges, it does not have that character. Once it has charges, it becomes a revenue producing monopoly and, therefore, it becomes subject to the rules of the treaties, particularly in the area of competition. That means charges in terms of the legal provisions of EU treaties become the prelude to privatisation, no matter what the Government says. Private companies will be able to use those treaty provisions to demand the right to tender for those services. Therefore, the process of privatisation will be inevitable once user charges are introduced. As I said earlier, the process has started already given that most of the work has been outsourced to private consultants and private contractors. In effect, off-balance sheet financing is privatisation because it means the bondholders will be able to put pressure and demands on Irish Water. Once charges are introduced, all of these things follow inexorably. That is why the Government should not do it. It does not have a mandate to do it and we all know where it is leading. I wish to make a point I have made once or twice here. There has not been a real response from the Government and it has not got out into the general debate and discussion. My fears and concerns about it were underlined by the experiences recounted by the people who came from Detroit this week. They said that what they called the financialisation of Detroit Water was a key prelude to the charges rocketing through the roof. In other words, the use of off-balance sheet financing, bonds and so on essentially became the main pressure to jack up the charges. Another thing they said, which was really interesting and, frankly, quite scary, was that the bill for water in was a tiny fraction of the bill for water out. The same as the Government is doing here, its charges are divided into water in and water out. The charge for water in was - I will not say reasonable - in this stratosphere in that it was a couple of hundred dollars but the charge for water out was three times that amount and brought it up to close to $3,000, making it unaffordable and the reason tens of thousands of people in Detroit have had their water cut off, an absolutely despicable move. There is something else I did not know which may shock the House a little more. If one's water supply is cut off for more than two days, one's children are taken away. That is the sort of barbarism that is happening in the US.I am not saying this will happen next week but the Minister is now starting the process, and that is how it has happened everywhere else. The issue has not moved in any other direction. The assurances given to us are not credible, given the experience of every other place in the world. The charges go up, the water companies are privatised and there are demands for money and so on at every turn for fixing leaks, etc. This means affordability is left behind for the majority of people, leading to threats of being cut off, regardless of what is in preliminary legislation. The elements relating to water egressing from premises have confirmed a fear that arose from reading the General Conditions for a Water and Wastewater Connection Agreement document from Irish Water. I do not know if the Minister has read it but it details the conditions that every customer of Irish Water commits to, although most probably will not have read it. The document is on the website and it outlines the conditions of being a so-called Irish Water customer. In the section dealing with obligations of the customer, section 1.9.7 indicates "The Customer shall not allow the discharge of rainwater run-off from roofs, paved areas or other surfaces into any Sewer, except as may otherwise be agreed in advance with Irish Water in writing". What is that about? Why would Irish Water require a written agreement - as every Irish Water customer will be giving a commitment to do this - demanding that if the customer has water running off the roof, windows or paving stones going into the wastewater system, there should be written consent from Irish Water? I would like the Minister to explain that. I will tell him what I think it is about, as it is what happened in Bolivia and Detroit. As the charges are for water out as well as water in, people may try to save money on bills by harvesting water to minimise the water coming in. That water will go into a wastewater system so they will not be rewarded for water conservation and using less treated water coming in; they will be charged for it instead. In Detroit, the charges for wastewater are more expensive than that for water coming in. People are not rewarded for water conservation but they are charged for it instead. The more water conserved, the bigger the charge. In Bolivia, Bechtel was thrown out by a massive two year-long popular revolt against the introduction of charges and the privatisation of water. When it was privatised, Bechtel sent inspectors to people's homes to check if they had equipment to harvest rainwater. If people harvested rainwater and the Bechtel employees saw the evidence, there would be a charge. That is what this clause is about. It will not happen today or tomorrow but there is a legal basis in the agreement that gives Irish Water authority to do what I described. The charging system is set up in such a way as to allow for it as it deals with water coming in and going out. There must be a written agreement from Irish Water for any water out that has been harvested from the sky. It is not just about treated water and people will end up being charged for water from the sky. It is shameful. As if the entire issue is not enough of a debacle, fiasco and injustice on a massive scale, we have this to add to it. Please do not give us any fake assurances, as that happened everywhere else. I have studied the agreements and they are probably cut and pasted from other international models. I have examined the wording of agreements for all the other private water companies in America and other parts of the world and it is always the same. There is a model for privatisation and charging that is being pursued by multinational corporations all over the world. That is the Irish Water model too, regardless of any assurances and promises from a Government whose credibility when it comes to promises is threadbare. This is yet another shocking aspect of the issue and another reason people are so right to resist it. The one happy consideration in all this is regardless of how much the Government refuses to listen to the will of the people and contempt it shows for it - as it has done over recent weeks - the people will triumph on this and charges will be defeated. The resistance will continue and defeat this obnoxious plan to steal people's resources and human rights from them in the interest of private companies. It will be resisted as successfully as it was in Bolivia. The Government which introduced these charges will fade in the dustbin of Irish political history.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If this were not so serious, it would be comical. I do not know whether the Minister is a fan of Charlie Chaplin — I am a big fan. This is like something out of a Charlie Chaplin movie in that there are to be 400 people employed in the super-quango that is Irish Water who will all be busy sending out bills at significant expense to the taxpayer. They will be sending out 1 million bills-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two million bills costing us an absolute fortune. Somewhere else, in another State agency, again paid for by the taxpayer, there will be hundreds of people sending out cheques in order for people to pay those bills. It is absolutely laughable but extremely serious. The only comment one can make is that anybody who ever says protests do not get people something should realise they certainly got something here; protests get one a €100 cheque. Maybe this is the lesson people should take: go out on another protest and get another €100 cheque. The problem is that there are many people who did not and who do not need to protest who are getting the €100 cheque when they should be having a little extra tax levied on them. Charlie Chaplin would be very proud of this measure. I would like an answer on something that should be in a water conservation section or which should be addressed or clarified, that is, the point I raised earlier with the Minister on the general conditions for the customer agreement and the provision therein that states one must enter into a written agreement with Irish Water if there is any water coming off one's roof. Why must there be a written agreement with Irish Water? Could the Minister explain what that is about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give them something to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not an answer to the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On water conservation, I am merely making the point that I am baffled by the Minister's answer on the condition in the agreement. Is he stating it is because it is good practice to demand a written-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what the agreement states. It states that if one has water running off one's roof, one must get written agreement from Irish Water for that water to go back into the system. The Minister has not given me any explanation as to why they do it which leads me to believe it is what I fear. It is providing the legal basis for them to charge for someone harvesting rainwater off one's roof. That is what it is there for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Deputy Walsh expecting a mass boycott?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Minister say that tenants will or will not get the grant?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to shed a bit of light on this for the Minister, which may be helpful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the census, 475,000 people are renting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister is saying the cost of the grant to those living in their own home is €130 million and there are 475,000-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that not what you are saying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The story is changing now. We were told it was-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----€130 million based on 1.3 million-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in principal private residences. That is what the Minister said and those two figures tally; €100 for those 1.3 million principal private residences. In addition, there are 475,000 people renting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am afraid the Minister referred to people living in their own homes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a major gap in the Minister's figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, there is a major gap. How do you explain the gap of 700,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would make sense that approximately 475,000 people are renting and others are multiple properties or second homes which are not empty, and this would bring the figures up to approximately 2 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Otherwise it looks as if we are staring at an extra liability of €47 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Stop interrupting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just wanted to help you.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very clear the Minister has got it wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister should do so because if he thinks the fiasco and the outrage surrounding the issue of Irish Water has been bad to date, if he has got this wrong, he is in deep trouble. We are asking a very simple question. How is it that the census states there are 1.6 million principal private households and the Minister says there are only 1.3 million. How can that be? How is it that the Minister can say there are 300,000 fewer principal private households than the census shows and that somehow, mystically and magically, 300,000 households have disappeared since the census? It does not add up and neither do the references to holiday homes because they are accounted for by the gap between the 1.6 million and the 2.1 million. They are the multiple properties, the holiday homes, of which there are 400,000, but what the census says - God almighty, if we are not supposed to believe the census to be reasonably accurate - is that there are 1.6 million principal private residencies, not second homes and not holiday homes. The Minister will have to explain that. Otherwise he has got a €30 million hole in his mathematics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy can explain them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to add one piece to Deputy Donnelly’s maths. If we take in all the figures the Minister is talking about and add a possible €36 million gap between the Minister’s estimate of the number of households that will get the grant and the number the Central Statistics Office, CSO, says exist, it comes to €42 million but the Minister has not given us a figure for the maintenance costs for metering. He gave us the capital cost broken down on an annual basis but what about the maintenance costs for metering? Those have to be added in as well, which is likely to bring it down further. We do not know the cost of the administration of the grant. Deputy Donnelly gives a figure of 3% working on €5 million but if it costs Irish Water €22 million to send out the bills, we could be looking at a pretty significant figure, meaning that the net benefit to the State of levying these charges would be absolutely derisory, possibly as low as €20 million. If I were the Minister I would want an adjournment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not given us the figure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not given us the figure for the cost of administering the grant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly, the Minister does not have it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course the Minister disaggregates the cost of administrating.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very serious admission for the Minister to make that he does not disaggregate the cost of the Department’s-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister’s maths will be very seriously out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department of Social Protection is already overrun-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----where people wait months and months to get responses to appeals and the Minister is going to load all this extra work on them and he has not figured out how he is going to pay for it. He does not know the extra cost of the staff, the administration and has not added it into this. That is ridiculous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is digging a big hole for himself. He would be better off-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The journalists will be looking and there will be an independent scrutiny of this debate and of the figures the Minister has put out. The questions we are asking will be writ large over the next few days and if it is discovered that the Minister’s maths were way out and he rammed the Bill through, despite the fact that those legitimate questions about the maths were being raised, he should just imagine how bad it will be for him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That could be €36 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this relevant?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Seconded.
