We understand the petitioner has e-mailed Dublin City Council. Therefore, we need to ascertain if the petitioner got a response and, if so, whether the petitioner was satisfied with it. We should contact Dublin City Council to establish if it responded to the petitioner and, if so, what was that response and write to the other authorities mentioned and also tell the petitioner that if she is not satisfied with any response from those bodies, she can come back to us.

It follows on from the marriage equality referendum by demanding that we extend equality into other areas of Irish society. The petition is part of a big national campaign which I support and I suspect many of us here support calling for the end of religious discrimination in our schools. The contention of the campaigners is not only is there religious discrimination against a growing number of people who are not religious, of different religions or diverse religions and that they are being unfairly discriminated against but that the legislation is in fact in breach of their constitutional and legal rights, or that the law may be in breach of the Constitution. That is a very serious and important issue which needs to be addressed, as a matter of urgency. I say, "Well done", to the petitioners. It is a positive thing that this committee will look further at the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have no choice because we cannot contact the petitioner. There was a slight jokey element to the petition's wording, so we cannot take it any further. However, there is huge public interest in the suggestion. That is because there is a slightly more serious issue at stake which is how we should pay tribute to, commemorate or honour people in this country who have excelled and done important things on the international stage. Conor McGregor is a phenomenon at the moment, particularly after his very short demolition of Jos√© Aldo. There was a debate about how we should celebrate a fairly new sport and his achievements in it. It might be worth adding that there is a debate not just about Conor McGregor but also Katie Taylor, a woman boxer who has excelled on the international stage. Tyson Fury won the heavyweight championship but that did not get as much commentary, notwithstanding his unacceptable homophobic comments. I believe he did apologise afterwards. There is a serious discussion about how we should celebrate all these people and others who have excelled in great achievements. People might therefore consider addressing it in a more serious way, because it is something to look at.
