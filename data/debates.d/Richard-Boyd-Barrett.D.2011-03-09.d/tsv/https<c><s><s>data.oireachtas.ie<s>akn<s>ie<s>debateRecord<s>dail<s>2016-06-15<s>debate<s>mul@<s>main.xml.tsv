RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is. It is profiteering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mentioned this briefly the other day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Originally this proposal was not down for debate at all, quite extraordinarily.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did, but I am going to make it again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to acknowledge the efforts of Alice in the Whip's office in bringing this to the attention of the Government and allowing for some time.When she asked me whether this was satisfactory, I said some time was better than none.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still do not think the time being provided is adequate and would briefly like to explain why, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue I am highlighting is how we will deal with a proposal for a directive on country by country reporting on the European Union's efforts to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals. As we all know, this country and companies operating here are at the centre of that controversy. This is specifically directed at multinationals. I find it extraordinary that an all-party committee agreed that the matter should be decided on in the Dáil without debate. I also find it extraordinary that there is not a bigger appetite for a longer and more substantial debate on the matter. Essentially, we are evoking the principle of subsidiarity to prevent an effort to deal with aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a specific question. I understand the Minister for Education and Skills is to sign a statutory instrument by the end of this week that essentially closes off the possibility of level 8, Montessori trained teachers being able to work, as they have until now, within the State system in special schools. These teachers are trained in St. Nicholas Montessori College in my constituency and in the Cork Institute of Technology. There was a recognition to date that even though they did not have a bachelor of education qualification, their level 8 qualification would allow them to work in the State system and to be approved by the Teaching Council to do so in the specific area of special education, which is where their training is directed.If the statutory instrument is signed I am told this career option for all of these highly qualified people trained to teach in the area of special needs will be closed off. They are asking that the statutory instrument is not signed. Will the Taoiseach provide a response on this? Will he ask the Minister for Education and Skills to do something about it? It is a very time-sensitive issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This motion is part of an ongoing and systematic cover-up, one involving the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and others in the House, of the country's collusion with aggressive and large-scale corporate tax avoidance by the largest and most profitable multinationals in the world operating in Europe, including this country. It is extraordinary that the only reason we are even debating this motion now is because I telephoned the Chief Whip's office yesterday morning to ask why there was to be no debate on this measure, an EU proposal, demanding country-by-country public reporting of the profits and affairs of the wealthiest multinationals. It is extraordinary that even some of those who have spoken against the Government motion are members of the committee that agreed it. Where was the dissent on this matter at the committee? It would have allowed the motion to pass yesterday without any debate on what constituted a minimal effort to require country-by-country transparent reporting and a blacklist of tax havens, which are correct and long-overdue measures. They do not go far enough, but at least they are moving in the right direction. Incredibly, the Government, Fianna Fáil and whoever else was on the committee went along with the idea that this measure should be blocked on the spurious grounds of subsidiarity, the rubbish notion that it transgresses into the area of tax policy. It is purely an accounting measure, one that requires multinationals operating across national borders to say where their profits are being generated. This is not a tax policy or tax measure. It simply addresses the deliberate and systematic hiding and shifting of profits by multinationals that are involved in staggeringly obscene tax evasions and in robbing the taxpayers of this country of tens of billions of euro and the taxpayers of the world of hundreds of billions of euro every year. When one asks why we have a housing crisis, a health crisis or growing poverty and inequality, the answer is that the wealthiest multinationals in the world do not believe in paying taxes, pay accountants to avoid paying them systematically and have certain governments, including ours, in their pockets to ensure that they get away with tax avoidance. This is happening belatedly and under pressure from the people, not the European Commission. People were angry at what happened in the recession, including the austerity and culpability of large corporate entities for it. They have demanded that there be some transparency and action in order to deal with corporate tax avoidance by the multinationals. In public statements, the Irish political establishment has claimed to be in favour of these measures but at its first opportunity to implement measures that would shine a light on the multinationals' massive systematic tax avoidance, it has moved to block them, cover up the situation and prevent a debate in the House. Similarly, the cameras at the finance committee were turned off for our discussion on whether to have Apple attend to explain its tax affairs in this country. That is the level of the collusion by the political establishment. The media is asleep at the wheel. This is the most important topic that has been discussed in the Dáil this week, yet it is the shortest debate. We would not even have had a debate but for the fact that we raised the matter. We are discussing billions of euro, yet there was not even going to be a debate. The establishment will now close ranks and push this through on a technicality in order to block a reform measure on what is the most important of areas. There is a direct correlation between poverty, unemployment, the crisis in our public services and growing inequality globally, and the ongoing practice of multinationals in this matter. The Irish political establishment has closed ranks, shut down debate, covered up the situation and colluded with people. It is outrageous. Thanks to the oversight of the left in this country, some alarm bells are being rung about the issue, there will be a vote and there has been some debate, albeit a ridiculously short-circuited one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was to be no discussion in the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of clarification, the motion was not to be discussed in the Chamber.
