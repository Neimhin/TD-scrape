RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the National Treasury Management Agency for attending before the committee. As we speak, the headlines are already appearing that the NTMA is saying we are going back to the bond markets. That is symptomatic of the superficiality of much of the media coverage of the debt crisis. It is assumed that it is a great step and that it should be our high aspiration and a cause for celebration that we would get back to the private debt markets. In an attempt to burst the bubble, could I put it to Mr. Corrigan that it is not a wonderful aspiration for the State? It would be far better if we did not have to borrow to the great extent to which we do. The reason we have difficulty in borrowing is precisely because of the level of debt we have. In other words, the bigger the debt, the more difficult it is to convince anyone to buy it.The problem is that we have this enormous debt and I do not believe anybody has any reason to slap themselves on the back about the way we are managing that because as far as I can see we are managing a debt that is not ours and are putting ourselves into an unsustainable situation where we are prey to the whim of these financial markets. That is the way I see it but it is not just me. The European Union Commission stated that if growth does not materialise and unemployment continues to stay high our debt is likely to be unsustainable. Is there not a better option from the point of view of managing our debt, namely, to repudiate the debt and say it is not our debt and we are not paying it?  Mr. Corrigan pointed to the fact that the key balance is the primary balance. Could he confirm that our primary balance position is not disastrous? If we exclude the debt interest we will pay back next year, which is €9.1 billion, our primary balance is manageable but our problem is that we are borrowing to pay back the lenders. That is the problem we must deal with and we are sinking ourselves in a hole by trying to continue to pay back this unsustainable debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is its hope, and it also indicates down-side risks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know what the troika thinks and hopes but I am asking Mr. Corrigan what he thinks. Would it not be a better option for us at this stage not to pay €9.1 billion in interest and just deal with our primary deficit, which is €6 billion? Would it not put us in a far better position if we said we are not paying this, our economy has been beggared, our citizens are being devastated and we need that money to invest in jobs and growth? If we told the troika that we could manage a primary deficit of €6 billion, would that not be a better management of our situation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly what I am talking about. It is somebody's debt, not our debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask Mr. Corrigan about the relationship between him and the Government. I do not want to personalise this but Mr. Corrigan is paid twice as much as the Taoiseach, and there are 47 people in the National Treasury Management Agency earning over €150,000 a year, in other words, more than most Ministers are earning. I wonder about the nature of this relationship. Who is advising who what to do and how to manage this situation? In terms of the various companies the NTMA has enlisted to run the small and medium enterprise, SME, funds, I know that previously it took advice from the Rothschild Group. I would be interested to know if it is still getting advice on the management of our debt crisis from the Rothschild Group, who are bondholders, or from the Carlyle Group, which is managing the SME fund. These are global asset managers. Are they advising the NTMA? Is that they circle in which NAMA moves? Obviously, those people would have the view that it would be unthinkable that we would repudiate the debt because they take the hit but our responsibility is to the citizens of this country. It is clear when we consider what is happening at the moment that the bond markets are happy with Ireland because the Government, the NTMA or both is telling them that we will pay them back every cent and will enforce whatever level of austerity and cuts on the citizens of Ireland that are necessary to pay them back. The bond markets express delight and buy Irish bonds because they know Ireland will do anything to give them back their money and make them a profit regardless of the cost to the Irish citizenry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people in the NTMA are the experts. Do they not advise the Government on how to deal with these matters?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one more question but Mr. Corrigan might answer the question I asked about the Rothschild Group and other consultants and asset management companies the NTMA might be paying or enlisting for advice, support or assistance in the management of our debt, funds and so on. Does the NTMA have responsibility for Coillte about which negotiations are ongoing for the sale of its harvesting rights? I am opposed to the sale of Coillte. We are selling an asset that could generate revenue for the State and create employment but what does Mr. Corrigan say to the charge that the valuation by NewERA of the harvesting rights, which I understand is about €600 million - that is the valuation Mr. Corrigan has given - which works out at about €500 per acre for the 1.2 million acres under Coillte control? The Woodland League and others concerned with forestry say that is a gross undervaluation of our State forestry and that this is a give-away of one of our most important natural resources. Would Mr. Corrigan respond to that and to the assertion I and others would make that it does not make any financial sense to give away the harvesting rights to forestry when if managed and invested in properly they could generate much more revenue and employment for the State if they were retained under public ownership?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough. I ask Mr. Corrigan to do as proposed. NewERA has valued our forestry lands at €500 per acre. Even I, as one who does not know very much about land valuation, can work out that this is a gross undervaluation, particularly in light of the widespread geological survey demonstrating what is under the forests. We have not seen the results, but they could mean some of the land is much more valuable. In that regard, is it not the responsibility of the NTMA to furnish us with the economic justification and advise the Government on whether there is good value. NewERA is dealing with State assets generally and the NTMA is involved in their management. Could we generate more revenue for and employment in the State if we operated differently or kept the assets in public ownership? The NTMA should set out the options that would result in the best value for the State. I appeal to it to do so. What is occurring is crazy in terms of achieving good value for the State and ensuring the good management of resources within the agency's remit.
