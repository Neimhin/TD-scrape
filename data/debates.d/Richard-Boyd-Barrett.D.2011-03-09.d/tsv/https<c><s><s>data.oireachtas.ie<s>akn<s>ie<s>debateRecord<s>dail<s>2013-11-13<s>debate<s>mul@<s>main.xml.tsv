RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been on tenterhooks waiting to see whether it would be before or after lunch. I strongly oppose this Bill which is a disgraceful attack on the elderly and the chronically sick. It represents a monstrous betrayal on the part of this Government of the promises that were made prior to the election about dealing with the crisis in our public health service and dealing with the two-tier system that persists in our public health service. As a general comment, it is becoming increasingly clear to me that the singular attribute of this Government is an attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes by manipulating the debate in this House and manipulating the media debate about what it is doing in order to cover its tracks for gross betrayals of election promises and for savage assaults on some of the most vulnerable sectors of our society. Nowhere is this more clear than in the butchering the Minister is meting out to the health service, to the chronically sick, to the vulnerable and to the elderly and we have seen the latest instalment in this outrageous budget.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I was saying to the Minister for Health earlier, the major attribute of this Government seems to be to try to manipulate the debate and cover up the realities of its savage betrayal of election promises and the brutal assault it is waging against ordinary citizens and public services. Nowhere is this more evident than in the health service. The promise was that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, would sort out the vast crisis in the public health service that the Government inherited from Fianna Fáil. We were to get free general practitioner care and universal health cover for everyone. The simple fact and the reality around what we are actually seeing in the health service is another €660 million worth of cuts from the public health service on top of €3 billion of cuts since 2008; a total of 10,000 staff removed from the public health service, including thousands of nurses; up to 1,700 beds removed from the public system since 2008; ambulance waiting times that are now exceeding safe limits; recurring stories of files being lost in hospitals; the downgrading of accident and emergency wards throughout the country, including in the coming weeks the downgrading of the accident and emergency ward in the hospital in Loughlinstown in my constituency; and a total of 237 people lying on trolleys in accident and emergency wards throughout the country today. As the Minister of State knows, I busted my shoulder last week playing football. I had to go to the accident and emergency ward in St. James's Hospital because I happened to be in town. When I went there it was like a flipping war zone. When I walked up to the window there was a woman in front of me whose head was bleeding. She asked the woman at reception how long it would be before she could see a doctor and she was told it would be between 11 and 12 hours. Needless to say, her distress was considerable at that point. I walked out because I did not have 12 hours to wait. That is the reality. Waiting lists for hospitals are so long that hospitals are refusing to give appointments to people because the waiting times are so far out. Now, the heads of four major Dublin hospitals are saying that as a result of the Government's cuts and the cuts inflicted by the last Government patient safety is being seriously compromised in our hospitals. The public health service is an absolute shambles no matter how much the Government tries to cover it up. Last week I said to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that it was strangely appropriate that the figure for cuts this year was €666 million, coincidentally, the mythical number of the beast from the Book of Revelations in the Bible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, that is what it is beginning to look like: a horror movie. If it was not so serious, one could make a film out of it and call it "The Return of the Beast, 666", produced by the troika, directed by Deputy Michael Noonan and staring, in the lead role as the beast, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, bringing death and pestilence to a hospital near you. Of course, it is not funny and it is not a play. The reality is a horror for vast numbers of people who are trying to access our public health system. Now, on top of all that, the Government is going to attack medical card provision for the elderly and the chronically sick. It is going to try to take medical cards away from as many people as it possibly can under the interesting term "medical card probity". The Government is going to increase prescription charges and axe the little tax relief that people who have been forced to take out private health insurance have. This will result in 90% of people who are having to pay through the nose for private health insurance, because they know the public system is a mess, no longer being able to afford that cover and they will be forced back into the public system, which cannot cope as it is. Then, they will have to pay through the nose because they will not have medical cards. The Government says people will get a general practitioner visit card. What this means is that there will be few savings in terms of the money the Government pays out to GPs per medical card, but the people who are really sick and who must go to hospital will suffer most because they will have to pay €100 to go to the accident and emergency ward, €75 to stay overnight in hospital, €75 for investigative procedures and €144 of the costs of their medication before those costs are covered. The Government will hit precisely the sickest people and the chronically ill. They are the people who will suffer. One could not make it up. Then, the Government tries to cover this by saying that these people have gold-plated incomes and €600. However, if a person is sick and has to go to hospital regularly for procedures or to accident and emergency wards or whatever, that money will soon evaporate in trying to cover those costs. The sicker a person is, the more it costs and the more a person needs the provision. However, the Government will rob precisely that medical card cover from people when they most need it. The other dastardly aspect of this is the Government's claim in response to the outrage and outcry about the attack it is waging on medical card cover for the elderly and the sick. The Government says it will give out discretionary cards to anyone who really needs them. When a person is sick, old or maybe even dying, he does not have much time to wade through the bureaucracy of making an application for a medical card. That is precisely the last thing a person should have to deal with in those circumstances, especially since he must now deal with the new centre in Finglas, which cannot cope, even now, which constantly loses applications and which is in an absolute mess. At least in the old days one could go to the HSE office in the local area, talk to a real human being and explain that a person is very sick, has particular circumstances and make an appeal for a medical card. However, now when a person is sick he must contact a post office box, not a human being, and get the run-around. It is absolutely outrageous. The alternative to this is what we have always proposed: real universal free health care for everyone and a national health service paid for through progressive taxation. Of course, the Government will not provide for this because it is unwilling to impose a little extra tax on the wealthiest in our society, the big corporations or on the accumulated wealth of the richest people. Instead, the Government is unloading the cost on the elderly, the sick, the young and the vulnerable. It is a disgrace and this Bill is a disgrace.
