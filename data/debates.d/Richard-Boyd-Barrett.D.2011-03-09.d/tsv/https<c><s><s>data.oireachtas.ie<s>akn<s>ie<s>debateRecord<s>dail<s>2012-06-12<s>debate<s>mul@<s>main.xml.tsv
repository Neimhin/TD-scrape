RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the six questions I had tabled cover three different aspects of the visit, I will ask about each of them.  In recent weeks and months, President Obama has been strident and often damning of the failure of European leaders to deal with the deepening crisis in the eurozone.  He has called consistently for more decisive and more concrete action to deal with the financial crisis in Europe.  He stated recently:If you are engaging in austerity too quickly, it makes it harder to pay off your debts.  Markets respond ... if you are contracting, they bet you're not going to be able to pay off your debts.He then added that after a bank bailout, a proper plan for growth is needed.  I could not have put it better myself.  This comment sums up months of criticism by President Obama of eurozone leaders and their failure to deal with this crisis, as it continues to worsen.  Moreover, President Obama's words are borne out by what has now happened in Spain on foot of the move to recapitalise that country's banks in the face of the ECB's insistence, as was the case in this country, that ordinary people should guarantee the bailout of the banks.  The result of this has been to plunge Spain now, just as was the case with Ireland previously, further into a debt spiral.  It is not time the Taoiseach heeded President Obama's words?  When the Taoiseach spoke to President Obama, did he make these views known to the Taoiseach?  Did he make known his understanding, as he has stated in public, that the approach being taken by eurozone leaders was a failure and was not working but that a different strategy, which moved in the opposite direction to austerity, was needed?  How did the Taoiseach respond to that?  How does he respond to President Obama's critique of euro leaders in the context of the unravelling of the current bailout of the Spanish banks, just as, of course, the so-called bailout of this country has unravelled and failed to deliver on its promise?In addition, I refer to the Taoiseach's engagement in the New York Stock Exchange.  Serious concerns have been raised over the presence of Mr. Denis O'Brien on the same platform as the Taoiseach, given that Mr. O'Brien is someone against whom very serious findings were made in the Moriarty tribunal and about the circumstances in which he was awarded the second mobile telephone licence and the assistance that was given to him in that regard by a former Fine Gael Minister, to whom he also was known to have given payments.  Moreover, I note Mr. O'Brien, a billionaire, is now a tax exile from this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been careful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I was very careful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, I was very careful about how I put it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the Ceann Comhairle's point.  I simply am summarising what was in the Moriarty report.  It made serious findings about the circumstances in which Mr. O'Brien received the aforementioned licence and about the role a former Fine Gael Minister had in helping him to secure that licence.  The report also noted that significant payments were made by Mr. O'Brien to Deputy Lowry.  Given this finding, does the Taoiseach consider it to have been appropriate for him to share the platform forum?  This is not simply an historical question and the Taoiseach should clarify his relationship and that of his party to Mr. O'Brien.  I ask him to so do particularly as a live issue faces us yet again in respect of Mr. O'Brien's recent acquisition of Siteserv plc and its facilitation by the writing down by Anglo Irish Bank of €110 million worth of debt to that company.  This deal deserves considerable scrutiny and in the context of the controversial plans to introduce water metering and water charges, I note Siteserv provides contracting services to Bord Gáis, including the installation of water meters.Finally, on foreign policy matters, did the Taoiseach raise the question of the recent massacre of 16 Afghan civilians by United States troops in Afghanistan?  Moreover, did the Taoiseach raise with President Obama the question as to the reason the western powers, led by the United States, continue to impose punitive sanctions on Iran, even though the International Atomic Energy Agency has made it absolutely clear it does not believe Iran is engaged in a nuclear weapons programme?  Did the Taoiseach ask him about the contrast between the treatment of Iran, which no one believes to have a weapons programme but on which sanctions are imposed, and the failure to impose sanctions on Israel, which everyone knows has a nuclear weapons arsenal but which does not have sanctions imposed on it and which in fact receives $3 billion in military aid each year from the United States?   Did the Taoiseach ask the President about those double standards, given the very worrying sabre-rattling going on about possible further sanctions or even military action against Iran, something that would be disastrous for the entire region and possibly for the world?.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were six questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not sure which part of the point I made about the Spanish banking crisis was not clear to the Taoiseach but surely it should be very clear that President Obama's criticism of the manner in which European leaders have dealt with the deepening financial crisis in Europe has gained renewed force from the unravelling of the so-called bailout programme for Spain's banks.  The country has borrowed money to recapitalise its banks but far from that stabilising the situation, and because the money has been routed through the Spanish sovereign, Spain will now have difficulty in borrowing elsewhere.  The markets look at the increased debt burden that has been forced onto the Spanish sovereign and its citizens, conclude that Spain will not be able to repay its debts and therefore do not wish to lend it money, with the result that bond yields go up, just as happened to us.My point is that President Obama's criticism of the manner in which eurozone leaders are dealing with the crisis has now been further vindicated with the unravelling of the Spanish banking crisis.  At what point do the Taoiseach and other European leaders begin to listen to what President Obama is saying, what a range of very mainstream and prominent economists are saying, what growing forces in Europe are beginning to say, namely, that continually bailing out the banks and making citizens of this country, or Spain, responsible for guaranteeing those borrowings and paying for it with austerity is a disastrous failure.  That was the other point made by the US President, about contracting demand in the economy and worsening a situation already made bad by states taking on board the gambling debts of private financial institutions.  Does the Taoiseach not believe the President Obama's criticism is correct and that we should start to listen to him in a way that, so far, European leaders have not done?I find it surprising that the Taoiseach would not raise the situation of Iran.  It is very serious, with very severe penalties involved and sabre-rattling about possible military assaults on Iran.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware of this but I understand Iran has begun to denominate oil sales in the Chinese currency.  It might be interesting for the Taoiseach to note that when the former Iraqi regime did the same thing it led to invasion by the United States, in the second Gulf war, as such a move could have very significant effects on the US and western economies.  I find it surprising, given the seriousness of the situation in Iran and the threats and sabre-rattling surrounding that country, with Israel joining in, of course, and the contrast with how Israel is treated in respect of its nuclear arsenal, that the Taoiseach would not wish to raise those issues and concern himself with them in his conversations with President Obama.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You do not get many answers anyway, Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The President says we are delivering the wrong answer.
