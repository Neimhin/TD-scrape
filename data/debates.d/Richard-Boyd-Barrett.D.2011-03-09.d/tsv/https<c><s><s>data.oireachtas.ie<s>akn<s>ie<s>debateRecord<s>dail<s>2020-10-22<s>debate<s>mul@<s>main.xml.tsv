RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The prospect of level 5 restrictions for the next six weeks is a pretty grim one. The normal social and human interaction that is the lifeblood of people will be curtailed to a very significant extent. It is, however, necessary for a very simple reason. For any who doubt that, and there are a few, it is necessary for the very simple reason that we cannot put our doctors and front-line health workers in a position where sick people, with Covid-19 or non-Covid related sicknesses, arrive at hospitals where there is no intensive care bed, staff or healthcare provision to look after them and they have to be turned away. That prospect is unthinkable. Whatever one thinks of the handling of the Covid pandemic, we simply cannot put our doctors and healthcare workers or sick people in that position. For this reason, we have no choice but to impose restrictions to try to drive down the infection rate of the virus. Having said that, I do not agree with the coercive approach the Government is trying to apply, with fines and powers to act against people whom the Government deems to be the problem, in sustaining the public health effort. When the first lockdown happened there was overwhelming support for it. There was no need for compulsion. People did it because they knew it was necessary. As difficult as it is, economically, psychologically, socially and in every other way, an overwhelming majority of people will endure the hardship. The subtext or underlying logic of the extension of the coercive measures and fines proposed by the Government was summed up by Deputy O'Dowd when he said the reason we are in this situation was some people's irresponsible behaviour. That is not the reason we are in this situation now. I will give examples of the reasons we are in this situation. The Government is exploiting student nurses because it has not staffed our hospitals properly. We have critically low levels of ICU provision, some of the worst in the western world. We will not properly pay the contact tracers we need to chase down the virus, and we have failed to recruit them. We did not act against the meat processing plants and no fines were issued in that sector. There is whole range of other failings by the Government and, critically, a failure to support people who are seeing their livelihoods hammered by the pandemic. We say we should reward and support people, rather than punishing them.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is rare that I am completely dumbfounded by the Government or the State but I really am dumbfounded. I am very curious to hear what the Minister has to say for himself in response to the points that have been made and to the request for a free vote, which I echo on behalf of survivors. I was talking to a survivor last night and she asked why on earth the Government would impose a whip on this issue. It is perhaps understandable on economic issues or certain political issues in the general sense of the word but why would one want to impose a whip in respect of an issue like this? The fact that the Government does makes me think that Deputy Gannon is being too kind, although I understand the motivation for what he says. I think this stinks, because if it did not stink, why would the Government impose the whip? Why would it not just say that we could have a free vote on it? It is a matter of conscience. The survivors are some of the people most abused by the institutions of church and State in this country. They are concerned about what the Government is doing and do not want it to do what it is doing, and it is going to impose a whip and ram through a Bill, despite those appeals and protestations. Why would the Government do that? Why would the Minister not accept any amendments? It stinks. There is more to it than the Minister is saying. His explanations for his actions do not add up. I do not understand the claim that seems to have underpinned what the Minister is doing, that somehow he is doing this to protect the records because otherwise they would be destroyed. What is the basis for the Minister saying that? I do not see it. I do not believe it is true, yet the Minister says it. Maeve O'Rourke's article sets out clearly why that is not the case, so why does the Minister say it? This stinks, particularly as the Minister is saying things that nobody believes to be true. Unless he provides a better explanation than he has given to date, I conclude that it stinks and that the worst possibilities are what is actually underpinning all of this, which is a continuation of the cover-up by the State of its appalling crimes against mothers and children. The State does not want to tell the truth about the dark crimes, the sins it committed and the manner in which the church and State colluded in the abuse of mothers and children. It is difficult not to conclude that that is clearly what is going on here. If the Minister can convince us otherwise, I am listening. The Ceann Comhairle said we should listen to each other. I am open to hearing an argument, but I have not heard an argument from the Government to date. There is much at stake for people here. There is the identities of the people who have already been traumatised. It is their history, and their identities. What right has the State to seal those up and to decide what is done with them and where they should go rather than the people whose histories and identities they are? It is absolutely shocking. In the spirit of what the Ceann Comhairle said about listening, I am hopeful that the Minister is listening to the appeals, questions and concerns and is going to convince us, to use the Ceann Comhairle's terms, that there is a good reason for what the Government is doing and that there is no reason to be suspicious about the imposition of a whip in respect of a matter like this. I suspect, however, that we are not going to be convinced. I hope I am wrong, but I suspect I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am getting texts from survivors expressing their disgust at what they are witnessing being done by the Minister and the Government. They are saying how pointless this whole exercise seems to be, given the Government's unwillingness to entertain amendments. Is it not pretty damning that the people who should be at the centre of this process are disgusted at what the Government is doing? Another person, whom I mentioned earlier, asked why on earth a whip was being imposed. That is a question the Minister has still not answered, by the way. Why would it be felt necessary to impose a whip? Why would the Minister want to impose a whip? I asked this person if he felt anything else needed to be said, as his point had been made. He just said I should invite the Minister to do the right thing by resigning to make history in preventing a great wrong being done. That man, on behalf of the survivors, is asking the Minister to make a statement that he is not willing to stand over this Bill and be part of a Government that would stand over what the survivors and victims do not want to happen. Is that not pretty damning too? Those were unsolicited texts from people who contacted me because they cannot believe what is happening. The Minister has been offered ways out of this situation. Deputy Br√≠d Smith and others have offered him a way out by proposing that he delete the section, which I do not have in front of me, on the imperative for the commission of investigation to report at the end of this month. If that section were deleted, it would create the space to consider this properly and give people a chance to challenge the sealing of archives. I do not know why the Minister would not take that section out on foot of the feelings of anger being expressed. On the specific group of amendments, I heard the Minister's answer regarding Tusla. I thought about his response and whether it was reasonable. I hope he will not take me up wrong because I and, I am sure, the survivors do not want to cast aspersions on the very many good people working in the Child and Family Agency. However, the issue here is the nature of State institutions, the imperatives, if one likes, that State institutions have and the pressures on these institutions to act in a particular way. They are State silos with their own imperatives and it is those imperatives that are not trusted by the survivors. That is perfectly understandable and it is why the survivors do not see Tusla as the right body. I will give an example of what I mean by that and how those imperatives can operate. I just stumbled upon this in a very topical context. A school principal emailed me with a circular on Covid-19 that was just sent out by the Department of Education to school principals. I cannot read out the exact wording here but the circular stated that if a teacher tests positive, the response of the principal should not be to call the HSE but to ring the Department, which will then arrange for a public health call that will then decide on any measures regarding close contacts and the possible exclusion of people. I ask myself why the Department of Education is interfering in a public health response in the context of the protection of children from a pandemic. Why is it doing that? The Department is doing that because it has its own imperatives and its imperative at the moment is to keep schools open. If this circular is correct, it would appear that it may be interfering with what should be the proper public health protocols regarding the close contacts of a positive Covid case. I hope the Minister understands the point I am making. It is the same, potentially, in the case of a body like Tusla. We have seen examples and instances of that because Tusla has its own imperatives which may conflict with the best interests of the people we are talking about in this Bill and their needs, wants and right to access information on themselves and their history and identity. That is why the survivors do not want Tusla to have this role, as I see it. They do not trust the imperatives of State bodies in particular instances because they may conflict with people's aspirations, needs and desires. I think they are right. They have a right to have that concern and to suggest instead a body that is a bit further removed from the imperatives of the State and would not be influenced by political imperatives to cover up certain matters or not to do things that might be damaging in some way to the State. The survivors are right to be concerned in that regard. They are right that it would be better to have that information in the hands of a body that is less susceptible to the political imperatives of a State body and its desire to protect itself or the State. I find it amazing that the Minister is willing to allow records to be sealed for 30 years when he is not sure what they contain. He is not quite sure what information could be in there that is relevant to particular individuals, their histories and the actions of the State in the abuse of mothers, children and individuals. It is astonishing that the Minister would allow that and think it is acceptable when he does not even know what is or is not being sealed. It is quite shocking that the Minister thinks it is okay for that to happen. I was born in a mother and baby home and my adoption was organised through St. Patrick's Guild, which is one of the institutions where there are records. I am lucky and I did not have a terrible history, but there are bits of my story about which I do not know. I might be curious to try to fill in those gaps at some point. It is possible that bits of my story, or important bits of many people's stories, could be sealed and that I and thousands of others would never have access to those bits of our identity and history. That is far more likely when some of those histories are absolutely terrible. As I said, I do not want to focus too much on myself because I was lucky. One of the people texting me at the moment went through not just one of these institutions but all of them and still has not managed to secure the information about their real identity and history. Perhaps part of that story is embarrassing to certain people. I know bits of my own story and bits of others and some of the circumstances surrounding the separation of children from their mothers and some of the characters who were involved at the upper echelons of the State and the church are very embarrassing for them. Powerful people utilised these institutions to protect themselves from some of their shameful and hypocritical behaviour. Is that some of the information that will be sealed up? We might never get to see it but it could impact on the lives and histories of real individuals still existing who have the right to know their story and all the facts surrounding their histories and their lives. Apparently it is okay to seal that and that the Minister would not even know whether it was sealed or not. It is unbelievable that the Minister thinks it is okay that this would happen when he has been given an out. A few suggestions have been made of ways out for the Minister not to do what he is proposing to do. He should do the right thing by the victims who are out there asking him not to do this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. Any respite for people who are threatened with eviction is better than their not getting that respite at all. This is true in the current circumstances and in any circumstances where people face the possibility of being made homeless by a landlord, overwhelmingly because that landlord wishes to sell a property or refurbish it or, as also happens, the landlord says that he or she needs to do so when, in fact, the intention is to get rid of the tenant and increase the rent. In any event, to be made homeless, particularly in a situation where it is nearly impossible, as it is in many areas, to get alternative accommodation, puts people in a terrible situation. If one is evicted by one's landlord, it is, in many cases, a recipe for ending up in emergency accommodation, couch surfing or living in overcrowded conditions with family members or friends. To get respite from that at any time, including in the midst of a pandemic, is certainly better than having the threat of eviction hanging over people. However, I really do not see why the provisions in this Bill are limited to level 5 restrictions and the ten days after they are lifted. It is almost a form of cruelty to do that, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. The idea that one's landlord cannot evict one for the next six weeks but will get the green light to do so before Christmas is an awful prospect and a terrible thing to inflict on people. We are talking about very real and live situations. I have raised the situation of the St. Helen's Court residents in D√∫n Laoghaire with the Minister many times. They are still in the same situation, waiting for the axe to fall as their landlord continues to try to push them out. In the same block where these people, including families, have been resident for many years are ten apartments owned by the same landlord that have been sitting empty for two years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no justification for what is happening to those people. Whatever about the perfect being the enemy of the good, which is the argument the Government is making in saying that we cannot solve everything right now because of constitutional limits and so on - I do not buy that argument, by the way - there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever, when we have a Covid strategy and when the Government has made clear we will probably be facing further intense restrictions in the new year, for not at least retaining the ban on evictions until this pandemic has passed.We are in the midst of a pandemic, and the Minister acknowledges that until we have a vaccine this is going to be an ever-present threat. Under any such circumstances or any level of restrictions, how is it acceptable for people to be homeless, to be put into overcrowded housing conditions, to be put out on the street or to be put into emergency accommodation? How could it possibly be compatible with public health? How could it possibly be fair? It is clearly not. To do that to people at the best of times is cruel and terrible and should not be allowed. The Minister supported our Anti-Evictions Bill when he was in opposition. To allow this to happen during a pandemic at any point until the pandemic has come to an end is absolutely unacceptable. The Minister said the emergency situation we are in allows the Government to impose a ban on evictions. Why then is it limited to level 5? Why would the ban not be for the entirety of the pandemic? There is no good reason other than continuing to pander to the landlords. The right to private property and, critically, the right to make money from private property is actually higher up the pecking order of concerns of the Government than the absolute imperative to ensure nobody is made homeless at any point during this pandemic, regardless of the restrictions being at level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. I will leave it at that. We will vote for this, of course, but really the Minister should give people the security from the possibility of homelessness at least for the entirety of the pandemic and the public health threat it brings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the reasons we opposed the extension of the emergency legislation today, and will oppose the plan to impose fines in connection with the public health restrictions, is not because we do not support the public health measures or think that people should not comply with them to drive down the virus, but because we do not think coercion is the way to achieve compliance with public health measures. We believe persuasion is the way. The other reason is that it implies that the reason we now have a rising infection rate such that we need a lockdown is that of the behaviour of ordinary citizens rather than the behaviour of the Government. Here is an instance of what we are talking about. We know, for example, that congregated and overcrowded settings are conducive to the transmission of the virus. At any level of infection where the pandemic persists, the Government is actually endangering public health by allowing people to be homeless. The Government should be fined for doing that. A pensioner in my area was made homeless during the previous lockdown. He could have invoked the legislation, but he did not feel he could stand up to the landlord. In any event, I think it was an Airbnb property so, although I am not sure, it could possibly be one of the instances covered by Deputy √ì Broin's previous amendment. He was a pensioner who was made homeless and he had to live in a shed for the entirety of the lockdown. His name is Brian. The only accommodation this pensioner was offered was in hostels in town, where he was obviously afraid to go because of his vulnerability to the virus. That is what was on offer for him from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE. If we allow people to become homeless, not just at level 5, but at any level of infection or where it is necessary for restrictions and while the pandemic persists, the Government is creating the conditions for the further transmission of the virus. It is. I do not understand how the Minister can shake his head. That is the case if he allows people to be put into homelessness or into homeless accommodation in congregated settings. I honestly do not know why the Minister is shaking his head. I will give him another example of a mother who was put into a hostel. This is precisely to the point.I have a case of a mother and her kids who were put into hostel in town while her kids go to school in D√∫n Laoghaire. That was all she was offered. She said that although they had their own-door accommodation, such was the situation in the hostel on Gardiner Street that there were kids from other families running in and out of the room where they were staying. They were also sharing bathrooms and so on. She was extremely worried from a public health point of view about herself and her kids. She then had to drag her kids out at 7 a.m. every morning to D√∫n Laoghaire to bring them to school. She was working as well and nearly lost her job. This was all at the lower level of restrictions before even the Government came in with various levels. She was extremely worried about her health in those conditions with numerous kids from multiple families running in and out of each other's rooms and sharing bathrooms. Those are precisely the conditions we should not put people in during a pandemic. However, the Minister plans to do that as soon as we go down to level 4, level 3 or level 2, even though it is precisely those kind of settings which can then drive it back up again. It is madness. I do not see why the Minister would not accept this amendment, notwithstanding the wider debate about the issue of homelessness and banning evictions altogether. We will have that debate on another day. For the period of the pandemic with the possibility of infection rates continually going up and down, I cannot see how the Minister can justify not having a blanket ban on evictions. I think it is poppycock from the Attorney General from a legal and constitutional point of view while the Government and the Chief Medical Officer want to drive infection rates down by December to ensure we can come out of level 5. At the same time, NPHET modelling suggests it is more than likely that early in the new year infection rates will start to rise again once we leave the current restrictions. In turn, we will be into another lockdown and, as Deputy Pringle said earlier, we will be in another one three months down the line after that. Why would the Minister have people on tenterhooks as to whether they could possibly be evicted? There is an irrefutable case for having at least a six-month moratorium on evictions. I am interested to hear the Minister's response but I think it is an unanswerable case to have a six-month eviction ban, if not one during the duration of the pandemic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I never said there would be a flood of evictions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will let Deputy Barry speak for himself, but I never said that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I said in my contribution and previously was that it is a fact that the majority of people who come into my clinic because they are threatened with eviction are in that position because the landlord is selling. It is not a flood, but there is a constant flow of people of all ages into my clinic. As a result of the eviction ban which applied during the heavy lockdown the number of people entering homelessness declined. That is a fact. Logically, it followed that when the ban was lifted the number of cases began to rise again. The Minister knows the numbers better than I do. I am not saying it was a flood of cases, but people who were protected are no longer protected. There is one specific question where this amendment is concerned. I have the Citizens Information website in front of me. The Minister can go on that website right now and see the terms of the level 3 restrictions. People are not allowed to leave their county. If I live in Shankill and my landlord decides to put me out, one of the places I will have to look is across the county border in Bray. I will not find anything closer to D√∫n Laoghaire, where rents get more and more expensive. That is totally out of reach. If I am lucky I might get somewhere in Bray. However, level 3 restrictions mean that someone cannot leave Shankill to look for an apartment in Bray, which would be hard to find anyway. People are not allowed to have visitors to their houses under level 3 restrictions, never mind level 4. One man, Brian, has been told there is no place for him but he can apply for a housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy. One man who came to my clinic is in his 70s. He has several serious ailments. He is a long way down the social housing waiting list and he has been told to look for a HAP tenancy. At a time when level 3 restrictions prevent people from visiting each other and older people should be protecting themselves, does the Minister think they should be traipsing around looking for HAP tenancies? I certainly do not. It contradicts public health advice. If someone like that is evicted because they are not protected during this period, the Minister is endangering their health. He is encouraging them to breach the public health guidelines his own Government has imposed.  As I said earlier, making people homeless is simply incompatible with the drive to protect public health and to get people to adhere to the most basic precautions by limiting social contact. That applies as long as we are facing a pandemic, not only while we are under level 5 restrictions. That case is absolutely unanswerable. The Minister is saying that this may be true at level 5, but if we go to level 4 or level 3 it will not be true any more. He has not answered that point because he cannot. I will be interested to see if he can, but otherwise he should drop his objection to this amendment and let it pass.
