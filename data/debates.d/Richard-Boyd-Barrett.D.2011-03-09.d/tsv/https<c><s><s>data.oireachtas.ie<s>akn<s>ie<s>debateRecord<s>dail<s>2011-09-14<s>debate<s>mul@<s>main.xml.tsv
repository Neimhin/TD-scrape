RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a State company, the ESB played a key role in transforming Ireland from a Third World country to a modern state.  In any rational approach in dealing with the current economic crisis, is it not the case that a successful and profitable company such as the ESB should be kept in public ownership and investment be made in it to develop sustainable energy resources and so forth?  This would allow us energy independence, thus ensuring people would not have to be shivering with the cold this winter in their homes, afraid to turn on the heating because of fluctuations in energy market prices.How does the EU and the IMF justify its insistence on the sale of State assets which could drive economic recovery?  Will the Minister agree such sell-offs are actually attempts to asset strip this country, using the guise of the current recession which was caused by the bankers and bondholders in the first place?  How can anyone construe an argument that a sale of even a bit of the ESB could possibly be good for this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister knows the point of my question, which is the extent to which the people of this country will benefit from gas and oil production under the terms that currently operate.  It is not very clear to me what €190 million represents as a proportion because the Minister has not really answered that question.  If I am correct in understanding what the Minister said, €190 million is the total tax take from the three fields I have asked about.  I ask the Minister to clarify this for me.  What I want to find out is how much tax revenue has been received from those fields as a proportion of the overall income generated so that we can know the actual percentage rather than the figures of between 25% and 40% being bandied around as to what we might receive.  It is like the corporation tax rate which we are told is 12.5% but actually the effective tax rate is 10%.  How much are we actually getting back?  I doubt very much we will get 40% back, given the other methods for the tax write-offs on capital costs and so on which means, I suspect, that in many cases we will get virtually nothing back from some of these fields, no royalties and no security of supply.  We cannot even control prices because we have effectively given away these gas and oil reserves under the conditions of the licences.  How can we justify a situation where at best we are talking about 40% while in Iran, for example, there are service-sharing agreements by which the state maintains the ownership of the gas and in Norway the state receives a 78% tax rate and it owns 67% of the gas and oil?  Why are we giving away the gas and oil and what will we be getting back in return?  Some of us suspect it will be nothing.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even at €80 million a pop, would it not be better for us to borrow the money to invest in a State company to do some drilling rather than borrowing €100 billion to bail out banks?  Could we not have borrowed a fraction of that sum to drill because there are estimates of the equivalent of tens of billions of barrels of gas and oil offshore?  Would this not have been a better investment than borrowing €100 billion to bail out rotten banks, speculators and bondholders?The Minister did not answer my question.  What I am trying to elicit is what are we getting back from the fields that were exploited.  I understood the Minister to say that we were getting €190 million in royalties but what was the total take we got as against what the companies made?  That would give a real sense of what we get back under those arrangements, even in a field that is in production.There are other methods to entice in companies to explore.  Why do we have this unique arrangement whereby as soon as the companies go into production we give it to them?  That is unique.  Why are we doing it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not functioning.
