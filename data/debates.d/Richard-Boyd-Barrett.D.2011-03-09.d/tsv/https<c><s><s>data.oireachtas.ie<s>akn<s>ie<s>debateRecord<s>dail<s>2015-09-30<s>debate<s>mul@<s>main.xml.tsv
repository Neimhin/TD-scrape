RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Wallace should not be pessimistic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question of climate change is simply too important for there not to be the fullest possible scrutiny and oversight of mitigation plans and of the actions to be taken to reduce CO2 emissions. I do not see why the Minister should resist these amendments, of which mine is amendment No. 50, which all make the same point that these plans need to be assessed and scrutinised by the entire Oireachtas. It is about hardwiring the question of dealing with climate change into the political system so it does not become a decision for the Government of the day which will spin its view of the situation on climate change. Instead, there will be the fullest possible scrutiny of the issue and it will be centre stage in the political system, overseen in the most transparent and accountable way by all the political forces of the Dáil and the public who will be looking in. It is necessary that the entire matter be fully interrogated on a regular basis. This series of amendments is fully in line with the promised democratic revolution. I do not really see how the Minister can say with a straight face that he remains committed to democratic reform, Dáil reform, political reform and the high-blown rhetoric of democratic revolution and then resist this. A capital plan has just come out and announcements about dealing with the housing crisis are being made month after month but we never get a real opportunity to scrutinise the detail of these announcements. Instead, we get Government by press conference, press release, photo-op and political stunt where the Government merely appears to be doing something. We have blaring headlines suggesting something big, something good and dramatic is happening on a particular issue but we never get the opportunity to scrutinise the detail. The reason we do not get the chance to scrutinise the detail is that if we did get the chance to do so, the whole thing would unravel and we would discover that nothing was really happening. It is all generalities and any measures are simply rehashed and recycled versions of measures that have been announced previously while nothing is happening on the ground. In fact, in many cases, the situation is getting much worse on the ground, as is certainly the case with the housing crisis.It should not be allowed happen with the housing crisis, which is a disaster, but let us not compound that sort of bad politics by doing the same on an issue as important and as vital to the survival of humanity and this planet as climate change. I do not see why the Minister would resist these amendments and I do not see what is at stake other than a desire by the Government to continue closed and unaccountable government that operates by diktat and spin. If that is not the Government Fine Gael and the Labour Party are, and they are keen to prove they are serious about open, accountable, more democratic government, then they should agree to these amendments. They relate to the most basic reform of democracy that one could imagine. Important plans should be subject to such scrutiny and it would send a clear message that the Government is serious about the issue of climate change and so serious that it intends to hard-wire regular scrutiny of the matter into the political system in order that it cannot be spun, ignored or manipulated by this or that Government now or in the future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's attitude to these amendments sums up why the political system is so discredited and why people are so alienated from it. I am surprised he is shaking his head because the language the Government parties used when they were elected about democratic revolution was used precisely because they knew that the slaughtering the previous Government received at the polls was at least in part due to enormous disaffection and alienation from the political system and the political establishment, which continues to exist. The Government parties felt the need to use that language because they knew that is what the people wanted. They want more accountability, a more participatory democracy and more oversight of what governments do regarding the decisions that affect them. A democracy which is just about an election every five years with the Government going off to do what the hell it likes in the interim is discredited. It needs to change and this was acknowledged in the programme for Government, but like so many other proposals, the Government parties are busily abandoning it.In this case, it is abandoning it on an issue that is of vital importance for the survival of the planet, namely, that of climate change. All that is being asked in these amendments is that the effectiveness of the national mitigation plan to do with reducing CO2 emissions, and the measures that will be taken to do that, would be scrutinised by the Houses of the Oireachtas and not simply spun by the Government of the day in whatever way it feels like so doing. That is extremely important because, as I said, many of these announcements and plans are being made about crucial issues such as housing and capital investment. We get the public relations, the press release and the photo opportunity but we do not get an opportunity to scrutinise the detail. However, that is the point of democracy. That is the point of this House and it is what the people are demanding. The Minister is flying in the face of the demands of the people of this country for real democratic, thoroughgoing reform. He is reverting to type in terms of the way a discredited political establishment has done its business for far too long. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister on this. There is nothing at stake in accepting these amendments except reform of, and improvement in, democracy, which would require that the scrutiny of our efforts to deal with climate change would be hardwired into the political system. That is what we are asking for. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is telling that some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition that were specific in terms of targets for CO2 emissions reductions were ruled out of order on the basis that they would be a charge on the Exchequer. I know it has nothing to do with the Minister, but I find that fact interesting, because that tells its own story. The Government does not want specific targets in the national mitigation plan because they will cost it money. We need to deal with runaway and irreversible climate change. It threatens the future of humanity. We will have rising sea levels, greater levels of flooding, more desertification and threats to food security. There is also the potential of those things already happening in the area of fuel. We have conflict, war, starvation, famine and mass migration. All of these serious things are already happening. If we reach the tipping point because we fail to take concrete, specific and decisive action on climate change, we are facing into a very dark future that is not too far away.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is because they cannot make enough profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have not even met them for this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Craig is still on the beach in Killiney along with seven or eight other people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would take four years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment relates to the key question of targets so that we can chart whether we are making concrete and tangible progress towards reducing CO2 emissions or whether our mitigation plans for reducing emissions are just aspirational general policy objectives and not really measurable in terms of real improvements and reductions. This goes to the heart of the matter we debated on Committee Stage and are debating again now, namely, the Government’s resistance to the introduction of specific measurable targets which could establish whether we are making real progress over the plan’s period. As I said before the sos, although it was not the Government’s decision, it is an interesting coincidence that some of the more specific amendments relating to targets were ruled out of order on the grounds they would be a charge on the Exchequer. This really gets to the heart of the matter because we are going to have to put money into meeting targets and dealing with climate change. This is why the Government does not want to commit to these targets and why it did not want the afforestation targets I proposed in the forestry Bill. Generally, the Government does not like targets because they are measurable and specific. It likes very general targets that can be pushed way out into the future so it cannot be held accountable as to whether tangible progress has been made towards meeting general aspirational targets, and as we know with so many of the Government’s aspirational targets announced a few years out. For example, in response to one of the topical issues of the moment, the Government said it was going to get rid of homelessness by 2016. Here we are approaching 2016 but we are going in the opposite direction in dealing with the problem. It sounded very good when it was initially proposed. That is the problem with general far-out targets. They sound good now but often will not materialise unless there is a clear tangible roadmap towards the achievement of those targets and where we can measure our progress on a yearly basis. That is why many of us on this side of the House are pushing for more specific binding targets. It is telling that the Government is resisting these amendments and proposals. Members on this side are merely acting as conduits for those environmental groups campaigning on the whole area of climate change. Those groups are adamant that we must have these types of targets. If we do not, then we are not serious about dealing with climate change. Given its response to those calls for specific targets, it is clear the Government is not serious and this is just window-dressing, as is so often the case with legislation it puts through to deal with matters of critical importance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made the historical point once before and it is always a point that strikes me very forcefully, so I will make it again as I think it very relevant to the debate about climate change and the future capacity of our society to sustain itself. The historical point is this. The reason the great civilisations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, which were the first great civilisations created by human beings, collapsed was that the people who ran those civilisations failed to invest in and sustain the infrastructure and basis on which those civilisations had arisen. Great advances in technology, in industry and in knowledge which had led to the development of those societies were completely undermined by the myopia and blindness of the people who ran them, who started to use that wealth and resources, not to sustain their civilisation, but essentially to aggrandise themselves. This is symbolised in things like pyramids, where the massive pyramids built were of no use to the society but were just monuments to the power and self-importance of the rulers and Pharaohs. Similar things were done in ancient Mesopotamia. This was instead of investing in infrastructure, both human and physical, and the means through which those societies sustained themselves. In those days, it was the question of irrigated canal systems around the great rivers which allowed those societies to rise. That same scenario is now playing out in the world where, literally, the basis of our civilisation is being undermined by the myopia and blindness of the people at the top.They have the technological, industrial and intellectual capacity to sustain our civilisation and help it progress and develop in the interests of the whole of humanity, but they fail to do that and instead use all the wealth and resources to aggrandise themselves, spending on wasteful, damaging and dangerous things that threaten to undermine the basis of society. That is what is going on. We look at the terrifying displacement of millions of people in parts of the world because of what the western world has done in those places and think it is bad now, but we have yet to see the impact of runaway climate change. It is already a major contributory factor to displacement of millions of people in these areas, but displacement will get out of control if we do not take action now. The scenes we have seen in the past few weeks will be as nothing. They will pale into insignificance compared to what is coming down the line unless we deal with this matter. Countries like Ireland, with its reputation as a green country, are deeply implicated by failing to act on this matter which is having a devastating effect in the developing world. Our CO2 emissions are 80 times greater than countries like Malawi, but these countries are suffering the devastating consequences of what we have done and are doing to the environment. Despite this and the consequences being wreaked on these countries, we still think in our narrow self-serving way that we should not do anything that might impact adversely on our short-term, narrow self interest. As Deputy Stanley pointed out, it is not in our self interest. In the whole of Europe, Ireland is one of the countries set to be worst hit by rising sea levels. This will be a mammoth cost to the State. We have already seen the impact of flooding, but the costs we have seen to date will be as nothing compared to the cost that will affect us in the coming years if we do not do something about it now. Yet, the Government sets its face against doing anything concrete. It must be seen to do something, so we get a Bill full of vague, meaningless aspirations but with nothing we can be tied to, nothing that will cost us anything. As Deputy Clare Daly rightly said, this is linked to austerity. Ultimately, our inability to invest in the sort of long-term measures necessary to deal with this is the flip side of the coin of paying out €8 billion in interest to the bankers and the bondholders - modern pharaohs in historic terms. They are the modern version of the pharaohs who dug the grave of ancient civilization. The same gang is doing it for our civilization, while we are on our bended knees obeying their every command and refusing to take any action in a range of areas.  Climate change is one of the most important issues, this global question of whether our planet can sustain food production and prevent massive flooding that will put significant parts of the globe under water, including parts of this country. Parts of our country will be devastated, as we have seen from river flooding already. Yet, the Government has set its face against change and seems uninterested. It wants to be able to say it passed the Bill, but it is not really interested. Earlier I gave an example of this lack of interest that drives me mad. When I proposed specific amendments to the Forestry Bill when it was going through the House, proposing annual targets for greater levels of afforestation, the Government's answer was "No". It was not interested. A shocking fact that many people in this country are unaware of is that the State forestry company, Coillte, is not allowed engage in afforestation, because of EU rules. That is madness, yet nobody is raising it as an issue. We are talking about dealing with climate change, but the State forestry company which was set up to plant trees is prohibited from planting them by EU state aid rules. It is madness but the Government does not want to do anything about it. Instead, we continually submit to the people who inflict this madness on us or to those whose economic interests or personal or corporate wealth is dependent on us doing nothing. We act as their lickspittles and servants. The culmination of this is a Bill that will do nothing and in four, five, ten or 15 years time, when the crisis has got worse, the Government of the day will blame the previous lot, who are then all retired, and say it is their fault. That Government will then say it will do something and will come up with another plan that will be long on aspiration and short on detail and the same process will continue. It is time to stop this nonsense and be specific and that is what this amendment is about. Be specific and be tied to targets. Any government can be measured against specific projections on CO2 emissions and targets to assess whether it is serious. If we did this now, we would discover very quickly that we are not serious at present.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	True.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am listening to the scientists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to the slaves who died making them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State kidding?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 8, to delete lines 10 and 11 and substitute the following:"(f) the findings of any relevant research on the effectiveness of mitigation measures and adaptation measures, including the management of soil carbon and the protection and rewetting of wetlands,".The amendment refers to another issue to which the Government must have regard in producing the national mitigation plan and, in particular, suggests that we need to take account of "the management of soil carbon and the protection and rewetting of wetlands", because this is a huge area of potential carbon sequestration, in addition to research on the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation measures. As we develop our understanding of this and its effectiveness in acting as a carbon sink and reducing CO2 emissions, it must be an important element to which to have regard in developing an effective mitigation plan. This is a reasonable and practical amendment and I hope the Government will accept it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the point has been made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly endorse Deputy Stanley's amendment. Monoculture or overdependence on one or two agricultural sectors is a very dangerous game. We need to diversify enterprise and industry generally, as well as agriculture. The idea we would have an ever onwards and upwards beef export industry or we can solely rely on the beef and dairy sector is a mistake. It makes us vulnerable to any sort of serious fluctuations, increased competition, diseases and other factors which could potentially hit a single sector and, therefore, make the entire economy vulnerable. We learned about the folly of overconcentration on a particular sector with the property crash. It would be devastating if we did not learn the same in the areas of agriculture which we have prioritised. One has to have diversity in this sector basically for safety, sustainability and protection of the economy. I do not know as much as Deputy Stanley does about the sugar beet sector and the sugar industry. However, it is an amazing fact that even in Dún Laoghaire, people regularly approach me to decry the collapse of the indigenous sugar industry and that it was a national tragedy to allow it to happen. The passion and conviction with which this point is put, a point echoed by Deputy Stanley, coming from an area very much affected, indicates the need to take the resurrection of that industry seriously. Another important sector in which we have desperately underperformed and which we have allowed to decline is forestry. Of course, there were historical reasons it was devastated under British rule. It is an absolute tragedy and shame that in the country in Europe which has the best conditions for growing trees, we have the lowest level of forest cover. This is a perfect crop for addressing climate change, CO2 emissions, as well as dealing with the consequences of climate change and environmental damage and yet we have failed spectacularly to develop the sector. In so far as we have developed it, again it has been on a monocultural basis with one crop being prioritised, which has questionable effects on soil and water quality, as well as making it vulnerable to disease. This is an area in which we should be diversifying and expanding to a significant extent.There are many other such areas but a focus on the diversification of crops to develop industry, enterprise and agriculture could be beneficial in terms of meeting our targets. It would be environmentally sustainable and good economically, socially and in every other way. This must be a key part of our moving towards a sustainable future and dealing with climate change. It is a reasonable and sensible amendment and I see no reason the Minister of State would not accept it. It is very much the direction in which we need to go if we are to think outside the box and widen our horizons. In some cases, we need just go back to things we used to do. This was a forest-covered country. We also had a sugar industry. Both of those have been devastated but there are things in these areas we could do terribly well, realising multiple benefits at every level. The Minister of State should accept the amendment. More important, however, this Government and future Governments need to take the spirit of the amendment seriously in addressing not just climate change but also a sustainable economic and environmental future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whose telephone is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has already been made - but it took an economic crisis for this Government and governments across Europe to recognise it - that we need independent economists to assess budgets, spending decisions and macroeconomic priorities so that there is an early warning signal, so to speak, with regard to mistaken behaviours that could wreak havoc on the economy and our society. Despite the fact that I may have issues with some of the recommendations of the Fiscal Advisory Council, I see the benefit of having an independent group of economists assessing the wider economy, what the Government is doing, its budgets and setting out whether it thinks there are dangers. The reports and figures it produces are very useful. In that sense, it is quite a good model and one which should be followed in this area of equal if not, arguably, much greater importance, which is an area that concerns the management of our environment so that it remains sustainable for human existence and society.It does not get much more important than that. To have that group independent in assessing our mitigation plans and Government policies and priorities in this area appears to be a no-brainer. As Deputy Daly said, there were positive sounds from the Government on Committee Stage on this front, so let us hope they will be followed through with an agreement on the Government's part to accept this series of amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State could elaborate on it a little.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should introduce the amendment properly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What number is the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If they are grouped together, should the Minister of State not move it now to explain it to us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not about voting. It is about explanation. The Minister of State's silence is stunning. We are dealing with a group of amendments and in the case of every other group of amendments we have dealt with, the Members who tabled them have all spoken, after which we received the Minister of State's response. It is astonishing that the Minister of State-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State responded to the points we made and then mentioned, at the end, that he has tabled amendment No. 124 to deal with this area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. It would be very helpful if the Minister of State would elaborate a little more about what he means regarding the independence of this body, who else will be on it and how it will be selected, so we can be satisfied that it fully addresses the concerns we have raised in our amendments. We do not wish to call votes for the sake of it. We would like to say that the Minister of State's amendment covers the matter and, therefore, our amendments are not required as the Government has listened. We would like to be able to say that, but it would be helpful if the Minister of State could elaborate a little more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difference between what the Minister of State is proposing and what we are proposing, and I hope the Minister of State will speak to it and explain as he still has not done that, is that while he is making a statement that it will be independent in its functions, it still will have the ex officio members rather than what was proposed to him by us and the environmental lobby. We proposed that the agencies he wishes to designate as ex officio members would be essentially a secretariat technical support for an independent body of people, similar to the Fiscal Advisory Council. It is not that these people and agencies would not have an input, but that they would not be ex officio members of the advisory committee. They would be technical support to the advisory committee. That is an important distinction. While making some concession to our concerns, the Minister has not gone the full way towards the Fiscal Advisory Council model but has retained some element of the insiders, as it were, being a permanent part of this advisory body.The real point is that this is not full independence when that was what was being sought, although with technical support from bodies such as the agencies referred to in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State can persuade us otherwise, but what we are proposing is still superior to what he is proposing.
