RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should dispense with red herrings.  Those of us who are critical of some aspects of politicians' and public servants' pay or allowances are not directing our criticisms - or at least, I and the United Left Alliance are not directing them - towards the vast majority of public servants, who, as the Minister rightly says, have been hit extremely hard with levies and effective pay cuts of 15% to 20% over the last few years.  In the majority of cases, these cuts were unfair and unjustified, and they have resulted in significant economic damage.  My concern is about pay at the top level of the public service, and not only the public service; I am concerned about excessive pay in the private sector as well.  I find it obscene in almost any circumstances, but particularly in circumstances of recession and the imposition of brutal austerity measures on low and middle-income families, that any public servant, or anybody paid with public money or employed by a fully owned State or semi-State company, is earning ten or 15 times the lowest wage.  In the case of ESB, I believe the chief executive is getting in the region of €800,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is he on now?  Is it €600,000 or €500,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the issue.  The Minister is suggesting that we are looking for soundbites.  The issue is justice in the context of economic recession.  I find it unjustifiable that politicians or people paid with public money can be earning ten times the amount somebody on the lowest level of income is getting - somebody who is living in poverty in the current climate.  Of course there should be fair remuneration for a job done, but I do not see why the Taoiseach needs €200,000 a year and I do not see why Ministers need €140,000 or the Tánaiste needs €180,000.  I do not see how it can be justified when we are imposing brutal austerity on people on the lowest level, who are being plunged into poverty as a result of Government decisions.  How can it be justified?  When allowances are thrown in on top of that, as well as significant budgets for public relations-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Look at the figures that were published in  The Irish Times during the week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but it is all of those things combined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All right.  On the issue of PR-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think it is justified.  It is as simple as that.
