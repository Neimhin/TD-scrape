RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank IBEC for its presentation. I welcome three specific areas that IBEC highlighted in its presentation. The first of these is the need to challenge the fiscal rules in the area of investment. I suppose related to that is the good, simple and straightforward idea of a target percentage of GDP for capital investment. Frankly, the latter is something the committee should push. If one does not, as IBEC has highlighted well, with a growing population and a significant investment infrastructure deficit we will encounter serious problems. We are encountering such problems and they will get worse. I very much welcome that and agree with IBEC. I also welcome and agree with the strong emphasis IBEC placed on social housing in its document and the need to significantly ramp up investment in that and look for a derogation on the fiscal rules, if I understood IBEC correctly. In that regard, does IBEC also think that the state aid rules are a problem for us in ramping up investment?I firmly believe they are holding us back from being able to invest in a number of areas, including social housing and forestry, the potential of which I think we need to discuss further. Maybe the witnesses will comment on that. Do the witnesses think there is a bit of alarmism going on with regard to Brexit, which everybody is talking about? Frankly, we do not really know what it is yet. I heard Donal O'Donovan, who is not exactly on my side of the political spectrum, correctly saying at the weekend that when the dust settles from all the political hyperbole, rhetoric and position-taking, things will settle down when it is seen that it is not really in any anybody's interests in Europe, Britain or elsewhere to create too much friction between the economies. Regardless of what we might think about the nasty racist ideas of UKIP and Theresa May, etc., the real economic imperatives and connections will assert themselves as the need for less friction becomes evident. It is already evident here between the North and the South and between this country and Britain. Nobody here thinks the discordant approach makes any sense. Do the witnesses agree that things might settle down in this respect? Many of the negative impacts we are already feeling relate to currency fluctuations. What is the view of the witnesses in that regard? My feeling is that the problems in this regard will settle down too. It is even possible that when things settle down, the English currency might increase significantly in value again. I think it will. People like a currency, like the Swiss currency, that is outside the EU and is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, stable. I would be interested to hear the witnesses' take on that. Some of us have been saying for a long time that this country's economic model has a significant overreliance on foreign direct investment. The dangers of that have been highlighted in a very strong way in the context of the Brexit debate. We can see it again today with the Hewlett-Packard announcement. We need to be talking about much greater diversification of the economy and the development of a diverse indigenous industrial base. Will the witnesses comment on that? I welcome the witnesses' general commitment to social housing. I agree with them that the voluntary housing bodies do not really have the capacity to deliver the scale of social housing that is required. This is a big weakness in the Government's proposal but why do they believe we are similarly unable to rely on the local authorities? They spoke about a different model. I remind them that the most successful period of social housing construction in this country was delivered by local authorities. That was when it worked. Obviously, there are problems such as the running down of capacity, but I think they could be reversed. I strongly disagree with the witnesses on the education front. Given the importance of generally upskilling and encouraging people into education, why on earth does IBEC support the introduction of fees and loans? I think it is bonkers. That is my serious opinion. It will certainly limit access to education for some people. It will be a disincentive for people. It will leave a massive financial overhang for people. I do not see why on earth IBEC would favour that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is an extra â‚¬6.5 billion needed each year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apple would pay for all that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	"Carnage" is Mr. Trump's word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask a supplementary question? One could argue that what Mr. Brady seems to favour is a new State construction company
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case whether it is the Northern Ireland Housing Executive model, the local authorities, or the private sector, one has capacity problems?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although most of the problem is in the areas where one has the bigger local authorities. There is not a massive problem-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I put a question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Brady mentioned aircraft leasing. What is aircraft leasing contributing in terms of real economic benefit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many company----
