RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is up to the Government and the promoters of this treaty to respond to my point that the logic of this treaty implies that excessive deficits and debt and excessive public spending are the background to the current crisis.  I take the view that this is clearly not the case.  The reason we have a crisis is the activities of a privatised and deregulated financial system which ran amok and was allowed to run amok.  The wrong solution to the wrong problem is the suggestion that by cutting public spending or focusing on deficits, the problem can be addressed.  The United Nations committee on trade and development made that clear in its recent report which stated that ballooning deficits resulted from the crash in the financial system and the extra debt burden that was taken on by states when bailing out the financial system.  The consequence has been huge damage to the prospects for economic growth, which is being crippled in this domestic economy in particular.The argument seems to be that capitalising the banks is the key aspect which must then be financed by austerity cuts.  However, this policy is not working.  We have financed these banks and we have discovered they are hoarding the money in the ECB overnight and they are not re-investing it back into the economy.  Our own banks are not lending or investing in the economy and neither are the banks across Europe.  Therefore, this policy is not working.I put it to the promoters of the treaty that there will be a very serious impact on the democracy of this State or any other state.  I refer to Angela Merkel who stated after the negotiations had concluded that the debt brakes will be binding and valid forever and it will never be possible to change them through a parliamentary majority.  This statement is as clear as day.  The democratic right of national parliaments and the elected representatives of the people of this State will be unable to change these policies.One of the most alarming aspects of the treaty concerns the correction mechanism where the European Commission will decide on the basis of common principles to be proposed by it concerning in particular the nature, size and timeframe of corrective action to be undertaken.  In other words, the European Commission will decide what type of cuts, over what time period and what scale of cuts.  The European Commission is an unelected body and it will make this decision.  This is outrageous.  How can the promoters of this treaty justify it?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To summarise the case being put by the other side, is it not the case that what we are proposing as an alternative is large-scale public investment which would be financed by wealth redistribution?  That is what we are proposing.  Is it not a fair summary that what we see as the problem is that private sector investment has collapsed leading to a recession, that the one measure that could be taken to intervene in that situation to get people back to work is public investment, that it is precisely this which is outlawed by this treaty, and that this is the contradiction we are trying to resolve?
