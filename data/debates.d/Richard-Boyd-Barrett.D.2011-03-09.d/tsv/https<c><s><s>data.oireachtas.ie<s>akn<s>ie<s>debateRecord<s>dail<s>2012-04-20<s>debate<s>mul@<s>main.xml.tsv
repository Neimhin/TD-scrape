RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is missing the point I understand Deputy Catherine Murphy to be making.  Whatever one might have thought about other treaties passed within the European Union - quite a number of Members have opposed many aspects of those treaties and campaigned against them - there is at least a countervailing democratic mechanism.  There are avenues through which the citizens of this country, even if sovereignty has been pooled at a European-wide level, can challenge the implementation of those policies.  However, this intergovernmental treaty is different because there is no democratic countervailing avenue.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it several times and moreover, I have it to hand.  The cheap shots should be avoided, as the Tánaiste and I simply have different takes on it.  There is no such mechanism and one should be clear that the paranoia, as the Government may perceive it, of Members on this side of the House has considerable evidence to back it up.  I refer to the comments of Chancellor Merkel at the end of the negotiations, when she stated "the debt brakes will be binding and valid forever.  Never will you be able to change them through a parliamentary majority."  It could not be clearer.The treaty will do away with democracy in the context of fiscal and economic policy.  I would have thought that it will continue the process of eroding democracy.  At least with previous treaties - including Lisbon - we still had open to us, through the framework of the European Union, avenues to challenge that erosion.  This is not the case with the fiscal treaty.  Consequently, the heavyweight wording to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred is cause for a good deal of concern.I accept that we may disagree on what might be the implications of the treaty.  In the context of the correction mechanism, for example, the phrase "on the basis of common principles to be proposed by the European Commission, concerning in particular the nature, size and time-frame of the corrective action to be undertaken" is included in the treaty.  These are very significant powers and if the correction mechanism is triggered, the Commission will be able to dictate the nature, size and timeframe of cutbacks, structural reforms to the economy or whatever.  What will happen if these conflict with imperatives within the Constitution?  I refer, for example, to imperatives which declare that the natural resources of the State must remain the property of the people.  What will happen if the Commission decides that one of the structural reforms required in this country will be the privatisation of our national resources?  Under the treaties pertaining to the European Union, there would at least be mechanisms through which we could politically challenge such a decision.  However, what is before us is an intergovernmental treaty which simply relates to imposing fiscal rules and giving powers to the Commission to dictate courses of action in certain circumstances.  There is no democratic mechanism within the treaty which would allow us to challenge any decisions that might affect us.  The key point is that the will of the Commission will just be imposed.As Deputy Catherine Murphy stated, we are against the treaty.  In so far as the treaty's ratification is concerned, however, we are of the view that if it conflicts with imperatives in the Constitution, then we should have the ability to challenge its implementation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will respond to the Tánaiste's point about the democratic component, as he is being somewhat disingenuous in his reference to the role of the European Parliament.  Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states: "The President of the European Parliament may be invited to be heard".  The phrase is "may" rather than "will be".  That is the extent of the involvement of the democratic part of the European Union, which we all know does not have much democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It states: "The President of the Euro Summit shall present a report to the European Parliament".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is an account of what is being done.  We can like it or lump it.  National parliaments are talking shops in my interpretation of Article 13, which states:As foreseen in Title II of Protocol (No 1) on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the European Union Treaties, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments of the Contracting Parties will together determine the organisation and promotion of a conference of representatives of the relevant committees of the national Parliaments and representatives of the relevant committees of the European Parliament in order to discuss budgetary policies and other issues covered by this Treaty.There are no other powers so they are a talking shop.  They will meet to discuss the issue.  It is a democratic fig-leaf.This is about being dictated to by the big states with a simple majority.  That is what we are signing up to and there is no countervailing democratic mechanism, as we noted.  Consequently, Deputy Murphy's amendment is on the mark.  She is considering the implications of unintended consequences.We will debate over the coming weeks the potential consequences of the treaty.  If the Government gets its way the treaty will be ratified and we will discover those implications but what if the consequences are different to what those on the "Yes" side imagine?  What if they are more far-reaching and lead to a position where the Commission will dictate matters and demand certain types of structural reform in our economy, including issues that may impinge on imperatives within the Constitution?  What if the Government is wrong and where is the democratic avenue for us to deal with the unintended consequences that may arise?  With this wording, there is none because all provisions of the Constitution are overridden in ratifying the treaty.  This is against a more simple process where we can ratify the treaty but if we later find it conflicts with the Constitution, there is some recourse for challenge.  That is the point of Deputy Murphy's amendment, which is right in its approach.
