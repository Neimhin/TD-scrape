RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the fundamental reasons that politics is widely discredited in the eyes of large numbers of people is because in almost every area, rather than listen to the people who work in particular sectors or industries - those who are passionate about things or the communities affected - and taking a lead from and involving them in making important decisions, we instead listen to a tiny number of people who just see these areas of endeavour or sectors as an opportunity to make money.We always listen to the minority who see our planet and resources as an opportunity to make money and never listen to the people who care passionately about these things for themselves, to those who are affected directly or to those who work in these areas. At the bottom of most of the problems we face in this country and internationally is that folly of getting things completely the wrong way around and upside down in terms of how we deal with problems, set objectives and chart a way for our society. As Deputy Wallace alluded to, it is the reason we have economic crises which affect everybody, even that tiny minority who control all the wealth and have all the influence at government tables. If one only listens to a tiny group of the wealthiest people and big business interests, one is guaranteed to get it wrong. What is good for a small minority, or what it thinks is good for it, runs counter to what is good for the rest of society, ultimately backfires even on them and leads us into the sort of catastrophic crises we are seeing. That is a generally true statement and there is no clearer example of how we are getting things wrong in that way than the issue of climate change. It is clear in the debate around the Bill and the response of the Government in dealing with the issue that it is engaged in a classic example of doing things completely the wrong way. People who care about these issues are asked for their views in submissions and 90% of them say we need binding targets. They submit that the issue is so serious that binding targets are required to deal with it. The matter gets to an Oireachtas committee and the views of the public, those who care, and the stakeholders are diluted. The committee says we cannot have binding targets as that is a bit extreme. Perhaps, it says, we can have a definition of low carbon so that at least we have some sort of roadmap to reducing carbon emissions and meeting international targets. It goes further up the line and all of that is ignored. The view of the 90% is ignored and the slightly watered down version of the Oireachtas committee is ignored. Instead, the Government listens to the big agriculture lobby. I stress that it is big agriculture. It sees binding targets as likely to infringe on its short-term - I stress "short-term" - view of making profit.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read what lots of other people have said and I listened to what the Minister has said. That can be the only explanation for the failure of the Government to include binding targets or even a definition of low carbon. It is the only explanation I can find for the fact that it has rejected the recommendation to have a fully independent advisory body on the setting out of plans and instead to have that body dominated by senior officials from State agencies. Why do we not listen and why are we diluting demands for specific and concrete action on what is a national and global emergency? Why do we shy away from that? Why do we refuse to listen? It is because we are not listening to those people to whom we should be and are instead listening to a minority set of interests. In the end, it is self-defeating for them. As we face the prospect of significant parts of the landmass of Ireland literally sinking under water and as we see the impact of flooding, including its devastating impact on agriculture, it is short-sighted and self-defeating from every point of view, including that of agriculture itself, to fail to understand that we need binding targets. We must be serious and concrete about moving to a low-carbon economy and meeting our international targets in this regard. In my last few minutes, I will set out a specific example at a sectoral level of our endemic attitude to these matters. I refer to forestry, an area about which I have spoken a great deal in the House. Forestry is something we know is a carbon sink. We know what the mitigating effects on carbon emissions of planting a particular number of trees are. There is also a positive spin-off of significant employment. We had targets, which we have consistently failed to meet, to plant 25,000 hectares of forestry by 2000 and 20,000 hectares per year until 2030 to increase significantly our forest cover and approach something like the average European level. We are now far below that average. Average cover in Europe is approximately 30% to 35% but it is 11% in Ireland. We set targets to do something about it but have consistently failed to meet them in an area which would contribute significantly to addressing climate change while creating employment. It would be a win-win, but we do not do it. When the Forestry Bill came before the House, I suggested to the Minister that we should have binding targets but was told we could not. My amendments were ruled out of order because they would have incurred a charge on the Exchequer, but the Minister could have included them. Why does the Government not include these targets? Why does it not want to do so? I got the same stuff when we discussed this in committee about the potential consequences for agriculture and the need to look at land use. The short-term interests of one sector prevents action on something that will affect our entire society and our entire planet. It is short-sighted to respond to these things in this way. I do not understand it except to conclude that the Government and its Departments are held hostage by minority interests which will, in the end, drive this planet over the edge just as in recent years they have driven the global economy over the edge. They do not have the interests of society, our planet and our natural resources as a whole at heart; rather they have a short-term interest in profit and wealth. In diluting the demands of environmentalists and others to include specific targets, the Government has sadly shown which side it is on in this debate.
