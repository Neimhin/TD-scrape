RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and his team for their report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I noticed that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was probably the point of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I know, but there is no chance of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The first point I want to make was made to me by Mel Reynolds. I always give credit where it is due. This is a pretty serious matter. There is a very significant discrepancy in the local authority output figures in 2017 between what the Minister is claiming and what is in the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, report published in September 2018. This exposes a spin that is going on about output figures. According to the Minister's housing delivery for 2017, the total number of houses added to the local authority stock was 4,269 but, according to NOAC, the figure is 2,019, which is more than 50% less new local authority stock than what the Minister is claiming. The NOAC report sets out the total local authority housing stock at the beginning of, and at the end of, 2017 and one can subtract one figure from the other. How does the Minister explain this discrepancy? It is a very significant discrepancy and it has very big implications for all the Minister's targets not only for 2017 but for every year out to 2021. If the point is valid, there are some serious questions to be answered. What seems to be at the bottom of the discrepancy, essentially, is the miscounting or double counting of sales of local authority housing, demolitions and, critically, voids. I raised this point with Brendan Kenny and he more or less acknowledged it. A void implies something that has been lying empty for ages, work is done on it and finally it is brought back into use. That is fine if it is a genuine void, but if a void is just a casual turnover, there is a big difference. I put it to the Minister that those casual turnovers are being counted in his claims for output as new local authority housing stock when they are not that. If we note the Dublin City Council targets that Brendan Kenny showed us, there are 1,000 voids roughly every year for most of the duration of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. That is preposterous because that would suggest, if we read it at face value, that there are 4,000 or 5,000 voids in the hands of Dublin City Council, but of course there are not. We noticed there are some but not that many. What we are counting are casual turnovers or vacancies. I would like that point addressed. If the additional local authority housing stock is half of what is being claimed, that needs to be admitted honestly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can tell the Minister that I was not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not name him. I just referred to "the guy from Hines".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. I did not name anybody. He said the cost of the units Hines intends to deliver later than expected - 26 months for the first phase is a long time - was approximately €400,000 per unit. These are mostly apartments. If they are costing him €400,000, what will they cost people in the area? Whatever it is will be in excess of €400,000, which is totally unaffordable for the vast majority of people who are affected by the current housing crisis. Whether they are working people on average earnings or even those earning up to €80,000 a year, it is way beyond what they can afford. What the hell is the point of that? We have fanfare about the delivery of the biggest residential development in the State, but the vast bulk of it will be completely unaffordable. What does the Minister say about that? I have just been struck by something I find slightly worrying. Outside the window where we were, there were trucks with lights flashing and a digger. I went down afterwards to see what it was doing. It was doing absolutely nothing. It was literally waving its arm around and moving a few stones from one place to another because nothing was actually happening on the site. This was done for the optics of the cameras. They have been sitting on that site for years and we now discover the latest date they are giving us is 26 months. What the hell is happening here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will finish and come back later on another point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not interested in making political or other charges for the sake of it. Rather, I am interested in getting to the facts. I am aware there are many different streams, but that does not answer the question I asked. What is the real addition to the local authority housing stock? The Minister has an obligation to tell us that. I acknowledge that that is only one stream. The NOAC report indicates that the additional local authority housing stock for 2017 was 2,019 and that 564 homes were added to the stock in Dublin. That is substantially less than the additional stock suggested by the figures for 2017 presented by the Minister specifically in regard to local authorities.I would like an answer to that question. When stock is demolished and then rebuilt, if what is built is less than what was demolished, there is a net reduction. Crucially, the big issue is voids, the way they are defined long term versus short term and that what are, in effect, casual vacancies are being counted as additional stock. That is my explanation, but there is definitely a discrepancy in the figures. The Minister might not be able to answer that question now but I would like an answer to it as it is an important issue.  The Minister gave some additional figures for HAP, namely 13,741 tenancies at the end of quarter 3. Could he tell us, and these should be included in all the figures, how many landlords pulled out of the HAP scheme in the same period? We need to know how secure or insecure HAP tenancies are because certainly, anecdotally, we meet many people who find themselves back in emergency accommodation or back in trouble even though they got a HAP tenancy previously. On the issue of affordability, the Minister did not answer my question. The biggest residential development in the State is not unimportant. We are being told €400,000 is just the figure it costs to build by the developer. I do not see how that really helps us resolve the problem. The Minister can say the answer is supply but supply at that price does not help. The prices are not coming down. I met young people who were living in the Ires REIT units in Sandyford where Ires REIT tried to put up the rent by about 40%. The rents were already €2,200 a month for those units and it tried to put them up to €2,800 but it stopped because of the embarrassment of the issue being raised. When I talked to the people living in those units, I heard there were five or six students or five or six IT employees working in Sandyford piled in together in a unit paying rents they could barely afford. What will happen in five years' time to those people when they have children and families? They can just about afford that level of rent if five or six people pile in together. There will be similar rents in the units in Cherrywood if they are buy-to-rent, but in five or six years' time those units will be useless for those people. The problem is one of affordability. Even on the affordable base we are going to get, it is not clear in Cherrywood, in terms of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF for all the structures that we paid to put in place in terms of the infrastructure, how much actual affordable housing we will get and what affordable price we will be given, taking account of the extremely high price about which they are talking.  Regarding the impact of raising building heights, Deputy Ó Broin referred to this issue in terms of land values and so on. Has the Minister considered that by raising building heights there is the possibility that people who already have planning permissions will pull them and apply for new ones, thereby slowing down delivery because they will be able to build an extra few storeys? That is very likely to happen. Has the Minister considered the impact of that? We know there is considerable hoarding and speculating. It is very likely that raising building heights will be a trigger for that kind of activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not talking about those houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept there are disagreements but will the Minister answer my question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not a member of this committee so I did not receive it. Perhaps the Minister will undertake to have it sent to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister send that on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not-----
