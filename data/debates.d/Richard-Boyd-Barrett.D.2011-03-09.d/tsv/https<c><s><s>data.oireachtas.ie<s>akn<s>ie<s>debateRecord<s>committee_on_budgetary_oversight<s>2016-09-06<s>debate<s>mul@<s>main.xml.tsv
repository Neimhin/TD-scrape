RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that Dr. Fagan is limited in what he can say about the Apple ruling. The report is couched in fairly moderate language but if one adds what he has said to what is said in the European ruling it is a fair summation to say that the activities of tax-dodging multinationals are making our economy very vulnerable.They even mean we do not really know what is happening with the economy because according to the European Union, they are tax dodgers. That is what I think they are and these tax dodgers have now put us in a position in which we do not really know what is going on in the economy and they are making us vulnerable to any shifts or changes that could result from their activities or decisions to move profits or investment elsewhere. Is that not a fair summary? Is it not an obvious follow-on from the EU ruling, which should be of interest to the Central Bank and to everybody, that there must be other companies which are doing the same thing? The whole point of the ruling was it certainly was not something that would have been available to the majority of companies but we all know there must have been other companies that were doing this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise but it is important-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is extremely important because-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I understand that, if we discover there are billions more-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but to use its words, the Central Bank has stated it is unhelpful that we do not know the outcome and whether we have €13 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Depending on which way one looks at it, it may hit us as another shock if it was not just Apple. Should we not also be looking into the possibility that it is not €13 billion but is a hell of a lot more? Can the witnesses also confirm that if the activities of these tax-dodging multinationals have artificially inflated the GDP and growth figures, this also means it is not simply in the year of the 26% jump in growth that Ireland will be obliged to pay a much bigger contribution to the European Union but that we have been overpaying to the European Union all along? I seek the witnesses' views on this because it seems to be a logical follow-on from what they said, namely, we have been forking out money to the European Union disproportionately for quite some time because of the distortion created by multinationals essentially tax dodging in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But we are stating we do not know what size the economy really is, are we not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And we do not have another measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Several of my questions were not answered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mandate of the Central Bank is to be conscious of and to make recommendations about possible shocks. Is that not right? The Central Bank stated there is uncertainty as a result of the €13 billion. Is there not a risk of a shock, if you want to put it in those terms? I would have thought it was fairly likely. I would consider it a massive windfall and we should just take the money but from the point of view of knowing the picture, should we not look into the possibility that it may be much more than €13 billion?Is it likely that this will be the consequence? Why has the Central Bank repeated the assertion that we have changed the rules on the double Irish when we have not done so? It will run for the next five years. The double Irish is still available and, therefore, the potential for the distorting effect and uncertainty about tax owed to the State will continue for the next five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about EU contributions? Have we been overpaying the EU for quite some time because of this distorting effect?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surely Mr. Quinn is not saying the distorting effect is limited to 2014. I am genuinely asking. If I follow the logic of what Mr. Quinn has said, the distorting effect predates 2014 and it goes back some time.
