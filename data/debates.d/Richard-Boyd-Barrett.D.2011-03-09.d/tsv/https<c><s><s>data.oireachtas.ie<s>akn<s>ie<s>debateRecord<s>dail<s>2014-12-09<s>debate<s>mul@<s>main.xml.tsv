RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is something completely shambolic and surreal about holding a confidence vote in this Government in the Dáil when everybody knows the real confidence vote will take place on the streets tomorrow when, at 1 p.m. at Merrion Square, tens of thousands of people will assemble in the real people's parliament. They will cast a decisive vote of no confidence in this Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will vote against the injustice of the water charges and the Government's failure to listen to what the people have said on that issue. They will vote against the equally cruel, unjust and regressive universal social charge and home taxes. They will vote against the cruelty of leaving people needing vital operations on waiting lists for over a year. They will vote against the fact that we have some of the most overcrowded classrooms in Europe and that all of this has been done when the big corporate investors in property and landlords are coining it and while hundreds of thousands of our citizens cannot put an affordable roof over their head and people are dying on the streets. They do this as the Government refuses, point blank, to levy even a small amount of extra tax on the super-wealthy or the corporations which are making absolute fortunes. That is why people are protesting and the Government has already lost the real vote of confidence from the people in this country. No matter what game or manipulation happens in this Parliament, the Taoiseach should remember that real power lies with the people and real change has always come from the people mobilising on the street. Reforms have been won in recent weeks because people have gone on the streets and refused to accept water charges or expressed their outrage against the homelessness crisis. That is more than anything achieved by the Government in the past four years and more reforms will be won as those protests continue. It is about time the Government listened to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Economic Management Council has a function, I presume it is to try to set out the economic priorities of this Government, to look at value for money when it comes to big projects and to decide the broad parameters of raising revenue and collecting taxes. I expect that the four senior members of the Government - the Taoiseach and the other three Ministers - come up with recommendations and argue in favour of them at Cabinet meetings. I imagine that is broadly how it works. I would say the members of the Economic Management Council get their way most of the time within the broad parameters of economic priorities, tax policy and the big headline issues in terms of expenditure. It is very relevant to ask how the Economic Management Council got it so wrong in this case. The evidence that it got it so wrong has been manifest on the streets in recent weeks as people have reacted to the budget, the broad parameters of which were undoubtedly set out by the Economic Management Council. I do not doubt - the Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong - that the Economic Management Council must have discussed the response to the unprecedented popular protest after the budget, particularly on the issue of water charges. The proposals announced by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, were drawn up in response to the unprecedented outrage of the people of this country who told the Government that it got this wrong, that it was not listening to them, that it did not understand their needs and priorities and that they fundamentally disagreed with it on the issue of water charges and the whole Irish Water project. It is very relevant to ask how the Economic Management Council got it so wrong. Does it not prove that it is a dysfunctional entity? It is not the way to go about framing policy and making decisions on the key economic issues facing the people of this country. That is the lesson. There is much speculation about how many people will be on the streets tomorrow. I can tell the Taoiseach that it is going to be massive. Any illusion he may have had that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will be a minimum of 50,000 people there. It will be probably be a hell of a lot bigger than that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind the Deputies that tomorrow is a weekday. It will probably be a lot bigger than that. For that to happen on a weekday, after the Economic Management Council has signed off on the package I have mentioned, will be an enormous vote of no confidence in the Government and the Economic Management Council, both of which have failed to understand what the people of this country are saying about water charges and more generally about the Government's economic priorities and tax policies. That is what is being said. It will be said again in the most unequivocal terms. Is it not time for the Taoiseach to step back? I absolutely guarantee him that this is what will happen tomorrow. I wonder what his reaction will be. Will he have the humility to say "we got it wrong and we are going to listen"? I have to make a further comment on the whole issue of value for money and metering, etc. I do not know who is writing this spin for the Taoiseach. If he wants to talk to a plumber about metering, conservation and value for money, he will be told that district meters are a much cheaper and more effective way of ascertaining whether there are major leaks out of pipes in any particular area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not ask Deputy Durkan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach discussed district meters? Plumbers and people who work in the water infrastructure system tell me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not ask you, Bernard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People who have worked in the water infrastructure system for decades have told me that just one district meter, rather than hundreds of meters, could cover all the households in an estate or a local area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They can be used to determine how much water is going into that locality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy does not want to hear this because it drives a coach and horses through the Government's argument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will you please ask him to shut up, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They know what the average usage for a household is. If it exceeds the amount of water going into a particular area, they can work it out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By the way, it measures the amount of water in the pipes going into the area, rather than the amount of water between the meter and the household. It is more effective. A much smaller number of meters is needed. It is much cheaper. Did the Economic Management Council discuss things like that? Can the Taoiseach confirm that Siemens offered to do the whole thing much more cheaply? I understand it offered to do it for free. I have a big question. What was the procedure for giving the contract for the metering to GMC Sierra? Were all the procedures complied with fully? Some serious questions need to be asked about the process of tendering this out. Did it fully comply with the protocols for outsourcing these things? It appears that there were cheaper offers. I am not in favour of metering at all, but it seems that there was a ready-up in terms of who was going to get the contract.My fundamental point is about how the Economic Management Council, EMC, has got it wrong. Has that not been proven by what we have seen on the streets and what we will see there again tomorrow? Will the Taoiseach go outside and listen to people tomorrow when they tell him that the EMC got it wrong?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the Taoiseach's role in it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am not saying that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The State should have paid for that, too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They should not have to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach also investigate the possibility of installing the district meters to which I refer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We know where he is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Sinn Féin Members for sharing their time with us and raising this issue. I commend the Government on not opposing the motion. It is absolutely vital to recognise the legitimacy of the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and statehood. It is a sign of the advancement of the Palestinian struggle that recognition is growing across the world. I would not have become involved in politics were it not for this very issue. As an 18 year old, I travelled to Palestine and happened to walk into the middle of the first Palestinian intifada, although not deliberately - just as I arrived it was happening around me and I was shocked at what was happening. There has since been an extraordinary advance in the awareness of the terrible crime committed against the Palestinians and the need for them to find justice, freedom and self-determination. One of the great ironies in this whole tragedy is that of the two greatest crimes committed against people in the past 100 years, one has been committed against the Palestinian people since 1948, while the other was committed against the Jewish people up to 1944 and 1945. The great irony is that a people who suffered so horribly in the Holocaust and who claim to represent that tradition are now responsible for the terrible oppression of the Palestinian people. I would not vote against the motion, but it is always important to inject a critical note into any discussion such as this. I do not believe a two-state solution can work because it is predicated on the divisions between Arabs and Jews. It is predicated on the belief there could be something legitimate as a Jewish state, but I do not accept this. I do not believe there should be racially or religiously pure states. The partition of Palestine in 1948 was the source of the conflict.The United Nations approved a partition and it legitimised the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians; it could not have happened without the partition of Palestine and as long as we fail to challenge the notion that there must be an ethnically or religiously pure state called "Israel" and something else which is an Arab state, there will never be peace in this region. It will always be at the expense of one or the other. The only concept we would accept anywhere else in the world is the idea that all human beings are equal under law, regardless of race, religion or creed. Accepting in any way that there should be a state giving priority to one religious group over another is a recipe for the oppression of one group over another. It will incite and encourage sectarianism, ethnic cleansing and violent conflict. We should know that from our own history. It is a difficult issue. On the one hand, recognising the right of Palestine to statehood is vital in establishing the legitimacy of that people's struggle against the brutal oppression they face at the hands of Israel. In truth, when we consider what is left of the Palestinian territories, there is no viability in a two-state solution and there is no moral legitimacy in accepting the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. All Palestinians dispossessed in 1948 deserve the right to return and to be equal citizens, whether they are Jew, Arab, Christian, secular or atheist. That is regardless of whether that one state is called Israel or Palestine. That is the only viable solution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the reasons people are absolutely furious and have come out onto the streets in recent weeks and will come out again in huge numbers tomorrow - it is not just about paying water charges - is the dishonesty in politics, with political parties, Governments Ministers and Taoisigh thinking they can play the people for fools. The people are very angry about this. Every now and again the Government faces a crisis and people get really angry and then apparently we have ardent words from the Taoiseach and the Minister about how they are listening to the people. On the face of it, they seem to display a little humility and appear to be listening, but actually the spin, the dishonesty, the manoeuvring, the game playing and the attempt to play people for fools continue. We have seen it again tonight with this carry-on in respect of the late sitting. It is a peculiar, absurd little game that I do not fully understand and, frankly, I do not even care too much, as it is part of the continuous game playing. The Bill represents the same. There is a commitment not to privatise when they know that the people have stated clearly that they do not want to see their water services privatised and they want cast iron guarantees that they will not be privatised. For the past week or two, after the Bill was published, the Government has been saying, "We have it now. They will not be privatised. It is included in the Bill that they will not be privatised and we have taken measures to make sure they will not be privatised." However, the devil is in the detail, as usual. There is no guarantee. It is utterly meaningless and a pretence. It is another attempt to deceive and the Government keeps doing it. I wonder if the Minister thinks he will not be found out. Part of the reason people are on the streets is the way in which the Labour Party, having been humiliated on the issue of bin charges for its complicity in the privatisation of refuse services, continued to spin a line, "It was all those people who were boycotting bin charges who caused the privatisation of refuse services". Was this really the case? How is it that refuse services were privatised in rural areas first where there had been no boycott campaigns and no opposition to paying? The last places to have refuse services privatised were the places in which people resisted. They lasted ten years longer than anyone else precisely because they had resisted. Does the Minister think they have not worked this out? Does he think they have not worked out that if they have to pay five cent in user charges, it will only move in one direction and that the services will be privatised? Does he think they have not worked out that when the contracts to install the meters go to the richest man in the country, that, in fact, they have already been privatised and that all of his assurances mean nothing? Does he think they have not figured this out? Does he think they are stupid? He obviously does because he would not be saying what he is if he did not think he could play the people for fools. However, they are not fools. I cannot believe he believes what he is saying because he knows that once user charges are introduced, privatisation is inevitable, as everybody knows. As for the off balance sheet stuff, we listened to the people from Detroit who described it as "financialisation", another word for bonds. They said the issuing of bonds in Detroit had led directly to charges sky rocketing to the point where people were being charged nearly $1,000 a year and where three quarters of the charge was for water going out. They were being charged three times more for the water coming off the roof than the clean water going in. That is where financialisation led because the bondholders placed demands on the water company to jack up the charges to get their pound of flesh. The Minister should stop playing the people for fools because they are not, as he will discover tomorrow.
