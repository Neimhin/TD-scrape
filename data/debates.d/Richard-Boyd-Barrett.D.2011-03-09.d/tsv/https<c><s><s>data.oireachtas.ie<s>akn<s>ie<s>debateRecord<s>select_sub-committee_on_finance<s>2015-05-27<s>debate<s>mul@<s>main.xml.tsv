RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is failing to acknowledge the fundamental difference between a vulture fund and other credit institutions that operate on a longer term or permanent basis within the State.As the Minister says, a bank or a building society might be subject to competitive pressures on interest rates because they will not wish to lose market share and they will want to enhance their brand reputation and so on. A vulture fund does not give a damn about any of those things. It is not in it for the long term. It is not in it to develop customer relations; it is in it to make money out of an investment. It might be true that at a particular point in time it suits a vulture fund to have a revenue stream coming in and therefore it will not push for repossession. But at other times a vulture fund might say, "The best way for us to maximise our profit, to get the best return on our investment, is just to move in on these people in every way we can, get the asset off them and make a whack load of cash out of it." That is the nature of these vulture funds and that is why they are called vulture funds. We need to recognise the difference. Furthermore, there is this more opaque line of responsibility via these credit financing or these credit service firms and the owners behind them, making it all the more difficult for the mortgage-holder. If we acknowledge those differences then we should have the most robust protections possible for the mortgage-holder and we should go for the maximum protection and powers for the State in dealing with these entities that have no loyalty to the customer nor to the jurisdiction, no loyalty other than to themselves to make as much money as possible. If we recognise that fact then we have to go for the most robust, comprehensive protections possible. That is the point of Deputy Tóibín's amendment and I would support it. I will mention briefly that Deputy Naughten, who is unwell, had hoped to attend today to signal his intention to table an amendment to the effect that it should not be possible for any person to be forced out of his or her home by one of these credit-servicing companies unless that person has alternative accommodation. I wish to signal that I would support his amendment on Report Stage. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Deputy Tóibín read slowly? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment, as I did the last one. I wish to signal that I may table an amendment on Report Stage. I fundamentally oppose and object to the idea that people's mortgages can be bundled up and sold to vulture funds. That kind of carry-on produced a global economic crisis. I would like to see a regulation that precludes companies, firms or vulture funds which are not real companies in the proper sense from engaging in such activity. They are not interested in the customer, the consumer, the country or developing market relations even on a commercial basis. They are just vulture funds. I would prefer if the Central Bank of Ireland did not give these people the right to come in and buy bundles of mortgages. I am pretty certain that the Government is disposed to allowing this kind of thing in the belief that the global financial system works in this way and there is not much one can do about the situation. Therefore, at the very least, we should have the highest level of transparency and the greatest level of protection for customers and, potentially, victims of these firms. It seems entirely reasonable that people should be informed as soon as their mortgage is sold to one of these funds or sold to anybody. People should be told all of the rights they are entitled to in this situation and the discount that the vulture fund received. That is the point that Deputy Fleming made.  Let me outline what the Minister for Finance said before the Minister of State arrived. First, it was a demand made by some of the people who are in this position that they should be allowed, individually, to buy back their mortgages at the same discount as vulture funds. In some cases, people have even offered to pay more than the vulture funds were willing to pay. That means people were willing to pay over and above the discounted rate in order to get their mortgages back. It was in that regard that the Minister invoked the issue of moral hazard as the reason people could not buy their mortgages back. He said there would be other people who are paying the full amount of their mortgage repayments and asked why, therefore, we should facilitate individual mortgage holders in getting big discounts. There is a great inconsistency when it come to the invocation of the moral hazard argument, particularly when one considers the Siteserv case. In that sector there is no problem with moral hazard, and very wealthy people who owed money to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was making a point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am responding to a point the Minister made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will only make the following point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	None the less, the Minister made the argument and I shall not sit here all night making that argument. He made the point, but I do not understand the double standard. It is unfair that very wealthy people who owed money to a bank, in corporate loans, were facilitated with big write-downs for companies that they bought. There might have been other companies that had loans and were paying them back fully but did not receive big write-downs. Siteserv was propped up and benefitted from a massive write-down, and we know of other examples. What about all the companies that made repayments? They were disadvantaged. A moral hazard existed, but that did not seem to matter because we were talking about big corporate loans and, possibly, because we were talking about very wealthy people. I do not know the reason for such treatment. It was a case of double standards, because the issue of moral hazard was not invoked. An attitude was adopted that moral hazard should be avoided at all costs. The moral hazard excuse is invoked in the case of the poor distressed mortgage holder who wants to get the same discount on his or her mortgage that a vulture fund gets. I do not understand the double standards and inconsistency in that regard. At the very least, people deserve transparency, and to know the discount that a vulture fund gets which is the point of the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no rift.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the amendment at least acknowledges the concerns of members and people in this situation about the prospect of loans being sold to vulture funds. Deputy Fleming made the point that if the credit servicing firm is breaching the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and consumer rights generally it can be taken to task but the owners of the loans should also be subject to sanctions if they try to get the firm to take actions which violate the rights of the mortgage holders. That begs the question of how we can supervise vulture funds which are based abroad and operate through the credit servicing firms. How can we even be made aware the pressures they bring to bear? I have not tabled an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage because I do not know how I would address the issue but I may prepare an amendment on Report Stage. If the purpose of the Bill is to protect consumers, it should simply keep vulture funds out of the mortgage business. I do not see what they contribute. I might have difficulties with private banking but I understand the purpose of a bank. I would prefer the banks to be in public ownership but I recognise that they have a role to play. I do not see what useful purpose these vulture funds serve. They are parasitical entities that speculate and gamble in a way that affects human beings who are trying to put a roof over their heads. I would love to see a prohibition on mortgages being sold to this kind of entity. It should only be possible to sell them to proper credit institutions. Perhaps the Minister of State can explain why that is not what we need to do to protect mortgage holders. The amendment at least attempts to provide protections but I wonder whether it will have that outcome in reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to raise an issue under this section. I do not even understand it but I said I would raise it for Deputy Naughten. I have already mentioned the other matter he wishes to have inserted. He is not actually ill, he is undergoing foot surgery. That is why he is not here. He wants to signal his intention to ensure everyone taking out a mortgage is required to make a will. I am not quite sure where this fits in. I presume it fits into some sort of regulation in this area. I will not try to explain. I am merely putting it on the record that Deputy Naughten intends to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair for his patience.
