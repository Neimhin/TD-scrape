RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The joint labour committees and the registered employment agreements are the main mechanism through which the lowest paid workers are protected.  This affects 400,000 of the lowest paid workers in the State, who have already been hammered by child benefit cuts and the universal social charge.  They are really struggling.  Can the Minister give reassurance to those workers, who are deeply anxious about what the review means in terms of further attacks on their wages and conditions?  Does the Minister have the review, when will it be published and will there be a chance to debate it in the Chamber before the summer or as soon as possible so we can see what is proposed and the Minister's response and so the workers affected can have their say on it?  Can the Minister guarantee these workers they have no reason to fear the review of wages and conditions for the lowest paid being considered will result in an attack on the structures that allow some regulation in these sectors?  In many cases, these are casual or part-time workers in difficult employment circumstances and are contract cleaners, retail workers and people in the catering industry.  The anxiety is justified given that it is part of the conditions of the IMF-EU deal to examine these agreements.  Everything else from that deal has meant cuts, austerity and attacks on existing wages and conditions.  Can the Minister guarantee this will not result in attacks on wages and conditions of the lowest paid workers in the State?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies.  I am slightly worried by the Minister's answer.  In so far as job losses are taking place in these areas, I and many reasonable people would argue it is the lack of demand in the economy that results in people's incomes being slashed.  What I and the workers in this sector are looking for is an assurance that while there may be anomalies, and the unions and so on involved recognise there are some anomalies, straightening out anomalies will not result in an attack on the pay, conditions or mechanism that guarantees the reasonable and basic minimum pay and condition standards for some of the lowest paid workers in the State who have already been hammered with cuts.  Can the Minister give that assurance and can he indicate when this legislation will be published——
