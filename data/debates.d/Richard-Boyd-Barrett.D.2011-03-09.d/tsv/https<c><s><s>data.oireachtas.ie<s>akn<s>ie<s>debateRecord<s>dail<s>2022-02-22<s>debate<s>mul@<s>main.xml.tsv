RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two weeks ago Amnesty International produced a devastating report rightly condemning the state of Israel for the crime of apartheid. I and others have asked the Whip that we would have a debate in this House about that report. I note that the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Carroll MacNeill will hold a briefing with the Israeli ambassador this week. There is no doubt but that the ambassador wants to trash the Amnesty report. That is his entitlement, but this House has a right to discuss this report and its very serious allegation, with which I agree absolutely, that Israel is an apartheid state. We need to have a discussion about this. It has global implications and very serious implications for our foreign policy and for the well-being of the Palestinian people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we have the debate next week?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But if we could have the debate-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have genuinely lost count of the number of times I have asked the Government and successive Ministers with responsibility for housing in successive Governments when we are going to get the decision on the review of the social housing income thresholds. Every week, people are coming to me who have been thrown off the housing lists after ten, 12 and even 15 years of waiting. All that time has gone because those people did the terrible thing of getting a job, with the result that their incomes went a bit over the threshold. They are punished for that by losing all those years they have been waiting. However, there is a benefit for the Government because apparently the numbers in need of social housing go down. I think that is why we are not getting the results of this review. In the longest review I have ever heard of, which has been ongoing for at least five years, I have heard again and again-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When are we going to get the results of the review? Will all those people thrown off the housing lists over the past couple of years get their time back?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the first time that I have heard about the time capsule section. I think that in the time capsule section on my form, I will ask the people who are still here in 100 years whether 100 years of government has managed to sort out the housing crisis. I fear we may well find that it has not. I wonder if the Government will have even managed the review of the social housing income threshold. Indeed, the reason I asked the question is because of the more immediate issue of the housing crisis. When I submitted a question before Christmas on the issue, the Minister of State informed me, if I understand him correctly, that in the questions to be asked in the census, we will still not get a count of derelict buildings in the country. I was unaware of that previously. That seems to me to be an extraordinary waste of an opportunity to ascertain the facts on one of the biggest issues facing this country that is directly related to whether we can actually solve the housing crisis in any sort of serious timeframe. It is a scandal beyond scandals how many derelict buildings there are in towns, villages and cities the length and breadth of this country and for us not to have a count of them. I know that in the last census there was a count of vacant buildings, but we need a count of derelict buildings. If I understand the Minister of State's answer correctly, given that the questions were set and finally signed off in 2019, surely the severity of the housing crisis and the importance of establishing the number of derelict houses means we should put a supplementary question into the census to help get that information.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So do I.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Supposedly one of the central pillars of the just transition we need to address the climate crisis is the idea that it will be a just transition. I do not know how many times I have heard the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and other Ministers in the Government wax lyrical about how if we seriously address the climate crisis, it can be a win-win situation. This is what it should be. If we address the climate crisis, and the biodiversity crisis I might add in, people could have warmer homes and lower bills. They could have better and cheaper public transport systems. They could have more biodiversity and a better environment if we met our afforestation targets. This is what it should be but it is not what actually happens. In the process the Government is not willing to challenge the logic of the market system, the way it is responsible for wrecking the environment and the way it simultaneously makes its money through exploiting ordinary people. The elephant in the room about who should pay for the just transition to a better climate future is the absolutely extraordinary rising, staggering and obscene profits of the energy companies. The Government does not want to do anything to cut or cap their profits or to call out the obscenity of their profits while people are being hammered with increased energy bills. The Government does not say a word about this. It thinks it is perfectly okay that they make a fortune. Then the Government comes in here and lectures ordinary people about how they have to take the pain to deal with the climate through increased carbon taxes and other forms of regressive taxation on their energy such as VAT and the public service obligation, PSO, levy. All of these hit hardest those who can least afford them and who have least control over the amount of energy they use in their homes or the access they have to public transport, or that they do not have, as is more likely the case. If the Government continues to punish ordinary people who are least responsible for the climate crisis, it will turn people away from the climate agenda. Why not turn its attention to the obscene, and disgusting in the context of the current inflation crisis, profits of the energy companies such as the ESB, Energia, Shell and BP? They are making a fortune by wrecking the world's environment and crucifying ordinary people with the bills dropping through their doors. Unless the Government addresses this problem it will not get a just transition or any transition to a better climate future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are right on the last point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister knows, and it has been discussed at length in this Chamber in recent weeks, that people are being crucified by the rising cost of energy and heat for their homes. Another report was published today, on a survey by Amárach, which shows that people are cutting back on food, meals and essentials because of the rising cost of heating and energy, a basic necessity to keep themselves warm. What tax measures is the Minister willing to consider to address the cost-of-living crisis that people are facing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am afraid it is just not enough. Heating and energy bills are set to increase by approximately €800. For many people, it will be more than that if their homes are badly insulated. In most cases, they have little control over that if they are tenants, public or private, or do not have the money to retrofit their homes. Who will make up the gap between the very small measures, such as social welfare increases, including an increase to the fuel allowance for those who get it, or the €200 energy credit and the cost-of-living increase? When it is added up, it is still well short of the increase just in the price of heating and energy, never mind how the cost of rent is rocketing and food prices and so on are going up. It is not enough. Does the Minister consider the fact - because he should - that the same people who are being crucified by these costs are paying €494 million in carbon tax, which the Government plans to increase, €481 million in VAT and €263 million in public service obligation levies? They are being crucified by taxes that he has the power to reduce. Does he not think that, given the unprecedented crisis we are facing, he needs to do a hell of a lot more?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Between the wars, climate destruction and inequality that capitalism generates, it will not need me to help it collapse. It will be more likely to do it itself. I do want taxes put on those who are doing well from the current inflation crisis. As I pointed out to the Minister, why will he not consider taxes on the excessive profits of energy companies? Energia's profits were up by 46% last year and 45% the year before that. What about the profits of the oil companies or the ESB? Does the Minister think it is okay that poor people on low and middle incomes will be considerably worse off, some of whom are making the decision not to have meals, pay rent or medical bills, while the companies that are hiking up the prices are making obscene profits? Does he think he should possibly address that injustice? Does he think that he should possibly use the power he has, as the Minister for Finance, to tax their profits as against imposing crippling taxes on people who cannot afford it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit has always opposed the tax that is imposed on the family home because it is an unjust and regressive form of taxation.We think there is an added case, however, given the role the vulture funds, cuckoo funds, buy-to-rent property investors or whatever name one wants to give them who are now controlling and dominating the housing sector are playing in driving up rents and house prices to unaffordable levels, to have a real property tax - not one on family homes but on these people who are wrecking the housing market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That sounds good but it is just not what is happening on the ground. We are going to have to blow this fantasy out of the water. As I have pointed out on several occasions, zero council houses were built last year in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. We just got the figures. Next year, five will be built. There is a lot of construction going on in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The Minister should drive out there to have a look. There are strategic housing developments, SHDs, going up all over the place. These are private build-to-rent developments that will be rented for €2,200 a month if one is lucky. There is an opportunity cost here, if one likes, to use economic jargon. If all the construction workers are building unaffordable profit-driven developments, they are not building council houses. The facts are clear on the ground. The council is delivering nothing. The Minister referred to AHBs. Who is building for the AHBs? It is the same property investors and they are charging a fortune. This is nonsense. We need to stop these people wrecking our market and start building affordable and public housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My constituency colleague being sent in to mark me is an interesting new phenomenon. This is a new tactic on the part of Fine Gael. It does not matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a public office that is visited by people who are homeless and cannot afford stuff; the Deputy does not. I have to deal with------
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to deal with the families who are being thrown off the housing list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rents in the places the Deputy is talking about are €2,200. They are not affordable for the people on the housing list and that is why people are ending up in homeless accommodation. There are 5,000 families on the various housing lists. They have been waiting 15 to 20 years because all the construction workers are building developments for profit. We get a tiny proportion of those at a huge cost but, meanwhile, those construction workers are not down at Shanganagh Castle building on public land the public housing we need. They are not inputting the water infrastructure on the Old Connaught Road or up in Stepaside where there is public land on which we should be building public housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have noticed the new tactic. Fair enough. It is all politics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not objecting; I am just pointing it out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not feigned at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is real anger.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every week, I come in here enraged by the housing crisis in my area. There is nothing feigned about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit has been against the carbon tax from the outset, despite what some Members appeared to be suggesting rather bizarrely earlier. We have been very clear in opposing carbon tax as an unfair, regressive tax. There is no evidence that it has any significant impact on the reduction of CO2 emissions. However, even if that was always true, it is simply blatantly self-evident that increasing the carbon tax yet again in the current situation is going to contribute to fuel poverty, hardship and injustice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, what is needed are caps on energy and heating prices. That is what we believe is the necessary action.While the Minister is clearly not going to do that, although he should, it is unacceptable to add additional hardship to people by further increasing carbon taxes. He is absolutely right that on its own it is not enough. He has control of VAT, the PSO and carbon tax. This is more than €1.2 billion worth of taxes that will be levied on people's energy use, with most of it hitting the least well-off. Does the Minister honestly think he should not reduce this and that he should certainly not even contemplate increasing it when we have excess winter deaths and people not able to pay the bills? They are literally making choices between food and bills and skipping meals. Does he not think it is totally unjust?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking about the higher level of VAT receipts specifically on energy and heating. Let us forget about the rest. It is up to €481 million and rising. The State has yielded a big tax bonus from the energy hikes that ordinary people are getting through their doors that they cannot afford. This gives the Minister scope not to impose further hardship on them. In fact, it gives him scope to reduce their energy bills and reduce the hardship, as do the profits of the ESB. The Minister is right that it is a publicly owned company. Its profits should be capped. Tell the company not to increase prices because he would rather not impose further hardship on people to get extra dividends. For that matter, the profits of Energia have increased. Tell that company that it does not need to make extra profits this year because people are suffering and they cannot take any more.
