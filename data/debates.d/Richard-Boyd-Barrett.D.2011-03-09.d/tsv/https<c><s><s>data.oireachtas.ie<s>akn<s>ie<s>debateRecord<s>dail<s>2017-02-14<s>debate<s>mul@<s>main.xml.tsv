RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed. No way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Order of Business is completely unacceptable. While the issue of the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe can be dealt with by a public commission of investigation, that is not the only issue at stake here. There are questions which need to be answered in terms of the Taoiseach's management and the management by Ministers of the Government. At the very least, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, must come before the House to make statements clarifying direct contradictions in accounts about who knew about the Tusla reports, when they knew, what they decided to do or not do about those things or whether to include them in terms of reference. All of those things need to be addressed by the Taoiseach. The Government must address why it refuses to suspend the Commissioner or to ask her to step aside, without prejudice, pending the outcome of an investigation when that is normal practice for somebody against whom such allegations are made. There was supposed to be a Business Committee meeting at 1 p.m. which was requested by a number of parties. The Government collapsed that meeting to discuss this issue. On the insistence of ourselves and others, a meeting took place at 1.30 p.m. but the Government came in and no discussions happened. It came in to say the meeting had been put off until 4 p.m. It is unacceptable to have any delay for people to concoct new stories. We want direct, factual accounts and statements from the various people. Fianna Fáil did not speak up against the move to delay that Business Committee discussion. We need an answer about statements today, not tomorrow or Thursday, from the relevant Ministers and, for that matter, from those who have made statements on this on the Opposition benches so that the public gets truth and clarity.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The time proposed for the meeting of the Business Committee is only acceptable if the Taoiseach indicates that the Government, at the committee, will be agreeable to have the relevant Ministers make statements and take questions. A debate must then follow and this must happen today. Otherwise, we will not agree to shunt the issue off to a meeting of the Business Committee which will then bury it until the Taoiseach decides he wants it discussed. We need an indication now that the Taoiseach is agreeable to having statements from the relevant Ministers and a debate today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question was about statements from Ministers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We first want an answer to our question on statements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need the Taoiseach to answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not hear the Taoiseach's answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will it go to committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maurice McCabe has lifted a rock and what has appeared from underneath it does not look pleasant at all. I want to know from either the Taoiseach or Tánaiste whether they will be led by what Maurice McCabe, the brave whistleblower, has asked for in terms of answering the questions. I note the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has responded to the questions that relate to her Department and has already sent answers to the McCabes and she is willing to further engage, but the Minister for Justice and Equality has suggested she will not respond to the questions that the McCabes believe can be answered even before a tribunal of inquiry is established. Why is the Minister taking a different line from the Minister, Deputy Zappone?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have another question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one more question.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the Tánaiste and Minister for Children and Youth Affairs not believe it is relevant to the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry to be discussed that we now have two Garda whistleblowers against whom false allegations of sexual abuse have been made involving Tusla? Do they not believe this is relevant to the decision on the terms of reference? I ask the Tánaiste and the Minister to give straight answers to that question because it is highly relevant. If there is a pattern of using Tusla to-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am reading from the report today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has made clear its view on this matter but does the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs believe it is tenable for Nóirín O'Sullivan to remain in situ as Garda Commissioner? Notwithstanding the Commissioner's right to due process, if any of these allegations were true - we do not know and it should be without prejudice - her being in situ potentially prejudices the ability of any tribunal to get to the truth of the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister consider that to be a tenable position?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs did not respond to a direct question I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She is about to respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that intervention, the Taoiseach needs to respond further.
