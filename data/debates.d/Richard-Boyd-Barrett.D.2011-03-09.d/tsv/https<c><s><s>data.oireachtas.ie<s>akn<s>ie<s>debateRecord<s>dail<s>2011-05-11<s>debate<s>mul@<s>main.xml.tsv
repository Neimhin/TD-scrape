Given that many low paid workers are concerned about the threat the review poses to their pay and conditions, perhaps the Taoiseach will say when we can expect the Government's response to it and when we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter in the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the Taoiseach's response and the comments that have been made around the jobs initiative, with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, making the same points on radio this morning, I do not doubt that he is concerned about dealing with the jobs issue, as is everyone.  There is, however, a significant difference of opinion about how to do that.  Much of the emphasis in terms of who the Taoiseach is talking to and who is advising him is very much to one side of the economic perspective.  My question is about the extent to which the Taoiseach will engage with workers, civil society groups and academics who are suggesting that we are moving in precisely the wrong direction to deal with the jobs crisis.  That opens debates about the IMF programme.  Is there a willingness to engage seriously in new forums in this Chamber and externally in terms of who the Taoiseach meets and talks to, particularly those who have a different perspective on how to deal with the situation and who feel the current path is unsustainable and will not work?
