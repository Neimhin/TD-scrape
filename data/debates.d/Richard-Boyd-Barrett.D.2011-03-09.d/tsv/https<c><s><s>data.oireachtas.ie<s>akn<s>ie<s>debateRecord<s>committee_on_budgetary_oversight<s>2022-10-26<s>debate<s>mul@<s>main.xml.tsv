RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank everybody for all their great work on all the documents they produced around the budget. I know it is a huge job. I am glad to see the tax expenditures report as well, which is an area at which our committee is looking. I will ask a question about that in a minute. On the overall view of the budget, however, it was suggested that the overall impact of the budget is "strongly progressive". In a contribution to us last week, a representative of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated that when we disregard the one-off measures:The effect of permanent 2023 policy measures to inflation-proofed policies for 2020 gives an indication of the more medium-term challenges facing households and policy-makers. Compared with indexing tax and welfare policies in line with inflation since 2020, budget 2023 leaves households worse off on average.I understand the ESRI is saying that if we strip out the once-off measures, people are left worse off. It also said that pensioners and lone parents are "likely to experience average income losses" and that the increase in the cut-off rate for the standard rate of tax was going to favour higher-income households. This would challenge the view put forward here that it is "strongly progressive". I am curious as to how the Departments would respond to the ESRI's assessment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it fair to say, though, taking into account the projected level of inflation, particularly because a lot of the once-off measures will have an impact shortly, that, as we head into next year, after the bump people will get from the one-off measures, the ESRI's assessment will be correct, that is, that people will see income losses and that certain groups, particularly vulnerable ones, will be worse off, notwithstanding the fact that the ESRI says exactly what has been said here, that is, that initial-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the point Deputy Mairéad Farrell brought up, may I try to elaborate on the question about the cost of the HAP, RAS and leasing schemes and the current expenditure threat, that is, the financial threat of the current expenditure between those schemes being €1 billion, with rents going up and, therefore, the potential for the payments under those schemes to go up? The point which the Opposition makes and which the Government sort of acknowledges is that we would be better off phasing out and moving away from those schemes and that if we had our own housing stock, we would be able to start to reduce reliance on the HAP, RAS and leasing payments. I know that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, report, has more or less made that point as well. I know that the witnesses are not the policymakers, but is there a plan to get to a point at which we wean ourselves off those schemes? Do the witnesses get my point? Often in this debate the point is made that we cannot get rid of the HAP, RAS and leasing schemes immediately, and of course we cannot, but is there a plan to phase them out whereby, at a certain point, the scale of social and public housing provision we have projected we will deliver will get us to a point at which we no longer have to rely on HAP and RAS leasing? I am talking about the financial projections of that, of large current expenditures year on year starting to reduce because another thing is happening, that is, that people are moving out of HAP and RAS tenancies and into permanent public housing, whereby there is no longer a big current expenditure. Do the witnesses get my point? Maybe I am not explaining it very well, but do they see a point at which we will no longer have that reliance? Are there projections of that sort? Such a policy is talked about but I do not see it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But financial projections-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I suggest that they are not and that they involve both Departments? It is very much a public expenditure concern if there is a very big area of current expenditure. Yes, it is absolutely the job of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to say, "Here is our plan for public housing, and our policy is to reduce slowly but surely the level of HAP, RAS and leasing payments and the level of current expenditure." Surely, however, the trajectory of the reduction in that level of current public expenditure is very much the concern of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Surely-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At the moment, however, there are no particular projections of an incremental reduction over a period of years. The witnesses will know the way we project out expenditure over a five-year period or whatever. There are no projections as to how these payments, the nearly €1 billion going out now, will reduce, are there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would just be useful for us to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the point of view of expenditure of public funds, it would be quite useful to know that. I have made the point. On the tax expenditures, the tax expenditures report acknowledges that it does not cover all tax expenditures. I think it identifies €7.7 billion of tax expenditures as the ones it looked at, the large ones, the significant ones or whatever, but it does not include intra-group transactions. I am curious about that because in the Revenue tables, intra-group transactions are by far and away the biggest, by multiples of all the others. In the latest Revenue tables I think intra-group transactions as a tax expenditure amount to €35 billion. That had jumped from, I think, about €29 billion in just one year. It has gone up by similar amounts each year. That is a huge tax expenditure - it dwarfs all the rest of them - but it is not included in the tax expenditure reports. Why not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is corporate tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry. I should have made that clear. It is corporate tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just to signal that it would be good to get a response on that because it is huge.Without a shadow of a doubt, it revolves around the area of intellectual property and royalties from same, intangible assets and all that kind of stuff, which we know is the big area where profit shifting is going on. At the very least, it bears scrutiny and some explanation when such a big figure is involved. I do not see why it would be left out of the tax expenditure report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Research and development.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Research and development are included.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not even mentioned some of the allowances, which also deserve scrutiny. There are big figures involved. Assuming they are part of the base is not necessarily a fair assumption. Figures that high deserve scrutiny, particularly when there is an incredible variation in them. An amount described by Revenue as a tax expenditure can jump by €6 billion or €7 billion in a year. That warrants explanation, at the very least. I will just say that. I have not studied every single page of the public expenditure report but I have read quite a bit of it. Am I right in saying that when the Revised Estimates, which are a sort of consolidated version of the public expenditure report, come out, we tend to get a more detailed breakdown of the different programme expenditures, whereas on budget today, we only hear about programme expenditure, current, capital and total? We get last year's and this year's figures but we do not really get any breakdown. I can see there are certain practical and logistical difficulties and perhaps the issue relates to those. It would certainly help clarify certain debates about how much has been allocated to capital expenditure in housing or how much is going to this or that programme if the same level of detail, or something close to it, was available in the breakdown of programme expenditure on budget day. It would help to avoid some interminable rows about how much has actually been allocated, for example, to capital expenditure on housing. Would it be possible for that level of detail on programme expenditure to be made available on budget day in the budget book?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will often say on budget day that a certain amount is being allocated to additional capital expenditure and such and such. I would like to know whether the Minister and the Department have that information. When capital expenditure on housing is broken down, it includes, for example, retrofit. It does not all go to the building of houses but instead includes quite a few other things. It involves grants for the adaptation of houses and a whole number of other headings. We do not quite know what it is. Do the Department and the Government know the allocations on budget day but do not include that in the book or do they not know until December when a more detailed breakdown is available? Perhaps our guests are not allowed to tell me that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any reason those indicative numbers could not be included in the budget book?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just make that as a suggestion, considering this is the budget scrutiny committee. It would be great if a more detailed breakdown of the programme of expenditure could be available on budget day. I understand it will be adjusted with the Revised Estimates but it would be useful if it could be included in the budget book.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department is trying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Callaghan. I understand it is a big job.
