To cut a long story short, they stated the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had sanitised and gutted the HSE's submission. It was then put together as a joint submission to the Public Service Pay Commission. The HSE's submission to the Minister which is not the submission made to the pay commission stated retention was a big problem and that pay was a factor. Essentially, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gutted that submission because the Minister did not want to acknowledge the problem politically. This is related to the criticism about not accurately estimating expenditure to be incurred. The Minister is not facing the reality which then just comes back and bites him. In this case, it is going to come back and bite him in the form of a nurses' strike. The dogs on the street know that pay is at the base of the failure to recruit nurses. For every four nursing posts advertised, there is only one application. There are nearly 2,000 fewer nurses in the public health service today than in 2008. We are not able to recruit them. Meanwhile, the number of health managers is burgeoning. The costs arise because the Minister is failing to address the underlying problem. I would like a direct answer to the question as to whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gutted or sanitised the HSE's submission that acknowledged there was a major retention problem and that the problem was related to pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have seen the document from the INMO that shows substantial passages in which the HSE acknowledges the problem. I do not have time to quote them now. The Minister's answer is not accurate. The passages do not appear in the joint submission made to the Public Service Pay Commission.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would appear that part of the reason the Public Service Pay Commission did not acknowledge that there was a retention problem was because the submission from the HSE, which stated there was a retention problem, did not get to it. Essentially, key passages were gutted. In the joint submission from the employers, namely, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, all of the references to the retention problem were removed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I hear. I hear that the Department influenced and sanitised the submission from the HSE. I have seen evidence showing that. Anyway, I have made my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My second point is on the same issue. The Minister is misleading the public and being disingenuous by referring to a €300 million cost in respect of the nurses' pay demands. He is not acknowledging that there will be significantly increased tax as a result of that and the additional recruitment. He is not acknowledging the savings that will be made in the payment of agency nurses, which runs at approximately €2 million per week. He is not acknowledging the fact that, to recruit nurses from overseas, we are paying foreign companies €10,000 per recruit, and we are still not recruiting enough people. Should the Minister not acknowledge that the price tag of €300 million is an exaggeration that he is using to deflect from the legitimacy of the nurses' pay claim?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it probably would happen. I have some sympathy for the Minister when he gets criticised for spending too much only for the same people to demand he spend more, but he cannot level that charge at us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We supported the VAT increase. We proposed measures like increasing employer's PRSI, financial transaction taxes and wealth taxes, which would have generated the necessary revenue. Is the IFAC not correct when it says that the Minister is not acknowledging the real costs that will be incurred and the expenditures that he will have to make? To plug the gap, he is using unsustainable corporate tax revenues when he should be contemplating other areas of taxation like those I have mentioned, closing corporate tax loopholes and so on.
