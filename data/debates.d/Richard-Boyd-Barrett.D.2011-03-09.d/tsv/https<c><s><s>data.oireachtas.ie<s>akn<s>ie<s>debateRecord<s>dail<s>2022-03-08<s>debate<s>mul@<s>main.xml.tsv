RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The world is rightly horrified at the unfolding disaster that is being unleashed on the people of Ukraine with Putin's bloody, inexcusable and murderous invasion of that country. Ireland's voice needs to be absolutely clear in condemning utterly that murderous invasion. We need, as I think it is clear the people of this country want, to extend every form of humanitarian assistance and support to those suffering under the bombs, bullets and shells of the Russian military, and to those who are fleeing their homes to escape this bloody conflict. We must provide refuge and be as generous as we possibly can in providing refuge for those fleeing from the Ukrainian crisis. I must say, however, that it is extremely worrying to me that it seems that there is a clamour of media commentators and, more seriously, the Taoiseach and leading Ministers, who seem to be trying to exploit this Ukrainian tragedy and crisis to argue that we need to move Ireland away from its traditional position of military neutrality and closer to NATO and the project of European militarisation. We heard it from the Tánaiste last week and we have heard it from the Taoiseach. The latest example of this came from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, who was speaking in New York to the US Council on Foreign Relations, a body packed with hundreds of senior government officials, arguing that we need to consider greater co-operation with NATO and increased arms expenditure. I find it absolutely extraordinary that in the face of the dire consequences of warmongering and militarism on the part of Putin, there is a thought that somehow more militarism, more arms expenditure and allying more closely with a military alliance that has also conducted and supported murderous wars elsewhere in the world is somehow a legitimate response. If we are opposed to Putin's brutal and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine, and we must be, we should not respond to that by joining an alliance dominated by powers that, for example, are supporting the Saudi dictatorship, which is conducting an equally murderous war in Yemen that has killed more than 300,000 people over the past four years and has now, according to the UN, brought 14 million people to the brink of starvation, or by continuing to ignore what Amnesty International is calling the crimes against humanity that Israel commits against Palestinians, supported and armed by the United States and the western powers.In the face of this tragedy, is it not time to recommit to Ireland's position of military neutrality, which does not mean ignoring this crisis, but being a voice for sanity against the madness of warmongering and militarism?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning I received an email from a former member of the Defence Forces who described how at every single military checkpoint he or any Irish soldier was ever at, their safety and our credibility was protected by our neutrality. He went on to say that, lately, we have been picking our fights, and the more we do so, the more we lose our integrity. He asked me to urge this House to keep the faith with military neutrality for that reason. That is the problem.If we oppose the madness we are seeing unfolding in Ukraine, we have to be consistent in opposing all militarism and all imperialism and not be selective. Absolutely, we must condemn Putin's brutal invasion, but are we going to condemn less what the Saudi dictatorship is doing in Yemen now, supported by the US and the UK, who are members of NATO, and are armed to the teeth by the West, or what Amnesty International describes as crimes against humanity on an ongoing basis against the Palestinian people, or say nothing about it? Does neutrality not mean standing against all warmongering and all dictators, and do we not have to hold fast to that tradition that indeed helped found this State, with the ideas of people like James Connolly and the rebels of 1916 rebelling against the madness of the First World War?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is horrible, but so is the war in Yemen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before the war in Ukraine, we urged the Taoiseach to use the powers the State has under the consumer Act to control the spiralling prices of heating fuels and energy, which are impoverishing huge numbers of people and increasing fuel poverty. There is an even stronger case for that now with the spiralling prices as a result of the Ukraine war. Some of this is being fuelled by speculation, which should also not be allowed. Does the Taoiseach now think it is time for the Government to use the powers available to control the unit prices of heating fuel and energy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there were spiralling inflation and cost-of-living increases. When I was briefed by the Department of Finance, it said the war in Ukraine and the impact on energy prices was going to add another 4% on top of that in terms of further inflation. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that and update the House on it. In that regard, when public servants, of whom the Government is the employer, are limited to 1% increases, that means the people the Government employs are going to be suffering significant wage cuts in the coming period. In that context, does the Taoiseach think we need to revise that and give pay increases to public and civil servants, and indeed all workers, but particularly the ones this Government employs, to compensate for the spiralling cost of living?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today, the Taoiseach once again rightly, as we all do, condemned the crimes against humanity of Vladimir Putin in the invasion of Ukraine. The Taoiseach has cited his support for sanctions and so on against Russia, with the possible replacement of Russian gas and energy. The Taoiseach may be interested to know that as one response to this, President Joseph Biden’s advisers are considering that he should go to Saudi Arabia to replace Russian oil with Saudi Arabian oil. I wonder what the Taoiseach thinks about the irony of this because Saudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship supported by the US and the UK, armed by them, and engaged in a bloody war in Yemen. Does the Taoiseach think it would be consistent to replace the oil and gas from Russia, one despotic warmongering country, with the oil of another despotic warmongering country, Saudi Arabia?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not so much Saudi Arabia.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Jesus, they just chop up people with swords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just against all dictators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the same in Yemen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is selling arms to the Saudi dictatorship. The Taoiseach does not want to mention that. It is embarrassing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach certainly does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach knows, this is International Women's Day. In this country, church organisations have played a pretty terrible role, historically, in their treatment of women and their denial of rights to women. This is something we have begun to overcome with the successful campaigns to repeal the eighth amendment, for marriage equality and so forth. Yet, it is still the intention of this Government to pay for the new maternity hospital we need, but to leave it in the ownership of the Sisters of Charity.This is an organisation that was part of the Ryan report and the residential institutions Bill; in other words guilty of abuse of women. It will be leased from them through a company that will be owned by the Sisters of Charity. By the way, at present, as I highlighted last week, they are just about to evict a blind 70-year-old woman who was in one of those institutions on that site. She still has not received compensation for her treatment at the hands of the Sisters of Charity. She is now being evicted by them. This is the organisation to which the Taoiseach will give the national maternity hospital. The Sisters of Charity have cancelled the lease with the HSE, which provided disability housing for this woman. Does the Taoiseach really think this organisation, which is doing this to women such as Eleanor, should be handed the national maternity hospital?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is land right beside the hospital. Use a compulsory purchase order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why should a religious body own it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They then wait 20 years for a building.
