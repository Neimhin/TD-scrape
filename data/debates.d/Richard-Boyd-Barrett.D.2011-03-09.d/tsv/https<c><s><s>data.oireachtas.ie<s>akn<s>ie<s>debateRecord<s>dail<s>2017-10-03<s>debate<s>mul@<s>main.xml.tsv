RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was never off it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the committee discuss, and does the Taoiseach propose that it discuss in advance of the European Council, issuing as a State an unequivocal condemnation of the Spanish state and Mariano Rajoy for the brutal and violent suppression of a democratic exercise in self-determination by the people of Catalonia? Article 1 of the UN Charter and all international law clearly defines self-determination. It is the right of people to "freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development." That right has been violently suppressed by the Spanish state. While there has been some mealy-mouthed criticism of violence in general, there has been no straightforward condemnation, and there should be, by the Government and European leaders of the brutal suppression of a democratic exercise in the right to self-determination.That is at stake. We would not accept if the British state stated people in England or Wales had the right to determine whether Scottish people had independence, yet comments made by the Taoiseach and other European leaders appear to stand over the right of the centralised Spanish state to suppress the right of the people of Catalonia to self-determination. It is shocking in its hypocrisy for the European Union that goes on and on about its commitment to human rights to stand idly by while the Spanish state uses the most savage means to crush a democratic exercise in self-determination. Is the Taoiseach going to come out clearly and stand up for the right of people to democratically decide their own political future, while not taking sides on which way they should vote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not on the issue of self-determination specifically.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we for the self-determination of people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is quite disgraceful that a free trade deal that could have very adverse impacts for huge numbers of people in agriculture, for workers' rights and for the environment, but which will further bolster the position of big multinationals to sue a state that interferes with its right to profits, will be provisionally applied by the Government without a debate or a vote in the DÃ¡il. It is outrageous. When asked about it during his visit to Canada, the Taoiseach confirmed that the invitation to Donald Trump to visit this country would stand. I am amazed at this. The Taoiseach said he and the Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, discussed their commitment to climate change but here we have an American President who wants to sabotage international efforts in this area. He does not give a damn what anybody thinks about it. In a terrifying development, he recently talked about the possibility of the United States totally destroying North Korea. This is the man in command of the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world. I need not mention his racist travel ban and all the other vile stuff he promised he would do and is now doing. Is the Taoiseach seriously going to invite this man to Ireland? If so, how advanced are the plans? Have there been active discussions with the White House or US officials about when this visit might take place? I appeal to the Taoiseach not to invite a man who is a dangerous threat to the world on a number of levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am an ally of Donald Trump on no issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are nuclear weapons not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a lot of lipservice paid to the commitment to deal with climate change but often not the radical action that is required to actually do something about it. Nowhere is that more true than in the area of forestry. What practical plans have we got to significantly ramp up the afforestation programme from its current pitifully low level? We are planting only approximately 6,000 ha a year against an official target of 10,000 ha. There is a pitifully low level of forest cover in this State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are the actual figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We used to have a target of 17% of forest cover from the current position of 11%, which is one of the lowest in Europe. The average forest cover in Europe is 30% but we are at a pathetic 11%. Previously, the target was to reach 17% by 2030. Now that has been pushed out to 18% by 2045 because the Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, said that in order to reach those targets we need to be planting 10,000 ha a year, minimum, with a sustained yield. We are averaging approximately 6,000 ha. The Minister of State says it might go up as high as 7,000 ha this year. That is still well short of the 10,000 ha. That is against a pathetic failure to meet the targets we need to meet if we are to get anywhere close to those further targets. There is anecdotal evidence, which needs to be examined, that felling is happening too early. It is happening at 20 years rather than best forest practice of between 35 and 50 years. If that is happening, even the afforestation that is taking place is being undermined by felling too early which will also slow down our ability to meet the targets. Can the Minister of State confirm that the ESB imports 40,000 utility poles a year? We cannot even provide poles for the ESB, another indication of our failure in this area. That is how poor our forestry sector is. What will we do to ramp it up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the fact the Minister of State has acknowledged that point and the need to address this but our approach to this issue needs to be more robust or aggressive. We are still falling way short. We are completely underutilising public land that could be developed and that would not be useful for other purposes. The McCarthy report suggested that Coillte has 0.5 million acres that might not be suitable for narrowly commercial forestry but in terms of long-term forestry to meet climate change targets and so on, it is just sitting there and could be used. We should be examining those 0.5 million acres. Are motorways planted? We should consider other land that is not being used for other things. Are we planting it? Have we got a plan to get up to the 10,000 ha of planting? There are young people in my area who are so exercised about the issue of climate change that they have gone to the local council and said they want to get out and plant trees. We need programmes to encourage that kind of initiative and the use of public land as well as trying to encourage and incentivise farmers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Condemning the violence, as the Taoiseach has done, is a start, but it is not acceptable for European Union leaders, including the Taoiseach, to refuse to condemn the violent suppression of the exercise of self-determination. They are condemning violence but not the decision to suppress a democratic vote. In fact, to some extent, there is a justification for talking about it being an internal Spanish matter to be dealt with under Spanish law. The UN charter and international law are crystal clear on the right to self-determination, but that right is being violently suppressed by the Spanish state, a European state. European leaders are not condemning it or saying the people of Catalonia have a right to vote and make their own decision on their political, social and cultural future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am also concerned by the response. The Minister of State said, "We trust our Spanish friends to decide for themselves how to shape their future." That is the problem. I do not trust Mariano Rajoy or the Spanish state that has a brutal history of suppressing the desire for self-determination of the people of Catalonia. We do not and should not trust them. What we saw on Saturday was a shocking, violent suppression of people who were acting peacefully and trying to do so in a democratic way. The Catalan Parliament made a democratic decision to hold a referendum and the people went out to try to cast their ballot papers and the Spanish state suppressed them violently. The European Union is always going on about its commitment to human rights. This is an elementary human right under international law for people to exercise the freedom to self-determination and the Spanish state is denying it. What is the Government going to state about this? What is the European Union going to state about it? If it states nothing, its claim to be concerned about democracy or human rights will be in tatters. Frankly, it has covered itself in shame in the last few days in failing to speak out more robustly about what the Spanish state is doing.
