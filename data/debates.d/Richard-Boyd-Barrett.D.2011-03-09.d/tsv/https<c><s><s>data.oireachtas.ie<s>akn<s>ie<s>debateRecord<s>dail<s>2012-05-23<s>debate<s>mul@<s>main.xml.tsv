RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not debating.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should debate the treaty.  He should stop hiding behind media soundbites.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He always gets the last word during these brief Dáil exchanges.  The people should get full information on all the issues pertaining to this treaty.  The European Stability Mechanism is one of the central issues he has raised as an argument for supporting the treaty.  He should take this opportunity to tell the people of this country the truth about the ESM.  Will he admit the reality that we will be liable to pay up to €11 billion if we sign up to the ESM?  That is what our liability will amount to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That money is likely to end up bailing out Spanish banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After putting billions of euro into bailing out Irish banks, we will end up bailing out Spanish banks and other European banks.  Where will we get the €11 billion from?  That money is in addition to the €8 billion in cuts under the troika programme over the next three years, the €5 billion in cuts that are required to meet the deficit targets under the fiscal treaty and the billions in interest repayments on a debt that will be €200 billion by the time we exit the programme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach admit that even if we pass the fiscal treaty, there is no guarantee that we will get money from the ESM?  If the Spanish banks require recapitalisation, there might not be enough money in the ESM to provide assistance to this State if it requires it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even if we can access money from the ESM, it will be subject to strict conditionality, which means more austerity will be shoved down the throats of the people of this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not incredible that the ESM gives complete immunity from legal prosecution to the board of governors of the ESM?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ESM will pay no tax.  All of its documentation will be inviolable from any sort of oversight or investigation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what is in the treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach admit that the ESM is not an insurance policy for the Irish people?  It is not a good reason to vote for the fiscal treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is actually one of the best reasons to vote against the fiscal treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not an insurance policy for the people of this country.  It is an insurance policy for the banks and the speculators in Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a mechanism to shove more austerity down the throats of Irish citizens-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and citizens across Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the truth that the Taoiseach is deceiving people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the ESM treaty, which I have before me, "there may be paid out of the Central Fund or the growing produce of that Fund sums, aggregating to a sum not exceeding €11,145,400,000".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is in the treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The treaty also states that "if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States", then "the ESM may therefore provide stability support".  If it "may" provide it, then it follows that it may not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point I am making is that "may" is not the same as "will".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The treaty also provides that "in the interest of the ESM, the Chairperson of the Board of Governors, Governors, alternate Governors, Directors, alternate Directors, as well as the Managing Director-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and other staff members shall be immune from legal proceedings".  That is what it says.  It is incredible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is no wonder that the Taoiseach does not want to face the facts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----own up about the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I started with "Will the Taoiseach", which means I was about to ask a question.  Will he own up about the deception he is perpetrating on the Irish people about the real content of the ESM?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It may cost us €11 billion to bail out the European banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have no control over this body.  It will be immune from prosecution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will not have to pay taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not say that.  I have never said that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should not confuse me with others on these benches.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We never say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy should stop making up our argument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said we have to be able to access it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Shame the devil and tell the truth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is true that there are a lot of variables when we are trying to project future growth rates, inflation and so on.  However, I think the Minister is covering up the facts about what we have to do to meet these targets because of the impact that might have on a vote on the fiscal treaty.  If inflation was rising significantly or if there was a significant prospect of growth in excess of the forecast on which the Minister based his budget, then he would be right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case, however, that all the variables are moving in the opposite direction?  That means it is more likely that the Minister will have to make even bigger adjustments, namely cuts, in order to meet the targets when the treaty's provisions come into force.  That fact has been confirmed by Professor John McHale, chairman of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  Professor McHale wrote that in the event that nominal GDP growth were to end up 1% weaker per annum, over the period 2012 to 2105, than envisaged in the budget 2012, the debt to GDP ratio would not stabilise by 2015 without additional discretionary measures.  In other words, matters would be worse.  Since those words were written, the growth projections have been significantly downgraded.  Growth forecasts are worse, thus making the possibility of having to inflict brutal cuts to meet the fiscal targets more likely rather than less.  It is about time the Minister admitted to the Irish public that that is a real possibility arising from the provisions of the treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Really and truly, I think the Minister is trying to blind people with science.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the Minister's own figures show that even if those growth projections had held up, we would have been looking at approximately €5 billion to €6 billion to meet deficit targets post-2015?  Several billion would also be needed to meet the debt-to-GDP ratio targets contained in the treaty unless there is significant growth in the economy, which there is not because the growth projections are being downgraded.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that we can have a €200 billion debt and a 3% structural deficit, and it will not cost us anything to reduce that to 0.5% or 60% of GDP.  How can one make those sort of repayments and adjustments without it costing billions in cuts for ordinary people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That has nothing to do with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to your gang on Leaders' Questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must put it to the Minister that yet again deception is being exercised on our people, particularly in advance of the vote in the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  Members of the Government are talking about and using the word "growth" a good deal.  We have heard its use  again by the Minister, the Taoiseach uses it a good deal and there is good deal of talk about it around the European Council summit.  However, in practice, we get austerity.According to the German newspaper, Der Spiegel, at the ECOFIN meeting referred to in the questions, the Minister was reported as having berated the Greek Government for failing to robustly enough impose austerity on the Greek citizens.  These are the same Greek citizens who have been massacred with cuts under austerity-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and whose economy has been destroyed with the imposition of that austerity.  Is it not the case that this taken alongside the insulting comment the Minister made about feta cheese, which was insulting to the Greek people who are suffering, are not only insulting to the Greeks but indicate the Minister's Government is still, along with Angela Merkel, promoting the austerity agenda, which has crippled growth and done such damage to the lives of ordinary citizens here and across Europe, instead of seriously addressing the question of growth, which requires an end to the austerity agenda and real investment in putting people back to work?  The Minister is playing something of a double game in talking about growth on the one hand and arguing for austerity on the other hand, particularly when he is over in Europe with his EU partners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that analysis not show a very simplistic and inaccurate understanding of what the consequences would be if there was a Greek exit from euro pushed by the austerity that has been imposed by Europe?  All the commentators, even the person who negotiated the Greek write-down of debt, have pointed out that we could face a much deeper recession if Greece is forced out of the eurozone to the degree that output across Europe could drop by 5%.  To suggest that the only impact would be sales of feta cheese is utterly simplistic, trivialises the issue and not to mention is insulting to the Greek people who are suffering so much.  Is it not the truth and a more accurate analysis that if Greece were forced out of the euro because of the determination of Europe to shove more austerity down its throat, that it could plunge Europe as a whole from recession into depression and trigger contagion right throughout the periphery and into the core of the Europe economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pie in the sky.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not happening.  Where is the investment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome that NAMA funds might be invested back into the economy to create employment and hopefully growth, which seems entirely sensible.  I agree completely with the Minister's earlier comments.  However, in what should it invest?  Are the investment and employment sustainable?  What are the long-term impacts of investing in particular areas?  Is the Minister not concerned that NAMA's focus seems to be essentially on trying to refloat the property market, which was precisely what got us into trouble?  While, of course, we need housing, I am concerned that the whole thing seems to be predicated on keeping as much as is possible the private developers, who helped us get into this mess, in business by paying them.  They will often own the assets at the end of the process rather than us owning them and also the rental revenue coming back to us on a long-term basis, which would also be a way for us to control the property market in future and prevent the sort of speculative bubble market in property which caused the crisis in the first place.  Should we not have more direct control by owning the assets that will generate revenue and wealth for the economy in the future?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to admit a certain personal interest in this matter.  I am the father of a child who attends Newpark Comprehensive School.  Another one of my children will go there in a few years time.  As Deputy Harris said, Newpark Comprehensive School caters for 830 children.  It is one of the few non-fee paying secondary schools in its large catchment area, which extends from County Wicklow to parts of Dublin like Booterstown and Mount Merrion that are closer to the city centre.  I suggest that the current economic crisis will lead to an increase in the demand for non-fee paying schools.  I cannot overstate the anger, frustration and disappointment of the parents, staff and students of the school when they heard the news in December of last year - 17 years after the Department accepted that the school needed a new building, such was its level of dilapidation even at that stage - that it was not listed to receive the rebuild that was expected to take place this year.The school has spent 17 years going through all the hoops, working up designs, getting planning permission, going through appeals and battling to get its dilapidated building rebuilt.  Even though the Department accepts a new building is needed, it has taken the school off the list and said the rebuild will not happen until 2015.  Tiles are falling off the roof of the school.  Its science laboratories do not have proper running water all of the time.  It has lighting problems and disability access problems.  There are rotten smells in the school corridors.  The science rooms are not of the standard required to deliver the science syllabus.  In many cases, the toilets are completely inadequate.  There are problems with people tripping over, etc., because of problems with the floors.  There are all sorts of problems.  The school is seriously dilapidated.  The Department accepted 17 years ago that a new school was needed.  I urge the Minister and the Department to deliver the rebuild of this school.  It should not be delayed until 2015.  It should be put back on the list for this year or for 2013, at the very latest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State's response is not adequate.  The parents, students and staff have been fighting for this school and they have gone through all the hoops for 17 years.  The Department has long since accepted the urgent need to rebuild this school to enable it to deliver the education syllabus and to provide adequate surroundings in order for 830 students to learn.  At present, the school is a health and safety hazard.  It is not suitable for the job it is supposed to do, namely, to teach more than 800 young people and educate them properly.  It is not fair on the students, staff and parents to delay this when they have done everything right and when the Department itself has accepted they deserve this rebuild.I appeal to and urge the Minister to reconsider this and to give a commitment that the rebuild of Newpark school will go ahead this year or at the very latest next year, as was expected and as the Department had indicated would happen.  It is simply not fair, justified or acceptable that this should be delayed for another few years which, I suspect, would leave parents, students and staff believing they will never get the rebuild and that it will always - again and again - be put on the long finger when it is so urgently needed.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that he will review this and do something to help the extreme anger and frustration of the parents, staff and students of Newpark, who deserve their new school?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like others, I broadly welcome the amalgamation of HETAC, FETAC and the National Qualification Authority into this new body, the QQAI.  It makes sense to tidy up and streamline the various bodies that deal with quality assurance and educational awards and to make them compatible with similar systems across Europe.  However, following on our discussion earlier on schools like Newpark, the best quality assurance in the world is meaningless if we do not put the necessary resources into the provision of education.  It is difficult to see how even the most beautifully streamlined quality assurance structure or administration will make a blind bit of difference if we have secondary school students trying to learn science, for example, in science labs that are not fit for purpose, where tiles are falling off roofs, there is no hot running water, there are serious health and safety issues and where hazardous science equipment is stored unsafely.  This is just one school.  The Minister of State made the point earlier that there are other schools even worse.  It is an alarming prospect if that level of dilapidation exists in the amenities and facilities available at second level for students and, similarly, when significant budget cuts are imposed at third level.This is all happening against a background where, essentially, a demographic bomb is working its way through our education system, in that approximately 10,000 extra young people are joining the education system every year.  This will work its way up through second and third level.  If we cut our already inadequate resources, facilities and amenities and cut budgets, we are storing up a very large problem.  As Deputy Donnelly said, if there is any way out of the economic mess we are in, it is through investing in all levels of our education system and in our young people.  This is critical if we are to chart a way out of the mess.  In the end, skilled and educated people are the raw material that will allow us work our way out of economic crisis.  Cutting budgets and resources for education in general seems a little like shifting deck chairs on the Titanic.Other concerns have been raised with me.  There is significant concern among staff of the various authorities being amalgamated and merged with regard to conditions.  Whereas their remuneration will not be affected, it is unclear in the Bill whether they can transfer their conditions, entitlements and pension rights when they move to the new body.  Can the Minister of State give us some assurance that there will be no interference with or downgrading of their terms and conditions or pension entitlements, given the new single pension scheme, and so on?  Can he clarify what their rights and entitlements and other terms and conditions will be when they move to the new amalgamated body?Another important issue is the composition of the board of the new body.  A number of people involved in the education sector have raised a concern about the lack of stakeholder involvement.  There is a lack of representation of education providers and, I might add, students, on the new board.  On 27 March, I asked the Minister about the lack of involvement of stakeholders on the board and I am concerned by the response I received.He could not justify stakeholder involvement on the board because it would make it unwieldy and he intended to confine its membership to suitably qualified individuals who had an appropriate mix of skills and experience in areas such as corporate governance and financial expertise.  What the hell has corporate governance and financial expertise got to do with an authority that is responsible for educational standards?  A mindset that prioritises corporate governance and financial expertise over educational expertise is a cause for concern.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the decision to exclude stakeholders because, given their knowledge of education, they are the best qualified people to judge standards and awards.Representatives of English language schools have described the economic benefits of involving them as stakeholders on the board.  One individual pointed out that the failure to reserve a place on the board for language schools was a break with past practice and that it would deny the sector access to decision making at an executive level.  This individual felt strongly that, as major stakeholders in the international sector, approved language schools should have a voice at that level and that their absence would have a detrimental effect on regulation of the sector in the long term.  Every 100 international students from places like the Middle East and Asia produce 15 additional jobs in the economy.  One teaching post is created for every 15 students.  This is an expanding area for the small and medium enterprises that the Government claims it wants to support.  Why are the experts in this area not represented as stakeholders on the board?  Similar arguments could be made in respect of other third level areas.I am not saying administration, financial expertise and corporate governance are completely irrelevant to quality assurance in the education system, but why is the emphasis on these skills rather than the involvement of stakeholders and education providers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not possible to overstate the importance of commemorating the site of the 1916 Rising.  It is even more important because of the terrible situation in which the country now finds itself.  In many ways it is as significant an historic crossroads as the one at which we found ourselves in 1916.  It is tremendously important that we honour and pay proper tribute to the heroes of 1916, their political determination, vision, bravery and heroism and properly commemorate this memory and protect the site of the last stand of the 1916 rebels precisely to remind us of what political vision, bravery and determination look like at a time when we desperately need them.The 1916 Easter Rising was the first strike in the foundation of the State.  It was also the first strike in the international movement against the horrors of the First World War.  It was the beginning of the end of the British Empire, and an inspiration to peoples and movements throughout the world who struck out against colonisation and empire.  It is a monument of international significance.  Even at the time, the 1916 rebellion echoed across the European continent and beyond.  It is very important that we do justice to this memory.I do not understand why, if the Government states it agrees with the general spirit of the motion, it has proposed an amendment.  All the motion proposes is that nothing should be done which would compromise this historic site; that any development which takes place in the area should ensure the proper preservation of the historic site; and it should be developed as an historic quarter.  There is no reason for the Government to table an amendment.  The details can be debated and discussed with the families and other stakeholders but there does not seem to be anything objectionable in the original motion.Even in terms of modern economic concerns, it is quite telling how we deal with these matters when we speak about the development of our city centre.  Why do people come here?  What is it that makes the country attractive to people?  Is it building shopping centres and monuments to consumerism or is it precisely our history and our architectural, historical and political heritage?  Commemorating this history and heritage properly, sensitively and respectfully will not only pay proper tribute to the rebels of 1916, but it will make Dublin a more attractive place.  It will be a boost to tourism at every level.  It will be a win for the city and the country.  Desecrating this historic site would have the opposite effect.I appeal to the Government to support the motion.  There is no need to amend it.  The details can be worked out with all the stakeholders as we move along.
