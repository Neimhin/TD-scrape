RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise to our guests. I did not hear their earlier contributions because I was at another committee next door. It was a bit frustrating. I apologise in advance if I repeat questions. What do the witnesses think of what I would favour to deal with energy price rises, rent and house price increases and other forms of inflation which will adversely impact on our economy and society? I favour controls. Controls, in and of themselves, do not solve all the problems. If there is a genuine lack of supply in an area, the controls do not solve the problem because of either genuine shortages or as I expect it is much of the time, bad planning, whether it is a failure to plan or allowing market cycles to determine the supply of certain things.Having said all that, and if we take housing inflation as an example, while I do not think rent controls solve all the problems, as a stopgap until we get planning right on housing and we can deliver the supply that would at least deal with the shortage, it is a legitimate thing to do. The other aspect is if we need to subsidise certain things because they are just too important to allow them get out of the reach of ordinary people then we must subsidise them. We accept that logic in some areas but we often reject it in others. I would argue we must subsidise certain things because we just have to have them. Thus if public transport costs are getting too expensive, one cannot keep letting them get more expensive, especially if one wants to get people out of their cars. One must say we are going to subsidise to make it cheap and affordable and that we are going to do the same with housing. Of course, energy becomes more controversial because there is a climate imperative but also an imperative to ensure ordinary people can heat their homes. I would be interested in the economists' views but I certainly think controlling energy prices at this point is a legitimate thing to do, however it is done. That might be holding off on carbon taxes or just controlling the prices. I would like to hear the economists' thoughts on using price controls, essentially, to deal with these problems. They would not be a silver bullet but a mechanism, until we get the planning side right, to deliver things that can ensure shortages are not generating inflation or bottlenecks, for that matter, in particular areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I am glad I agree with Professor Whelan on something there, namely, the last point. I respectfully disagree with the economists on the issue of rents, house prices and so on. I will make the obvious point. I made it to the Taoiseach and have made it several times in this debate as supply, supply, supply is always the answer. Forget about the debate between Marx and Hayek, as interesting as that is. I point to our own recent experience. When we had the greatest supply of housing in the history of the State by a long chalk, that is, during the Celtic tiger period, when between 70,000 and 90,000 houses and apartments were being built every year, prices did not go down at any point. They consistently rose. That is because the market and the people who were providing had no interest whatsoever in prices falling. None. To my mind, they will not, of their own volition, increase supply to the point at which prices drop. Why would they? They would be mad to do that, from their point of view. However, from society's point of view the control they have over something as absolutely critical as housing is just not acceptable. I agree with the economists that controls, in and of themselves, are not the silver bullet. However, where the market has clearly failed, as it has in housing, one must do something to get something as basic as housing to a level that is affordable. At the moment it is simply is not and if one says wait for the supply to come on stream one will be waiting a very long time. I would like to hear the economists' answer to how they riddle that one but it seems to me one has to intervene. To an extent, I take Professor Whelan's point about the constitutional provisions around private property. It is interesting how that defence suddenly collapsed when rent pressure zones, RPZs, were brought in and so on. I would like to see all this legal advice from the Attorney General. I am less than convinced about that excuse. The Government has promised a referendum on housing. Let us get on with it and have a referendum in which private property rights could be diluted in order to vindicate something as basic as the right to housing. Regarding energy, it is not an opinion but a fact that the rich are the greatest producers of carbon emissions, so whether geographically or socially, the poor are being punished for the crimes of the rich in destroying our planet. However, we are saying that we should keep loading a self-evidently regressive measure onto the shoulders of the poor. The rich who cause the problems will not be particularly bothered by the carbon tax increases, so there is a real problem with regard to justice, which I believe is central. The climate objectives cannot be delivered if justice is not at the heart of it. It will turn most people off the climate agenda. We cannot afford to do that.
