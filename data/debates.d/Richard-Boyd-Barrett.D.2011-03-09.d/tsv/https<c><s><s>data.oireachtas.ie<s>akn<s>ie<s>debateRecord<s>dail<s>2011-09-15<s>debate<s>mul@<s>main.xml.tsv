RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise two questions.  In regard to the temporary agency workers' Bill, it appears that Stena in DÃºn Laoghaire, in an effort to pre-empt the introduction of this Bill, is trying to get rid of its permanent staff essentially so that it does not have any permanent staff against which to compare the rights of agency workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the Bill come before the House and what measures will be taken to deal with a situation where companies may try to get rid of their permanent workforce, as appears to be the case, before the Bill is enacted?  In regard to the legislative programme distributed yesterday, emphasis was placed on job creation and economic recovery.  Given that hundreds of jobs are being lost at TalkTalk and 450 jobs are being lost in Loughlinstown in south Dublin, in my constituency, I call for a serious debate on jobs and how to deal with getting jobs and the conditions under which redundancies are being imposed on workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have very positive proposals.
