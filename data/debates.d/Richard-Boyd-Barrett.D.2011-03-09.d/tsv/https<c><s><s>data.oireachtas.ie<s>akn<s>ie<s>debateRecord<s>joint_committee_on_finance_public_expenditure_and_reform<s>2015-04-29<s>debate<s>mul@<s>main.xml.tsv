RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their participation. I would like to discuss the variable rate mortgages and the apparent differences in the rates here compared to those in the UK. While profiles of borrowers can vary anywhere, variable interest rates seem to be higher here than in Britain and the North of Ireland. The witnesses referred to greater risk in the South. Could they elaborate on it? Is the greater risk to do with what we have just been through, namely the bubble, the crash and the unprecedented mortgage arrears crisis? Does the bank constantly factor it in and recoup its losses? Is that the reason rates are higher here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Credit losses?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Credit losses refers to losses the bank has incurred in the South of Ireland, presumably much of which has to do with what we have just been through.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I am trying to establish, and this is probably the perception, is that the banks are unloading the cost of their own mistakes onto the variable mortgage holder, therefore, the cost is greater here because we have been through this crisis, which was largely not of the making of the people with the mortgages but of the financial institutions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Brown has made that point, and I do not have much time so I will take that answer. I ask about Mr. Brown's interaction with the Minister, the Department and so on. Can he tell us anything about what the Minister is saying or has said to him on these matters or the degree to which he would be willing to respond to what the Government is saying about the extra pressure it will put on the banks to give people a break on variable mortgages?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I really want to know is whether he is putting pressure on the bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But to date.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To date, the Minister has not put any pressure on Mr. Brown on this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the mortgage arrears issue, what is Mr. Brown's explanation of the 2,000 people who just will not engage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Generally speaking, the mortgage-to-rent process does not seem to have happened. I am disappointed that has not materialised to a greater extent because it is potentially the solution to many of the most difficult cases that one would imagine, that is, people who have lost their jobs and those on low income. Mr. Brown might answer that but I will ask him one final question given that my time is running out. A big issue that has dominated the agenda in recent weeks is the events around Siteserv, and it has opened a window to the bigger issue of big write-downs for corporate and commercial interests. While Mr. Brown is not involved in the Siteserv issue, has he any opinion on the scale of the write-downs being handed out, and what is Ulster Bank's record in regard to big write-downs? The Minister is now saying, after the event, that he wants to know about any write-down over €10 million and so on. Can Mr. Brown tell us anything about the volume of big commercial loans his bank has written down and the writing down of loans in those type of circumstances to that extent, which is arguably of significant benefit to the companies that get them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there anything comparable in terms of where companies that would owe Ulster Bank €150 million, for example, would get a write-down of €110 million?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Brown have anything like that in terms of his bank's write-downs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sold them at a big discount.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Originally, I had one supplementary question but after Deputy Arthur Spring’s question I have two.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the opposite because I totally disagree with what the Deputy just said. Deputy Spring’s line of questioning essentially shows the desperation of the Government trying to resolve the housing crisis. It is now trying to put the onus on the banks to sort it out. That is a futile policy which is destined to go nowhere and, essentially, absolves the Government of its requirement to start building houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not enough by a long mile. From the bank’s point of view, given the Government’s strategy to resolve the serious housing crisis appears to be to beg the banks to start lending again-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what you just said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Spring and the Government are relying on the banks and the private sector to fill this enormous gap in the construction of housing units. Given his own caution about getting back into this market again, does Mr. Brown believe realistically that the banks, collectively, are going to provide the sort of finance that will fill the enormous gap in housing construction that is needed at an affordable level?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not pursue it further. However, I draw from that response that given everything that happened, if other banks are likely to have a similar concern about going down that road again, the current housing crisis will not be resolved - at least alone - by the finance that might be provided by the banking system in this country and that we are going to have to look elsewhere. I understand Mr. Brown was not involved in Siteserv but if I may pursue the question I put to Mr. Brown about Siteserv-type scenarios. If I understand him correctly he said that he cannot imagine a situation where a commercial loan of €150 million would be written down by €110 million where that company would continue in business. I think that is what Mr. Bell said. If I understand him correctly, Mr. Brown followed on from that to say that he cannot envisage circumstances where such a company that was being sold off that the shareholders would be allowed walk away with €5 million. That is fairly damning opinion in terms of what happened in Siteserv, even if Mr. Brown is being moderate in his statement of it. I have one further question for Mr. Brown in the Siteserv case scenario. Can he envisage a situation of that sort where the buyer of the company that is being sold off was somebody who also had a number of other companies that between them had a controlling share in a number of other companies and, between them, owed Mr. Brown's bank hundreds of millions of euro in other arrangements and that he would offer a write-down of that sort in that kind of arrangement?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking Mr. Brown if he would sell them to somebody-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a policy, Mr. Brown seems to be saying "No". I just want clarification. Can he envisage a situation where he would sell them to somebody who had controlling shares in other companies that owed his bank huge sums of money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for missing the earlier session but I had to be at another committee meeting. I am sure many of the issues regarding variable rates and so on have been discussed. Mr. Boucher will be aware that the events around Siteserv have dominated media debate over the last week or two. That has opened up a debate around big write-downs on commercial loans. The figure the Minister is looking at now is loans over €10 million where there were significant write-downs and so on. What has Bank of Ireland's attitude, policy and practice been with regard to big loans and write-downs of the magnitude that we are seeing in the Siteserv case, where somebody owes €150 million and €110 million is written down?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Boucher saying that - I am not unsympathetic to him in this regard if that is what he is saying- under no circumstances could he envisage a situation where somebody owed Bank of Ireland €150 million and €110 million would be written down to keep them in business?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Boucher may not answer this, but did he have some involvement, along with other banks, in the write-down given to Independent News and Media?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So Mr. Boucher took equity in the bank as-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was that of about €100 million?
