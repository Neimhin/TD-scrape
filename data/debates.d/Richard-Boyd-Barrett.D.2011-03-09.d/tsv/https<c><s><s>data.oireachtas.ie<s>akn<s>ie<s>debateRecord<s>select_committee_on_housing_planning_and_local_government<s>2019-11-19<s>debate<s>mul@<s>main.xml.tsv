RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not have a problem with standards being set down. In fact, I want standards to be set down. This is apropos of the general subject area of the amendment rather than the specific purpose of the amendment. Could the Minister explain to me how somebody who has a difficulty with the standards, maintenance or such of an approved housing body unit is not at a disadvantage to a council tenant who would have the same problems?One of the forms of recourse that the council tenant has which the AHB tenant does not have is that he or she can go to the local elected representative and have the issue brought up at the council. To give an example of what I mean, there are minimum standards and there are best standards. I have a group of AHB tenants who have complained about the lack of good sound insulation between units. They have looked for an independent audit of the properties, which are in an estate called Cualanor in Dún Laoghaire. It is quite a big estate. That has not been provided. They have done their own audit which basically states that the developer says the standards are fine, having taken a decibel-measuring machine around, but the residents are adamant that there is a major problem with sound between the units. If those were council tenants, a local councillor could go to the council chamber on their behalf and say they are moving a motion to say there should be an independent audit. If that motion was passed, there would be an independent audit to see whether there was a sound problem. AHB tenants do not have that same recourse. They can go to the RTB but it will only enforce minimal legal standards. It cannot take the next step of saying it is just not happy with this and it is not good enough, even if it just about meets minimum standards. I would be interested to hear the Minister address that. To add to the complexity of it, if one takes this particular instance, these people were allocated places from the council housing list by the council. They go into these AHBs but there is also a property management company and a private developer involved. They have to deal with all these different layers, whereas if they were council tenants, there would be another form of recourse, which I have described. One-stop shop would not be quite the right word but a tenant would know that he or she could go to a person and actually get something done. I ask the Minister to comment on that because it is a problem which will become bigger. The Minister will probably not agree with me but I think the Government is overly reliant on AHBs to deliver social housing and this will become a bigger issue. We need to ensure that all social housing tenants, whatever type of social housing they are in, have the same rights and avenues for addressing problems as each other and that there is not a downgrading or dilution of the forms of recourse that they have because they happen to be in a particular AHB. I ask the Minister to comment on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point that there are different levels of regulation, such as for governance, how AHBs keep their finances and accounts, and so on. Bluntly, my point is that it is more complicated than dealing with a council, from a tenant's point of view. Even though having recourse to the RTB is better than nothing, it is not the same as having recourse to a councillor, who can table a motion at an area committee to state an issue has been examined and it has been decided there is a problem, and that the problem will be addressed in a particular way. The RTB cannot do that. All it can do is comply with the law. Sometimes one will discover that the law does not reach such complexities. Similarly, whatever governance standards, rules or regulations may be set down might not meet those requirements, which is why we have democracy, because we constantly re-evaluate such matters and try to refine them.We learn from people contacting us about problems that may not be covered by all the rules and bodies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19:In page 35, line 6, after “AHB” to insert the following:“, including the number of such units providing social housing and specifically allocated to the local authority waiting list and the numbers of units provided in other categories”.This amendment speaks for itself. We want to know how many of the units of any AHB will be allocated to the housing list and how many will be allocated to other categories. There are a number of reasons for seeking that information but some of us have a concern that the financialisation of AHBs could ultimately lead them in certain directions. The matter relates to the amendment whose debate, unfortunately, I missed earlier. In order that we can return to it on Report Stage, I raise the issue of rents and differences in rents that may exist between AHBs and councils.We must know this information and the facts so when these reports are produced we can examine them and see what is happening and the direction being taken in terms of social housing being delivered by approved housing bodies. The logic of it is to ensure we have all the relevant information so we can assess where things are heading over time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will consider what the Minister said. I will flag the issue now and if it needs to be spelt out explicitly, I will resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.
