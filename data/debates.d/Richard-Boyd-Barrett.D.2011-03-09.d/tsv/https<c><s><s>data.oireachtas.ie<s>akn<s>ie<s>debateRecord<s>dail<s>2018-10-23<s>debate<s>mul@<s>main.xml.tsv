RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In its programme for Government, the Government promised a humanitarian response to asylum seekers, committed to making Ireland a safe haven for those fleeing from violence, and said it would promote the integration of migrants in this country. The deportation order for Shepherd Machaya is anything but compassionate. He has lived nine years in direct provision, a pretty awful system, but he made an effort to secure a FETAC level 5 qualification before going to DCU, where he completed his first year with flying colours, but now he is being threatened with deportation. Some 13,000 friends, fellow students, the students' union, and DCU, which is a university of sanctuary, are all pleading with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Government to be compassionate and humanitarian and to revoke that order to allow Shepherd Machaya to remain here, finish his studies and contribute to Irish society. I do not understand why the Minister would throw out somebody who is studying IT systems and business management when he could contribute to Irish society. I also wish to mention Eric Zhi Ying Xue from Bray, a nine year old who has lived all his life here. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister to show compassion for these two people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will not revoke it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Taoiseach that our public services are in bits. We all know about the public housing crisis, and we are aware of the dire situation in our public health service, but one crisis that is less remarked on but which is very severe is the crisis in third level education. That crisis was not in any way addressed or acknowledged in the Government's recent budget. The Taoiseach may have noted that the Irish Universities Association released a statement recently expressing significant regret at the failure of the Government to address the funding crisis for third level education. The Union of Students in Ireland and other student union bodies have also expressed huge disappointment at the Taoiseach's failure to address the funding crisis for third level education and for student poverty. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that we have a crisis and that Ireland is at the bottom of the league table in Europe for funding per student? The Irish Universities Association has helpfully included a graph with its statement, which compares Ireland with other European countries. It shows the State investment per student in the following countries: Finland €20,000 per student; Germany €10,000 per student; The Netherlands €14,000 per student; Norway €16,000 per student; Sweden €19,000 per student; and Ireland €5,000 per student. Ireland's €5,000 funding per student is a tiny fraction of what is invested in third level education cross Europe. This per student investment is going to further decline, because according to the Minister's budget speech we are expecting another 18,000 people to enter further education and university over the next number of years. The budget, however, gave the sector a 1% increase in funding. It was €19 million extra, which is nothing. It is a drop in the ocean that will be mopped up many times over by the increased student numbers. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that there is a problem here? Has the Taoiseach any intention of doing something about this funding crisis in third level education?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has not answered my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the universities' analysis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is nothing facile about my analysis of the funding of third level education. This analysis was provided by the Irish Universities Association. Its authors are academics so I think the Taoiseach should take them a bit more seriously rather than just trying to score political points. The analysis points out that we are spending a small fraction of what most other European countries are spending per student. The Taoiseach's comparison with health is facile because it fails to acknowledge that quite a considerable amount of that expenditure is out of pocket expenditure by people paying accident and emergency charges, overnight bed charges, and prescription charges. That is all included in the expenditure as is, for that matter, private health insurance. Public funding of health is a very different matter but we are talking about universities. The point is we are way down the league table and our universities are now tumbling in the international rankings. The Irish Universities Association, to say nothing of the students' unions, says that there is a very serious problem. I would have thought that the Taoiseach should acknowledge that as an issue and seek to respond to it in a sensible way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Gino Kenny is ill today so I am asking this question on his behalf. Six beds closed in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire in August, meaning, scandalously, that 12 beds have closed in that hospital. The other six have been closed since the end of 2017 due to staff and other resource shortages.In August, however, six paediatric inpatient beds were shut as a result of the inability of the consultant who works out of Crumlin hospital to provide paediatric cover because they apparently went on unplanned leave.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The NRH provides incredibly important services in brain injury, spinal-cord injury, prosthetic and limb absence rehabilitation, as well as paediatric rehabilitation. The human consequences of not having these beds open are severe. Today, I spoke to Deputy Gino Kenny's constituent who contacted us about this issue. The individual’s daughter had a brain tumour and surgery in Temple Street hospital in April. She has been left with serious weakness on her left side and needs serious rehabilitation. However, she is now unable to go to the NRH for treatment because of the closed beds. Early intervention in serious situations such as this is important. This is the human consequence of this. Will the Minister of State explain why we cannot recruit a consultant to provide the cover which will allow these beds to be reopened, given the suffering endured by people who really need it? We need an explanation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no doubt about the excellent work the NRH does. However, 12 beds were closed at the end of 2017. The hospital managed to get funding to get six of them reopened but then another six were closed because it could not get the paediatric consultant cover. If it is related, as discussed earlier, to the sort of apartheid new-entrant levels of pay for consultants as a result of austerity cuts, then it has to be addressed. This situation cannot go on with the girl I just mentioned who needs this rehab urgently, as well as the many others who need rehab. It is unacceptable. We need to sort this out. We need to provide necessary resources to recruit the consultants to do this vital work.
