RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will tell the Deputy in a minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, Deputy O'Sullivan referred to Brexit in her contribution-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and the Acting Chairman did not interrupt her.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I, too, want to point out the intersection of these two issues. This Water Services (Amendment) Bill is an arrogant and undemocratic fudge. The arrogance and contempt for democracy that is displayed in this water services Bill is the same arrogance and contempt for democracy that produced the vote to exit in the United Kingdom, which is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister does not get it. The establishment does not get it. There is widespread disaffection and alienation from the political establishment, not just in this country but across Europe. It will be reflected in the Spanish elections that will be held soon. It was reflected in the vote for Syriza. It was reflected in the votes for the radical left in Portugal and, tragically, it is also reflected in darker and more dangerous manifestations of disaffection, with the rise of the vile xenophobes of the UK Independence Party, UKIP, the vile Boris Johnson and the vile far right across Europe. Why are those forces rising? It is precisely because of the failure of the establishment, and the establishment would want to take a long, hard look at itself. It is in absolute panic now over Brexit-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----just as it was in panic faced with a quarter of a million people on the streets. It was panic-stricken by that. That is the truth, and it has rocked the establishment. It has brought the two parties that have dominated this State for its entire history to their lowest ever ebb, and it was close to eliminating the Labour Party-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----because it joined that club and got it wrong as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we stop the clock?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sticking to the issue. It is about honesty and democracy.That is our main problem with this Bill; the Government just does not believe in democracy. The people have spoken clearly and unequivocally but the Government will not respect their decision. If anything is going to fuel further alienation and disaffection from politics and from the political establishment, it is the contempt the Government is showing. To be honest, even from the Government's point of view, it is utterly self-defeating. If the Government had any sense, it would get this issue off the pitch so that we can move on to other things, because it is just going to keep digging a hole for itself if it does not respect the decision. The reason it will not do that is not just contempt for democracy, it is also because the Government is playing a trick on the people, just as it did with the bin charges. That is part of the reason there was such a revolt about water. People will be fooled once - he is going to do it again-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but they are not going to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	See - the Minister just cannot bear that the Government has been beaten. The people have seen through it. The Government and Fianna Fáil knew when it first proposed the introduction of a €400-per-year water charge that it was going to lead inexorably to privatisation, a fact confirmed by the European Union. It also continued to recycle the lie that it was going to be off-balance-sheet when EUROSTAT exposed that lie and admitted in its ruling that privatisation was always envisaged, just as with the bins. The Government knew that once the charges came in, privatisation was coming. That is what it wanted. The reason the Government will not abolish water charges now is that it wants to come back at this for the same reason: to get hold of this precious resource and make money out of it. It is trying to trick people and that produces disillusionment. The last point I want to make is that the Government put up spurious opposition to this on the basis that something had to be done about the water infrastructure. We heard it again from Deputy O'Sullivan, asking where we are going to get the money and so on. I will read from the Irish Water business plan. If one wants the facts, just read the plan and compare it with the figures for water investment in previous years. Planned water investment by Irish Water was €343 million in 2014 and €391 million in 2015. It goes up to €522 in 2016 and then €533 million. In 2018, it is going up to €595 million, and so on. The average is €600
million. That sounds good - this is the big water investment plan and the Government is serious about fixing the water infrastructure. However, then one goes back and looks at the previous figures. What was the high water mark, if Members will excuse the pun, of investment in water infrastructure? It was €699 million in 2008. That is higher than any of the figures envisaged by Irish Water. In 2009, courtesy of Fianna Fáil, it dropped to €679 million. Then, in 2010, there was a massive drop in investment to €519 million. In 2011, it dropped again by another €100 million to €467 million, while in 2012 it dropped to €442 million - this is under Fine Gael and the Labour Party. In 2013, it dropped again to €411 million. Who cut the investment in water infrastructure? The answer is Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, Fine Gael and Labour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not going to go back up, because the Government is spending €200 million-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy cannot bear it, can she? The truth hurts. The people will not be fooled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a corporate entity, for God's sake.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He cannot control himself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume that comment applies to the Minister.
