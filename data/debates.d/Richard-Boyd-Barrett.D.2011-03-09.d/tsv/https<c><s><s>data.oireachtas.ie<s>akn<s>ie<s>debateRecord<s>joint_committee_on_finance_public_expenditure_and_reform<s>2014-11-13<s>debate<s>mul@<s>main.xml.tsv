RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for being late.  There was some confusion in my office about what was going on this morning.  Representatives of Permanent TSB were in here yesterday and spoke about the successful arrangements they have come to with people in mortgage arrears.  However, they said there were still a lot of people with outstanding arrears with whom they had not made arrangements.  My fear - and they seemed to indicate that there might be some basis for it - is that as we do deals with some people, we are likely to see a significant increase in repossessions for others.  That is because we are probably dealing with a cohort that will have much more difficulty in coming to arrangements.  How do things stand in that regard with Ulster Bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is outstanding?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many of them are engaging with Ulster Bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are they often the same people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Bell saying that people who have significant arrears and who are not able to meet them, are trying to meet their unsecured debt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With his bank, so they are paying his bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a complete blank with the people who are not engaging?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Ulster Bank anticipate it can come to arrangements with most of those who are engaging and thus avoid repossession?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the mortgage-to-rent scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that similar to what New Beginnings has been talking about in the last few days?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is interesting.  It has apparently got some investor backing to buy up very distressed mortgages.  It is saying that it can keep pretty much everybody in their home, either through restructuring or in the really difficult cases in some sort of mortgage-to-lease scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My last question concerns the whole property sector.  Mr. Brown said he does not think that a bubble is developing, although I am a bit more concerned on that front.  Is Ulster Bank doing much lending to people who are buying property in fairly big deals?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  Is Ulster Bank financing much of that kind of activity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is buying the property, to Mr. Brown's knowledge?Are other banks financing that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ulster Bank is more cautious given what happened.
