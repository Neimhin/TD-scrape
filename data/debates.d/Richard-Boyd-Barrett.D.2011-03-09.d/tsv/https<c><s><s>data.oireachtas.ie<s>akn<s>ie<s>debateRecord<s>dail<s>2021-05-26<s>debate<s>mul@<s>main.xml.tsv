It is about breaking down division and showing the value of unity and alignment from the bottom. I gave the Taoiseach a concrete example of this a few weeks ago. Taxi drivers affected by the Covid pandemic in the North have been given a financial package of up to Â£3,000 to deal with overhead costs, insurance costs and all the costs and debts they have built up because of the loss of income incurred by Covid-19.I asked the Taoiseach, as the taxi drivers have done, to do the same down here. I understand the Taoiseach met with taxi drivers this week and still the Government, despite vague promises, has committed nothing in terms of a supportive financial package for an industry that has been decimated. As the Taoiseach knows, the taxi drivers will conduct a large drive-by protest at Leinster House tomorrow. The industry has been decimated and taxi drivers have asked for a supportive financial package that is similar to the one available in the North. Let us start aligning North and South in a tangible way that means something to ordinary working people and take our lead from the good example in the North, where a serious financial package was put in place for taxi drivers. Will the Taoiseach do the same for the industry that has been so badly decimated and the taxi drivers affected here, in advance of the protest tomorrow?

My first question is whether the Government is going to do the pilot on basic income for people working in the arts. Second, we have recently had a good news story with the reports about the Disney production, "Enchanted". However, other reports suggest the film might more accurately be called "Disenchanted" when it comes to some of the people working on it. Reports suggest, for example, that many of the performers and dancers found themselves being paid less and being denied the residuals or royalties for their work on the film under a so-called industry agreement that is shocking compared with the position and conditions those performers enjoy in films made in Britain and elsewhere. In addition, stage crew from the Irish Film Workers Association who worked on the first "Enchanted" film - this is "Enchanted 2" - were picketing outside Disney because they have been blackballed by the Irish production company involved, which has received tens of millions of Irish taxpayers' money-----
