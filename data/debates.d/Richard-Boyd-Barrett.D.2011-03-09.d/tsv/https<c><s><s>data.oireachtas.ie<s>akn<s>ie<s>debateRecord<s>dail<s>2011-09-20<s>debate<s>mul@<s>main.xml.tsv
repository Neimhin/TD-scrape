RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the total cost?  Members of the Government have referred in previous questions to the overall cost of the visits being in excess of €20 million or €23 million.  The Taoiseach might remind me of the full cost of the two visits.  How much of the total expenditure was spent on food, beverages, entertainment for the various guests and so on?  Does the Taoiseach think it is appropriate that a significant sums of taxpayers' money is being spent on wine, alcohol, food and big glitzy——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——occasions with celebrities and personalities quaffing fine wine and eating fine food——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——at the same time as brutal austerity is being imposed on people who are struggling to put food on the table or pay their bills?  It is an aspect of the visit that some of us who were opposed to it are concerned about.  Is it appropriate, given the suffering so many people in the country are going through?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is not associating me with them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer one part of my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked about the appropriateness of such expenditure when austerity is being imposed on the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Glitzy occasions and spending money on fine food for select invitees——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need clarification on this matter.  The debate on Second Stage is to be guillotined, which is unacceptable.  May we have clarification with regard to Committee, Report and Final Stages which have been timetabled for tomorrow at 9 p.m?  Is the debate on these Stages to be guillotined and will Opposition amendments be accepted?  Earlier today it was suggested to me we could not submit amendments because the EU-IMF would not tolerate the House making amendments and that we simply had to accept the whole lot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need clarification about the process to be followed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The legislative programme indicates that the housing Bill is expected in early 2012.  Why is it being taken in 2012, when new housing policy guidelines are already being implemented——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about the timing of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to ask the question in order to——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking a question about the reasoning for the timing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that not what the Order of Business is about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has effectively thrown 20,000 to 30,000 thousand people off council housing lists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This has been implemented by local authorities throughout the country——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——and we have not had a chance to debate that.  This is a move that will essentially be another bailout for developers and speculators who caused the economic crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are we imposing the policy before we have the chance to debate the legislation?  It has very far-reaching consequences, even in terms of the public finances.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the case, even if it is economic treason?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is shameful that any Government, particularly one which includes the Labour Party, would consider selling any part of a vital strategic public asset like the ESB, Bord na Móna or Coillte.  It is even more shameful that it is being done under the diktat of the European Union and the IMF to pay off the private debts of bondholders, speculators and vultures of the financial market.It is extraordinary that because of the greed of people in the private banking system who crashed the European economy, the response demanded by the European Union and the IMF, and implemented by the Government, is to take another vital area of the economy and hand it over to the same privateers and profit and greed driven people who crashed the financial system.  It beggars belief.It is the definition of betrayal, sell-out and economic treason that any Government would consider giving away even a part of something as important as the ESB.  It is a slippery slope to begin privatising the ESB.  The State was transformed from being a Third World country to a modern state primarily as a result of a public enterprise, the ESB, assisted by other publicly owned enterprises such as Bord na Móna.Now, when the vultures of the private market have failed us, is the time we need such enterprises most.  We need to invest in them to put people back to work and put our economy on a rational and sound footing.  We need to invest in the things our society needs.  We should aim for energy security, infrastructure and the provision of jobs for the people.  I challenge the Government to tell me if it or the European Union and the IMF can put forward any justification why in a so-called rescue package it is a good idea for us to sell our vital State assets.  How does that help economic recovery?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can one define that as anything other than asset stripping?I totally disagree with the advice of Deputy Ó Cuív to the unions.  I hope Sinn Féin Deputies agree that we need a massive mobilisation of working people in this country on the streets on 8 October when the European Union and the IMF come here to show them that we are not allowing the Government to sell our vital strategic assets.  We need to maintain that mobilisation to stop vultures asset stripping the country and the people who are sitting opposite from selling the country out and doing away with any of the assets we need if we are to have any chance of economic recovery.
