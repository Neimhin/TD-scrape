RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we have half an hour, can we not have a little longer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to ask very direct questions and receive direct answers, if possible.  Mr. Lynott described those involved in the study as independent. How can he possibly claim organisations such as Amec and CDM Smith are independent? Is it not misleading to say these organisations are independent?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Lynott not think Amec and CDM Smith have a hopeless conflict of interest? Is this not obvious as they are involved with oil and gas companies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does Mr. Lynott mean by that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Mr. Lynott summarise it? Do they not have a hopeless conflict of interest, given their association with the oil and gas industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to Mr. Lynott that they do not. Amec is part of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a pro-fracking coalition. I will read from its website: "Our customers, in both the private and public sector, are among the world’s biggest and best in their fields - BP, Shell, BR Petrobras, KNPC ... Suez ... ExxonMobil". The list goes on. Mr. Lynott does not say it is independent, but how can he seriously suggest it does not have an absolutely massive, overwhelming conflict of interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is running out. I just do not accept this. Under all the headings, including ground surface and water, water requirements for fracking, faults and fractures, air monitoring, water impacts, mitigation measures and life cycle assessment, CDM Smith is listed. It goes on and on. In some cases Amec Wheeler Foster and CDM Smith are not only carrying out the studies but also reviewing their own studies. CDM Smith dominates this entire process. Is it not simply the case that this is a corrupted process?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my point. I put it to Mr. Lynott that this whole exercise has been completely compromised from the word go by the involvement of CDM Smith. It has been predominant at every level and clearly has a very strong interest in fracking going ahead. In one sentence, what is the purpose of this study?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the health department in New York has said it does not believe on public health grounds it is safe to allow fracking, how could it be safe in Ireland?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will quote what was said in New York to Mr. Lynott: “DOH's report concludes that it will be years until science and research provide sufficient information to determine the level of risk HVHF poses to public health and whether those risks can be adequately mitigated.” The New York health department is operating according to the precautionary principle. In other words, it is saying there is no way anybody could, based on current scientific knowledge in this area, guarantee there will not be adverse effects on health. The New York Department refers to “health” but we could also include water and the environment. Is that not just a fact?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very long answer. How could it be safe in terms of public health in Ireland if it is not safe in New York?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is what is being said in New York not science?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Lynott said there is no public health assessment in his study. Is that not what he said earlier?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is he going to be able to tell us at the end of the research whether there is a danger to health?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will be no health impact assessment completed. Therefore, at the end of the process, Mr. Lynott will not be able to tell us whether there is a risk to health.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Lynott not think people really just want to know whether it is safe in terms of public health? That is what we need to know. Mr. Lynott is saying to us that, after all the research, we will not know whether fracking is a threat to public health, although they can tell us in New York.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask one last question, Chairman?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the health concerns around this and New York, would Mr. Lynott support the terms of reference for this study being extended to include an assessment of whether there is a public health risk and involving the Department of Health in what the EPA is doing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not do it?
