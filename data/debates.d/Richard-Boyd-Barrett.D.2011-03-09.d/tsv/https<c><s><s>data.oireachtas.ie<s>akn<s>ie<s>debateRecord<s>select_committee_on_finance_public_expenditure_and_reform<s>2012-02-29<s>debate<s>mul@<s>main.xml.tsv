I do not believe many of these things that are presented as environmental taxes are anything other than revenue-gathering exercises which further penalise low and middle-income families.  These taxes are misconceived, and this is the responsibility of the current and previous Governments; it was the Green Party that started the ball rolling.  I do not think the revenue is used to clean up our environment, which is something the State will have to take a different and more proactive role in.  It is just another revenue raising exercise and I wish to signal my opposition to it.

It is little consolation to the many elderly in particular who are already freezing because they cannot afford adequate fuel during the winter, that this increase will not happen until next year on top of all the increases that have already taken place.  This is misconceived and will lead to more suffering.  There are always choices and we have spoken many times about what we think the alternative is, to tax those who can afford it and who will not be shivering in the cold in the winter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do now know why it is so off the radar to tax the wealthy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Winter deaths are better?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of the €80 million expected to be raised, how much of that comes from domestic household use?  It has been calculated per bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept the argument.  It is dishonest to suggest that this is an environmental charge.  It is called a carbon tax and the implication is that it will reduce carbon emissions.  It affects people's ability to heat their homes or run their business, although my concern is primarily about the immediate impact of people using less fuel and freezing as a consequence of the combined effect of this, the cuts in the fuel allowance and other cuts in the incomes of vulnerable sectors of our society.  It is not likely to have any substantial impact on the environment and in so far as it does, it is at the expense of human suffering.If the Minister is serious about retrofitting, I can make a suggestion which I have put to a number of Ministers but to which I have received no response.  It is a simple suggestion that is fiscally neutral, which should be attractive to the Minister.  It came from a constituent in Meath - which is not my constituency - and it is that we should set up a system where loans would be extended to people to retrofit their homes and the repayments on those loans would match the reduction in their fuel bills.  In other words, it would not cost them anything.  If one gets a 25% reduction in the cost of heating one's home as a result of the house being retrofitted, for example, the repayments would be linked to that saving.  It therefore does not cost any more.  That would also act as a significant stimulus to the construction industry, which would carry out the retrofitting.  Perhaps the Minister might consider it.  If there was real movement on retrofitting, it would be far more beneficial for the environment than simply increasing what is, in effect, another revenue raising exercise.  The Minister admitted as much when he said it is about the €80 million.  It is not about the environment, but let us do something serious about the environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the measure introduced in the Bill in so far as it attempts to chase down some of those multimillionaires or multibillionaires who are apparently choosing to live outside the State in order to avoid paying taxes.  Is there any evidence that such is happening and how do we identify non-compliant persons?  Does Revenue wait for them to identify themselves voluntarily, for example, or does it take it upon itself to inform such persons that they may be liable?  How do we identify the constituency for this tax and how are those who make up that constituency responding?  The amount of money yielded and the number of persons involved are both quite minuscule.  Is there anything we can do about this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is interesting that the Minister of State has indicated that Revenue has the ability to identify the assets by the individuals in question, both here and abroad.  This raises an interesting question with regard to why it is not possible to go further.  Certain Opposition members have referred to the introduction of a wealth and assets tax and have pointed out that some people's assets have undergone a considerable increase in value in recent times.  I refer here to the figures presented to the committee by the Central Bank last week in respect of financial assets.  If we could procure information with regard to individuals who are domiciled abroad-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point.  However, the question arises as to why we might not go further and increase what is quite a low levy of €200,000.
