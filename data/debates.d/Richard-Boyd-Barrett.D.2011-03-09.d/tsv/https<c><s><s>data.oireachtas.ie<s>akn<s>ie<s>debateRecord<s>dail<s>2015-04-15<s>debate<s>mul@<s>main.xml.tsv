RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the aftermath of the Ryan report and the appalling history of this State in terms of the history of child abuse and the failure to protect children, Tusla was set up with a great stated commitment to child protection. The HIQA report on just one administrative area details a chronic failure to adequately protect children in need of support and particularly 234 high priority cases who have not even been allocated a social worker and another 500 medium priority cases who have not been allocated a social worker. I ask the Minister to provide the figures but if this is replicated at national level that represents a chronic failure on the part of Tusla to provide the child protection services that the children need.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The somewhat rosy picture painted by the Minister of an improving situation does not reflect the language in the report, which stated that the service was not sufficiently resourced to deliver a child centred, safe and effective service that met the needs of children and families. It further stated that there were long waiting lists at point of receipt of referral and following the completion of the initial assessment. It found that staffing numbers were not sufficient to cope with the level of demand for the service and that some offices were in poor condition and not a suitable place for children and families to meet their social worker. This is a damning statement. I refer to the two categories where the report identified significant risk. The Minister said earlier that children who were high priority or at significant risk would be dealt with immediately. However, the report identified significant risk with regard to the specific circumstances and needs of children subjected to organisational and-or institutional abuse and how children who are deemed to be especially vulnerable are identified and responded to. In that category the report finds a significant risk identified. That is in one administrative area and it is damning. Can the Minister tell the House what are the similar figures and breakdown for the country as a whole? If it is as bad as Cork it is not a rosy picture.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I simply point out to the Minister that in the category of the HIQA report where significant risk is identified, it is precisely in the area of children who are particularly vulnerable and who have been subjected to organisational and-or institutional abuse. That is what the report says. That is pretty worrying. If those figures are replicated in the other 16 administrative areas of the country, that indicates an adequate service is not being provided to thousands of children at significant risk. I wonder how all this relates to the crisis in child mental health services for which the Children's Alliance gave the Government an E grade - a fail grade - in its recent report, due to lack of beds, resources and staff, which seem to be evident in both of those areas. When I tabled questions on child mental health services to the Department they were transferred to the Department of Health. I have tried to raise the matter as a Topical Issue debate. I submitted the matter approximately 25 times in recent months. I believe the relevant Departments do not want to talk about the issue. There may well be a connection between the allocation of a social worker and child mental health services. If children initially identified as needing support do not have a social worker allocated, how many of them end up with mental health problems and then face the inadequate crisis ridden situation in the child mental health services? One cannot get answers about the area.
