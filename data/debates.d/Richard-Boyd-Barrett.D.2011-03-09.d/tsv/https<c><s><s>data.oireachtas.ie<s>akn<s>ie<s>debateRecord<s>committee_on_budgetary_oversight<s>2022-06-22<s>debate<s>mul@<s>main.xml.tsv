RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have loads of questions but we are going to get a second round, are we not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I have a couple of general questions but mostly I want to ask about the film tax credit. In the case of the research and development credit, what market failure is being addressed? It is supposed to address a market failure and it seems to me there is not a market failure, especially for those that are the biggest beneficiaries of it. They are companies that have enormous wealth and resources and whether we gave them a tax credit or not they would be innovating. Are we giving a tax credit that is supposed to be responding to market failure in an area where there simply is not a market failure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but it is primarily going to those big multinational companies. The bulk of the value of this thing is going to big, very wealthy, very profitable multinational corporations and the threat is if we do not give them this tax break they will do that research and development elsewhere. The contrast I always draw is if we put €700 million into our public universities for research and development or into Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, what might we get in the form of more targeted research and development that was actually beneficial to society as against beneficial to already spectacularly wealthy corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. One of the things the PBO, in looking at all this, is saying, and I am in agreement, is we are not having a proper evaluation on a regular enough basis of these things and hearing from stakeholders as to the arguments and pros and cons of this. I do not think we are. Ms Donaghy can put that case and I am sure people will put that case but then I think of the fact that educational counselling and psychology are not funded for people to do doctorates, yet we have a chronic shortage of psychologists to do assessments for children. I want to hear that discussion on evaluating if this is the best expenditure of public money in the area of encouraging research, advancing research, and so on. We are not getting that level of scrutiny, oversight and hearing from the different stakeholders so we can make a proper evaluation. We should find ways to have that discussion with all those stakeholders in a more structured way. We have discussed the film tax credit many times. According to the EU, state aid to film must meet two tests, namely, the industry development test and the culture test. The industry development test is worth reading out. It states there will be:... [an] aim to generate the critical mass of activity that is required to create the dynamic for the development and consolidation of the industry through the creation of soundly based production undertakings and the development of a permanent pool of human skills and experience.Then there is "... the primary cultural aim of ensuring that the national and regional cultures and creative potential are expressed in the audiovisual media of film and television". How are we evaluating that? I believe we are not doing so at all, to be honest. Margrethe Vestager, as the Commissioner with responsibility for state aid, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in 2019 to express concerns about whether we were meeting the cultural test. There are very serious question marks. It is interesting that on foot of that that this year an Irish film won a load of awards at the Irish Film and Television Awards. I do not think that was a coincidence.I am sure it was deserved, but it was very interesting because it was the first time it had happened for yonks . In my view, that was because it was being called out on it. How are we evaluating this? I would be interested to know if anyone has ever been refused section 481 support on the grounds of not meeting the culture test. Has anybody ever been refused on the grounds of not meeting the industry development test? One of the biggest recipients of section 481 support is producing “Vikings: Valhalla”, which is being shot in Wicklow at the moment. It was reported in the newspapers recently that: "A note attached to the accounts states that the majority of workers employed are contract workers." This raises serious questions about the industry development test. If the majority of people working on a production for one of the biggest - if not the biggest - recipients of section 481 tax relief year in, year out, are contractors rather than individuals who have an employment relationship with the recipient, that is a big problem. In the context of any reasonable understanding of the EU rules around this test, that clearly does not meet the industry development test. It is not creating a permanent pool of skills, and it involves using a load of contractors who have no employment relationship whatsoever with the recipient of the relief. That relief is given specifically on the grounds of creating quality employment and training, and creating a permanent pool of skills. How are we checking this? It appears to me that we are not. We are listening to the producers who get the relief and they are saying that it is brilliant. Of course they are saying it is brilliant because they are getting the relief and benefiting from it. Previously, this criticism was coming from people who were employed on construction crews, stage crews, etc. I do not know if our witnesses have had a chance to read the Equity submission. Equity raises some very interesting questions and expresses concerns about section 481. Equity, the film workers who have expressed deep concerns and I all want to see money going in to create an industry. However, Equity has asked some serious questions. It states that the risks regarding the way in which it is done at the moment relate to: excluding new and emerging independent producers and having a large amount of industry power concentrated within a small group of players; the potential abuse of the tax credit through a range of practices, including internal pricing and artificially depressed income strategies; and the flaunting of national and international copyright legislation. This latter concern relates to the question of residuals and royalties. Nearly all of the major recipients of section 481 relief in this country tell people who want to work in film productions that in order to get jobs, they have to sign up to buy-out contracts where they sign away all of their royalties and residuals. Their counterparts in Britain are not asked to do that. This is absolutely outrageous. Residuals are one of the major ways whereby artists and performers who are in very precarious situations might get a little bit of money back over the years from a film that continues to be shown again and again. The recipients of section 481 in this country are insisting that most performers and artists must sign away their rights to the particular production in question. This also raises a very interesting question as to whom those rights are being assigned? Who then gets the royalties over the years? Is it the DAC that disappears after 12 months following the end of the production? This is the mushroom-like nature of the DAC. Where employees have grievances and go to the WRC and raise issues relating to their employment on a production or in respect of instances where they may have been wrongfully dismissed or badly treated, the film production company, which receives the money on the basis of developing the industry, quality employment and training, goes before the WRC and the Labour Court again and again and states that not only is the relevant person not its employee but also that the structure of section 481 means he or she could never be an employee of the company. The employer is the DAC and the DAC is gone. As a result, nobody is accountable for how a person is treated on a particular film production. I do not even know the answer to the question as to what happens to the royalties and residuals because they are not going to the performers. Where are they going? I presume they are going to the production company, which has always existed and which is the recipient of section 481 relief. This is the company that has managed to disown responsibility for everybody who has worked on the film production and got all of them to sign away their rights to further royalties. When are we going to start looking seriously at these things?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it. I am probably out of time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pre-empting a bit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do so because the submissions raise some pretty serious questions. They have been put in the public domain. The royalties and residuals are shocking and outrageous. They have publicly made the case strongly that the contracts and conditions of employment for people working on film productions here are significantly worse than in Britain, for example. That is very serious. We will hear from them and the detail will be seen in the report but they have made public statements to that effect. That echoes the views of a group Ms Donaghy has heard from before, namely, the Irish Film Workers Association, whose leading figures have never worked n the film industry after they made these things public. Some of the people who work on those film productions have just said to me straight, "I'll never be working with those people again." It is as black and white as that. You get blacklisted if you say certain things in the film industry. I still do not see where the protections are, nor do I see how a situation in which people can be blacklisted is compliant with a state aid and EU requirement, and a legal requirement in terms of the relief here, that something called quality employment and training be in place, along with a permanent pool of skills. The database is something workers have been screaming for. It used to exist many years ago. Who will draw up the database? I suggest we find out and I think the answer will be interesting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the Screen Guilds of Ireland, the contractors. That is who will draw up the list. That is a problem because the allegation made is that the contractors hire and fire who they want.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. I have read it but the questions are how you get on that database and also concern the tracking of trainees. They have been designating people as trainees on films for yonks. That does not tell me anything has changed. They can put a document in stating they have a certain number of trainees. The big question is whether any of those trainees are working on the next production. Do they have any obligation to those trainees? Do those trainees have a qualification? The answer is "No". There is no pathway to qualification. We are still way behind on that. It is like we are ticking a box that someone is a trainee and, by the way, we have run a course that the trainee may have participated in. Does that actually give people a qualification and will they have any greater security in the industry than they had previously? The answer, in my opinion and from what I hear, is "No". There is still absolutely nothing to prevent someone being designated a trainee on this production and on the next production it is a different bunch of trainees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would first require a qualification standard and a pathway, which I am pretty sure do not exist. At which point does someone become a props master or a set painter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except the ones who were blacklisted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I make an obvious point? There is a problem with that. The big film producers might be a year or 18 months between big productions. When people are laid off at the end of a film production and the same production company makes a new film with a new DAC, the old DAC has expired. If someone does not get employed 18 months later, it is too late to take a case. The DAC under which that person was employed no longer exists and there is no recourse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are precisely the issues that need to be discussed. People acquire through the operation of law a contract of indefinite duration when they work a certain amount of time over a certain period for a particular employer. The difficulty in this situation occurs when those cases are taken and the employees go in.Every time, without exception, as we can see from the transcripts of proceedings, the recipient of the section 481 relief states something like, "I have never been that person's employer and I could never be that person's employer because the DAC is the employer." What the recipients are, in effect, saying is, "I set up the DAC and I only set it up as an accounting tool, but somehow I am managing to separate myself, the recipient of section 481, from this DAC thing, which is only an accounting tool, but legally it is allowing me to absolve myself of any responsibility for the people who worked on the film production." That is continuing to happen, even after all the compliance certificates and all the rest of it, because of the DAC structure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nobody is suggesting that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am running out of time. The Government needs to make a decision on this issue and stop batting it back to the WRC. The latter does not know what to do with it. Somebody needs to clarify the situation. The relief is given out with a purpose, which is to support the industry, create a permanent pool of skilled employees and create employment. The Government, using public money, is trying to meet a particular objective. Whatever about precisely how the WRC may interpret it, nobody looking at the situation can say the test is being met because the people who are getting the money are saying they have no employees. I do not see how that is an industry or how it can be described as such.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Inter-group transactions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Carey might refresh my memory. Is that the list where some of the recipients have, beside the name of the producer company, figures between €10 million and €30 million? It is slightly alarming that we are giving this company somewhere between €10 million and €30 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad to hear that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But we cannot see them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find that problematic, although I do not know whether Revenue is bound by certain rules here. This DAC thing drives me around the twist. How is anybody supposed to know? We will get on to the Equity issue next week, and our guests will have read the submission. One phrase that strikes me - people do not use phrases for nothing - refers to depressed income strategies and internal pricing. I know exactly what that means and I think our guests all know what it is alluding to. That kind of stuff needs to be scrutinised and, as policymakers and legislators, we need to know whether these mechanisms that have been set up to stimulate the industry are being abused. We need to know the detail. I am curious about the DAC in all this business. Do we ever see the DAC's accounts? Can I see them? All the accounting is done within the DAC even though it is the producer company that gets the relief. It does not give us transparency, does it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it is referred to as being a risk.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a couple of quick points and they will genuinely be quick. I know this has been explained but it does concern me that the inter-group transactions are up to €35 billion as a cost on the revenue table this year. That is up from €16 billion the year before and €12 billion the year before that, which is an enormous jump. I am a great fan of the Revenue's table, by the way, I want to say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The stamp duty inter-group transactions. On the face of it, in the table produced by Revenue, it is a cost to the people of €35 billion, having jumped from €16 billion the previous year. It is absolutely enormous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. One last thing, the stakeholder issue is a theme that comes across in terms of the reviews and I ask the committee to consider that we significantly up the ante on that. We had an arts committee that recommended a stakeholder forum around section 481 a few years ago. Certain participants said they were not participating and then, even though a Minister and a committee was in favour of it, the committee was gone because one or two stakeholders decided they did not want to participate. I seriously recommend that this is just not allowed. If people say they are not participating, they are the ones who should be penalised. How on earth can somebody get public money and then refuse point blank to participate in a stakeholder forum that the elected representatives and the Minister say is going to happen, and they are let away with that? It is beyond belief to me. I ask the committee to consider that point because we need more stakeholder engagement and a proper structured process. Frankly, if stakeholders and beneficiaries of these reliefs are not playing ball, they should be told to take a hike.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a bit sceptical.
