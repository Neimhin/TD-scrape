RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, described the housing and homelessness crisis as a matter of concern. I put it to her that it is not a matter of concern; it is an emergency. The first step in resolving this crisis is for the Minister of State to recognise it as a crisis that is now becoming an emergency. I acknowledge that she inherited the problem from the previous Fianna Fáil Government, which turned housing and property into a casino for banks and property developers. That caused the crisis but it is not the end of the story because in the three years this Government has been in power, it has not addressed the problem and the measures it has taken have only made the crisis worse. She has to admit that fact. The Government made the problem worse by cutting the rent allowance. Two years ago, the Minister for Social Protection told us this decision would result in reductions in rents. She was wrong and should admit that it did not work. Rents have increased. The problem was also exacerbated by the Government's abandonment, in June 2011, of direct provision for social housing. The document to which the Minister of State referred announced that the Government was going to rely primarily on leasing arrangements with the private sector. That has failed. Landlords are pulling out of RAS and other leasing arrangements because they can make more money on the open market. The Irish mortgage brokers association, which represents landlords, has stated they will not solve the problem. The people to whom the Government is looking to solve the problem are stating baldly that they will not do so. Furthermore, by giving a veto to the banks on mortgage distress and allowing for the repossession of homes, we will be facing another catastrophe when the individuals concerned will be put on the housing list and made homeless because of the lack of social housing. The first step on the road to wisdom is to accept this is an emergency rather than a matter of concern. Some of the human faces of that emergency are in the Gallery. Bethany, who is 19 years old, is on a Tús scheme and is homeless. The Department of Social Protection proposes to cut her from the Tús scheme because she cannot give an address. Lindsay-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A family comprising a mother, a father and their eight children are sharing a two bedroom house with a sister and grandmother. There is nothing from the local authority. Another family in the Gallery, with seven children, is getting a variation on the rent cap on a month-to-month basis but is being told this will not last. They will face homelessness if the rent cap policy is applied. Another family in the Gallery has been on the list for 15 years. Another family in the Gallery is dealing with receivers moving in on the landlord. Representatives of the receivers are sitting outside the family's house to intimidate them and the family do not know where they will go if they are put out. Another family, with five children, has been staying in a hotel in west Dublin for the past six months even though the children go to school in Shankill. Another family, with two children, has been on the list for 14 years and is renting chronically damp accommodation under the RAS. The children are sick as a result of the damp. For another family, three children have been sharing a bed with their mother for the last 18 months because the rent cap prevents them getting private accommodation. I will not continue to rehearse the list because it is too long. That is the human reality, and it is replicated all over the country. The Minister of State has to face the fact that it is an emergency. She says the Government does not have the money to deal with the crisis. I beg to differ, however. The Government pays €500 million in rent subsidy to private landlords every year. That money would build 5,000 council houses and save money for the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would save money for the State because it would get extra rental revenue. Fr. Peter McVerry has pointed out that the €100 million being spent to change the traffic lights at Newlands Cross would build 1,000 houses at current market prices. This year, we are going to spend €9 billion to pay off the debts of bankers. Can the Government not tell Europe that we are going to hold back €1 billion in order to build 10,000 council houses? If Europe insists on being repaid, we could argue that we will make savings by spending that amount every year for five years in terms of the €500 million in rent allowance that goes into landlords' pockets annually. We would be able to repay the money in ten years time. Even the European Investment Bank would accept the logic of that. There are solutions if the Minister of State is interested in pursuing them. Tragically, however, the real decisions are being made by the Minister for Finance. He knows that the banks are holding all of these properties and they want to inflate the properties' value in order to save their balance sheets. It suits the banks to have a crisis in which rents and property prices are increasing. Yet again, the citizens of this country are paying a terrible price for the-----
