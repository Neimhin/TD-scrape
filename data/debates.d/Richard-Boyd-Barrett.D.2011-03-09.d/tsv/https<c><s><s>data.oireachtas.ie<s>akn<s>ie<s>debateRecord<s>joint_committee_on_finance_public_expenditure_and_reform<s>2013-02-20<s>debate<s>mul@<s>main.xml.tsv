RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the percentage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a number of questions, both micro and macro-economic. Mr. Trethowan stated some 323 appeals were dealt with by the Credit Review Office; what is the time period involved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Credit Review Office deals with approximately 100 appeals per year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it correct the CRO upheld 250 appeals?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many of the 215 appeals has the CRO upheld?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will Mr. Trethowan give me a value for the loan appeals?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Trethowan stated this was following 784 internal reviews in the banks prior to the person bringing his or her case to the Credit Review Office. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Mr. Trethowan have a rough figure for the total value of the 784 loan decisions that were appealed to the bank?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps I could guess, it would be about four or five times the figure given by Mr. Trethowan. If the purpose of the Credit Review Office is to try to make a serious impact on the level of credit being provided for small and medium enterprise, which are regularly described by the Government and others as a key engine of economic recovery and the generation of employment, this is just a drop in the ocean. Is it virtually having no impact on the wider economic stage? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My remarks are not really a criticism of what the Credit Review Office is doing. Every job that has been saved is well worth protecting. I am sure the people involved are tremendously grateful to the CRO for upholding their appeals. In terms of macro-economics, this is simply not going to have a meaningful impact on the wider economic question of whether we generate large scale employment through the SME sector. Is that not a statement of an obvious fact from looking at the figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, in a way that confirms the point of my question. On the macro stage there is actually, notwithstanding the great efforts of CRO, a net reduction in the amount of credit in the system available to small and medium enterprise. This probably corresponds with the general contraction of the SME sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that point. My point is that CRO seems marginal in the greater scheme of things. It will not deliver a silver bullet.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with Mr. Trethowan on that point. Without consumer demand we are going nowhere. The next question is: how does one generate consumer demand?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Confidence does not spring out of the sky. From dealing with the cases, would it be fair to say that small businesses are not looking for money because they are not confident about demand? The banks are reluctant to lend money because they are not terribly confident about demand. They both have a point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Trethowan saying that the banks do not have a significant role in boosting demand in the economy? If that is the import of what he is saying, I disagree with him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a slightly alarming perspective. I went into AIB with somebody who was negotiating a distressed mortgage. It was clearly unsustainable and what the AIB officer kept repeating was that you might win the lotto. She said that three times. There is an element of that in Mr. Trethowan's last remarks, but it does not sound like a strategy. The reason the Credit Review Office was established was to have an impact on lending that would be substantial for the SME sector and consequently for the dire situation of unemployment in this country. What I am hearing from Mr. Trethowan is that his office will have a marginal effect. He seems to be saying that whatever the banks do will not make much difference either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What Mr. Trethowan has described is catch-22.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because the decisions that are being made by small and medium enterprises not to look for money or on the part of banks not to give it to them if they do, in the few cases that seek it, are rational within their own terms if one is looking at the micro case or a particular business whether it is viable or not. That decision which is rational in the individual case is completely irrational from the point of view of the wider economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one very last question as my time has expired. I get that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough and I think the Credit Review Office is playing a valuable role. I am not disputing that, I just wonder how it fits into the bigger picture and I can see the value of what it is doing. Mr. Trethowan appears to be saying that the difference between his attitude towards upholding a loan application and the banks denying it, seems to be the fact that he is taking a slightly longer term view and saying that one's business may not appear viable now but, based on the hoped for resumption of demand, it will be viable. Does that mean that the companies that are getting the loans as a result of Mr. Trethowan's intervention are just about being kept afloat on a very tenuous hope that the position will improve?
