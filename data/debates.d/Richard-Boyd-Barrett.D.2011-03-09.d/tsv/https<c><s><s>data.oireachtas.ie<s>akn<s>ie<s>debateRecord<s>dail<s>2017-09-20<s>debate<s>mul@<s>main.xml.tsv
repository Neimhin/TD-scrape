RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In December of last year, this House made a unanimous decision to send the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill of Deputy Gino Kenny to Committee Stage. Shamefully and disgracefully, a joint health committee, comprising members from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, the Rural Independent Group and some other Independents, has ignored the opinion and advice of the Irish Medical Organisation, which represents the doctors, Professor David Finn, president of the Irish Pain Society, and Professor Mike Barnes, who produced the definitive report on the issue of medicinal cannabis, and it has recommended that the Bill not proceed to Committee Stage. I would like to know, on a matter of Dáil procedure, what standing the recommendation has. It seems that if the Dáil completed Second Stage and agreed to send the Bill to Committee Stage, it has to proceed to Committee Stage or come back here for a decision to be made to reverse it.What is the attitude of the Government going to be to that? Does the Taoiseach think it is a good idea for the Joint Committee on Health to ignore the IMO and Professor David Finn? As a doctor, does he think it is sensible to ignore what the IMO is saying on this matter, in particular in regard to the 20% of our population who suffer with chronic pain?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One person has got it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Professor David Finn a scientist?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Ceann Comhairle want me to read it out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a genuine point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, which is a genuine question to the Ceann Comhairle, if we vote for this motion, what standing does it have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Six years of failed and flawed policies by a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government and, more recently, a Fine Gael, Independent and Independent Alliance Government have left us with a national housing and homelessness emergency. I want to know more about the references the Taoiseach belatedly made - six years too late - to the possibility of NAMA, instead of flogging land and property as it has done for the past six years, being transformed into an agency to deliver social and affordable housing. I know that the Taoiseach is fond of jogging and will be familiar with the Nike slogan, "Just do it". I am wondering if he will just do it, albeit six years too late. Will he just do it and transform NAMA into what it should always have been, namely, a vehicle to deliver social and affordable housing, using what is left of its land banks and assets? Today Dr. Rory Hearne and Dr. Mary Murphy from NUI Maynooth added their voices to those of Fr. Peter McVerry, the Mercy Law Resource Centre, MLRC, and the Simon Communities on the necessity to insert the right to housing into the Constitution. Dr. Murphy pointed out - this is related to the NAMA question - that states within the European Union that had such a constitutional imperative had gained flexibility within the EU fiscal rules. This is very relevant in the context of our capacity to deliver housing, if what she says is true. Will the Taoiseach heed the advice of the academics in the area of housing, the MLRC, the Simon Communities and Fr. Peter McVerry, and pass our Bill tonight which seeks a constitutional amendment to insert the right to housing into the Constitution?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the right to a home?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is disingenuous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be helpful to the Taoiseach in his consideration of the question I asked, the proposed amendment to the Constitution seeks to define the common good as specifically including the right to secure and affordable housing and further requires the Government to prioritise the allocation of resources and its policies to vindicate that right. There is no compulsion to live in social housing as he suggested. Somebody has misinformed the Taoiseach. Given that I have clarified the matter, and bearing in mind, as I said, that the Mercy Law Resource Centre, Peter McVerry, the Children's Rights Alliance, academics and just about everybody who knows anything about housing have been saying for the last ten years that this would help clear the way for securing housing and removing obstacles to the provision of housing for everybody who needs it, would the Taoiseach have a problem with inserting that proposal into the Constitution?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach considering changing or inserting serious conditions and penalties in public contracts and public procurement where firms awarded contracts by the State are found not to be in compliance with the tax code, are fraudulent in their tax affairs or are, as is the case, I would argue, with some accountancy firms here, encouraging tax avoidance strategies for wealthy people? I refer to some construction or consultancy firms that are awarded big State contracts and are then often found to be up to this sort of practice. For example, on foot of a question I raised in the Dáil prior to the summer recess, a raid was carried out on the building site where the regeneration of Dophin's Barn is taking place during the summer because the workers on that site had not received payslips for two months. They were working on a public contract project. That raid was carried out subsequent to my raising the issue here, but, as of the last report I heard, those workers still have not received payslips. Is that not incredible? This is a public contract for a major job and those workers are not getting payslips. I contend that is due to bogus self-employment practices, but that needs to be investigated. Any firm found guilty of that practice should never ever be awarded another public contract. Will the Taoiseach consider measures like that for firms that are awarded public contracts and then found to be up to this sort of sharp practice?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	About public procurement and public contracts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will we receive the report on how we will deal with discrimination against homemakers who brought up their kids in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and who, because the homemaker's credit does not extend back to those years, are being discriminated against in their pension entitlements? I refer also to the issue of the averaging of pensions after former Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton's changes to the bands in 2012. We were promised a report by the former Minister and now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar. Where is that report? When will the changes happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of where the additional money can be obtained, I accept that additional money is needed, but I will tell the Minister where it can be found. The employers' PRSI contribution in this country is so far below the norm elsewhere in Europe that it is shocking. In fact, the big gap in tax revenue by comparison with most of our European counterparts is precisely the shortfall in employers' PRSI contributions. It is precisely the source from which one would want revenue to pay for pensions and to end what the Minister has accepted is completely unacceptable discrimination, mostly against female pensioners. The position on the commitment made by the former Minister for Social Protection and now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who said he understood the issues involved, promised that we would move towards lifetime contributions and said that he would deal with the inequities resulting from the averaging system and that there would be a report within six months, is slightly alarming. Now we hear that there is no report, that something will happen and that there will be a public consultation process but that the Government does not really have the money. That is really not good enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I repeat that in parliamentary questions last year and again this year we confirmed that if we created a new band for employers' PRSI for people who are employed on incomes over €100,000, it would result in hundreds of millions in additional revenue. That would be fair and would help to generate money. Another big area is tax relief for wealthy pensioners. Hundreds of millions of euro are spent on pension reliefs for very wealthy people. I do not mind such measures for ordinary people who are putting away a few quid for their pensions, but very wealthy pensioners - multimillionaires and so on – are putting money away and receiving significant tax reliefs for gold-plated pensions. The Minister could collect some extra money by closing off some of the reliefs for the wealthiest in Irish society. That would give us the sort of money we need to end discrimination and have a fair pension system for all pensioners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely discriminatory. What happens, for example, if somebody gets a job and then loses the job, but the job that he or she had and the earnings that he or she got from that were what enabled them to put a roof over his or her head, then that person loses the job through no fault of his or her own and then is back to the half-rate of a jobseeker's payment? That person is then homeless if he or she cannot go home, or possibly is left in overcrowded conditions. Yesterday, we were at a very good seminar organised by the Ceann Comhairle about mental health issues. One of the big focuses of that was the absolute crisis in youth mental health. Does the Minister think there might be any connection between youth homelessness, the serious problem in youth mental health, and the low incomes that young people who are not 18, living at home with their mums, but who are 18, 19, 20 or 21 who cannot do that, or the young people who are leaving the country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only if their benefit contributions are sufficient.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are supposed to be allowed to ask supplementaries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The subtext of the Minister's response is that young people just want to sit around collecting money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the subtext.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the implication of what the Minister is saying. The reason young people have taken up employment is not because the Minister cut their benefits, but because young people want to go out and work. They want meaningful, properly paid work, which is very difficult to find, and work that will enable them to pay to put a roof over their heads is even more difficult to find for many young people. Slashing their payments when they are not able to find employment that will allow them to do that and putting them on this discriminatory rate as against when one reaches an arbitrary point of 25 years of age, before which one is expected to live on virtually half the money, is discrimination. There is no other way for it. For the Minister to imagine that is helping young people is preposterous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister more or less said it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tairgim: "Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois." I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I wish to share time: eight minutes for myself, seven minutes for Deputy Bríd Smith and five minutes for Deputy Coppinger. It is a shameful decision of the Government to decide not to support a Bill to insert the right to housing into the Constitution. In doing that, the Minister is ignoring the views of the Simon Community, Fr. Peter McVerry, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Mercy Law Resource Centre and the Constitutional Convention which voted, by 84%, to insert the right to housing into the Constitution. It appears, in the face of the worst housing and homelessness emergency in the history of the State, an emergency generated by six years of failed misguided policies by Fine Gael-led Governments, that the Minister knows better than Simon, Fr. Peter McVerry, the Children's Rights Alliance, all the housing NGOs and, indeed, the Constitutional Convention. Even the Taoiseach's new best pal, Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, is about to bring forward a right to housing into Canadian law. Some 81 other countries in the world have it but the Irish Government, in the face of a catastrophic housing emergency, will not put a basic right to secure, affordable, dignified housing into the Constitution so that it is a right of every resident of this country to have a home and, as our Bill proposes, that it should be a requirement and an obligation on all Governments to vindicate that right to housing through the allocation of resources and through their policies. The Government has set its face against that. It seems, rather than establish the right to housing which we so desperately need, the Minister wants to bury it in another committee and reject the advice of those who know and who are working on the front line. I want to make clear that neither I nor anyone who advocates inserting the right to housing into the Constitution believes it is the panacea for all aspects of this current crisis. We have been saying to Fine Gael since 2011 that the answer to the housing crisis, that we could see was even building up at that point, is: to have an emergency programme of public housing construction; to have used compulsory purchase powers to get hold of vacant properties and building land that is being hoarded for use for public and affordable housing; to use NAMA as a vehicle to deliver social and affordable housing using its land, its assets and its cash; to stop all economic evictions and repossessions; to guarantee security of tenure to people privately renting; and to introduce effective rent controls that actually ensure affordable rents. For seven years we have been saying this. For seven years this Government and the previous Fine Gael-led Government ignored this advice and did exactly the opposite. It abandoned the construction of council housing and used NAMA to flog off tens of billions of euro worth of land, housing and assets to vulture funds which are now evicting people. The Government has allowed economic evictions to continue unabated, mortgage repossessions to happen in huge numbers, and rents to spiral out of control and beyond the affordability of large numbers of our citizens. The Government has done all of these things in the face of a growing crisis and against the pleas of those involved in housing and, indeed, ourselves and others in the Opposition. Those are the measures necessary. However, in addition, everybody who works in this area has said inserting the right to housing into the Constitution would make a substantial difference. The Mercy law centre states:A right to housing in the Constitution would mean that the courts could look at the State decision or policy as to whether it was 'proportionate' by reference to that right. It would mean that Government and State policies and actions would have to respect the right. Legislation and policy would have to be "proofed" to ensure they reasonably protect the right to housing. It would mean that the policies in relation to housing and homelessness could not be a political whim but would have this grounding, this obligation to respect the right to housing.Had that been in the Constitution since 2011, the Government could not have made the desperate mistakes that it has made and we would not be in the mess that we are currently in. There is no case for not supporting this Bill. I really have to ask what the Government has got against rights for citizens. For that matter, if Fianna Fáil does not back the Bill, I will ask its Deputies the same question. The Government will not ratify the rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It does not want to give women the right to control their own bodies, their own fertility and their own medical treatment. It does not want to give people the right to housing. As much as Fianna Fáil's Deputies praise the European Union, for instance, they will roll out the red carpet for Mr. Verhofstadt tomorrow and they are always talking about how they love the European Union, when the European Union proposes rights they want nothing to do with them. For example, in 2000 the European Social Charter proposed a right to housing. Ireland sought an opt-out. That was Fianna Fáil. I am not sure whether Fine Gael raised objections at the time. Why did we specifically opt out of the European charter obligation on the right to housing? Of course, the answer is because at every hand's turn they have protected the interests of developers, speculators and vulture funds instead of vindicating the rights of citizens to a secure, affordable roof over their head, and we are in a mess because of it. Will the Minister please change tack and, as a first step, support this Bill and change the Constitution to establish that right to housing in law?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to assert the dominance of ideology for the sake of it because this crisis is too serious but is it seriously a coincidence that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael refuse to support inserting the right to housing in the Constitution when 84% of people in a randomly selected Constitutional Convention said we should insert the right, when all of the housing NGOs say we should assert this right, and when parties ranging from Sinn Féin to Independents to Solidarity-People Before Profit, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Social Democrats all say this would be a good idea? Is it a coincidence that Fianna Fáil decided to opt out of the right to housing provision in the European Social Charter? Is it a coincidence that when the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2016 was being debated and we pointed out to the Government the loopholes that would be exploited by the landlords and which the Government is finally acknowledging, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael resisted our amendments on those things and our attempts a year ago to close them down? This has consequences. In my area, the case of the residents of St. Helen's Court is before the RTB. A vulture fund called Apollo Global Management is evicting these residents because it tried to get a 60% rent increase, felt it could not get away with it and came back a couple of months later saying it needed to carry out substantial refurbishments and that the residents needed to get out. Robin Hill apartments were in the hands of NAMA. These 20 or so apartments were sitting empty for the past four or five years. NAMA refused to sell them to the council and now the people who own those apartments, our friend Cerberus, which the Department of Finance met, along with holding 60 other meetings with vulture funds and which was invited to buy this property, is evicting people and because it cannot increase the rent, it is adding over €100 and, in some cases, €200 in additional charges per month for heating and hot water which never existed previously. We pointed out all these loopholes to the Government. These people will be evicted so already the Government's ideology has got in the way of preventing these things from happening. There is no explanation other than ideology.  This Bill is very clear. It is about re-balancing the common good provisions and strengthening them over the rights of private property specifically in respect of the right to housing, but the Government resists. Why? It has not given an explanation other than to say it needs to consider it. The Constitutional Convention made its recommendations in 2014. The Government has had three years to consider it. There have been multiple papers on this, and there have been conferences and recommendations. It has been done across the world but the Government still resists it. Why? There can be no explanation other than it is because the Government's ideological default position is to defend the landlords and the vulture funds. What is it going to do about the fact that Cairn Homes has 20% of zoned building land? We could build 12,000 units on that land but we are not going to do so because Cairn Homes, a private, for-profit entity, only wants to build 300 units because it is more profitable to do it that way. I say that the State should go in, take that land and build the houses we need. What will Cairn Homes do if we try to do that? It will scream that we are interfering with its private property rights but to hell with its private property rights. The right to housing for the citizens in homeless accommodation comes first. That is what we are saying and we want the Government to agree with and act on that, build the public housing, stop the evictions and profiteering by landlords and vulture funds, get the land that is being hoarded by these people and use it to provide housing for our citizens. The Minister knows damn well what this is about. We need that action because Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have dragged their heels at every single point of this crisis.
