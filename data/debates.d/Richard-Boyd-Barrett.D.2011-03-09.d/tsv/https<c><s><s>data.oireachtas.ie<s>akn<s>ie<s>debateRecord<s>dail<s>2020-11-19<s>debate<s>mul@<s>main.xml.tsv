RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At one level the task force report on recovery in arts and culture is welcome. I refer to the proposals for a basic income pilot scheme for those working in the arts, local authority funding to be continued, a support for well-being programmes, upskilling and training, loans for small and medium-sized businesses in the events sector and other proposals such as, importantly, payment for online content. The issue is whether it will be merely an oversight committee discussing this. Will we actually see any of these measures implemented?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. It is one of the proposals in the task force.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the income supports and other supports for people working in the arts and creative sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The CRSS will benefit some in live entertainment and music and that is to be welcomed. The report itself, however, obviously influenced by the campaigning of groups like the Events Industry Alliance and the Event Production Industry Covid-19 Working Group, EPIC, points out that huge numbers of SMEs in the music and live entertainment sector will not qualify for the CRSS because they do not have rateable or public-facing premises and so on. This, by the way, is the same point I have made about taxi drivers. They are excluded from these supports and, in fact, they are probably the people who need the most. It is all very well announcing schemes and having positive proposals from a task force but if they are not implemented it will not mean a hell of a lot to the people who are really on their knees. More widely, it is worrying that there is, from what I can see, no timeline for the universal basic income pilot and in a number of other areas, it seems we are going to follow a task force report with an oversight committee. When is it actually going to happen because it is urgent?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I requested the first debate on the impact of Covid on the arts in the House earlier this year. The central point of what I said at the time was that life, without arts, music and culture, would not be worth living. I am glad to find that sentiment has found its way into the title of the Minister's report. However, while we have all these positive proposals, what has actually happened? Many of the people who really need the help and are fighting for their lives are excluded from the CRSS. The PUP has been cut for many of the people impacted. I would say that the Department has shelves full of reports on the need for pensions for people in the arts and all sorts of stuff that never happened. Yes, we have made progress in having a few good proposals because of the campaigning by and desperation of those in the sector, but there has to be urgency in their delivery and the idea we are going to have another report on top of the last one is pretty worrying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Covid-19 has forced us to rethink many of our priorities and understand what is important. Many of those things that we have learned the importance of during Covid-19, and which we should have known before, start with higher education. There are the doctors, the nurses and the scientists we need to cope with a health crisis, the engineers, the architects and the apprentices we need to build infrastructure and the houses we so desperately need, and the arts and the humanities without which, frankly, we would all have gone off our heads over the past six months. Yet, even before Covid, we were failing desperately to support and invest in the people who study these things at third level and postgraduate level. We have the highest fees in Europe, now that Britain has gone, with accommodation costs absolutely out of control for students and a straightforward lack of affordable accommodation, or any accommodation, for students. We had grants that were woefully inadequate and huge inequality in terms of access to third level, given 90% of people from Dublin 6 go to university while the figure is well under 20% in many working-class areas. If all of that was true before Covid, frankly, it has got worse since then because students now do not have the opportunities to work they might have had in order to supplement their income. It is also true of postgraduate students who get paid nothing at all and who, even though they are key to delivering a research output in our universities, do not have proper contracts of employment. Student nurses, who are literally holding the front line together, as many of the nurses, doctors and healthcare assistants are out sick with Covid, are being paid nothing now. Having been acknowledged with healthcare assistant, HCA, payment for a couple of months, it was then pulled from them and the Government is resisting paying them.  Some â‚¬250 is a drop in the ocean in that situation. There is no justification for fees and there never was. There is even less justification in the context of blended learning, with most of it happening off campus amidst general uncertainty. Fees for international students are absolutely outrageous, student nurses actually have to pay fees, when they should be paid and not have to pay fees, and postgraduate students are not paid, even though they are doing real work in real jobs. A hell of a lot needs to be done to change the situation for our students and postgraduates and in regard to the proper funding of universities.
