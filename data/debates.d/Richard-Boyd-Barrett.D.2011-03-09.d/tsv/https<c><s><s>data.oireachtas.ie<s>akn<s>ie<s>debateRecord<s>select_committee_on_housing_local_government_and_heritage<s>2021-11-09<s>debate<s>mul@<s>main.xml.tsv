RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask a question on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to get clarification. We are allowed to ask questions on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no issue about being rushed through sections. I wish to hear a little bit more about the plans for the staffing of the new marine area regulatory authority, MARA, and what the Minister envisages for the staffing of it. How big of an entity will it be? There is reference to consultants and approval for them. I would like to know what is envisaged, as to the type of body it is. What sort of staff will be full time? What sort of specialists will there be in particular areas of environmental expertise, marine biology and heritage? It would be useful to paint a little bit of a picture of what the authority will look like in terms of who is going to work for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister of State have any conception of how many people might be located in the office?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will there be further discussion on that? Will we get down to the granular detail of what type of operation this is going to be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take it the Minister of State has no idea what sort of staff numbers we are talking-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or how it would be structured.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or what departments or sections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, that is a fairly important development. It is one that we welcome because it would be concerning for us if there was the potential for disposal of any part of the maritime area to private interests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My recollection of it was that it specifically said - we quoted the section on the previous occasion - that it referred to the sale or disposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Selling or disposing of is not an administrative function, in my opinion. I do not know what the Minister of State means by "administrative function" but I welcome what he said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A positive victory for Oireachtas oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is more on the section. Will I raise it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a sensible provision to try and ensure co-operation between, if I understand it correctly, different State agencies, Departments and public bodies that may have an interest in the maritime area, have responsibilities in the maritime area or be involved in activities in the maritime area. That seems sensible given that there are many competing imperatives in the maritime area, whether it is the protection of biodiversity, amenity uses, tourist concerns, offshore energy development, fishing or the many other matters that might be important. It is positive that we would have agreements. How would the decision that it is necessary to have such an agreement between different bodies be triggered? Could the Minister of State respond to the concern, consistent with the concerns that we have raised throughout, that insofar as agreements might be struck between MARA and other Departments or public bodies, whether it is heritage, fishing, tourist and amenity concerns or wildlife concerns, that such agreements be screened in some way? Will the public be aware of such agreements and do we need to concern ourselves about the degree to which such agreements might run foul of the directives that we have talked a lot about such as the marine spatial planning directive, the habitats directive, the birds directive or the Aarhus Convention? In most other cases we have argued, whether it is guidelines, statements, plans or consents, one needs public knowledge, public oversight, political oversight and a concern to ensure that all directives are being complied with? Do we need to spell it out in terms of such agreements because these agreements presumably would be a little like management plans of the maritime area where there are different groups involved with an interest in the same maritime area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for that information. It may be something to consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is pretty much what I wanted to ask.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister of State to consider, as well as laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the local authorities being notified about it because, there is overlap for the maritime-based local authorities between MARA and its corporate strategy and objectives and what impacts on local authorities and the communities in their areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It might be an idea for the marine area regulatory authority to indicate in its annual report submissions or lobbying to which it was subject during the course of the year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is my view that while it is fine that there is a one-stop shop for lobbying where everything is, I also believe an important body such as the marine area regulatory authority should indicate where it has received submissions or been the subject of lobbying by any group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just seeking clarification on the things that will not require a MAC. If I read this section correctly, these will include things where their "size, nature or limited impact on the maritime area" falls within a class does "not offend against the principles of proper management of the maritime area and sustainable usage of the maritime area". Where are the principles of proper management and sustainable usage of the maritime area against which this decision about what is or is not subject to a MAC benchmarked? Where are those principles set out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Second, if I read this correctly, a MAC will not be required for activities included in Schedule 3. These activities include, for example, "maritime usage[s] for the purposes, ... [of] consisting, of prospecting for minerals, or the working of minerals, within the meaning of the Minerals Development Acts". That could possibly be called mining. Mining in the sea in the maritime area would not require a MAC, if I read this correctly. Schedule 3.7 further states:Any maritime usage for the purposes, or consisting, of the exploration or working of petroleum (within the meaning of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960), or the restoration of ... [such] area in which ... exploration ... for petroleum has taken place.These are not small usages of the maritime area and Schedule 3 would appear to exclude them from the requirement for a MAC. The Minister of State might detail the other relevant usages because some of the others in Schedule 3 refer to other Acts that I have had time to cross-reference at this stage. I ask for a clear spelling-out of what things will not be subject to a MAC and why. On the face of it, I am deeply unhappy that mining in the maritime area or exploration for petroleum or anything to do with fossil fuels would be somehow not subject to all the processes and consents required in order to ensure those were not damaging to our precious marine environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State did not answer my question about Schedule 3 and what is precluded from MAC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I ask my question now because I must leave? I will be back, and I can read the transcript but while we are dealing with the section I wish to ask the question now as it will have gone past by the time I have returned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to have the point clarified. I do not understand, and frankly I do not accept, that maritime area consents should not be required for explorations, surveys or whatever it might be. No justification has been given. This includes works related to looking for and extracting petroleum for example, which seems to be excluded, or exploration related to mineral extraction. What are these principles referred to in good management or sustainable management? This is not an exact analogy but in some ways I see the MAC as a little bit like some of the licensing arrangements that some of the big industrial offshore wind companies already have under the Foreshore Act for particular areas. It is not for doing development, it is for doing surveys. The Minister of State is shaking his head but an explanation would be helpful. There are works involved in advance of an outright consent to development. Those companies doing this work do not have a consent to development, so they are doing something in advance. The Minister of State should not really patronise me while I am asking these questions, to be honest. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot of head shaking does not really-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that these companies are doing work at the moment that is impacting on fishermen, for example. The fishermen have told me that it is impacting on them. It is in advance of a full-scale development consent. According to the fishermen, there is not sufficient assessment of what is the potential impact in the areas that are being surveyed of what they are doing now. I echo those concerns. If they are doing these things under a maritime area consent, which is not an exact analogy to a foreshore licence, they are doing things in advance of a full-scale development consent that are impacting on fishermen and others. Should those works not be fully and properly environmentally assessed? Should maritime users not know exactly what is going on with regard to these things and how it may potentially impact on them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The notification of MACs should be more than just publishing on a website for the reasons that we discussed earlier. I put more weight on a maritime area consent than the Government has done with its view that it is not consent and not actual development, which is subject to a different process. There is more involved in the things that can be done, under the provisions of a MAC, than is suggested by the way it has been handled in the legislation. Therefore, there should be a greater degree of public notification around the granting of such MACs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If it is proposed to put 2 m of slipway into Dún Laoghaire harbour then I think that the people of Dún Laoghaire are entitled to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have said that bigger plans should be advertised on the radio but I do not propose that for the addition of a 2 m slipway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I do not see why these things would not be notified in some way in a local newspaper, for example. The public are entitled to know if a usage will impact on a port, harbour or beach because often these things happen and people are raging after the event. The Minister of State may consider from the legislative height of the Oireachtas that this seems trivial but often these things are not deemed at all trivial by people in local areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I will have to think about the best formula. Let us be honest, a notice published on a website would pass most Deputies by, never mind members of the public.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a big gap between doubling and a minor tweak. There is a big grey area in the middle. Again, I give the example of the fishermen in my area. They said as par of the survey for the proposed Dublin Array wind farm on their fishing grounds on the Kish and Codling Banks, the goalposts moved during their engagements with the companies as to the area from that they might be excluded from for the period of surveying. That was not trivial to them. No doubt, the company might have seen it as trivial, but the fishermen did not. This is a matter of concern when there is such a grey area. We are told that the Minister will specify these categories of amendments. Our concern is on the precautionary side. There is potential for a lot of slippage there and for big arguments about what is trivial and what is substantial.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As not being "trivial" within maritime area consent?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am thinking in the area of what we are talking about. There is stuff that these companies do in advance of putting in a formal planning application for development that impact on users and on marine life, in many cases. Is it trivial or not, if they decide to say that the area they were surveying was this or we were running tests-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are talking about the maritime area consent, which is different. There is a distinction in this system between a formal application for a development, and the consent a company gets for doing things that are related to its plan for a development, which are not a development but which are usages of the marine area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, but a MAC may involve excluding some existing users from an area for a period of time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State clarify the point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that a lot happened in the 15 minutes that I was gone. Pardon me for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 92 refers to the rehabilitation of the area subject to the MAC. It refers to the requirement to rehabilitate an area, which could include "the decommissioning of infrastructure; the removal of infrastructure; the partial removal of infrastructure; the re-use of infrastructure for the same or another purpose; the burying or encasing of infrastructure; and the removal of any deposited or waste material". In other words, a great deal of infrastructure can be constructed under a MAC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is possible to have a MAC and do absolutely nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, it is possible to have a MAC and to do absolutely nothing with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As far as I am concerned, that is a problem. The Minister of State spelled out that certain things cannot be done under maritime area consent, but applicants for all the relevant projects, so-called, will now have to apply for maritime area consent. Is that correct? Will applicants now have to apply for maritime area consent?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but the public will have no input on whether that is granted. They will have no avenue for making submissions on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	During the planning process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. We have discussed this and my views on it are well known. I will signal, for the record, that even if you cannot do anything, these projects are physically doing things now that will get consents that are impacting on fishermen-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but even for the occupation of the area, to use the Minister of State's phrase-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The right to occupy it. To me , that is pre-empting proper assessment of the areas they are occupying as to whether those areas should even be up for consideration for certain types of activity. I will state that for the record. If we had had designated marine protected areas, and I know the Minister of State said it is a different process that will come later, some of the areas applicants will be allowed occupy under MACs are ones they for which would not have been able to apply for a MAC because they would not have been able to occupy them because they would have been marine protected. That needs to be spelled out clearly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The marine area regulatory authority will be able to ask the High Court to stay proceedings regarding an application for a judicial review about a decision to grant a maritime area consent.Why should MARA be allowed to ask the court to set aside an application for a judicial review around a maritime area consent until after it has made its decision? I ask the Minister of State to explain in plain language why that should be the case. The other amendment relates to extending the eight weeks out to 12 weeks in light of the complexity of the process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to get the Minister of State's view on the question of proximity to the coastline for the of granting licences for activities in the marine and the protection of heritage before licences are granted. We have suggested that we should not be granting licences for certain types of industrial development, particularly industrial offshore wind but also other major industrial-style development, within what used to be called the foreshore area. Across much of Europe, these things are only allowed considerably farther out. A paper by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy pointed out that the general distance in Germany is 53 km from shore. In Belgium, I believe the distance is approximately 37 km. There have been moves in France recently to ensure that the distance for a major offshore wind development is farther out. As far as I understand, Wales has regulations relating to distance and height, with the height of something determining how close it can be to the shore. The average distances are generally considerably farther out than some of the relevant projects which in some cases are as close as 6 km from shore. That is the thought behind amendment No. 190. Amendment No. 191 seeks to ensure that heritage is not negatively impacted by licences of that sort.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unusually, I find myself agreeing with the Minister of State on this amendment. With regard to the central argument and thought behind it, I do not in any way concede, but the amendment, as currently drafted, is casting its net a bit too wide, to use a maritime metaphor. As long we do not keep using the same metaphors over and over again, it is all right. The amendment would prohibit practices that are entirely legitimate and uncontroversial within the foreshore area. With regard to minor activities being licensed, there is not a problem. I would be genuinely interested in hearing the Minister of State's thinking on this matter but we reserve the right to, and very likely will, table amendments seeking to have a requirement on the minimum distance from the shore of large-scale, industrial-style developments. I am simply pointing out, in defence of this position, that the average distance from the shore of these kinds of developments in Europe is forever increasing. We are contemplating a process to grant consents for developments that are much closer to the shore than is generally allowed elsewhere in Europe. The Minister of State should say why we should do that. There are reasons for what I describe. People are trying to get a win–win because we need to develop offshore wind capacity but we can do that while at the same time protecting coastal amenities and the sensitive marine ecosystems and biology that often exist in what used to be called the foreshore area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The section relates to usage exempted from the requirement for a licence. Unlike the maritime area consents, this relates to real activity and the freeing of an application from the requirement for a licence if the Minister decides that its impact is minimal. That is essentially what we are talking about. To use the language of the section, this relates to usages that "would not offend against the objectives listed in Article 5 of the MSP Directive" or are trivial. I am concerned about that. It is back to the issue of what is trivial and how the issue of whether these activities significantly impact on the environment is assessed. Is it the case that the Minister will simply set that out? The Minister will decide.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decision in respect of what is licensable is subject to all of the directives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	MARA can decide if something is sufficiently significant to require an environmental impact assessment, EIA. If it decides that it does not or - if I have the jargon right - it screens something out which should have been in, that is challengeable. How? It is through the courts only through judicial review. There is no method for stakeholders, NGOs or members of the public to challenge a decision as to whether an EIA should have been required for the licensing of a particular activity other than recourse to a judicial review, which is an expensive, difficult and onerous process. With the exception of the rather discredited strategic housing developments, that is different from how we do things on land, where there is an initial process and a right to appeal. The only avenue once the MARA makes the decision that, for example, an environmental impact assessment is not necessary for somebody wishing to challenge that is to apply for a judicial review. That seems-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, and a bit problematic for many people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No licensable activity would ever be subject to an EIA. Is that what the Minister of State is saying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So no activity can take place until it goes through the planning process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we get some explanation of this section's purpose?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It relates to unauthorised development. What would it do with historical unauthorised development?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It relates to foreshore consents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The leases or licences will be turned into MACs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section deals with licences rather than MACs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are the types? Are they small provisions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surveys might be done now by offshore wind companies. Does this section relate to those?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is mention of long-term occupation of parts of the marine. Is it just a rubber-stamping process for the arrangements in question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. That is for every activity or development. They would have to go through some sort of process to check they are legitimate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
