RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad to speak about this because there is probably no more important a subject we could discuss than strategic investment, which is the key to getting this country out of the economic mess it is in. This Bill is long overdue. The strategic investment bank the Government promised, which I presume is now this strategic investment fund, has taken a long time to come before us for this debate. The lack of a strategic plan for investment lies at the heart of the economic crisis we had, because investment flowed to the wrong places for the wrong reasons, creating a bubble economy and leading to a disastrous crash for which we have paid a terrible price. Getting the question of strategic investment right is critical for the future of our economy, if that future is to be sustainable and if it is to avoid repeats of the sort of disastrous crisis we have just been through. I hope that with all the exciting and interesting issues that often occupy the national media, some of which are important and exciting and others less so, some attention will be paid to this very important discussion, which will set the parameters for the future sustainability of our economy. In establishing a strategic investment fund we are starting with a much-depleted fund because of the decision of the previous Government and this Government to bail out private financial institutions and international gamblers in the financial markets. The obvious point - which has been made many times, but which I do not believe we should be allowed to forget because it will be a feature of what is going on in our economy for years to come - is that this year over €8 billion, which could have been in a strategic investment fund and invested in this country to create jobs, develop infrastructure and ensure a sustainable economic future for this country, is being sucked out of the country. That is a tragedy. The pot we have to engage in strategic investment is massively depleted because we will continue to pump out billions of euro for years to come to pay for the disastrous mistakes that were made in the past. Those mistakes must inform our approach to strategic investment to make sure we do not repeat them. I still believe - although I know I will not get any change from this Government on it - that we should be fighting with Europe to retain some, if not all, of that €9 billion to reinvest in our economy in strategic ways. If this Government or any other Government insists on paying back all that money, which we should not do because I do not believe we are obliged to pay it back, it should demand that it is paid out over a much longer term. It should insist that some of the money we are paying out be retained for strategic investment on the basis that we can show that investment is capable of achieving a return which would allow us pay back the money over a much longer term. I make that general introductory point. I will not dwell on it but I believe it is critical and must not be forgotten. In terms of what this fund can do and where we should be investing strategically to create jobs and develop a sustainable economy, on the face of it, this Bill is saying the right things. We need strategic investment. It is a good approach to streamline the National Treasury Management Agency and move away from investing the national pension fund in international hedge funds that are being invested elsewhere, and to redirect the investment back into our economy, with a particular focus on job creation. All of those measures, on the face of it, are welcome, and some of the sectors of the economy mentioned by the Minister with regard to this fund and that are in the legislation, such as infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, broadband and forestry, are key areas in which we must be thinking about strategic investment, because it can generate employment and real wealth for our economy, which can help us get out of the mess we are in and develop the economy on a sustainable path into the future.  However, what worries me greatly is the repeated emphasis the Minister put in his introduction on co-partnership with private investors, public private partnerships, and allowing for further State investment in private financial institutions - that is, bailing out banks - all of which are worrying. In the case of NewERA, the Minister knows well that we are opposed to the State asset disposal programme because we believe it is the wrong way to go about making the best of our assets and resources that must be retained in public ownership and invested in to develop jobs and economic benefits for the citizens of this country rather than being given away to private interests purely to ensure a profit for those interests and, ultimately, at a loss to our economy and society. Overall, there is a worrying emphasis on what is called commercial return, which, going on past experience, is often about short-term rather than long-term, sustainable investment directed towards the good of our economy and society. It is also important that as well as a commercial return on our investment we get a social return, and that the return is regionally balanced so that the investment is spread throughout the country and among different sectors of the economy rather than concentrated in particular regions such as Dublin. It is important that the focus is on balancing the need for a return with the social need of our citizens and the long-term needs of society as a whole. I am concerned that this is not the direction in which we are going and that the focus is more on short term commercial gain for strategic investment. An issue that has not yet been mentioned but that lies at the heart of the economic crisis we are experiencing and needs to be a priority in terms of strategic investment for all sorts of reasons is that of housing. The manner in which NAMA, which comes under the umbrella of the NTMA, has dealt with and is dealing with this issue indicates that we are moving in the wrong direction. I and others have repeatedly and endlessly pointed out that we are experiencing a disastrous housing crisis, that rents and property prices are going through the roof, that a property bubble is rapidly developing and so on. NAMA, the biggest real estate company in the world, owned by the State and under the umbrella of the NTMA, is unloading vast amounts of property onto the market and into the hands of, to a large extent, private international investors who have no commitment to our society, its needs or our economy. They are investing in Ireland for one reason only, namely, to make money, to profit from a property sector that is beginning to again spiral out of control. A body operating under the aegis of the NTMA is handing this property over lock, stock and barrel to big international investors. The Department of Finance has put in place incentives and tax breaks to encourage these vultures on the international markets to invest in and profit from the housing and property sector while at the same time we are experiencing a massive and spiralling housing crisis, with many of our citizens unable to afford to put a roof over their heads. To me, that does not make sense.  If NAMA's job is to make a short-term gain and put private developers back in business, then that makes some sense. However, if we are thinking strategically about the long-term good of the economy, the maintenance of balance and regulation in the housing sector and, crucially, meeting the social needs of Irish citizens, what is being done makes no sense. It is setting in place the ingredients for the same disastrous mistakes to be made again. What should be done is that this property, in so far as NAMA still has it, should be put back into the hands of local authorities to house people in need and generate a long-term revenue stream for the State. Whether property is taken from NAMA or constructed, the effect would be the same - namely, people would be returned to employment, a revenue stream would be created for the Exchequer and there would be savings to the State in moneys currently paid out in rent allowance, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, arrangements and lease arrangements with the private sector, which, if this is not done, will continue to get this revenue stream at great cost to the State. I do not understand it.  In response to our calls for a housing construction programme or housing purchase acquisition programme for local authorities, the response of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, has been to ask where the money will come from. The money could be taken from the Strategic Investment Fund. I will provide some data showing how this would make sense, not only for the people on the housing list in need of affordable housing but for the economy in terms of the revenue that would be generated. According to the response to a parliamentary question I tabled some months ago, the cost of constructing 10,000 council houses - the cost might be slightly higher now because of the rise in inflation, although it would cost us nothing if property was transferred across from NAMA - is €1 billion. If 10,000 houses were constructed annually, the saving to the Exchequer in rent allowance payments to private landlords would be €66.2 million. Also, additional rental revenue of €50 million would be generated for the State. This means that approximately €100 million per annum would accrue for every 10,000 council houses constructed, purchased or transferred from NAMA. If 50,000 houses were to be constructed, purchased or transferred from NAMA, the saving would be €500 million, or the same amount in additional revenue to the State. In other words, if, via NAMA, construction or acquisition-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excuse me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The response to a parliamentary question in regard to how much it costs to construct a council house is that it would cost approximately €100,000 to do so. That is what I am basing my calculations on. I would appreciate it if Deputy Lawlor ceased interrupting me. This means that over ten years the scheme would pay for itself. Following that, there would be a revenue stream back to the State - money that would otherwise be going to private investors such as LoanStar and other vulture funds. In the context of the repayment of all debts to private institutions, even they would see that this guaranteed revenue back to the State. Also, the construction of social housing would put many people back to work. That is strategic investment that is sustainable, long-term and beneficial to the economy and society. I do not understand why the Government will not do that and the reason all the emphasis is on partnership with the private sector. We all know what happened to public private partnerships such as the one with Bernard McNamara in O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and so on. They were a disaster. Why would we do that? It is a waste of money. It is money down the drain, it is unreliable, it does not work and it has had disastrous consequences in the past. What I have proposed is the type of scheme in which we need to invest. It would meet real social need, create employment and all that would flow from it and provide guaranteed revenue to the State. Another area that could be examined is that of forestry. Despite the fact that we have the most favourable conditions in Europe for the growth of forests, we have spectacularly failed to meet our afforestation targets. This country was once covered by forests. Forestry is a safe investment. It generates a lot of employment and so on. I do not propose to go through all the data because we have already discussed it during several debates. Forestry provides a guaranteed number of jobs for a set amount of acreage. It is a long-term safe investment. The value of timber globally is increasing. A lot of international funds invest in forestry because it is a safe, good investment. It is also good for the environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying that the State should be investing in it.Through protesting and campaigning, we stopped the Government giving away Coillte's harvesting rights, yet all the emphasis is on handing over the
assets to the private sector rather than on recognising where there could be strategic investment with significant potential to generate revenue and deal precisely with issues such as the pensions reserve fund. We need the reserve fund because it is a safe investment that will actually guarantee the pensions of citizens and deal with the pensions crisis that is looming for the country. What I propose presents a win-win scenario. There would be a benefit in terms of carbon credits and EU money. These are the areas we should be examining. A matter that was recently brought to my attention — I am not an environmental expert by any means — was that of geothermal energy. My point on it may be very obvious to people from rural areas. Everything that grows, including grass and scrub, can be turned into energy. I refer to biomass. While the Government's emphasis has been on building huge industrial wind turbines, attracting all of the associated controversy and major questions, a report issued recently claims that if we were to spend on converting the Moneypoint power plant into a biomass plant one tenth of what the Government is planning to spend on turbines in partnership with big private financial interests, we would meet our targets for carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Should we not be considering this? We could grow the trees and there would be an economic benefit in terms of jobs and the environment. Revenue would be returned to us rather than go to private investors. I do not have time to address all areas of strategic investment. I worry deeply about the emphasis the Government is placing, through this legislation, on the facilitation of profit-making by private investors and interests who will drain away our resources and the revenues that could otherwise be generated to the benefit of citizens and the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could simply stop paying €9 billion in interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To what committee will the Bill be referred?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take up where Deputy Murphy left off. I am in favour of universal access to health care. The repeated emphasis in the Minister of State's introductory speech and the Government's setting out of its vision to develop the health service is on the need for universality in access to health care. The removal of user fees from any group is to be welcomed. I believe that user fees for health services are unacceptable, obnoxious and wasteful. There are a myriad of reasons why we need to remove them but, as has been said by Deputy Murphy and generally over the past while, the perfectly understandable perception is that we are giving free GP care to the under-sixes at the expense of other groups of chronically ill, disabled or elderly people with serious medical needs. The perception is that this is the quid pro quo. That is unacceptable. The Minister of State will say that this is not the case and that additional money is being provided.We heard on Sean O'Rourke's show again this morning about the appalling and most impossible circumstances of families with severely disabled children who were being denied medical cards. It might have been related to the family to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred. This week an elderly lady came to my clinic who could barely breathe. I could hear that she had an inability to breathe. She had a severe, chronic, permanent pulmonary condition and was wheezing constantly during our conversation. She informed me that her medical card had been withdrawn and that she had to reduce by half the medication she took, although she might literally collapse and die, of which she was fearful. She feared going up the stairs or going out for a walk. She could barely breathe, yet her medical card had been removed following a review. This is absolutely unacceptable. Understandably, people ask how the Government could possibly endanger the lives, health and welfare of severely sick, disabled and elderly people, while at the same time giving free access to health care to children whose families may well have sufficient resources to pay for it. As a supporter of universal access to health care, I do not accept the setting off of one against the other and do not want to go down that road. It is absolutely understandable people are asking what the hell the Government is doing when they see medical cards being taken from chronically sick and disabled people. It is difficult not to conclude it is a political stunt. I want to see universal access. We are not going to oppose this measure, but we are against the slashing of health budgets and what was referred to in euphemistic jargon, to cover over budgetary cuts, as "medical card probity". I love such phrases. In this case, probity means savage cuts affecting the disabled, the sick and the vulnerable. That is what probity turned out to be, as predicted by us when the measure was included in the budget. That is the current position. The Government must do something to ensure the two sides are not set against each other. Young children should have access to whatever health care they need. I applaud and concur completely with the idea that we need to move towards preventive health care and what is proposed is a step in that direction. If we ensure children are healthy from a young age and give them the access to the health care they need, it will pay off and pay dividends further down the line, but this cannot be achieved where the policy is set against the literal endangerment of the lives of some of the most vulnerable, the ill, the elderly and disabled people. That is appalling and unacceptable. Deputy Catherine Murphy's point is well worth underlining in the light of the example I gave of the lady who came to my clinic this week. Ultimately, there may be no savings, as the Deputy said. The lady who came to my clinic literally looked like she could collapse at any time. If she collapses, she will end up in an accident and emergency unit. This will cost more than it would if we were to give her the medication she needs by returning her medical card. What is occurring does not make sense and I seriously hope the Government will address that appalling set of circumstances. Everybody deserves health care when he or she needs it. We need to allow for universal access that is free at the point of need. Nothing is free in this world; it is always paid for, but it is a question of whether we pay in a fair way through central taxation. This is linked with ability to pay and is thus fair and progressive. It is critical that people receive the health care they need when they need it. Let me outline where I am critical of the particular model of universality in question. I have made the point on a number of occasions, including to the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, that linking universality with a plan to involve private health insurance companies is inappropriate. Putting the money into the pockets of private health insurance companies is sucking out resources that should be going into front-line services and contributing to the required staffing levels, health care, the recruitment of doctors and nurses, etc. I do not see why we need these companies or what value they add to the process. I have not heard any justification for their involvement in it. The examples of Holland and the United States were raised by us on a number of occasions. I refer to the so-called Dutch model and the US model. As I pointed out on a number of occasions, the United States spends more, proportionately, on health than any other country, but 40% of that expenditure is on administration linked with private health insurance companies. It is utter waste. The money is spent on advertising, billing and all that unnecessary crap, including paying the massive and inflated salaries of the top executives in the health insurance companies. Why do we need them? We do not. Why are they involved? They should not be. They are profiting from health care and the health needs of ordinary people. It is all the same, whether the money spent in this way is sucked out of the pockets of citizens through inflated health insurance costs or the public purse. They are equally bad. It is money down the drain and a complete waste. What we need is a national health service and free access to health care at all levels, from the cradle to the grave, provided by a public health service funded through central taxation. This would remove all the waste and the middleman who is sucking out the money. The Government needs to address the concerns of general practitioners. I am glad that there has been some agreement, but the case general practitioners made to us at the meeting in the Burlington was pretty scary. They were saying they were leaving; some had actually bought their tickets to go on the grounds that they were in an unsustainable position. Unless we get them on board, this will not work.
