RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank both contributors for their comments to the committee.  It is worth asking both of them, putting this debate in context, whatever about all the nuts and bolts and the questions of who and why, if they agree that aggressive tax avoidance by multinational corporations is a major contributor to the spectacular growth in the gap between the rich and poor.Each year report after report from various international agencies points out that most of the 250 richest individuals are the CEOs of multinationals and that their personal wealth is the equivalent of that of the 46 poorest countries in the world. This level of extraordinary, unprecedented inequality is accelerating year on year. Does Mr. Keegan agree with the assertion that aggressive tax avoidance, be it through deferral, transfer pricing or the abuse of research and development clauses in tax codes, etc., is a major factor, if not the major one, that explains what any fair person would say is the morally unacceptable gap between the rich and poor?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an amazing response, to be honest.  Could any reasonable person believe the correlation is coincidental given the spectacular wealth of certain individuals, whose current concentration has never been seen before?  Circumstances are such that one individual could be worth tens, if not hundreds, of billions of euro.  They are the CEOs of the companies in question and we are discussing the means through which the companies avoid, defer or get around taxation.  Surely any reasonable person would say there is a strong, if not direct, connection between the phenomena I describe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, the gap is even greater.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is not about directing remarks at Mr. Keegan personally.  I was surprised that he would not accept that there was a connection between tax avoidance and the widening gap between the rich and poor.  He states he teaches compliance with the law.  As I do not know a lot about what he teaches, I am not personalising the issue at all.  There is the question of compliance with the law and that of getting around the law legally.  We are trying to determine whether there is a connection between tax avoidance by multinationals that make such extraordinary profits and the CEOs of which are spectacularly rich and among the richest in the world and the fact that there is a huge gap between the rich and poor.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point.  I am not saying Mr. Keegan's organisation is encouraging tax avoidance, but to my mind it is extraordinary that somebody would not acknowledge that there was a connection between the two phenomena.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is hard to quantify the extent of transfer mispricing, which seems to be one feature of tax avoidance, because corporations operate on an international basis and we do not have country by country reporting, as pointed out by Mr. McCaughey.  I would like to hear a little more about whether we could on our own start a process of reporting.  It seems that we could and should and not just wait for the OECD to demand it.We want to know details of multinationals' operations, what is being made here and where these profits are being generated, as against stuff that is coming in. I would therefore like to hear a comment on that. In so far as we could possibly get a handle on transfer mispricing, that is not just tax avoidance; is it not tax evasion? If they are abusing the rules, that is tax evasion. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I just stop Mr. Keegan there because time will run out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have seen figures - I do not have them in front of me - which show that, for example, the productivity of workers in Irish multinationals and the profits generated per worker are off the Richter scale compared to other countries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have great time for Irish workers and I have no doubt how educated and capable they are, but there is such a spectacular gap between the profits being generated per worker in Irish multinationals and those in other countries, that two and two would strongly seem to suggest four.  I am suggesting there is something going on.  Would Mr. Keegan agree with that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two other quick questions and the answers will have to be brief because I do not have much time.  I am back-tracking a little bit.  Tax deferral, as opposed to tax evasion, might be legal but Mr. Keegan made a good point which is worth underlining.  Perhaps he can confirm this point.  If one can defer tax there is a huge amount at stake, is there not?  To take the comparison with an individual, if we did not have to pay our property tax and water charges for ten, 15 or 20 years, but had to pay them way down the line, that would be a pretty significant benefit.  Ordinary individuals do not get the opportunity to do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One can do it for five years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one is on a low income, one can do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but one pays interest on it.  As regards share values, however, because they do not have to pay tax on it the value of their shares can appreciate - sometimes enormously - and they can then sell those shares and make vast fortunes.  Generally speaking, it is not a mechanism that is available to ordinary citizens but by doing this, shareholders in those companies can become very rich.  Is that not true?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one last point.  There were references to the €4 billion we get in profits.  Mr. Keegan said that was a big figure.  Perhaps he could comment on the point I have made several times, namely, that compared to the €70 billion in pre-tax profits it is very small.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is 6.8% of the pre-tax profits.  The European Commission's effective figure would confirm that, whereas effective rates elsewhere - according to a paper we received recently from the Oireachtas Library service - showed that similar implicit rates across Europe are very much higher.  Putting that together with the point about research and development, there are other ways in which taxable income is reduced.  I would like to ask both Mr. Keegan and Mr. McCaughey about that.  How is it that our implicit rate is so much lower?  Is it to do with abuse of research and development tax breaks or other tax breaks that allow companies to write down the amount of their taxable profits?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just one question, while Mr. Keegan thinks about his answer.  Why is our implicit rate so much lower than everybody else's in Europe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the figures we were given in the research document, it is.  The implicit rate is much higher than in other countries in Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
