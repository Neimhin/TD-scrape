RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach read the NESC report on land management produced in April 2018? I ask this because it will explain to him what those of us who will be marching for emergency action on the housing and homelessness emergency on 1 December want and the sort of radical change in policy we are looking for. What the NESC report does is set out examples of what is done in places like the Netherlands and Austria. The contrast with the policies the Government has pursued on housing is stark in the extreme. It points out that in Amsterdam, for example, 80% of zoned building land is in the hands of the state, which does not sell it. Some 30% of Dutch housing stock is social housing, which contrasts with 5% here because of the failure of the Government to build social housing. In Austria, between 2000 and 2014, the austerity years when Irish Governments slashed housing budgets, helping to generate the current housing crisis, the Austrians did the exact opposite. Between 28% and 36% of all housing built in Austria in that period was social housing. It is extraordinary. In the period when we stopped building social housing, more than 30% of all of their housing output was social housing. Does the Taoiseach see the point? The Government is selling off public land and allowing the private market to dictate, and we have a disaster. However, in other countries of Europe land is kept in public use, strict land management policies apply and a large amount of social housing is built.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should not be selling public land.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to take the Taoiseach back to what was a fairly disappointing response to the Stardust families earlier and what I feel is a bit of a buck-passing exercise on his part when one considers the programme for Government and what it says about what the Government would do about the Stardust tragedy. It stated, "Full regard will be had to any new evidence which emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at Stardust". The reason the Stardust families have had to go to the lengths of collecting 48,000 postcards appealing to the Attorney General is that the Taoiseach's Government has failed on this promise in the programme for Government to have regard to evidence that has been provided and gathered by the families. Thirty-seven years on, they are still fighting and are now having to go to the Attorney General because the Taoiseach's Government failed on a promise to take into account evidence gathered by them which suggests that the real cause of the fire was completely different from the causes claimed in the official reports. This evidence has been provided and I do not understand why the Government will not look at it, acknowledge it and give the families what they are asking for, which is an independent commission of investigation into the real causes of the fire so they can finally get truth and justice. Will the Taoiseach not pass the buck but rather answer the families? Why has this not been done? A desktop report by Pat McCartan was not what they asked for. It did not look seriously at the new evidence they had provided, evidence that is staring the Government in the face, about the fire having started earlier in the roof space, eyewitness reports, maps of the Stardust building used in the original inquiries that were completely inaccurate and many other things I do not have time to mention. This evidence has been provided. Why will the Government not look at it and give the families the commission of investigation they have asked for?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should give him more time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach answer the other questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we get responses to the other questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not talk to witnesses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is very simple. Why is the Tánaiste not demanding, and why is the EU not imposing, sanctions on Saudi Arabia? The humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding in Yemen is due, to a large extent, to the Saudi military intervention, the blockade and the deliberate attempts to starve and bomb the population into submission. Of course, standing behind Saudi in this regard are the United States, France and Germany. They are arming the Saudi regime, a regime whose agents murder a man who is a dissident journalist. They dismembered his body and, if the reports are accurate, they burned the remains of his body with acid to destroy them. This is what we are dealing with. There are 22 of these characters around the corner from this building in the Saudi Embassy. Why are there no sanctions? Why is this not being said? Can we impose sanctions on what is an absolutely rogue barbaric regime that is inflicting the sort of humanitarian horror that we are seeing? The Tánaiste knows the answer to this question. We do not do it because France, the UK and the United States make a great deal of money backing these people. Even worse, geo-politically these countries do not mind what those people do. It suits them to have Saudis do this because Saudi is a reliable ally for western interests in the region. That is the truth. We all know it is the truth. Millions of people are suffering. Will the Government not stand up and say that is the truth of it? Can we not expect the European Union to have a little more moral backbone and do something about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My ideology is informed by arms sales to Saudi Arabia by the western world.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There should be a second round of contributions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My comments about the embassy were not directed at Saudi citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 22 diplomats, which is a disproportionately high number for a small country. Given what happened in the Saudi consulate in Turkey it is ever so slightly alarming. That was the point I made. We are talking about a rogue state that, as we have seen with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and with its actions in Yemen, is quite willing to engage in barbaric acts. The elephant in the room is that the UK, France and the United States sell vast amounts of weapons to this regime on an ongoing basis. How can that possibly be acceptable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Precarious work of various different types is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, is not here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. This Topical Issue matter was moved on two separate occasions specifically to allow the Minister to be here to take it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished my point. This Topical Issue matter was originally to be taken about a week ago, when I agreed to defer it to another day. I have no problem with Ministers not being available but I agreed to defer it to today at the request of the Minister. I would not have bothered re-tabling it for today if I had known the Minister could not be here to take it. The reason it was not taken on the first day was because the Minister was not available. Had I been told earlier that she could not be here, I could have deferred the matter to another day. It was deferred to today on the basis that the Minister would be here to take it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point but the way in which this works is that the matter is deferred-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. I want to have the debate with the Minister, as promised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, for the record I genuinely understand that people have other commitments but there should be advance notice of these matters. That is a fair point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(3) Within 6 months of the passing of this act, the Minister shall produce a report on the benefit of abolishing the Universal Social Charge on all income below €90,000 and replacing it with 4 new income tax bands for income earned between, €100,000 and €140,000, €140,000 and €180,000, €180,000 and €250,000 and over €250,000.”.Since the great tax marches of the early 1980s, the question of tax justice has been a burning issue for working people in this country. Indeed, one cannot really understand the enormous movement around water charges, property tax and bin taxes without understanding the burning sense of grievance that working people feel over the historically unjust character of the tax system. It is not that workers are unreasonable. They have been out on the streets on these issues again and again since before the Minister's time in politics or mine. Taken in the round, workers justifiably feel that the tax system is unfair and disproportionately punishes them while letting the wealthy and large corporations off the hook of making a tax contribution to fund our services and society. In that regard, the universal social charge was a bitter pill to swallow, as were the property tax, water charges and so on. Since it was Revenue that took the USC and, subsequently, property tax, there was not much that workers could do, but they expressed their fury on the issue of water charges. One should be in no doubt that the anger expressed on water was also an anger at the property tax, USC and many indirect and hidden taxes and charges that working people have to put up with. It is in that context that this amendment attempts to redress the balance in the tax injustice that pervades the Irish tax system. Our amendment proposes to get rid of USC for everyone earning less than €90,000, a commitment that this Government made, and to pay for it by making some of the wealthiest in society pay their fair share. There is something of a false debate about whether the Government should be promising tax cuts as against spending on public services. I do not accept that as the correct parameter for the debate. There can be tax justice for workers and more money for public services if the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. This is one of a suite of amendments that we have proposed to move in that direction. I do not expect that the Minister will accept them, but they must nonetheless be aired. The specific proposal in this amendment is that USC for those earning less than €90,000 should be abolished and replaced with four additional bands of taxation on those earning in excess of €100,000 so that people earning between €100,000 and €140,000 pay 50% tax on that portion of income, people earning between €140,000 and €180,000 pay 55%, people earning between €180,000 and €250,000 pay 60%, and people earning more than €250,000 pay 65%. According to the Minister's response to my parliamentary question, this would raise €2.1 billion. That is a lot of money, and we could use it to give tax relief to workers at the lower end without undermining the famous tax base. This is about shifting the tax balance from those who have been hard hit, the very people the Taoiseach was talking about at the weekend. Let us take some pressure off them and pay for it by making those who are not paying their fair share do so. It is a small cohort of people. According to the CSO, the wealthiest 10% in society get 40% of the income. I always laugh when I hear the Minister or the Taoiseach saying that the wealthiest 10% pay 40% of the taxes. Of course they do. It is because they have 40% of the income. Proportionately, though, and when all of the indirect taxes, USC and so on are taken into account, are they paying the same amount of their income as people at the bottom? They are not. That was confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General when he pointed out that an incredible 90 of the richest individuals in this country, high net worth individuals who have well in excess of €50 million each, are paying less tax than the average worker and are managing to do so on the basis of loopholes and tax reliefs of which they can avail. This brings me to my final point. It is a bit rich that, at the same time as the Taoiseach talked at the weekend about giving relief to working people in terms of tax, we discovered that Revenue was making a grab for the tiny bit of tax relief that some of the lowest paid and most precariously employed workers in this country enjoyed.We are talking here about €85 million in reliefs claimed by shop assistants, freelance actors whose working lives are totally precarious, freelance journalists and so on. A further grab may be made for allowances claimed by construction workers, bar staff and others who receive relief of a few hundred euro. At the same time, the Comptroller and Auditor General has identified an incredible €213 billion worth of reliefs and allowances that are benefiting big corporations and the very wealthy. We must address these double standards. The amendment would make an attempt to move in that direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have time to go into the issue of allowances in two minutes, but I want to make one point. The Comptroller and Auditor General identified €231 billion in allowances and losses brought forward. The figure is so big it is mind-boggling. The gross trading profits of the corporate sector were €80 billion higher than its taxable income in 2016. That is the scale of these loopholes. As against that figure, the allowances at which the Minister is looking or which Revenue is going to go after, most of which are given to working people who are relatively low-paid and precariously employed, amount to €85 million. Hundreds of thousands of workers get little tiny loopholes in the form of real, justifiable allowances based on the cost of working and the corporations get €231 billion. That is just not fair. It is not even fair to look at the workers' allowances, which they really need. They are a couple of hundred quid. They are contributions towards the cost of getting to work, uniforms, tools, or whatever else it might be while an enormous amount is being written off in terms of taxable income for those at the top. That needs to be looked at. I am going to keep banging on about it until we force the details of these allowances, reliefs and loopholes into the public view so that they can be scrutinised and so that they have to be justified. Frankly, that has not happened. It is beginning to happen a bit in respect of some of them, but we have a hell of a long way to go. We should not even be looking at low-paid workers. This asks for a report. For the benefit of Deputy Burton, we were talking about individual incomes, not combined incomes. That is the first point. Second, the examples the Minister gave leave out the middle cohort. Workers on €35,000, €40,000, €45,000, €50,000, €60,000 and so on are paying quite a lot of tax when - and this is the point I made at the very outset - it is added to all the other forms of indirect tax, such as property taxes, bin charges, and water charges. Luckily we have defeated the latter for now. There are many other areas in which people are paying stealth taxes such as the public service obligation levy on utility bills and so on. It all adds up to an additional tax burden on working people that is disproportionate when compared with how these charges impact on people at the top. The Minister's point about people paying taxes at a lower level might be justified if there were not all of these extraneous costs, which are in effect taxes, imposed on people for just about everything they do. That is the point. It is not just me saying that. That is the reason people were out on the streets. It was not because populists stirred them up but because people are furious about this stuff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not really explain the point that the Comptroller and Auditor General made, which is a serious issue. Somehow, 90 of the richest individuals with extraordinary wealth, €50 million on average, are paying less or about the same tax as the average industrial worker. Something is wrong there. That speaks to another fact which is that, overall, income inequality in Ireland before social transfers is pretty high by international standards. This point has been made by the CSO and others. If there are high levels of income inequality to start with, one ends up with even higher levels of wealth inequality over time. That is very evident with the CSO again confirming that the richest 10% have 54% of the wealth. That is in line with an international pattern where wealth and income are becoming more and more concentrated in the hands of the top earners. Wage share as a share of national income is falling consistently, and Ireland is seeing one of the biggest falls. I am trying to say there is something wrong with that trajectory and that we need radical measures to address it. That means radically shifting the balance of taxation when one is earning over €100,000. It is important to say that for the earnings lower than that, people will benefit from not having to pay USC or property tax and so on. It tries to shift the balance radically so there is a very steep cliff once one goes over the threshold of €100,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 92, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:
“Report on section 481 Tax Relief
26. Within 6 months of the passing of this act, the Minister shall produce a report on section 481 Tax Relief and the social and economic impact of this expenditure particularly in relation to the provision of quality employment.”.This amendment relates to the section 481 tax relief, which is designed to encourage and promote the film industry. It amounts to approximately €70 million a year, which is a substantial investment of public money in this industry. As I said to the Minister on Committee Stage, and I will repeat myself because this issue has become very controversial, I am very much in favour not only of maintaining the current level of public investment in film, but of dramatically increasing it. In fact, in our budget submission we proposed an additional €241 million in investment in arts generally, with a substantial amount going to film, although, obviously, to other arts as well. This level of investment would bring us towards the average expenditure in Europe, which we are well below. I stress this because there are some in the film industry who are not happy that I have questioned some of the matters surrounding this relief and some of the issues in the industry. However, I stress to them, and no doubt some of them will be watching this debate, that what I want is to strengthen the industry and to see more investment in it. There are problems surrounding this relief, however. Indeed, there is a significant dispute raging in the film industry on a number of fronts linked to this relief. I will not go into some of them in great detail except to urge the Minister to take them seriously. A series of articles has been running, particularly in The Sunday Business Post, about fairly serious allegations of abuses of section 481 relief, court cases pertaining to same and very prominent film stars and so on accusing certain producer companies of significantly inflating their claims under section 481. I do not know the truth of these allegations but they indicate that there needs to be serious policing and very definite rules and regulations around these reliefs so they cannot be abused but rather do what they are supposed to do, that is, generate employment in the industry and generate a sustainable film industry. This is very important. As I said to the Minister, and I again stress this to all the people involved in this industry, we have a massive pool of talent in this country. We box way above our weight in literature, the arts and so on and we could do so to a much greater extent in film if there was more investment but also if we redesigned things a little. The focus of this amendment is the issue of the requirement in section 481 that it provide "quality employment and training opportunities". That is the condition of availing of this tax relief and therefore is a legal requirement. The debate revolves around whether this is the case. To outline to the Minister some of the issues at stake, the number of employees, for example, is important. At the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, where this was discussed at the end of January, Screen Producers Ireland and the Irish Film Board said there were 17,000 whole-time equivalent jobs. Recently that figure has come down to about 3,000. That is a big difference, is it not? Let us be honest. The same amount of money is involved but now the number of jobs in the industry has gone from 17,000 to 3,000. When we consider that quite a few of those are in RTÉ, we begin to get a sense of how many are actually working in film. This is a significant issue and it needs to be looked at. What are we getting back in terms of real jobs in this industry? What kind of jobs are they? Are they quality jobs? Will the Minister in his response to me tell me his definition of a quality job? What is quality employment? What is quality training? Legally, this relief is supposed to be dependent on these questions. To my mind, quality employment, at an absolute minimum, is adherence to employment law and EU directives on employment. For example, if a person has three short-term contracts for the same production company in the space of four years, that person is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration. That is not happening. Even though the same companies are getting the money and employing the same people, these employees are not getting contracts of indefinite duration.That is the law. It is not up for debate but it is not being applied. Bogus self-employment is also happening, which the Government has started to act on in other areas. There are objective criteria relating to this. Some people cannot simply be declared to be contractors if the character of their work and the nature of their relationship with the employer, the producer company in this case, is one of employee. Objective criteria need to be examined, which is important from a Revenue point of view. With this amendment, we are asking the Minister to look into these issues. Let us examine how many PAYE employees in the different sectors claim this relief as opposed to contractors and then examine the tax revenue from these two different groups. We will find there is a significant difference. If there is a PAYE employee in the same grade and doing the same job, the State gets back much more.  Workers were telling me that a PAYE worker in certain grades in transport, construction, etc., six-month contract pays €35,000 in tax but if the same person doing the same job is designated a as contractor, he or she pays €3,000 or €4,000 in tax. There are issues in this regard that need to be examined. This needs to be looked into and, critically, the industry forum that was recommended needs to be convened. All stakeholders could discuss what is quality employment and what are the conditions for availing of this tax relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that things are beginning to move on this and that some work has been done to quantify the impact and tighten up and streamline matters in a good way, but I should probably press the amendment because there is more to do. I will say something before moving on to the general point. The Minister correctly agreed that, at a minimum, quality employment - this relief is not just about training, as current legislation refers to quality employment and training - is not just compliant with EU directives in the sector, but also with contract and employment law, the working time directive and so on. Does he further agree that the relief should be withheld where an employer is found to be in breach of those laws? It follows that he should. The relief says it should be conditional on these factors. If we find that employers are not applying contract law, they should not get the relief. That should be self-evident to a law-abiding party like Fine Gael. I am not joking. Unless there is a sense that quality employment has to be provided to get the relief, then there is room for slippage. Certainly, there are allegations that such is happening. We need to put resources into establishing what is self-employment and PAYE, when it is appropriate to fall into one category rather than the other and so on. We need to determine whether there is bogus self-employment in the industry. The Screen Industry Education Forum was good, but was any PAYE worker or trainee at it? As Deputy Pearse Doherty reminded us, one of the 11 recommendations was for a stakeholder industry forum. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has indicated in principle that she is willing to take that recommendation. It has to happen in order that we can get the various groups together to air these issues and thrash them out. The whole industry will thrive and we will all be happy to put more money into it on the basis that we have clearly defined rules about what employment and training should look like. We will get buy-in from all stakeholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome that. I am not saying that there cannot be oversights. Of course there can be. People can make mistakes and there sometimes are grey areas. We are discussing quality employment. The majority of the employment in the companies that receive this relief should be direct PAYE employment. Of course it is reasonable and legitimate to employ some contractors or people on a freelance or self-employed basis, but if they comprise the vast majority and there are hardly any PAYE employees with continuity of employment and so on, then there is something wrong with the balance. This is something that the Government has acknowledged in terms of bogus self-employment in areas like construction. In RTÉ, for example, 50 people were found to have been wrongly classified as contractors when they were actually employed by RTÉ. I appeal for us to examine this matter closely and find out who the employees in the industry are. It is a simple question. Who are the registered trainees? How long have they been trainees? That means that we will have to have a defined training period, by the way. At what point does someone cease to become a trainee and become qualified in a particular grade? Can we have a register of all the people who are qualified? Can we have a register of all the people who are employees in the various grades so that we know who the employees in the industry actually are? We can then work out whether there is fairness in terms of the allocation of employment, compliance with employment law and so on. These are basic elements and reasonable requests. That is why I am asking for there to be a study. I am not doing this to be flippant. However this amendment goes when I press it, I acknowledge the Minister is taking the issue seriously. I would like us to examine it comprehensively, set out all of the facts and establish what the playing field is in a fair way that sees the genuine buy-in by and involvement of all stakeholders in putting that picture together.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought the Minister could speak again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought he would get to respond. I would be happy to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
