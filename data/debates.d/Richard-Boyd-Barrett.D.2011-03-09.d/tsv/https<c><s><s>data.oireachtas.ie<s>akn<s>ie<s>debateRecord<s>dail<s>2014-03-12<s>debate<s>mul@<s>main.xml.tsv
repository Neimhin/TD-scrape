RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For two and a half years I, and others, have been appealing to the Government to acknowledge the fact that we have a housing emergency in this country and that it needs to take emergency measures to deal with it. One aspect of that is the promised delivery of social housing units from NAMA. Could the Minister tell us how many social housing units we are getting from NAMA? The delivery seems to be pathetic. I want to hear some good news from the Government that we will get serious delivery from NAMA of desperately needed social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for her answer but when one wades through those figures-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, and I appreciate the Minister of State's giving them to me, but when one wades through them, we have got 596 units out of a promised 4,300.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only 496 have been delivered. Others may be in the pipeline or approved as suitable but, given the fact that NAMA has this enormous property portfolio, this is pathetic, particularly against the backdrop of 96,000 families languishing on housing lists for, in many cases, over a decade. Is the Government on top of what NAMA is doing? At the weekend we discovered that much of this portfolio is being sold out to property speculators such as Lone Star. Has NAMA delivered such a pathetic amount of social housing because we have made a decision to sell off all this property, which we need, to property speculators such as Lone Star?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Much seems to centre on what NAMA puts forward as suitable. I take the point about properties in the middle of nowhere being of little use to anybody on the housing lists but is NAMA holding back the good properties because it wants to flog them off to speculators such as Lone Star, Apollo or Kennedy Wilson, which we have recently discovered are in the process of bidding for or buying up these massive property portfolios? They get the good, quality buildings and NAMA offers the rubbish it cannot flog to these speculators to local authorities. It would be a supreme irony if, on the back of a massive crisis caused by property speculators, we handed over this property to another gang of speculators while tens of thousands of families, who could use those homes, languish on housing lists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I and many others have previously made clear, people are in dire straits. I refer to those who are on the housing lists, those who are being pushed into homelessness and out onto our streets, those who couch surf and those who live in desperately overcrowded conditions with other family members. These people have no possibility of getting a secure roof over their heads. It is not an exaggeration to state that we are facing into the worst crisis relating to social housing and homelessness in the history of the State. This crisis is the result of a catastrophic failure on the part of the previous Government, in the first instance, and it is being compounded by policy failures on the part of the current Administration. The stakes could not be higher. There are many important issues with which society must deal. If, however, a family does not have a roof over their heads, they cannot function properly within society. How can one pursue educational opportunities, access employment, maintain one's mental health or avoid developing drugs or drink problems if one does not have a secure roof over one's head? It is the most basic consideration and if the Government cannot deliver this for its citizens, then it is unworthy of the name. The previous Government completely destroyed the economy because - quite disgracefully - it treated housing as a commodity for speculation and to enrich its friends in the banks and the property sector. As the Minister of State said, that is what caused the crisis. The current Administration, however, has compounded the problem at every single turn. This debate is taking place three years too late, and tens of thousands of families are paying the price of the Government's failure to address this most serious issue as a matter of urgency. Everything to which I refer has happened in the aftermath of a period in which we built the largest number of houses ever in the history of the State. We are faced with the greatest crisis relating to homelessness and social housing since the foundation of the State following its biggest ever building boom. This does not add up. There are more empty houses throughout the country than has ever been the case but we are faced with the crisis to which I refer. In July 2012, with some 100,000 people on the housing list, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government stated it would no longer be directly providing and building council housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department issued a policy document in July 2012 in which it was stated that direct provision of newly built social housing was being brought to an end and that it would in future rely on leasing arrangements with the private sector. At the same time, rent allowance supports and caps were reduced.I remember the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, promising us in this House that this would not cause problems or lead to homelessness and that, in fact, it would lead to a reduction in rents. I plead with the Minister of State to put up her hands and say she got it wrong because the exact opposite happened. Rents went through the roof and homelessness followed directly as a result of the reduction in the rent caps and this is still happening. I recall the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, saying to me that no one would be made homeless as a result of the Government's policies. On three occasions I have brought families to the House, including as recently as last week, who have been made homeless or who will be made homeless this week because of the reduction in the rent caps against a background of rising rents. The landlords simply say they are sorry but the rent is going up. The rent allowance community welfare officers will not vary the rent caps and people are evicted. Then, they must go to emergency homeless services and they are put in hotels or hostels on the other side of the city. They have to drag children across the city to schools and some cannot get to schools. They cannot function and they do not know from day to day where they will be sleeping. It is an extraordinary situation and it is getting worse. Deputy O'Brien is perfectly right. Fully 80% of cases that come to my clinic relate to people facing homelessness in dire situations and I know it is the same for Deputy Catherine Murphy. Some will be 17 years on a housing list. I have before me a case study. Noleen from Wicklow was renting a house for €900 per month. The landlord increased the rent to €1,300 and the reason given was household charges. She ended up in a hostel with her four children. She now has a house on the rental accommodation scheme but the landlord refuses to do repairs and the council maintain it is up to the landlord to do such repairs. She has been told she will be 17 years on the list before she gets a house. What will the Minister of State do? We need direct build of council houses. The Government must vary rent caps in the interim to ensure people are not made homeless; otherwise, all words are useless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was done by Fine Gael.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no doubt that Gateway is a blueshirt fantasy. Those in Fine Gael must be becoming terribly excited about the prospect of forcing people to work for next to nothing. They probably dreamed about this for years but never thought they could get away with it. Suddenly, however, they have their opportunity. They are going to displace real, proper, permanent, secure, well-paid and trade-union supported jobs with what effectively is slave labour. People are going to be dragooned into doing work which desperately needs to be done. There is no doubt about the latter because how could we not need individuals to work for local authorities whose staffing complements have been drastically reduced in recent years? In that context, 20% of the workforce of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been axed as a result of the prevailing policy of austerity. There is a desperate need for maintenance work to be done on people's council houses, for repairs to be made to roads, for parks to be cleaned up, for graffiti to be removed, for bins to be emptied and for flood relief works to be carried out. There are construction workers and hundreds of other people in every area who would be more than willing to do this work but they should be paid for doing it. These individuals should not be enslaved and forced to do the work to which I refer on the cheap. What the Government proposes to do is completely outrageous. One would expect this from the blueshirts because they would probably confine all of us to boot camps if they got the opportunity. However, for the Labour Party to have anything to do with what is proposed - particularly in light of its historic relationship with the trade union movement - is simply beyond belief. Essentially, the Labour Party is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel in order to undermine proper jobs and facilitate both job displacement and what effectively is slave labour. That is an absolute disgrace.
