            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_3">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">Further to my response on this subject on 12 April, I have recently written to party leaders regarding the re-establishment of the Oireachtas consultation group in relation to the commemorative programme for the centenary anniversaries in the period to 2016. Subject to the responses received, I hope the group will be re-established in the coming weeks. I am aware of the keen interest in the Oireachtas and of members of the public in the development of the commemorative programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">In addition to the centenary programme, commemorations of other notable events will be organised or assisted by my Department. These include the annual Great Famine commemoration in May by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the annual Daniel O'Connell commemoration in May in association with the Glasnevin Trust and the annual July Somme commemoration in association with the Royal British Legion. Prominent among the possibilities under consideration are the centenary of the <i>Titanic</i> voyage in 2012 and the millennium of the Battle of Clontarf in 2014. I would be grateful to receive suggestions from Deputies with regard to other occasions of national significance they would recommend for consideration.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_6">The Department of the Taoiseach is, by and large, the lead Department for commemorations. A significant distinction has been drawn between permanent State commemorations such as that at Arbour Hill and once-off programmes such as the Famine and 1798 commemorations. Our commemorations have been successful because they have not been partisan or tribal but have commemorated broad national movements. I am sure it is the Taoiseach's intention to maintain this policy and approach. The 1916 and National Day of Commemoration events are valuable. Recent events have demonstrated the significant degree of public interest and engagement in such commemorations. The 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising is a good illustration of such interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">My party has received correspondence from the Taoiseach on nominees for the consultation group. We have made a decision in the matter which we will forward to the Taoiseach. Has he considered the possibility of handing over responsibility for the entire commemoration agenda to the Oireachtas for it to work and deliberate on?</p>
            <p eId="para_8">I do not propose to comment on the millennium of the Battle of Clontarf other than to suggest Deputy Finian McGrath will have an informed perspective on ongoing battles in Clontarf.</p>

            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_9">The Deputy is welcome to Clontarf any time.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">I confirm to Deputy Martin that it is the Government's intention and the intention of my Department that these commemorations should first be discussed in a broad sense, should be sensitive and should be co-operative, where that is appropriate. I look forward to receiving responses from other party leaders as to who they wish to nominate to the consultative group. I assure the Deputy it will be as broad and generous as can be. I have no particular aversion to Deputy Finian McGrath, himself a well-known veteran of battles of Clontarf, being able to assist in respect of renewed energy in 2014 and I shall convey the Deputy's interest in that regard to him.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_11">It has been mentioned previously in the House that because of the sensitive nature of some of the aforementioned commemorations in the context of an all-island dimension, interests from Northern Ireland should be involved in the consideration of how to go about commemorating a number of significant events in the history of the island, the anniversaries of which are falling due. Contact should be made, perhaps through the Oireachtas consultation committee and other means, with a variety of interests from different traditions on the island of Ireland to have their input on the shape and design of such commemorations. For example, the centenary of the <i>Titanic</i> offers a useful opportunity for an all-island approach.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_12">Yes, I will give consideration to an appropriate appointment in respect of Northern Ireland. Obviously, the Ulster centenary committee consultation report was published and there were invitations to be associated with that. There may be a number of commemorations in which there might be a genuine willingness to have a joint commemoration and were that the case, that is fair enough. Others may seek individual commemorations to take place in a different way but the Government will take on board all the points from the different parties in the hope of putting together a series of appropriate, relevant and sensitively arranged commemoratives ceremonies. I believe that covers the point raised by the Deputy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
            <p eId="para_13">Fáiltím roimh ath-eagrú choiste an Oireachtais do chomóraithe stairiúla chun comóradh céad bliana a dhéanamh ar féin rialú a bhaint amach. Tá mé an-sásta leis sin agus fuair mé litir an Taoisigh maidir leis. Tá a fhios againn, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil an gnó sin fós le baint amach. I welcome the re-establishment of the Oireachtas consultation group on centenary commemorations. I seek further detail on what form the consultations to which the Taoiseach referred will take. Will this be truly national? Will there be an all-island or all-Ireland input? Will such events include the Ulster Covenant of 1912, the 1913 lockout in Dublin and Waterford or the Proclamation yet to be achieved? Will the Taoiseach raise these matters with the First and deputy First Ministers?</p>
            <p eId="para_14">I am sure the Taoiseach will have noted that the elections have just taken place in the North and will wish to join in commending all the parties, the Sinn Féin party in particular, on their success in that area. Will the Taoiseach put in place arrangements to involve representatives from the Assembly, civic society and the diaspora in the consultation group? It is not enough simply to commemorate all these events. Many of them were glorious failures or defeats. At some time, someone will commemorate the bailout——</p>

As the Deputy said when he asked me the question whether there would be all-Ireland representation, he has not been behind the fence, at least on this occasion, in saying he represents an all-Ireland party. On the last occasion the previous Taoiseach nominated the Minister for Defence as chairman of the consultation group which included Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, the new Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Joe Costello of the Labour Party, Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh from Sinn Féin and Deputy Michael Lowry as an Independent. At the time the Green Party was satisfied that the Minister for Defence would ably represent its views on the consultation group. From that point of view, all of the issues raised by Deputy Gerry Adams and the range of incidents or events that should be commemorated can be discussed by the consultation group. We put in place a strategy to deal with this. On the last occasion, when dealing with the restoration of the <i>Asgard</i>, renovations at Arbour Hill and Glasnevin, the refurbishment of St. Enda’s Park and the Military Archives, there was a co-ordinated, full and generous response from the members of the consultation group. I hope those nominated on this occasion will do the same in respect of the many events that have to be commemorated in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">To answer the Deputy's question, quite a number of personnel are on each of the Cabinet sub-committees, depending on the range of subjects they follow. The Deputy will receive the list when it is circulated. The issues to be discussed are not for discussion here because they carry the same level of confidentiality as Cabinet meetings, but, in general, the sub-committees will focus on individual sectors to enable more focused or concentrated discussion of particular issues by the relevant Ministers. Conclusions arrived at by the Cabinet committees are then brought before Cabinet for final approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">When the Deputy sees the full list and the range of personnel thereon he will see that there is clearly significant representation from different Ministries, as there should be, on the Cabinet committees we have set up.</p>

Each Cabinet committee draws on particular personnel depending on the matter under discussion. The economic management council, which has met 12 times to date, deals with the main agenda of economic issues that go through for discussion and conclusion by the Cabinet in its plenary meetings. From that point of view, the decisions of the Cabinet are a matter for discussion here. These decisions become public and Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to debate them and put their views for or against as the case may be. It is a matter of streamlining the main areas of economic discussion that need to be attended to rather than having these issues deliberated upon in open session <i>ad nauseam</i> at Cabinet. The economic management council can bring a greater focus on these issues, after which they can go back to the Cabinet for final decision in a shorter time.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">In the past, sections dealing with the public service, economics and infrastructure had an independent existence within the Department of the Taoiseach independent of servicing a Cabinet committee. I wish to clarify that this remains the case. I am concerned that the Standing Orders of the House may allow a situation to develop in which the Taoiseach would not have to answer questions about the general work of his Department under those headings. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that he does not intend that to be the case and that the work of his Department will not be hidden behind Cabinet confidentiality.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">I have raised in the Dáil on a number of occasions the fact that Ministers and spokespersons have been able to make detailed statements about the agendas of the Cabinet and its sub-committees. For example, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, briefed newspapers about the agenda of the economic infrastructure sub-committee. I ask this basic question: Why should the Dáil be limited by Cabinet confidentiality in what it can discuss while no such limit is placed on Ministers and advisers in regard to the agenda and issues to be discussed by these committees?</p>

            <p eId="para_54">There is no change in the situation. As the Deputy is aware, Article 28.4.3° of the Constitution refers deliberately and specifically to Cabinet committees. For example, it states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_55">The confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter — (i) in the interests of the administration of justice by a Court, or (ii) by virtue of an overriding public interest, pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter...</p>

We did not give consideration to a specific committee on health. The Minister is very occupied on this. In any event, as the Deputy will be well aware, to find the time to convene and chair committee meetings dealing with a broad range of issues is an adventure in itself.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_77">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">The forthcoming visit of President Obama will be an historic occasion for Ireland and a very significant event celebrating the strong ties between the peoples of Ireland and the United States. I know he will receive a very warm welcome to our shores.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">Plans for the President's visit are currently nearing finalisation. Consultation with officials in the US Embassy and the White House are ongoing and senior US officials will travel to Dublin in the coming days to agree the final details. The programme will include a meeting with President McAleese in Áras an Uactharáin and a bilateral meeting with myself. It is also expected that President Obama will pay a visit to Moneygall and that he will make a public address at an event in Dublin city.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">The public address in Dublin will be part of a major entertainment event. The programme and the venue have yet to be confirmed. Entrance will be free of charge with tickets available to the general public and it will be designed as a welcome to the President and the First Lady of the US.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">Organising an event on this scale will involve working closely with many public agencies as well as businesses and citizens. I appreciate that people will experience some disruption as a consequence and I want to thank everyone who will be affected both for their patience and their forbearance. This is an historic opportunity to put our capital and our people on view to a potentially huge audience around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">The full details of the overall programme will be finalised and announced as soon as they are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">I expect that I will discuss a range of issues with President Obama during the course of his visit and I will emphasise how much the Irish people value our relationship and the enduring friendship with the United States. It is likely that our discussions will also cover the global economic situation and Ireland's determination to overcome the difficulties that we face. I will be stressing that we are open for business and will emphasise the many advantages to doing business here in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">The President's visit comes just after the historic visit of Queen Elizabeth. It is anticipated that up to 1,000 international media representatives will cover both visits. Taken together these visits will highlight Ireland and its people and will instil confidence and hope in a brighter future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_85">That is not an answer of any great detail. Given that the visit is imminent, I would have expected a little more in the Taoiseach's reply. Does the Taoiseach intend to give the House the full schedule of events when he receives them?</p>
            <p eId="para_86">While he dealt a little bit with the content of some of the discussions he intends to have with the US President, Mr. Obama, he was somewhat silent on several other issues. Will he enlighten us as to whether he intends to ask if it is the US President's intention to implement initiatives for undocumented immigrants in the United States, many of whom are Irish? Does the Taoiseach intend to fight their corner?</p>
            <p eId="para_87">In light of the assassination of Osama bin Laden in the past week, will the Taoiseach raise the issue of the incursion of the United States into Pakistan? Will the Taoiseach ask the President if it is US policy to act as judge, juror and executioner of those accused of such crimes or whether it would be better off to leave these matters come to trial?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_42">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_88">I cannot give Deputy Clare Daly any more details of the plans around Mr. Obama's visit to Ireland because I do not have them. When the American President pays a visit to any country, members of his Administration travel there beforehand to discuss with the authorities the actual detail of where the President, and in the case of this visit to Ireland the First Lady, will travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">The event to be held in Dublin city centre has not yet been agreed because the US personnel involved must look at the sites in question and give their views on the range and extent of the numbers which might turn up. Accordingly, I cannot give the Deputy the finalised detail because it has not yet been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">I raised the matter of the undocumented Irish with the President and his Administration in the White House on St. Patrick's Day. As Deputy Clare Daly is aware, politics in Washington has changed with the Democratic Party in control of the US Senate while the Republican Party now has control of the House of Representatives. Accordingly, the much sought after comprehensive legislation to deal with immigration in the US will not happen in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Arising from recent events, however, a package of enforcement measures concerning homeland security in the US may have to be brought forward soon. If that were the case, the process will begin in Congress which will make a swathe through it.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">The appropriate time to make an amendment to that would be some time during that process and the appropriate amendment would be, in Ireland's case, to seek access to the E3 visa system, which is a renewable visa system. This would provide some relief and release of pressure in respect of undocumented Irish people. Senator Schumer from New York will be the author of whatever documentation goes through that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">When in New York last week, I met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, which is well aware of the process by which legislation and amendments in that regard go through Congress and the Senate. In that regard, Senator Schumer is in a powerful position. He has much contact with the Irish community and as such is well aware of the extent of the problem. Given the scale of this problem in the United States, of which the Deputy is aware, the legislators are encountering difficulties in terms of putting through Bills that would give legislative effect to comprehensive reform. I met a number of undocumented Irish people, some of whom have been in the United States since before 9/11 and have a degree of difficulty. They are members of the community who pay their social security and taxes and who, in most cases, have families and businesses they look after but they are undocumented, a position not dissimilar to that of many other nationalities. Those experiencing problems range from people who recently went to the United States and have over-stayed their welcome to those who have been there for much longer periods and are also having difficulties. In that regard, the Deputy can take it the Government is focused on this issue and that on each occasion a Minister or Minister of State goes to the United States he or she will seek to build up relationships on behalf of the Government and, therefore, the people of Ireland with Democratic and Republican personnel. Whatever change has to be made will have to go through Congress and the Senate and this will require connections and discussions on a regular basis.</p>

We still cannot get a straight answer as to whether this is the case. Given those reports and the growing number of experts and commentators internationally and domestically who are saying that our economy is ruined, the constant protestations of Ministers that they have no money for anything because we are in the straitjacket of the IMF and that the much vaunted jobs budget, now a jobs initiative which will be fiscally neutral, is looking certain to be a damp squib to beat all damp squibs because we are not allowed——</p>

Would he agree that the visit is not just about the issues to which I have alluded? Does he agree that we should not forget that in addition to the thousands of jobs Irish people create in the United States and that United States companies create in Ireland, the United States is a very important market, which is repeatedly in the top three in terms of US citizens buying goods and services that are manufactured by Irish manufacturers as well as services produced by Irish people? In that economic context, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure, if he can, that the US-Ireland research programme which is substantial and an area to which President Obama gives high priority in his own economic renewal programme, gets due recognition during this visit, and that some facilitation of this could be organised around the visit.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">I thank Deputy Martin for his comments. I agree this is a very important visit in its own right and it gives Ireland the opportunity to present itself as being a traditional friend of the United States, with many links through social, cultural, political and business activities. For example, I hope to have the opportunity to open the €300 million extension to the Coca Cola plant in Wexford before too long, Intel is spending €500 million on an expansion of its plant at Leixlip and there was the announcement yesterday of the joining of Elan and Alkermes in respect of the siting of the new Alkermes headquarters in Athlone.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">I met quite a number of business and investment interests in New York last week and was enthused by their dedication and commitment to this country. Some results will come from that in the time ahead. This is a critical market for Ireland and the extent of trade, as the Deputy is aware, that crosses the Atlantic either way between Europe and the United States, including between Ireland and the United States, is very extensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">I will ensure that there is appropriate reference to the US-Ireland research programme. I am aware of its activities over the years and know it played an important part in keeping Ireland up there in terms of awareness when times were not so good. It is an important element of the professional connection between our two countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">Nuair a bhí an Taoiseach sa Teach Bán, bhí an tUachtarán Obama ag caint faoi fear gorm as na Stáit Aontaithe darbh ainm Frederick Douglass. Frederick Douglass was an escaped slave, a freedom fighter and a human rights activist in the USA. During the St. Patrick's day visit event for the Taoiseach hosted by President Obama, the President spoke about Frederick Douglass, who came to Ireland in 1845 and was described as the black O'Connell of America. There are plans to unveil a statue to this activist in Cork and there is a request that President Obama would perform that ceremony. Given the Taoiseach said the final details have not been agreed, will he tell us whether this is part of the consideration?</p>
            <p eId="para_145">One of the reasons this man came into such public consciousness was not just because of his life's work but because he published a book, <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</i>, which the Taoiseach may be interested to know will be republished and launched this Thursday in Glasnevin Cemetery museum.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">As I understand it, President Obama will not visit Cork on this occasion. I am aware of his interest in Frederick Douglass and of Mr. Douglass's life and times. I had the opportunity when I was at the White House to present to President Obama a book in respect of Daniel O'Connell detailing references to Frederick Douglass. In fact, President Obama referred to people from Ireland who had received Congressional medals of honour for various deeds of valour, including one John King from Ballinrobe, a bust of whom was unveiled by Senator Chris Dodd last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">With regard to the life and times of Frederick Douglass, I made the point to White House staff and to President Obama that the waters that divide us as countries were those that brought the Africans to the United States for slavery purposes and the Irish to that country for freedom. On St. Patrick's Day, remembering St. Patrick, too, was a slave, President Obama showed he fully understood the history his own people endured. He might have liked to have been able to go to University College Cork on this occasion but his schedule does not permit it. One hopes in the years ahead there will be other opportunities for the President to return to Ireland.</p>

     if, in view of her recent press briefings regarding projected spending for 2011, she is alleging that false assumptions were made; and if she will detail the nature and extent of same.

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_116">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_178">The Revised Estimates volume, published by the previous Government in February, provides for total expenditure on social welfare schemes and services of €20.615 billion in 2011. This sum incorporates the effect of a range of savings measures announced in budget 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">The estimate for jobseekers' payments contained in the Revised Estimates volume was based on a weekly average live register of 405,000 in 2011. If current trends continue, the live register will outturn at an average higher than provided for in the Estimate. If this turns out to be the case, additional expenditure over and above that provided will be incurred. The weekly average live register in the year to date has been 441,482. The jobs initiative announced today will play an important role in getting people back to work or into education, training and internship and off the live register, so it is too early to quantify any overspend.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">The social welfare package in budget 2011 was designed to achieve total savings of €873 million. The measures included reductions in weekly rates of payment for all working age recipients and in monthly child benefit. Savings were also to be achieved through the continuation of spending restrictions under the treatment benefits scheme, administrative savings and a range of activation measures. Budget 2011 also provided for €30 million in savings through achieving efficiencies in the electricity and telecoms elements of the household benefits package. My officials are currently in discussions with the relevant providers with a view to achieving these savings. Savings of €60 million in the rent supplement scheme were also included in the budget figures. However, no specific measures were decided upon to achieve €50 million, or in that region, of this saving.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">In addition, it was announced that approximately €49 million would be saved through various other measures. No measures were publicly announced. However, this €49 million was allocated across a range of schemes, with specific amounts deducted on a scheme by scheme basis, in both the Estimates published on budget day and the subsequent Revised Estimates volume, both of which were approved by the previous Government. It is my understanding from my officials that the then Minister intended to bring forward a range of measures to achieve these savings in the context of an early social welfare Bill. However, events overtook this.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">My colleagues and I are currently considering the issues and options arising in the context of the financial targets set in budget 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">Further to her answer, will the Minister outline whether in the context of the overall spend of her Department throughout the year on these demand-led initiatives the figures provided are those of her officials? Are they based on the normal assumptions such as the projected growth rates and unemployment predictions etc. for demand led schemes? Will the Minister confirm that provision has been made this year, as it is any other year, for a supplementary allowance to be made available in the event that when the figures crystalise there is an underspend?</p>

            <p eId="para_186">As I recall, the former Minister was Deputy Ó Cuív and the Government was made up of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. The critical issue was the provision in the Estimates for an expectation of 405,000 people on average to be on the register during 2011. As I stated, for the year to date the weekly average live register has been 441,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">Later today, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will announce a series of jobs initiatives and measures which we hope will reduce the number of people on the live register. However, those are the figures and the previous Government factored in an assumption of 405,000 which turned out to be significantly different to the experience to date in 2011.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_121">
            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_188">I am somewhat puzzled. The officials available to the previous Minister were the same as those available to the current Minister. The figures are those of the Minister's officials. The supplementary provision is in place as always. If the provision is to be out by 1% in the context of a €20 billion budget, then why, on the basis of those two points, this extraordinary, cynical, politically motivated comment that the figures are massaged? When the Minister makes such commentary, as per the recent <i>Sunday Business Post</i> article on 24 April, she alleges that a false projection has been portrayed by the Minister’s officials.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_122" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_189">The reality is that when I came into the Department, the Department's estimates, which were the estimates of the previous Minister in the Department and the Minister for Finance in the previous Government, projected an unemployment figure of 405,000 in 2011. The actual figure has turned out to be 441,000 on average in the year to date. This is the major reason for the difference. The second reason is that savings were targeted across a series of headings amounting to €49 million and were provided for in the departmental Estimates but not announced. In addition, savings were targeted which were the subject of announcements in respect of savings in the rent supplement scheme. How €50 million of the €60 million savings would be found was not identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">I understand the previous Minister intended to bring forward detailed proposals of these estimates. The previous Minister signed off all these estimates and measures as did the previous Government. The previous Minister intended to bring forward these measures but events, in the shape of the general election and a change of Government, overtook what the Minister, presumably, intended to do.</p>

    <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>

     the steps she will take to ensure that Tús serves as an effective activation measure and to ensure the most suitable people are selected for participation in Tús.

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_192">The then Minister for Finance announced the introduction of a community work placement initiative for up to 5,000 people in the Budget Statement to Dáil Éireann on 7 December 2010. The initiative, known as Tús, was launched on 21 December 2010 and work on developing the necessary implementation structures has been underway since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">Tús will provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those unemployed for more than one year. The work placements will be offered by the not-for-profit, community and voluntary sectors. The initiative will contribute to the range of activation measures being developed by the Government. It is different to other initiatives such as community employment, in that it does not have compulsory training or progression elements. Its focus is on providing those unemployed for more than one year with a work placement opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">The initiative will be delivered locally by each local development company and by Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas. Some €30 million has been provided in my Department's Estimates in 2011 to fund the rollout of the initiative. Following the launch, my Department conducted two successful trials to develop the delivery mechanisms for Tús. One trial was based in the Coolock area of Dublin and run by the Northside Partnership with the other based in Mullingar, County Westmeath. A total of 119 people were randomly selected from the live register and offered the opportunity to participate. The results of both trials have been evaluated and have informed the development of the initiative. Internal procedures for the selection of people to participate have been finalised and are being issued to local office managers and staff to enable the selection of participants to commence in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">Promotion of Tús to potential work placement providers has been underway for some weeks as part of a process of identifying suitable work placements. Local development companies are currently recruiting supervisory staff which will provide for a phased rollout during the coming months with the full 5,000 placements to be made available by the end of quarter one, 2012. The target is to have 1,000 of these placements filled by the end of June.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_196">The Minister is aware that the scheme is not voluntary and, in its current guise, people will be forced to participate for fear of losing their jobs. A wide range of community employers are set to participate. However, is it really acceptable to force people to work in this way especially when there are scores of people who would be very keen to apply or avail of the opportunity? For example, some of these employers work with children and vulnerable adults. Have we learnt nothing from the major child protection investigations or the media exposure of elder abuse?</p>
            <p eId="para_197">Would the Minister not agree that jobseekers should be entitled to apply for a place in Tús or, at a minimum, that a profile should be created? The Minister referred to the selection procedure. However, a profile could be created for each person on the dole which could then inform the selection of appropriate candidates. Will the Minister make these changes? If not, how will the Department ensure the appropriate people are selected if it has no profile of people on the live register? When will the guidelines governing the selection to which the Minister referred be produced and circulated to the partnership groups? Are they available to Deputies to determine whether they stand up to the required scrutiny?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_198">I refer to the selection of people for this initiative. The only detailed information I have is the response to the two pilot studies that were undertaken. The Deputy might be interested to know that of 119 people, 100 of them, or 84%, replied to the invitation to participate. Only one person left the live register and 71% of those contacted expressed an interest in participating. This confirms what we all know: the vast majority of people on the live register are anxious to participate in work or education. This is designed to assist those who have been more than a year on the live register to do that. Of those people, 58 were deemed suitable for placement immediately, 13 people did not show up for interview when called and 28 were deemed, as we would expect, to be more in need of educational assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">This is an opportunity. It does not impact on the existing CE places, or on other schemes managed by the Department. It is an additional initiative of 5,000 places. I have met many of the companies and there is a serious level of interest. This is an opportunity for a one year placement with the same sort of top-up that applies in CE. Interviews are being carried out for supervisors and the interest shown so far is very positive.</p>

            <p eId="para_201">The scheme, as I inherited it, and provided for in the budget for this year, has an expenditure of €30 million. That makes provision for both the employment supervisors and for a top-up of €20 per week. I wish our financial circumstances allowed for a greater level but within the constraints of the budget that is all that has been made available. I am, however, encouraged by the level of interest and positivity that has been shown by individuals and by organisations.</p>

     the specific cuts to child benefits, disability allowances and other social welfare payments signalled in the draft deal with the EU-IMF and in view of the latest research which indicates that 620,000 persons or 14.1% of the population are already at risk of poverty and the expert belief that this figure would be much higher if it were not for social welfare payments; and the way she will implement further cuts while simultaneously attaining the target set out in the current national agreement Towards 2016 of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_203">The challenge for this new Government is unlike any faced before. The priority of this Government is to get our economy moving, restore confidence, fix our banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs. The success of our economic plans will lay the foundation for the rest of our agenda for change and the jobs initiative being announced today is the first step in this regard.  It is important to state that the most recent memorandum of understanding with the EU-ECB-IMF does not provide for specific cuts to child benefits, disability allowances and other social welfare payments. The overall aim of the memorandum is to ensure that public finances are sustainable and, to this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy. This will impact on current expenditure across all Departments, including the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">The Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair and balanced and which recognises the need for social solidarity. This is explicitly reflected in the commitment in the programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">I am fully aware of the key role the payments made by the Department play in the social and economic life of this country and in preventing poverty. This is illustrated in the annual survey on income and living conditions carried out by the Central Statistics Office. The latest available report shows that in 2009, more than 91% of the average gross household income of households in the lowest income decile was made up of social transfers. The percentage of gross household income made up of social transfers remained above 50% up to and including the fourth decile where 65% of gross household income was made up of social transfers. In addition to reducing poverty, these social transfers enable households to purchase goods and services in the local economy thereby sustaining jobs and economic activity at a higher level than would otherwise be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">While the payments made by my Department have these very positive economic and social effects, there is an ongoing necessity to curtail expenditure in 2012 and in later years. This is necessary for many reasons, not least so that we can continue to make social welfare payments at appropriate levels, sustaining social cohesion and treating people with dignity. Any changes to the wide range of schemes and services operated by my Department will be considered in a budgetary context later this year. This consideration will be informed by the comprehensive review of expenditure currently under way, which will be completed by September.</p>

            <p eId="para_209">New research by Social Justice Ireland shows that poverty in Ireland is at an all time high. Since 1987 the income of the top 10% high earners has increased to the detriment of the least well off in society. One in ten children now lives in consistent poverty, a scandalous figure. That figure increased by half last year under the Fianna Fáil Government, largely as a result of its social protection policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">When the Minister was on the Opposition benches, she spoke about eliminating poverty by 2016. The elimination of poverty is about increasing welfare payments for the least well off, but it starts with not reducing those payments any further. I listened intently to the Deputy in opposition when she was an advocate for the less well off. I would like her to stand by that now for the sake of those worst affected by the economic downturn who are suffering horrendously on social welfare so at the very least, their income will not be further reduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_216">The most important anti-poverty strategy the country has ever had will be to get people who are unemployed through no fault of their own back into a job. There are those in every town and village in Ireland who never expected or wished to be unemployed but who have lost their jobs or businesses. The primary job of this Government is to ensure people get back to work. That is the strongest anti-poverty measure any Government can put in place.</p>

    <b>Deputy Barry Cowen</b>
     asked the 
    <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
     if she will elaborate on her recent comments that if persons object to a number of reasonable offers of employment, they could face having their payments cut; and if she will outline these new rates.

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_137" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_218">The jobseeker's schemes provide income support for people who are seeking their first job or have lost work and are seeking alternative employment. A fundamental qualifying condition for the jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">To satisfy this condition, it is necessary for the person to demonstrate that he or she has taken some positive action and is making genuine efforts to secure employment. If a person fails to satisfy this condition his or her claim will be disallowed. In addition, an unreasonable refusal to accept an offer of suitable employment may also lead to disallowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">A key objective of the Government is to offer a high level of appropriate employment support and to prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment. This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">The national employment action plan, NEAP, is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people. The national employment action plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">As one pillar of this overall approach, reduced rates were provided for by the previous Government in the Social Welfare Act 2010, which will encourage jobseekers to improve their skills to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. The intent of the reduced rates is to ensure compliance with the activation processes. Basically, there is a right to a payment but also a matching responsibility on the unemployed person to engage with the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">The reduced rates, which apply to personal jobseeker's payments, may be implemented where a jobseeker refuses an appropriate offer of training by an officer of my Department; refuses, or declines to avail of, an offer of training from FÁS; declines an intervention under the national employment action plan; does not attend NEAP meetings with a FÁS officer; drops out of the NEAP process.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">Additional information not given on the floor of the House:</p>
            <p eId="para_225">The relevant legislation provides safeguards for the social welfare recipient in terms of the reasonableness of the intervention being offered. In common with many social welfare provisions, the new measures allow for discretion on the part of a deciding officer, as an offer of training, education or employment must be viewed in the context of a person's circumstances. Where a customer has been subject to the reduced rate, the normal rate of payment will be restored from a current date when the person subsequently engages with the NEAP process or takes up offers of training that were made.</p>

            <p eId="para_226">I am glad the Minister supports this provision of the Social Welfare Act 2010. The Minister's briefing document states that administrative arrangements are currently being put in place with a view to introducing these rates very shortly. What is meant by "very shortly"? When will she make an announcement on this? This legislation was enacted in 2010 and arrangements are being put in place. It is up to the Minister to decide on these rates, when they are to be introduced and how it will work.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">With regard to the first part of his question the relevant legislation came into force in January 2011. However, for operational reasons the application of the provisions commenced in April 2011. I understand that currently a very small number of claimants are subject to the provisions. The number of people who have been affected so far amounts to seven. I remind the Deputy that people are made reasonable offers with regard to a placement, training or education or engagement with the process. The Department is seeking to assist people to become active in a sphere of appropriate interest to them. In the case of a person who fails to engage or to respond, the claimant's personal rate for the jobseeker's allowance will reduced from the full rate of €188. The Act made provision for the rate to be reduced by €44 and in the case of supplementary welfare allowance by €42.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">Yes, the rates were established by the previous Minister when the legislation was introduced. I wish to be clear on this matter. The vast majority of people who are registered as unemployed are anxious to find work and to return to work. However, it is equally important that, for instance, a very young person does not regard being on social welfare as a lifetime option. It is not good for them nor for their children and it is usually not very good for their community.</p>

People have always raised the point about a one-stop-shop which would allow them go to one location to access the full range of their entitlements. The community welfare officers and the employment services division of FÁS will be integrated into my Department. In this way we can build a one-point of access service which is integrated. People will not be required to go to three different offices in pursuit of entitlements and signing the register will happen in tandem with thinking about how to get back into employment. This is the system in Scandinavia where there is no delay in offering back to work training or education. This is my vision for the Department and this is my work plan.</p>

    <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
     asked the 
    <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
     if she will amend the means test rules for disability allowance and secondary payments to extend eligibility for these to wards of the courts whose funds were depleted at an exceptional rate during the period of 2007 to 2009 while under the care of the State as to do so will go some way towards compensating the wards for the loss of units which cannot be recovered and which was outside of their control. 
    [10538/11]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_144" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_233">In determining entitlement to disability allowance, the social welfare code provides that the first €50,000 of capital is disregarded in the means assessment. Thereafter, weekly means are assessed at €1 per week for each €1,000 of capital between €50,000 and €60,000; at €2 per week for each €1,000 of capital between €60,000 and €70,000 and at €4 per week for each €1,000 of capital above €70,000. These arrangements are more generous than those which apply to other social assistance schemes in recognition of the fact that persons in receipt of disability allowance may not have had the opportunity to accumulate savings or other income through participation in employment and this disability may hamper a person's ability to live independently.</p>
            <p eId="para_234">The Deputy will be aware that funds which are held for the benefit of wards of court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service. These funds, which amounted to approximately €1.137 billion at 30 September 2010, are managed in a fiduciary capacity by the Courts Service on behalf of more than 18,000 beneficiaries, of whom some 2,300 are wards of court. It is my understanding that while court funds were impacted by the turbulence on world financial markets, particularly in 2008, very few actual losses were incurred in individual cases and that all funds have fully recovered to pre-financial crisis levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">Where the position of an individual has been impacted upon, it is open to that person, or his or her representatives, to apply for disability allowance or to have the level of payment reviewed in cases where he or she is already in receipt of the allowance.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_145">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_236">Wards of court are, by definition, vulnerable and the State owes them an enhanced duty of care. The State, through the Courts Service, is responsible for the administration and investment of funds which many wards of court depend on for their living expenses. The fund is not a realisable asset in the sense of a means test. At the beginning of the economic downturn these funds lost significant value and consequently the length of duration of the award. Considering their special status and the State's responsibility to them, I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality to compensate the wards of court for these losses in an effective manner. He has denied that the loss exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_237">The Minister, Deputy Burton, has repeated that denial to some degree by claiming that the value of all funds has since recovered. That is a misrepresentation of the facts, however, because units of the funds need to be sold when money is needed to make payments to wards of court. When the value of the funds decreased between 2007 and 2009, there was a dramatic increase in the number of units that had to be sold to generate the same income. That diminished the number of units in the funds at an exceptional rate and prohibited true recovery. As a result, the funds cannot possibly provide for wards of court for the duration that was originally intended.</p>
            <p eId="para_238">While I accept the Minister for Justice and Equality is directly responsible, I ask the Minister, Deputy Burton, to intervene by making a compensatory gesture to the adult wards of court on behalf of the State. I suggest she should make a disability payment available to them from now on. Such a payment would supplement and stretch their funds and thereby ensure they last for the intended period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_239">There is a precedent for looking for exceptions in means test rules. For example, compensation and awards, and the income arising from the investment of such moneys, are not taken into account when people in certain groups are means tested. I refer, for example, to those who contracted hepatitis C or HIV from blood products, to those with a disability arising from the thalidomide disaster, or to those who received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board. I ask the Minister to consider making a similar exception in the case of wards of court to compensate them on their losses. As such a measure would affect a small number of people, a major cost would not accrue to the State.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_146" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_240">Court funds that are held for the benefit of wards of court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service. Through its offices in the High, District and Circuit Courts, the service has responsibility for the management and investment of funds in court. The courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law and are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. It is not open to me as Minister to comment in any way on the operation of the courts. However, I want to point out that the Courts Service operates a fairly conservative investment policy. Despite the impact of the credit crisis, all funds have fully recovered to their levels before the financial crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_241">I reiterate that if a ward of court wishes to apply to the Department of Social Protection, he or she is welcome to do so. If a ward of court is at a financial loss and consequently qualifies for a higher rate of payment — or if he or she qualifies for disability allowance for the first time because his or her means have been reduced — the appropriate level of disability allowance will be paid to him or her. My Department is responsible for that aspect of the matter. As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts themselves are independent in the operation of their functions.</p>

    <b>Deputy Catherine Murphy</b>
     asked the 
    <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
     the average time it is taking to process carer’s allowance applications; the number of applications awaiting decision; if there is a plan to reduce delays; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
    [10413/11]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_147" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_243">The average time taken to award a claim for carer's allowance in the first quarter of 2011 was 12 weeks. A total of 3,815 applications were registered in the first quarter of 2011 and 3,883 were processed in the same period. Some 4,509 applications are awaiting a decision at present. Approximately 51,000 carer's allowance claims are in payment. I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation. It recently commenced a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer's allowance. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process reorganisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority. It involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department. This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times. I am pleased to say the modernisation project is on target. The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims will be processed under the new system from July. Although the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, individual claims may continue to take some time to process. Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_245">The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed with regard to the workload. The Department monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible. The action taken may include providing for flexibility in the application of staff resources in accordance with seasonal or temporary fluctuations in workload and using overtime where appropriate. The position is being kept under continuous review. In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet his or her needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, he or she can apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from his or her community welfare officer.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_148">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_246">My understanding of the monitoring of information systems is that when the term "business process reorganisation" is used, the entire process is thrown out and a new one is introduced. Is that what is taking place in this instance? The Minister suggested that there is an overlap between one processing system and another. The key issue is what the ideal time will be. That is one of the questions I have. I accept that if a person does not provide sufficient information, it is not possible for his or her claim to be dealt with within the ideal time. There can be variations. Does the Minister envisage that an ideal time for making a decision will be determined? She is aware that if one encounters uncertainty when leaving work to care for somebody with a sudden illness, it can take a long time for one to deal with such matters, which can be very stressful.</p>
            <p eId="para_247">It appears to me that the refusal rate is quite high. Having heard anecdotal evidence and discussed this with some of my Independent colleagues, it seems that there is a high level of success on appeal. Has the Minister examined that in her Department? Can she ascertain whether there is a variation between the approach to carer's allowance and the approach to other kinds of allowances provided by the Department?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_149" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_248">In 2010, the average time it took to award a claim for carer's allowance was eight weeks. Some 18,212 applications for carer's allowance were made and some 16,629 claims were processed in that year. The main reason for the deterioration in the processing time is that major modernisation work is ongoing. That work will be completed and the new system will be started by July of this year. My experience of the Department of Social Protection is that investment in the modernisation of information technology facilities achieves results such as improvements in processing times.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">The Deputy asked about levels of refusal. Some 16,574 new claims were received in 2009. Some 5,776 claims were refused in that year. That represented a refusal rate of 34.8%. As I said, some 18,212 new claims were made in 2010 and 6,972 were refused. That represented a refusal rate of 38.2%.</p>
            <p eId="para_250">One of the reasons for delays in processing all social welfare applications, including for carer's allowance, is the provision of insufficient or inaccurate information. As the Deputy noted, owing to changing circumstances people often make applications while under pressure and it may take time to obtain all the relevant information and present it properly. I am optimistic that when the new system is operational, we will be able to achieve the previous processing times and perhaps improve on them. The process would be facilitated if people had more complete information when they made an application.</p>

            <p eId="para_251">Does the Minister accept that greater use should be made of the review process as opposed to the excessively arduous appeals process? Many of those who apply for carer's allowance do not understand the documentation or the requirement to include details on the level of care they provide. Does the Minister agree that waiting times, especially for appeals, are unacceptably long across all schemes? I do not know if she is aware of today's missive from the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy Brendan Howlin, which indicates that the Department of Social Protection will be allocated an additional 22 staff by the end of the year. This figure does not take account of the transfer of community welfare officers from the Health Service Executive. Does the Minister agree that 22 additional staff will not be sufficient to address the delays in processing social welfare applications?</p>

If an appeal is successful, the relevant payment will be backdated to the date on which the application was submitted and the Exchequer will not make any savings. In many cases, people are being put through the wringer unnecessarily.</p>

            <p eId="para_254">I did not hear the announcement made today by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin. I accept that an additional 22 staff is small in the context of the number employed in the Department, which currently stands at approximately 5,000. However, since my appointment I have signed in nine additional appeals officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_255">We had a discussion previously at Question Time on the need for better quality information in processing applications and to use reviews rather than full appeals. Last week I met senior staff and many other employees in the appeals section, including inspectors and staff manning the telephones. I am aware that the section is of particular concern to Members. Given the condition of the economy, staff in the office must contend with providing testing and exacting services for members of the public. Nevertheless, everybody in the appeals structure is determined to give citizens the best possible service. As I indicated, the additional nine appeals officers should produce a significant improvement and reduce processing times.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_155" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_265">I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 45, 52, 57, 68, 168 and 191 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">The Minister for Finance announced the introduction of a community work placement initiative for up to 5,000 persons in the Budget Statement to Dáil Éireann on 7 December 2010. The initiative, known as Tús, was launched on 21 December 2010 and work on developing the necessary implementation structures has been under way since. The aim of Tús is to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than one year. Some €30 million has been provided in my Department's Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_267">Detailed conditions and rules to guide the operation of Tús have been developed with representatives of the local development companies and officials of my Department. These conditions and rules require that each local development company takes the necessary steps to guard against potential displacement of existing private or public sector service or worker displacements. Additionally, internal procedures for the selection of persons to participate have been developed and will be issued to local office managers and staff in the coming days. The random selection of participants by my Department will commence shortly as the necessary arrangements become operational at local development company level.</p>
            <p eId="para_268">Promotion of Tús to potential work placement providers has been under way for some weeks as part of a process of identifying suitable work placements and local development companies are recruiting supervisory staff. This includes engagement with a number of national sports organisations, including the GAA, in respect of games development and related activities. With respect to the latter, my Department will make detailed proposals in the coming days with a view to finalising arrangements to enable participants to avail of games development opportunities across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_269">There are a number of significant differences between the operation of Tús and the community employment programme. In the main, these differences relate to the programmes' aims, participant selection, delivery, duration of engagement and training requirements. The amount paid to participants on both programmes will be similar and participants will continue to maintain their entitlement to certain secondary benefits. Equally, participants will be required to work 19½ hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_270">Other than tasks related to training, Tús will not have a compulsory training element, although training opportunities may be available from the range of initiatives delivered by local development companies. Travel and out-of-pocket expenses will not be payable, although every effort will be made to ensure work placements are available close to a participant's home. The target is to have 1,000 placements filled by the end of June, with the remainder being filled over the course of the next year.</p>

          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_156">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_271">Is the Minister aware that circumstances may arise in which Tús participants will find themselves working alongside community employment scheme participants while enjoying fewer entitlements? Does she agree that this is unfair?</p>
            <p eId="para_272">Does the Minister agree that random selection may be a flawed approach in that, for example, persons without a background in sport could be sent to the GAA or the FAI to engage in sports training? The selection process needs to be reviewed. Will the Minister consider allowing those who qualify for the scheme by virtue of having been on the dole for one year to apply to be included in a panel for selection to participate in Tús?</p>
            <p eId="para_273">If Tús is to be more than workfare, it must have a strong training element. The Minister has indicated funding is not available for this purpose. Is funding available that could be allocated to partnership groups or local development companies to enable them to provide additional training over and above their current contracts to ensure Tús participants have some access to training and the scheme will deliver real benefits?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_274">I was very encouraged when I first heard about Tús on entering the Department. I was under the impression that many of the places had been taken up and was surprised to find that while there had been four or five announcements on the launch of the initiative, other than the pilot scheme involving 119 people in two local development company areas, Tús had not commenced. I have now spent a considerable number of weeks seeking to encourage the widest possible participation from the various local development companies and sporting organisations that have been provided with a complement of places.</p>
            <p eId="para_275">I am encouraged by the positivity with which people have been reacting. I also have had discussions with Members of different parties from all sides of this House, many of whom are also involved in local development companies. In a manner similar to the internship scheme that will be announced later today by the Minister for Finance, there is an opportunity for everyone who is involved in a local development company to identify people. In many ways Tús is probably modelled on the original rural social scheme. However, it now applies to both urban and rural areas and as Minister, I certainly intend to ensure that not only rural areas but every town, village and city in Ireland in which there are development companies and partnerships anxious to engage people will be fully involved in the process. As I stated, the response thus far is encouraging.</p>

            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_276">The Minister referred to Tús and the local development companies. My local development company in County Offaly has informed me that in respect of the recruitment of supervisors, for example, those who advanced themselves or who sought to better themselves by participating in departmental training in the year previous to their application are not allowed to apply. How can the Minister stand over this and how can local development companies be hamstrung by virtue of this fact? People were given a leg up by encouraging them to participate in training and to further improve themselves and their skill sets, yet the Minister presides over a scenario whereby she will not allow anyone to take up a supervisory position because they tried to better themselves in the previous year.</p>

            <p eId="para_277">Will the Minister review the random selection element to put in place some sort of system that would enable participants or those who wish to participate to put their names forward in a manner that would avoid, for example, those who have no interest in sport being forced to engage in sport? How many staff supervisors are being employed to cover this initiative?</p>

            <p eId="para_279">County Offaly has been offered 100 Tús places with five supervisors.

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_281">One reason for the inclusion of random selection was that one measure in the programme agreed by the previous Government with the troika was to provide for activation measures, some of which would be based on random selection.</p>
            <p eId="para_282">In response to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's question on the possibility of someone like me, who is not the greatest person at football or hurling, being selected, this is about reasonable offers that relate to a person's capacity or interest. There is no way in which someone who was totally unsuitable would be selected for a particular offering. It is about reasonable offers that are meant to assist a person to acquire valuable experience and training. I am confident there will be a good match and I intend to send the details to all Members of this House. Moreover, as I stated previously, I have spoken personally with many Deputies in respect of their interaction with their own local companies. We will make as great a success of this as we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">I am afraid that no additional European funds have been made available in this regard. However, much emphasis is laid in the memorandum of understanding with the troika on the business of getting people into work, training and education. Were we to show that schemes such as this or the internship schemes can be successful, productive and helpful to people trying to get back into work, it would bear fruit during the renegotiation of the terms and conditions of the deal.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_287">Earlier today, Commissioner Rehn made it clear that he expects Ireland to receive a reduction in interest payments relating to the support loan. He all but announced a reduction earlier today and it has been clear since the beginning of the year that this would happen. As expected, it appears from his statement to form part of a wider restructuring of support programmes for Greece and Portugal. However, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree this is nowhere near the end of the matter as there remain major issues concerning the ECB, funding mechanisms for the bank and the ongoing measures required to reduce our deficit. The immediate question arises as to what is the Government policy concerning the money saved by this reduction. Will it be used to reduce the deficit or will it be diverted into spending?</p>
          <p eId="para_288">It is fair to state there is a clear division between the Government parties on this matter and I ask the Taoiseach to state clearly two matters. First, will the Taoiseach reassure the House that Ireland's consistent opposition to the introduction of Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base remains firm and has not and will not be compromised in exchange for the reduction of the interest rate? Second, will he clarify whether the reduction in the interest rate and the savings arising therefrom will be used to pay down the debt or used for further spending?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_166">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_289">I have noted the comments of Commissioner Rehn. This matter has not been finalised as yet and there have been some expectations in this regard for some time. I have noted the perception that often applies before European meetings of either Ministers or Heads of Government and I am always one to wait and see what actually happens. The Government is negotiating on an interest rate reduction and I am aware of the Commissioner's comments. As the Deputy is aware, this matter was devolved to the Ministers for Finance to be dealt with and that meeting will take place on Monday next. It is clear that an interest rate reduction would be in this country's interest. This was endorsed by President of the Commission Barroso and has been referred to by others, including the Irish Commissioner, Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, yesterday. I prefer to wait and see what happens here. The situation in Portugal and Greece is of very topical conversation in Europe, as the Deputy is aware. Ireland is proceeding on the basis of looking for this deal on a constant basis. We have made the case in respect of an interest rate reduction and are continuing to do that. Obviously, after the meeting next week, we will know whether a conclusion can actually be reached here.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">In respect of the Deputy's question about the reduction in the debt and our spending on job creation measures, he will be aware that while the language in the memorandum of understanding still stands, there is a clear understanding that, for instance, the sale of non-strategic public assets will be looked at on a case-by-case basis in respect of investment in job creation, of which the jobs initiative today is but a down payment in terms of the programme for Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">The EU-IMF programme states that anything realised from the sale of State assets would be used to pay down the debt, but my question was about the reduction in the interest rate, the savings arising from that and how they will be used. Problematically, confusion is developing about the clear statements in the programme for Government and the revised EU-IMF agreement. In terms of the economic background and in advance of the Government implementing new policies, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has released figures that, according to him, show that Government finances are ahead of expectations while Deputy Howlin has released figures showing that public service numbers are being reduced in line with expectations. Today there has been news from Commissioner Rehn. In light of the fact that there is no change in the fiscal——</p>

Given that there has been no change in the fiscal situation to force a change in the policies agreed ten weeks ago, will the Taoiseach explain the current status of the coalition's tax promise? The programme for Government states clearly that bands and credits will be maintained, but the Cabinet published a document last week stating that the next budget would include a lowering of tax bands and credits, which means that working people will need to pay more tax on their incomes. There is no way for the Taoiseach to spin his way out of this one.</p>

In so far as we are concerned, wewant to focus on the difficulties that we have as a country and as a Government that is grappling to resuscitate an economy left in an atrocious mess by the previous Government. Be that as it may, the situation is that this will not happen, as the Deputy knows, unless negotiated agreements are reached. The fact of the matter is that the Ministers for finance will meet next Monday, these matters are on the agenda, we will be in discussion and negotiation with our counterparts in Europe up to and during that meeting and, hopefully, a conclusion can be reached.</p>

All I can confirm to him is that I have spoken with our Minister for Finance and, on behalf of the Government, he has been delegated to continue these negotiations. An interest rate reduction in Ireland's case would obviously be very welcome and very necessary but, for us, we must look at that as one issue and continue to seek improvements in the overall bailout deal, as we have pointed out on many occasions.</p>

Is he aware of the anger expressed about the master plan launched by the serving Minister at the Cabinet, Deputy Leo Varadkar, despite the fact that the stated policy position of both Government parties before the general election was that no further infill of the bay would be supported? Does he accept that the late Seán Dublin Bay Loftus and groups such as Dublin Bay Watch and the Clontarf Residents Association have spent the last 30 years fighting with Governments, City Hall and the Dublin Port Company to preserve and protect Dublin Bay and won that battle? With regard to the retention of employment, is the Taoiseach aware of the thousands of people who use Dublin Bay and walk on the sea front and the major impact this infill would have on local small businesses such as coffee shops, pubs and restaurants? What about the further potential of marine tourism and leisure destinations?

          <p eId="para_405">This is a complex matter and the reason I have not tied a timeline to presenting to the people a referendum on children's rights is that it has got to be right. This is a sensitive issue. The Deputy will be aware that during the lifetime of the previous Government an all-party Oireachtas committee came forward with a specific wording, following its members from all parties having done a great deal work on it. The then Attorney General recommended a change in the wording. The children's rights advocacy groups believe that wording is not sufficient to deal with the requirements involved in the referendum. The Minister with responsibility for children and youth affairs is now dealing with having to provide a number of Bills in respect of this. She will be dealing with the children's rights advocacy groups in order that there be a thorough analysis of where best to go from the situation that exists. I did not tie a specific timeline on this because it is very important that it be got right. That is one of the reasons we have a front line senior Government Department dealing with children and children's issues.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
          <p eId="para_417">It is just under nine weeks since the new Government assumed office, having obtained a secure and stable mandate from the people. We have agreed a programme for Government, motivated by a clear vision of an Ireland that, by the end of our term in office, will be recognised as a modern, fair, socially inclusive and equal society, supported by a productive and prosperous economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">As indicated in the programme for Government, the success of our economic strategy will lay the foundation for the rest of our agenda for change. That economic strategy in turn is based on several essential elements that include fixing our broken banking system, restoring order to our public finances, regaining and enhancing our international competitiveness, supporting the protection and creation of jobs, radically reforming our system of public administration and rebuilding Ireland's reputation on the international stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">We have hit the ground running. Within three weeks of taking up office, we took firm and decisive action to recapitalise and restructure the domestic banking system to restore the banks to a position where they are fit for the purpose of supporting economic recovery. Within three more weeks we re-engaged with the European Union-International Monetary Fund-European Central Bank partners to renegotiate the programme of support for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">We have also confirmed our commitment to bringing the public finances on to a sustainable trajectory and to achieving a deficit of less than 3% of gross domestic product by 2015. To this end, we have embarked on a fundamental and comprehensive review of public spending, both current and capital. We intend to use the results of those reviews as key building blocks in our budgetary plans for 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Government is also committed to implementing a range of reforms to the domestic budgetary framework. It is our intention to have put in place by the end of June an independent fiscal advisory council and to publish, by the end of the year, a fiscal responsibility Bill which will set out a radically new approach to the management of the public finances. These important reforms will place Ireland's future budgetary framework on a more sustainable and credible footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Today, well within our first 100 days in office, we move forward with the jobs initiative. It comprises a set of measures that represents the new Government's first steps towards improving the economy's international competitiveness and promoting job creation. We are taking these steps against a background where the economy has seen three successive years of declining economic activity. Between 2007 and 2010, the volume of goods and services produced in Ireland fell by approximately 12%. This year, however, we can look forward to positive growth which we fully expect will accelerate as we move into 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The recently published stability programme update forecasts positive gross domestic product growth this year, a welcome development following the past three years. For 2012, my Department projects that gross domestic product will grow by 2.5%, with average growth of 3% per annum possible between 2013 to 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Underpinning this expected rebound in economic activity is a strong outlook for goods and services exports. The picture emerging is one of an export-led recovery which is in line with expectations. A recovery in a small open economy such as Ireland's typically takes this form.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">On foot of recent competitiveness gains and improving external demand, the exporting sectors of the economy are in general performing very well. Last year, exports increased by 9.5% in real terms, the strongest rate of growth for a decade. Looking to the future, export growth is projected at about 6.75% in 2011 and 5.75% in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Since the 1950s, Ireland has used its corporate tax regime as an integral part of its strategy to encourage growth, attract foreign direct investment and increase employment. We do not have the allure of a large domestic market or substantial public procurement to attract major international firms here, so we must use the other tools at our disposal. This approach is supported by research by bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development which points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth in small open economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Government is committed to continuing this policy approach, knowing that certainty is essential for existing and prospective investors. Our 12.5% rate of corporation tax is here to stay. It is central to our industrial policy and is an integral part of our international brand. The Government's message is, therefore, unequivocal. There will be no deviation from that position, one which also has broad cross-party support.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The corporation tax regime is a vital element of our industrial policy. However, other measures also have an important part to play. In this regard, Ireland has a very attractive research and development tax credit scheme that allows as a general measure 25% of incremental expenditure by a company on qualifying research and development to be set off against its corporation tax liabilities or, where there are no such liabilities, for the credit to be paid to the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Since its introduction in 2004, the scheme has influenced the decisions of many multinational firms to locate internationally mobile research and development projects in Ireland. To maximise the benefits to companies and further encourage investment and employment in research and development, I intend to amend the research and development tax credit legislation to enhance flexibility for companies in how they account for the credit, giving the option to account for it above or below the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Ireland's attraction for research and development activities has played, and continues to play, a critical role in encouraging foreign direct investment and creating employment. The Government intends to continue to enhance that attraction.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The jobs initiative is about encouraging employment. In that regard, I have reviewed the decision taken by the previous Government to introduce employer PRSI on share-based remuneration. This was a serious mistake and I intend to reverse it in the forthcoming finance Bill. The imposition of this charge on employers needlessly increases the costs of doing business in Ireland and would have the potential to negatively affect current employment levels and future investment decisions. Businesses operate under strict budgetary control in the current economic climate and increasing their costs is unwise. The potential loss to the economy from this measure far outweighs the potential yield to the Exchequer. Accordingly, I have decided to abolish the employer PRSI element with effect from 1 January 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">There is a perception that export growth is not jobs-rich which is true in general. Most exporting sectors in the economy tend to be capital rather than labour intensive. However, tourism is one very obvious exception to this general pattern. Much economic activity in the tourism industry is highly intensive in its use of labour. This is particularly true of hotels and restaurants, recreation and entertainment. In the case of tourism and exports, it is simply that the persons who purchase the goods and services come to the country to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Its relative labour intensity makes it all the more unfortunate that tourism has greatly underperformed other exporting sectors. Far from expanding, as overall exports did, tourism continued to decline last year with the total number of trips by visitors to Ireland down by 13% on the 2009 level. This brought to 25% the cumulative decline in inbound tourism numbers between 2007 and 2010. Over the same period, earnings from tourism and travel fell by about 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">These figures reflect the scale of the challenge facing the tourism industry. They also illustrate the scale, however, of the opportunity that exists for the industry if it can get it right. Even by recovering the ground it has lost in recent years, tourism can make a substantial contribution to our economic recovery and to the creation of employment in all parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Another strong reason we should make every attempt to capitalise on the potential of tourism is that significant investment has already taken place in this sector. Whatever about the merits of some of the schemes that encouraged this investment, we have a stock of accommodation, much of it of a very high quality by international standards, which we must now utilise to full advantage. We also have a stock of entertainment and recreational facilities that has been significantly enhanced by public investment in recent years, not to mention a transport infrastructure the capacity of which has been greatly augmented.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Overall, our tourism products are very strong. In addition to Ireland's natural attractions, we have a wide range of high quality accommodation, including hotels, guesthouses, B&amp;Bs, self-catering accommodation and hostels, to suit all tastes and budgets. We offer a wide range of sporting and recreational facilities and events. Culture and heritage, golf, angling, walking, cycling and equestrian pursuits are all easily accessible. In recent years, holidaying in Ireland has become more affordable. These are some of the many advantages we must harness to improve visitor satisfaction and to increase the number of people from overseas who choose Ireland as their holiday destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">While the provision of tourist facilities and amenities is important, marketing of what Ireland has to offer as a holiday location is crucial. The United Kingdom is our most important overseas market, with close to half of our overseas visitors coming from there. It is also the market that has seen the greatest contraction since the recession began. Between 2007 and 2010 trips to Ireland from Britain fell by 32%. It is critical that we see a return to growth in visits from the UK to achieve overall growth in tourist numbers. As part of a three-pronged strategy to promote tourism by encouraging airlines to improve levels of access for visitors to Ireland, tourism marketing resources will be made available for Tourism Ireland, working with the three State airports, to promote visitor traffic from destinations served by additional routes and services through co-operative marketing with carriers. The tourism marketing fund will support a strong focus on our major source markets, including the UK, to take advantage of the additional opportunities presented in 2011 by the forthcoming visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama. These visits present exciting opportunities to get Ireland back in the minds of potential tourists and are invaluable in terms of marketing and publicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The programme for Government provided for the lowering of the reduced VAT rate. Rather than applying a 1.5% reduction to the rate for all goods and services currently on the 13.5% reduced rate, I have decided to introduce a more focussed and larger reduction for certain goods and services while other items continue to be subject to the existing lower rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Consequently, as part of the measures to support the tourism industry, the VAT reduction will be targeted mainly at those services relating to tourism. In this context, a new temporary second reduced rate of VAT at 9% will be introduced with effect from 1 July 2011 until end December 2013. The new 9% rate will apply mainly to restaurant and catering services, hotel and holiday accommodation and various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, museums, fairgrounds, amusement parks and sporting facilities. In addition, hairdressing and printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes and newspapers will also be charged at the new rate. All other goods and services to which a reduced rate currently applies will remain subject to the 13.5% rate. This measure is estimated to cost €120 million this year and €350 million in a full year. The purpose of this targeted VAT relief is to boost tourism and stimulate employment in the sector. I am confident that it will give the tourism sector a much needed shot in the arm. However, to ensure that the sector is delivering, the effects of the changes announced today will be assessed and the measures reviewed before the end of 2012 in the context of preparing budget 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">To encourage overseas visitor numbers, I will provide for the air travel tax rate to be reduced to zero on a date to be fixed by order.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">To be clear, the commencement of this measure is subject to an agreement being reached with the airlines to bring in additional passenger numbers. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is holding discussions in that regard. Furthermore, as with the targeted VAT reductions, a review of this measure will be conducted before the end of 2012 to evaluate its success in bringing in additional passenger numbers. If it is not being successful, the air travel tax will be reapplied. Consequently, the relevant legislation will remain in place to allow the tax to be recommenced if there is no appropriate activity in the market. The cost of this measure, based on a possible implementation date of 1 July 2011 is €15 million in 2011, €90 million in 2012 and €105 million thereafter. The suspension of the air travel tax is one of a number of approaches being taken to revitalise the tourism industry as part of the jobs initiative. Other elements include a new scheme of discounts on airport charges, which has been agreed by the State airports in consultation with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the airlines. A tourism marketing campaign will begin, which will be particularly focused on Ireland's major source markets such as the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">In addition to these measures, the Minister for Justice and Equality will announce a major reform measure in the visa application system for entry to Ireland. This initiative will make it easier for overseas visitors, including visitors from crucial emerging markets, to come to Ireland without having to incur the trouble and expense of applying for separate visas once they have already obtained visas for the UK. Essentially, the holders of such visas will not require a separate visa to come to Ireland. I know that as well as presenting business and employment opportunities for the coming season, this measure will provide a great opportunity for tourist service providers to capitalise on the hundreds of thousands of visitors who will travel to the London Olympics next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">The notable under-performance of tourism over the past few years highlights the need to improve the sector's cost competitiveness, an objective that the measures I have announced will help to advance. A set of costs that are especially important to tourism and other employment-rich areas of the economy are labour costs. One way to help job creation and improve our labour cost competitiveness is to ease the costs on employers of taking on new employees. Accordingly, and in line with the commitment given in the programme for Government, I am announcing today the halving of the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to €356 per week. This measure will take effect from 1 July next. Also, 1 July next is the effective date for restoration of the minimum wage to its previous level.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_447">This will be done through legislation to be introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton. The existing employer job, PRSI, incentive scheme will remain in place until the end of this year so that enterprises and businesses that had planned to take on staff under this scheme in that period may continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">As set out in the programme for Government, it is the Government's intention to reform the structures for setting wages at sectoral level. The Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation has recently received the report of the independent review of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements, which will be published shortly. The report states that the system requires radical overhaul to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The downturn in the economy has had a profound effect on the labour market, with areas such as retail, accommodation and food being among those hardest hit. In this environment, it is necessary to ensure that these structures are flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances and that they reflect the realities of our modern economy. In particular, there are issuesrelating to overtime and premium payments for Sunday working, the number of joint labour committees and the general functioning and supervision of the system. Following publication of the report, the Government is determined to proceed with urgency to substantial reform of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Job creation is central to any economic recovery strategy. That is why labour market policy forms an important part of the programme for Government. Measures to reduce employment costs and to make wage-setting arrangements work more fairly and more responsively are, in turn, essential tools of labour market policy but they will not be sufficient to address the severe labour market problems that we currently face. They must be accompanied by measures that ensure a pathway to appropriate employment, education and training opportunities for people who have become unemployed. At all costs we must avoid the risk that people who are now long-term unemployed will find it difficult to secure meaningful employment again in the open labour market. That is why it is essential to maximise the effectiveness of the substantial resources we provide on activation measures and provide for a more integrated approach and targeting of effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Increasing levels of engagement with the unemployed at clear milestones is a key element of our approach to creating pathways to employment for such persons. A re-invigorated national employment action plan, within the architecture of the national employment and entitlements service will underpin this increased level of engagement. The Minister for Social Protection will publish details of the further development and roll-out of the new approach to engagement with those on the live register. The Government's objective will be to ensure the State will engage with unemployed people and advise them on training, education or work placement opportunities that are appropriate to each individual's circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">We will provide an additional 6,000 specific skills training courses targeted at those who have left employment in areas where there are now significant structural employment issues, such as the construction industry. We will also provide an additional 3,000 back to education initiative places which will be targeted at adults with less than the leaving certificate. Some 1,000 additional post-leaving certificate places will be targeted at school leavers and adults returning to education. An additional 5,900 places will be provided under the third level-springboard programme targeted at those who have left employment where there are now significant structural employment issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The Government will also establish a new national internship scheme providing 5,000 work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors. This will be a time-limited scheme and will provide work experience placements for interns for a six to nine month period. A weekly allowance of €50 per week on top of the existing social welfare entitlement will be payable for the period of the internship.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Taking all of these measures together, the net result is that there will be some 20,900 places available at an additional cost in 2011 of €11 million. This represents a substantial and meaningful commitment to helping people who have lost their jobs. These measures are, of course, on top of the other initiatives such as the supports for over 1,000 redundant apprentices now being put in place to enable them to complete on-the-job training.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I will move on to initiatives relating to public capital projects. Public capital investment can play an important role, both in promoting employment and in addressing worthwhile, visible and pressing infrastructure needs throughout the country. Despite our current circumstances, we will continue to invest in such worthwhile and necessary projects, with the considerable sum of €4.6 billion being allocated for 2011. Capital investment can stimulate economic activity as well as providing direct employment, with an average of eight to 12 direct jobs being created per €1 million of capital expenditure. Additionally, well-targeted investment in infrastructure can have significantly higher indirect job creation impacts in the medium term. However, an investment programme must strike an appropriate balance between projects the purpose of which is to create new capacity, for example, new roads or new schools, and works whose purpose is to maintain the capacity of existing infrastructure by carrying out necessary repair and maintenance. The comprehensive review of State capital spending to which I have already made reference will help the Government to get this balance right in relation to 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">In the meantime, I have decided that there is a case for tilting the balance for 2011 in the direction of what are called minor capital works and away from new build projects. This is largely on the grounds that I think more resources than originally provided should be directed towards ensuring that our existing stock of infrastructure does not become degraded. A welcome consequence of this is that there will be some modest boost to employment since minor capital works tend to be more employment intensive than larger projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Specifically, there will be further investment in schools, local and regional roads and the national energy retrofitting programme.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_465">The cost of these measures will be met by re-allocations from elsewhere within the capital allocations of the relevant Departments and from some of the proceeds of a new levy, the details of which I will set out shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Delivering and maintaining necessary schools is one of the priorities of Government over the next five years. We will continue to invest heavily in our schools. An educated workforce has been central to our previous economic advances and is an absolute prerequisite for our future economic renewal. This will form part of the capital review which is just commencing and which is due to be completed in the autumn. To this end, a further €30 million will be made available for school works and associated works in 2011. Some €20 million of this will be re-allocated by the Minister for Education and Skills from within his own Department's allocation. An additional €10 million of Exchequer funding will be made available to the Department from the proceeds of the new levy. This will be allocated to immediately ready projects to be delivered by schools and will lead to the commencement of an additional €40 million investment, €30 million of which will be spent this summer on what are locally referred to as the summer schemes for schools. A targeted programme using re-allocated funds will enhance existing schools, address building defects and, most importantly, provide immediate, labour-intensive employment in localities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The Government has also agreed that the Department of Education and Skills will continue to invest in new schools. As a result, the Department will identify and deliver two further public private partnership schools bundles in areas where additional infrastructure is required post-2016. Planning and preparatory work will begin immediately. Details of these measures have been announced by the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">An extra €60 million will be re-allocated to invest in our regional and local roads to carry out much needed surface restoration and road reconstruction works. This important, remedial work is overdue and the additional money invested will allow local authorities to bring forward important projects to 2012 that had previously been pushed back to 2013. The local and regional roads network is fundamental to supporting economic activity away from the main urban centres and motorways. The existing road network must be maintained to a sufficient standard to ensure that the value of this important capital asset does not depreciate prematurely over the coming years. Indeed, if such work is not undertaken soon, the quality of the roads is likely to deteriorate markedly.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">All in all, the re-allocated €60 million will help repair about 800 kilometres of local roads right across the country. In addition to this, a further €15 million will be spent on local sustainable transport projects in both urban and rural areas. These will include cycle lanes, pedestrian routes and park-and-ride facilities. These labour-intensive schemes will have a real local impact both in the provision of direct employment and enhancing the quality of local infrastructure. These two measures will support the creation of a number of additional jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">There will also be an additional €19 million in Exchequer funding to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, for the national energy retrofitting programme, to be supplemented by €11 million savings from within that Department's existing allocation. This will double the funding for the retrofit home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes in the second half of this year. Energy efficiency works are more labour intensive than other capital programmes and will therefore support additional jobs, as well as delivering long-term savings to households and to the economy in terms of carbon savings. It should also be pointed out that, under the retrofit programme, each €10 million of Exchequer funding provides leverage for up to €15 million in private sector spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The size of Exchequer funding for this measure in future years will be considered in the capital review, to be conducted by the Department of public expenditure and reform. In accordance with the programme for Government commitment, we will prepare alternative measures to ensure more energy efficiency programmes can be funded without further recourse to the Exchequer by the end of 2013, if not sooner. In addition to these initial investment measures, we are committed to a more radical overhaul of the wider Exchequer finance capital programme in line with our changed economic and social needs and are putting in place a parallel, commercially financed NewERA strategic investment programme in key works of the economy. Further announcements in this regard can be expected shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be an important source of business for SMEs. The Government will build on existing initiatives to promote greater access to procurement opportunities for SMEs, including through identifying and overcoming barriers to their participation in the procurement process. We will also seek to foster greater SME engagement in developing innovative products and services to meet the needs of public bodies within the framework of EU law, and will explore schemes in other EU countries in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The Taoiseach recently signalled the Government's willingness to pilot an incentivisation scheme to encourage a broad diaspora to work for Ireland in finding potential foreign investments that result in sustained employment in Ireland. The initiative will be piloted by IDA Ireland and is intended to complement the IDA's initiative to attract more fast-growth emerging companies to Ireland. The focus will be mainly on generating projects from SMEs which are not reached through IDA's marketing and networking structures and ideally have the potential for rapid international growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">To ensure additionality, the pilot will be structured around projects that would not otherwise have found their way to Ireland. It is intended that private sector partners, who could be from the "for profit" or voluntary sectors, will be selected following open competitive tendering, based on objective criteria such as the ability to deliver appropriate leads; the international reach of the persons involved; the ability and quality of the proposed mechanism to filter leads for real potential; a proposed fee and fee structure; and proposals to encourage the use of the fee income for philanthropic purposes. The details of the scheme will be agreed between the Department of public expenditure and reform and the Department of enterprise, jobs and innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The Minister for public expenditure and reform is announcing tomorrow a relaxation of the numbers ceiling applying to non-Exchequer funded posts in the higher education sector in order to further facilitate the maximum possible employment creation potential of that sector, while also encouraging institutions to seek to diversify their sources of funding away from the Exchequer. It is envisaged that similar type arrangements will also apply to contract posts involved in research activity in non-commercial State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The various tax reduction and additional expenditure measures which I am announcing today will be funded by way of a temporary levy on funded pension schemes and personal pension plans. I propose that the levy will apply at a rate of 0.6% to the capital value of assets under management in pension funds established in the State. It will apply for a period of four years commencing this year and is intended to raise approximately €470 million in each of those years. The levy will not apply to pension funds established here and providing services and benefits solely to non-resident employers and members. Further details regarding the proposed measures of the levy are set out in the summary of initiative measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I am conscious of the concerns of the pensions industry about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging. However, the imposition of the levy is for a relatively short period and its purpose is to improve that environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly. These pension funds, the vast majority of which are invested in overseas assets, have been the beneficiaries of massive tax relief in recent decades. In our current circumstances, there is sound economic logic to clawing back some of the tax relief on capital invested overseas to finance greater domestic employment in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The levy is being confined to pension funds because I believe the alternatives for increases in taxation elsewhere at this time would be more damaging to the economy. I will be glad to consult the pensions industry on the legislative provisions which will give effect to the levy so as to seek to minimise, where possible, any unnecessary difficulties to which this measure may give rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The pension levy represents a very significant contribution by the pensions industry and the many individual savers it represents to our commitment to getting the economy moving again. I am aware that the pensions sector is also concerned, given the temporary levy, about the commitment in our agreement with the EU-IMF to reduce the tax relief on pension contributions starting next year. I will examine this issue in the context of the results of the comprehensive review of expenditure currently being undertaken by the Minister for public expenditure and reform, and any resulting scope for fiscally neutral changes to the EU-IMF agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">At the end of March, a range of measures was announced to reorganise, recapitalise and de-leverage the domestic financial system in order to restore the banks to health and continue to provide a secure banking system for deposits. The three main elements of this strategy — recapitalisation, strong liquidity standards and a radical reorganisation and downsizing of the banking sector with the establishment of two pillar, full-service banks — are fundamental to economic recovery and job creation. The restructuring of the banking system will result in banks that are more proportionate to the size of the economy, that can better serve business and households and provide the vital supply of credit needed to support industry and consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The banking system must provide substantial new lending into the economy. The business plans submitted by the pillar banks provide for over €30 billion of total new lending over the next three years across their core business areas. Up to €20 billion of this figure will go to small and medium size businesses, which are the lifeblood of economic recovery. The authorities will be rigorously monitoring the banks' activities to ensure credit is available for borrowers meeting reasonable credit standard requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The plans to restructure and recapitalise the banking system represent the principal response to the challenge of ensuring the availability of credit to viable businesses. These plans are designed to secure an adequate flow of credit into the economy to support economic recovery, even as the banking system is downsized. Notwithstanding this, there remains an issue which predates the recent banking crisis, whereby new companies or expanding companies trying to develop new products or markets struggle to secure finance. This can be due to a lack of familiarity or understanding of the new industry, the new product or the potential of new markets. This market failure in the provision of credit to viable businesses became particularly acute in Ireland during the property bubble, during which time the Irish banks lost the capacity to assess credit risk in companies that were unable to offer property-related collateral.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">This is why my Department will work with the Department of enterprise, jobs and innovation over the coming weeks to flesh out the lending targets of the two pillar banks agreed as part of the restructuring plans and to develop a package of additional, targeted initiatives designed to address specific market failures in the provision of credit for viable businesses. These measures will, of course, be subject to EU state aid approval, where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Among the issues that will be examined will be the role of the Credit Review Office, the credit assessment procedures and skills of the two pillar banks, the reporting procedures of the banks regarding new lending and what the Government can do to support the continued operation in Ireland of foreign-owned banks. As part of this package of initiatives, and in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government, we will also be initiating a tendering process for the development of a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The design of the scheme will draw from international experience to support new lending that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks. In this way, the scheme will complement, rather than be a substitute for, existing lending activities by the main financial institutions. It will be designed to encourage banks to lend to new or expanding commercially viable SMEs so they can grow their company, develop new products or expand into new markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Government's commitment will be for an initial period of one year. Specific performance criteria will be set down that allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period before committing to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years. There will be a modest and known level of exposure to the taxpayer when the scheme is launched but I expect to see a significant positive knock-on benefit to the economy in terms of job creation, welfare savings and returns to the Exchequer by way of tax revenue generated. The Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I will develop this proposal further with our officials. It is our intention to announce the details of the scheme in June, with a view to having a targeted scheme in place by the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, a microfinance start-up fund to provide loans to small businesses is being developed. A workable scheme and optimum delivery mechanisms are now being considered and this work will be brought to fruition for the December budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">There is no escaping the fact that we do not have the resources available at present to fund large-scale policy initiatives to help to generate economic activity. Given the weak state of the public finances, the costs associated with the measures we are implementing as part of this jobs initiative must be paid for through the introduction of off-setting measures. In practice, this means the initiative must be budget-neutral over the period to 2014. That in turn means the direct stimulatory effect of today's package of initiatives will be modest and there will be no extravagant claims made in its regard from this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">However, the measures announced principally represent the first steps by this Government towards improving the competitiveness of important sectors of the economy and enhancing the functioning of our labour market to better facilitate the return to work of those who are currently unemployed. These first steps will be followed by further movement towards this Government's vision of rebuilding a prosperous and productive economy by the end of our term in office. In addition, I believe today's jobs initiative will help to rebuild confidence among households and firms at home and amongst potential investors abroad. In the first instance, as an initiative it points to a Government which is alive to the fact that, despite the tight constraints within which economic policy must now be pursued, it is still possible to make policy changes for the better. The Government is prepared to initiate those changes. Second, I believe the jobs initiative will help to rebuild confidence because it points to a Government which has a vision of what it wants to achieve, a strategy for getting there and the energy and decisiveness needed to adopt the measures required.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I believe the House will agree that in the early days of its tenure, this Government has not been found wanting. We identified priorities for action in our programme for Government and are well on the way to delivering on each of these although barely two months in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I commend the jobs initiative to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">I welcome the opportunity to comment on this, the Government's first initiative in the field of job creation. Welcome though it may be, however — and I welcome it — it is rather minimalist. When one compares it to the documents produced by Fine Gael less than 12 months ago which promised €18 billion expenditure on job creation, it pales into insignificance. For every €36 promised in that original and widely circulated document €1 is being spent today. Of course, when reality kicked in the figure of €18 billion dropped, first to €7 billion. Now it has dwindled to €500 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">None the less, the unemployment problem in this country is very severe. I recognise this, as does my party, and I welcome any initiative, from whatever Government, that will attempt to deal with that situation. I intend, therefore, to be as positive and constructive as I can. I have a number of questions which I hope are legitimate, a number of criticisms I hope the Minister will regard as constructive and a number of suggestions I hope he will regard as helpful.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_507">In regard to the Minister's announcement on employers' PRSI, I had been somewhat confused as to how exactly this would operate, arising from certain statements made by the Minister and some of his colleagues. However, it is made reasonably clear in today's statement, which I welcome. It would appear that in respect of jobs which generate up to €356 per week income an employer who creates such a job will have his or her employer's PRSI halved, from 8.5% to 4.5%. The Minister must recognise there is a danger in this situation. What about the case of a person earning, for example, €370, €365 or €360 per week? In such a case will there not be an incentive for an employer to reduce wages to avail of the new rate of PSRI? I do not know how the measure will operate — we will tease it out when the Minister answers questions on Thursday, as I am glad to see he will do. Neither do I know if there is to be a kind of tapering, or marginal, relief that may be worked up gradually from the figure of €356. This must be done very carefully otherwise the cure is in danger of being worse than the disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The Minister announced a very important change in regard to the tax treatment of research and development expenditure which I warmly welcome. Leaving aside terminology in respect of above and below the line, in effect this means that in order to encourage people to invest in research and development this State will provide tax incentives or credits. As a result of this change, people who now provide such investment will, in almost every case, be able to claim full credit for the investment they provide. That is a very substantial step forward. We must remember there is very substantial tax competition at present in regard to the tax treatment of intellectual property. Other countries have taken various initiatives in this regard. The success of this country has been phenomenal if one considers the figures for recent years as released by the relevant agencies. Ireland has been phenomenally successful in attracting this type of investment which is absolutely vital for the future health of its economy. This is a very worthwhile initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">If I may presume on the Minister's obvious interest in this area there are some other aspects of this issue I wish to mention. There is a difficulty with the way such tax treatment is currently calculated, in terms of a base year of 2003 and expenditure over the amount spent in the base year. That has created a number of difficulties for what I imagine to be a relatively small number of firms which spent a great deal of money on research and development in 2003 and have been spending similarly since then. Perhaps a small adjustment, if not in the forthcoming budget perhaps in that of December, would yield very desirable results in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Another point I wish to make to the Minister in the context of tax relief on research and development concerns the outreach cap. As I understand it, at present an enterprise is allowed to outsource only 5% of its expenditure on research and development to a research institute. It is time to raise that cap substantially. One impact is to prevent linkage between the work done in this regard by research institutes and the work done by business. The Government has taken over many other policies designed to encourage linkage from the previous Government and has announced them in the programme for Government. Basically, maintaining the cap in place runs directly counter to many of the Government proposals with which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Will the Minister explain what became of the promise in the programme for Government to allow businesses that spend up to €100,000 on research and development to pay the full amount with no reference to the base year? This commitment was written into the programme for Government but I do not see it in the document today and I am bringing it to the Minister's attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of the economy. I welcome the many references to SMEs in the programme for Government. Although there is some provision for them in the document, it is rather scanty. It relates to public procurement and is rather vague. There is no doubt that there is great capacity for SMEs to improve their business through public procurement but I state without fear of contradiction that the efforts made to date to improve the SME share of public procurement business have been an abysmal failure. For example, the first thing they run up against is the requirement for financial records and history. Many SMEs do not go back to the year dot or do not have 50 years of audited accounts, etc. There is too much emphasis on the financial history of the applicant for public procurement jobs and less on the capacity of the applicant to do the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Another problem is the famous Department of Finance circular 10/10, which was supposed to facilitate SMEs to access public procurement business. The circular has been honoured more in the breach than the observance. It was supposed to deal with such matters as transparency regarding opportunities which would arise, the capacity of companies or SMEs to break the contract into job lots, the capacity of SMEs to get together and make a joint application, information about indemnity and insurance etc. However, this is not happening. I put it to the Minister there is a need to urgently review this circular with a view to clarifying many aspects of it and to ensure that it is properly enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">A section of the document deals with labour market activation. I thought it looked somewhat familiar and now I remember that I saw it in the last budget and in the four-year plan. The measures seem to build on those. I recall the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, stating in Opposition that we had to consider scale with regard to these matters. He appears to be considering scale now, albeit a slightly increased scale. There are two difficulties in this regard. First, we must think bigger. If the present rate of unemployment is maintained — hopefully it will not increase — we must consider the scale of it. When he was in Opposition, Deputy Bruton rightly stated — I fully agreed with him at the time — that these measures could be cost-effective regardless of scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Second, the present system is unwieldy to say the least. It appears the Government is grafting on these new places to the present system. I realise the introduction of the one-stop-shop, which I welcome, will considerably alleviate the situation in this regard. Recently, I put a question to the Minister for Social Protection in respect of when exactly the one-stop-shop will come into operation. I was not overly enthused by the reply I received because it appears to be years away. What will happen in the meantime? We could do with some streamlining.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I wish to put forward several ideas with regard to labour activation. First, there should be a specific unit in one Department, with access to its website, to monitor the implementation of these schemes to ensure that we are getting value for money and that the schemes are working correctly. Second, apparently there is a problem with branding. I am informed employers do not relate well to opportunities with a social content. This is not rocket science, it is a question of re-branding. We could call it upskilling or further training for the new economy or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I welcome the Minister's announcement of the top-up payment of €50 per week on social welfare. However, in the vast majority of cases of which I am aware it will not work because the difficulty is that we are dealing with interns or graduates being taken on for work placement in industry or business for a given period. Most of these will be living at home and because of social welfare rules in this country they will be entitled to very little or perhaps no social welfare. In the meantime, the employer is prevented from paying them any money. The €50 initiative announced today is welcome in so far as it goes but I do not believe it goes nearly far enough. I urge the Minister to consider the question of giving legal status to interns. If internship is to be a feature of what we are doing in terms of labour activation then they deserve some legal status at least.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">With regard to VAT changes, the original suggestion in the programme for Government was that the 13.5% rate would be reduced to 12%. The Minister has introduced a more focused scheme today and it represents the lion's share of the spending the Government has undertaken in this initiative, some €350 million in a full year. The perennial problem is whether the decrease will be passed on. I have no hesitation in admitting that enforcement in this country is fairly patchy. I am unsure what the Minister has in mind to ensure this is passed on so that consumers may properly avail of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">A considerable range of labour intensive areas which are VAT rated at 13.5% have been excluded. The Minister is focusing the measure, which is fair enough. However, when one focuses a measure in one direction, one leaves out a whole range of other areas. Will the carpenters, electricians or plumbers be covered? I note the change covers meals in restaurants and theatre tickets, etc. Therefore, as a result of the initiative, the Government will ensure that someone who is having a meal out will pay less but the 13.5% rate still applies to the ESB and electricity charges suffered and incurred by people living in fuel poverty. There is no provision for them. Also, I note hairdressing is included. Yesterday, I passed a barber shop in Limerick that offered haircuts for €20.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_526">The difficulty is whether this would create jobs. What is the linkage between this considerable expenditure from the Government, which is in straitened circumstances — that much we all accept — and job creation? Would the money not have been better spent on sectoral, targeted areas to create employment? I believe it would have been but there is no guarantee of it at present. The Minister will recall the efforts of the previousLabour Party Government in the United Kingdom which invested a vast amount of taxforgone on substantial reductions in VAT. It did not receive the concomitant responsefrom the jobs market or from revenue yield and that Government finished up worse off than it started.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The method of funding leaves me bemused. Today, I heard the well-known authority, Eddie Hobbs, on the radio describing it as "theft Tuesday". He said it was bizarre. Basically, the position is that this country has an ageing population. The number of people over the age of 65 years is growing remarkably and it will have trebled during the course of this century. As there is absolutely no way the State can provide for these people, we must try to encourage them to provide for themselves. I recall Fine Gael spokesmen before the general election referring to the proposal included in the four year plan to reduce the payment of tax relief on pension contributions from the top rate to the standard rate of 20%. The word was that they had a better way and a much less painful way of dealing with the matter, by introducing a levy such as this. What are they now doing? They are doing both. When we take the double whammy of the sum of €900 million a year in the EU-IMF agreement and this levy, taking into account the cost of annuities and poor returns, I do not know how many will take out private pension plans from now on. The cost will fall back on taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">There is no doubt that 80% to 90% of private pension schemes are insolvent. This is, basically, a levy on funds held by insolvent organisations, the liabilities of which exceed their assets. It will mean — the Government is legislating to enable this to happen — that those participating in defined benefit schemes, elderly people, those living in very poor circumstances and on fixed incomes because indexation had to be got rid of owing to the collapse in the markets will see their pensions being reduced as a result. Many pension schemes, because they will be unable to meet the minimum funding requirements, will be forced to wind up. The losses crystallised at that point will fall on those who have contributed; they will receive no pensions and only get back only a fraction of what they have put in. It is very unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Towards the end of his contribution the Minister mentioned there had been massive tax relief for pension contributions. That is true, to encourage people to provide for themselves, but tax relief was also available to public sector workers, as well as to those in the private sector. This arrangement is confined exclusively, apparently, to the private sector. If this is compensation for the tax relief given in the past, it should be spread equally across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">We have a practice whereby we tax economic activity arising from deposits which yield interest payments that we then tax. People save for pensions and we tax payments from these funds. However, this is the first time in history the capital is being targeted. Pensioners' savings are on a par with deposits. A line has been crossed. Does this mean the Government feels free, with its huge majority if it gives itself the power, to target savings? The principle is the same. Some of those who will suffer reduced pensions as a direct result of this measure are those who have lost their jobs and are relying on their reduced pensions. It is hardly fair. This is the biggest smash and grab raid since Nero got rid of half of Rome to build a pad for himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">There are alternatives as pointed out by the pensions body which wrote to the Minister. He says he wants to meet it now; it is a shame he did not meet it before now. There are innovative alternatives that could give the Government access to the €72 billion in pension funds to create jobs in the economy, especially when credit is in such short supply. We are suffering a 14.5% unemployment rate. Behind the cold official statistics there is human misery, desolation and despair. I welcome any attempt by any Government of any hue to deal with that issue, but this is not even, to use Churchill's phrase, the end of the beginning. The Government is barely scratching the surface. There was once an election slogan, "A lot done, a lot more to do". The slogan tonight could be, "Very, very little done, an awful lot to do".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_532">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important day for the 440,000 on the live register, 170,000 of whom are long-term unemployed. To be added to these figures are the many graduates and school leavers who will enter the jobs market later this year. All these people, well over 500,000, pinned their hopes on this announcement today. From that point of view, one will appreciate there is a level of good will for the Government in taking this initiative, as people hope to see some improvement in their employment prospects, with the possibility of long-term unemployed persons, graduates and school leavers finding jobs. Sadly, I am disappointed to say, I do not see that happening, although I would like to be more positive, as I came here on a positive note. Most people will be positive when they tune into the news. However, when they look at the small print, they will ask, "Where is the beef? Where are the jobs?"</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Minister says he is funding this measure with the pension levy, the 6% levy on the market value of pensions on 1 January 2011. People will see the nest egg they have built up during the years being raided. During the recent general election both Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised to increase the tax payable on interest on money people had saved on deposit in their banks. The Government is now committed to taxing the interest payable on bank accounts and raiding pension funds. People will be rightly concerned that perhaps it might raid their deposit accounts next. The Government must allay that fear; it must tell the people they need not worry that deposit accounts will be touched during its lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Most of these measures will be enacted by legislation by 1 July. I am concerned that the pension levy has been backdated to 1 January. This is a phenomenal shock. All pension funds made their plans and calculations for budgets and dividends on what they could afford towards the end of last year. On page 20 of the Government's own document it is stated the yield this year will be €470 million. That will also be the yield next year and the year after. It is a retrospective levy for the full year, even though it will only be taken in the second half of the year. People will be shocked that there is to be a levy, that it is so severe and being backdated for six months. That will be a further bone of contention for many.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">There is a figure of €390 million in the capital programme for schools. The Minister says he will move a figure of €20 million from this to the summer works scheme and that an extra €10 million will be provided by way of the pension levy. Normally the capital fund creates eight to 12 jobs for every €1 million spent. We will assume there will be a doubling of that figure in the case of the summer works scheme, but even if 20 jobs are created per annum for each €1 million spent, it will amount to only 200 extra jobs. These 200 jobs in the construction industry will be welcomed and appreciated and we will support their creation, but in the context of the scale of the problem, the single greatest initiative will, at a maximum and on a very optimistic basis, provide for the creation of only 200 jobs in a full year.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">People will be disappointed at the small number of jobs which will flow from today's announcement. Overall, I am shocked by this announcement. The Minister states that the pension levy will raise €470 million. I welcome the reduction in other taxes such as a reduction in excise tax by €15 million and VAT by €120 million, PRSI by €85 million and by €9 million and the Minister proposes to reduce other income taxes by €230 million. This means he will have €240 million available for job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I refer to current expenditure measures proposed on page 22 of the Minister's statement:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_538">Total additional current expenditure to specified areas will amount to €29 million in 2011 or €45 million in a full year. These will be funded by reallocations of €18 million from within existing current resources and €11 million from the introduction of the levy on pension funds in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Minister is providing €11 million out of the pension levy for current expenditure job creation, which means the labour activation projects. The Minister proposes that total additional capital expenditure will amount to €135 million, funded by reallocations of €106 million from within existing resources and only €29 million will be produced from the introduction of the levy on pension funds. The capital expenditure fund will receive €29 million from the pension levy and €11 million from the pension levy will go to current expenditure, giving a total of €40 million from the pension levy. A total of €240 million will come from the pension levy, meaning that the pension levy is being raided today to the tune of €470 million, with €40 million of it going into capital and current job creation measures. The Minister states that his figures will produce a surplus from the pension levy of €200 million which he will use to reduce the deficit. This is a raid on the pension fund to cut the budget deficit by €200 million, with a few scraps of €40 million given to job creation and a reallocation of a couple of hundred million. There is no sign in the Minister's document of the vast bulk of the pension levy being spent on job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I remind the Minister of the old cliché that one should not judge a book by its cover. This is very true with regard to this document. The title cover reads "Jobs Initiative May 2011". However, one can judge this book by what is written on the final page where it states that according to the quarterly national household survey the unemployment rate at the end of 2010 — just a few weeks before this Government came into office — was 13.6%. The Minister's document forecasts that the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 will be 13.7%. The Minister is predicting an increase in the unemployment rate over the first two years in office of this Government. Some people may be fooled by a book cover but people cannot be fooled all the time. They will see that most of the pension levy is being used to cushion the budget deficit. In the final paragraph the Minister predicts an increase in unemployment in the period from last year to the end of next year. People will be very disappointed when they read the details of the initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The Minister states that he will reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015. This will mean extra borrowing and extra interest rates to be paid for an additional year. I ask the Minister to outline the resulting extra cost to the Exchequer of funding the jobs initiative.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_542">Listening to the Minister's speech I now fully understand why the Government downgraded today's announcement from being a jobs budget to a jobs fund to a jobs initiative and the reason is crystal clear. It gives me no pleasure to say that across the country, hundreds of thousands of people will be deeply disappointed by today's jobs initiative. There are 439,571 reasons the Minister and his Government colleagues should have done better and done more.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The election, held a few weeks ago and which brought this Government into office, was all about jobs. However, one must question how many jobs are being promised in this initiative and how many people will be taken off the live register. How many of the 439,571 people can look to a future of employment as a result of this major announcement from the Government? The capital projects such as retrofitting, schools maintenance works, investment in local and regional roads, the smarter travel project, will benefit by an additional €29 million. The Minister estimates that this investment will create jobs per million euro. I congratulate the Minister because this proposal for the total allocation for capital projects will create 348 jobs this year. I do not know if this is what he expected but people will be desperately disappointed at these announcements and hope has been snatched from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">There is no doubt that the Government has entered into office when the country is in an economic mess left by the previous Administration. Despite projections to the contrary, almost all the economic indicators show that the policies of austerity implemented by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party since the 2008 budget continue to drive our economy into the ground. We all know that GDP continues to decline, by 0.7% for the last quarter in 2010 and unemployment continues to rise at 439,571 in April, up 1.6% since April 2010. Inflation and interest rates are steadily rising, creating additional pressures on businesses and families struggling to cope with lower wages, fewer working hours and depressed consumer demand. All the while, despite being told there is no money for investment in job creation, public service provision or adequate social welfare, the previous Government was willing to borrow billions of euros to prop up a banking system with no evident social or economic dividend for the ordinary citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">As a result of three long years of bank bailouts, savage cuts and increasing unemployment, it is no wonder that the Government deficit continues to rise. At the end of the first quarter of 2011, the Government deficit now stands at €9.9 billion, which is €3 billion up on the same period in 2010, thanks to a further injection of €3 billion into Anglo Irish Bank. According to the OECD, Irish debt as a percentage of GDP, continues to rise. It is projected to hit 113% at the end of 2011, up from 105% last year. The European Commission estimates that our debt to GDP ratio will reach 120% by 2014, which would bring the total debt to €190 billion. This is not new because Sinn Féin in this Dáil and previously said this was the direction and the trajectory which the State as taking under the austerity measures. Only last week, the UCD economist, Mr. Morgan Kelly, argued that when liabilities and expenditure from bank recapitalisation and NAMA are taken into account, the State will have a total debt of €250 billion in 2010, amounting to an incredible €120,000 debt per person per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Our society and our economy are in the middle of a perfect storm, comprising three linked crises, a jobs crisis, a debt crisis and a deficit crisis. The outgoing Government believed that the best way to exit this perfect storm was to ignore the need to create jobs, to borrow billions to bail out the banks and heap the burden of the recession on low and middle income families with wage cuts and tax increases.  This approach is simply not working. Those who do not think the figures speak for themselves should go out on to the streets and talk to people who are struggling. I refer, for example, to families that are finding it difficult to pay their bills, businesses that are finding it difficult to secure credit lines and unemployed people who are finding it difficult to get work. Our society and our economy are on their knees. People are looking to the Government to devise and implement solutions to our jobs, debt and deficit crises.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I remind the House of what Fine Gael and the Labour Party said during the election campaign. They told the electorate that if they were elected, job creation would be the priority of the new Government. Deputy Kenny had a five point plan to get Ireland back to work. It is clear that it is now a five point U-turn. He told us that the protection and creation of jobs was his priority. Deputy Gilmore's jobs strategy involved the establishment of a strategic investment bank and was aimed at creating jobs and getting credit flowing to businesses again. Fine Gael was not embarrassed to say it would create 100,000 jobs over five years through the NewERA programme. It told voters it would invest €7 billion in the development of the State's water services, telecommunications, infrastructure and energy industries. I remind Deputies that Fine Gael said it would invest €7 billion in such capital projects. The investment in such projects that has been announced today amounts to an additional €29 million and will create 232 jobs. Fine Gael also promised that 45,000 new employment and training places would be created to target youth unemployment. Some 23,000 of these places were to comprise a national internship programme and 17,000 were to be second chance education places. It also proposed that 700 new places for apprentices and 5,000 new community employment places would be made available. The scale of Fine Gael's job creation, training and education proposals was ambitious, even if the costings were a little fuzzy.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The Labour Party promised before the election that it would put in place a €500 million jobs fund to support new ideas and create employment in strategic sectors of the economy. It also promised to establish a strategic investment bank, with a lending capacity of €2 billion, from the National Pension Reserve Fund. Like Fine Gael, the Labour Party outlined a series of training, education and work placement schemes. It promised to provide 60,000 places during the lifetime of the Government — 30,000 in work experience places for graduates and 30,000 in training and education places for the unemployed. If we were to believe the pre-election promises of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, some 100,000 jobs and 60,000 training places were to be funded to the tune of between €2.5 billion and €7 billion. These commitments were used to win votes, to get the former Opposition Deputies into the positions they are in today and, ultimately, to form the new Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The speed with which Fine Gael and the Labour Party have abandoned their promises is truly breathtaking. Within two weeks of the election, they agreed a programme for Government that contained no figures or targets for job creation in its 64 pages. The strategic investment bank and the NewERA proposals survived the negotiations, but the proposed investment of between €2.5 billion and €7 billion did not. The programme for Government sets out a target number of education, training and work placement programmes, but it is half the figure promised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party during the election campaign. The number of places proposed dropped from 60,000 to just 15,000. Just 20,000 places have been announced today. If ever there was an example of political parties breaking election promises as soon as they got into office, this is it. During the election campaign, the Labour Party promised a jobs strategy and Fine Gael promised a jobs budget. In the programme for Government, these weighty commitments were downgraded to a "jobs fund". This weaker proposal has now been diluted further and is now a revenue-neutral jobs initiative. The spending commitments are gone and the job targets and training places have been slashed.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Before the Minister for Finance and his Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues came to the House today, it was clear to Deputies on this side of the House and people in the wider community that we would get very little. The Government had been playing down the initiative and rightly so because very little was to be presented. Today's announcement needs to be read in conjunction with the savage austerity measures that have been proposed by the Government under the EU-IMF programme. The measures outlined during last week's debate will further depress consumer spending and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the public and private sectors. There is no two ways about it — the measures in the austerity programme, such as the introduction of water rates and property taxes and the reduction in tax credits and tax bands, will depress consumer spending and lead to more people becoming unemployed in the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Some aspects of today's initiative are undoubtedly to be welcomed. When the proposals that have been outlined by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, are taken together, it is clear not only that they will fail to create substantial employment, but that some of them will depress consumer spending and lead to a rise in unemployment. Sinn Féin is on record as welcoming the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage. This is especially welcome for the thousands of workers who lost a significant portion of their income when Fianna Fáil introduced the cut last year. The positive benefit of this measure for the economy is dramatically undermined by the Government's assertion — repeated again today — that it intends to attack the wages of up to 300,000 low-paid workers across the State under the guise of a review of joint labour committees. Any reduction in the income of this section of the workforce will have a devastating impact on thousands of small and medium sized local businesses that depend on the spending power of lower income earners to survive. This will be compounded by the cuts to social welfare being proposed under the guise of removing so-called disincentives to work in the social welfare system. These cuts will further reduce the spending power of the increasing number of people who receive social welfare payments and, in turn, further damage our local retail and service sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The employers' PRSI initiative was a targeted jobs scheme. It meant that those who employed someone who had been undertaking a FÁS training programme or had been unemployed for six months did not have to pay PRSI for 12 months. It was specifically targeted at new employment. It was not available to the existing employees of employers. Although the scheme will continue until the end of this year, it is disappointing that the Minister for Finance failed to announce today that it will continue thereafter. Instead, the Minister announced that he intends to reduce the rate of employers' PRSI from 8.5% to 4.25%. Sinn Féin is concerned that the reduction to 4.25% in the rate of PRSI applying to jobs for which employees are paid up to €356 per week will incentivise employers to decrease the pay of those who currently earn more than this amount, or engage in firing and rehiring to achieve the same end. I ask the Minister to keep a close eye on the practices of those who avail of this incentive. The existence of two rates — 4.25% and 10.75% — will offer employers a major financial incentive to reduce the pay of employees in order to avail of the lower rate. That was not the case in the past because the rates were closer together.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The elements of the initiative that I have mentioned, such as the review of joint labour committees, have nothing to do with job creation. They involve trying to suppress the cost of labour in a vain attempt to increase economic competitiveness. The employees who will be most affected by these wage cuts work in the domestic rather than the export sector, which demonstrates that this is simply a cost-cutting initiative that will drive down wages, increase poverty and lead to further job losses. Any new programmes or expansions of existing schemes that are aimed at improving people's employment are to be welcomed. I have said that some of the Minister's proposals are welcome. Sinn Féin will study in detail the proposal, as outlined today, to provide 20,900 new places under various training schemes. My colleague, Deputy Crowe, will elaborate on that when he addresses the House during this debate on Thursday. The 20,900 new places are a far cry from the 60,000 places promised several weeks ago. That the total additional expenditure in this area is a meagre €29 million speaks for itself. Increased investment in labour activation measures is only worthwhile if there are meaningful jobs on the other side of it. The Government has not properly addressed the issue and is not prepared to stimulate the economy. There is deep fear that we are about to see a repeat of what took place in the 1980s and that people will be trained for a future of social welfare or emigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The substance of today's jobs initiative deals with issues of labour market costs and activation. The questions many people will ask are, "Where are the jobs?" and "How many jobs will the initiative create?" As with the programme for Government, the jobs initiative does not contain job creation targets. The Government proposes to spend a total of €135 million on capital projects in the coming year. Of this figure, €106 million is from existing capital allocations. This means only €29 million of additional expenditure will be allocated in this area in 2011. According to the Government's figures, slightly more than 200 jobs will be created as a result. Considering the level of immediate job growth that could be delivered in this area and the funds at the Government's disposal, its unwillingness to significantly increase investment in labour intensive capital projects constitutes a complete failure. As for the much promised measures to assist small and medium sized enterprise to access credit, the Minister's proposals do not provide detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The Minister has argued that the Government's hands are tied, the jobs initiative must be financially neutral and an alternative is not available. There is always an alternative. We elect Governments to bring forward proposals and, as my colleagues have noted, stand up for Irish interests. Sinn Féin has put forward alternatives. My party has long argued that the Government can neither cut nor borrow its way out of the jobs, debt and deficit crises. While we need to reduce the deficit and debt to GDP ratio and require a strategy to allow the State to return to the international bond markets to resume normal lending, none of these objectives can be achieved through the economics of austerity. We have had four austerity budgets since 2008 and each time unemployment, debt and deficit levels have increased. Austerity is not only incapable of fixing these problems, it makes them worse. The only way to exit the perfect storm of the jobs, debt and deficit crisis is to invest in job creation. The only way to get the economy back on track is to invest in a major stimulus package aimed at saving and creating jobs, assisting small and medium sized businesses, helping hard pressed families and boosting consumer spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">If Sinn Féin were in government, we would invest €2.9 billion over the next 12 months to stimulate economic activity, job creation and consumer spending. Not only is such an approach affordable, it is urgently needed if we are to break the downward spiral created by the Fianna Fail Party policies of austerity which are being followed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Most of us know that there is €14.7 billion left in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, of which €10 billion has been committed by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party for future bank bailouts under the terms of the EU-ECB-IMF austerity programme. Sinn Féin in government would use €2 billion of the remaining €4.7 billion over the next 12 months to fund a job creation and retention programme. Combined with a €900 million package aimed at boosting consumer spending, it would be possible to protect and create in excess of 75,000 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Sinn Féin would spend €1 billion of the €4.7 billion on fast-tracking labour intensive infrastructure projects, including schools and hospitals building projects, upgrading water infrastructure, developing public transport networks and rolling out State-wide broadband services. According to the Department of Finance, every €1 billion invested in capital infrastructure projects generates more than €4 billion in GDP over time, which would amount to an increase of GDP in the order of 3.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Sinn Féin would use a further €600 million for a specific job creation and retention fund which would subsidise small and medium sized enterprises to retain existing staff and, where possible, take on additional staff. This proposal is similar to the successful model developed by the German Government. We would invest €400 million in the State child care and pre-education sector with the objective of building a public child care service, creating jobs and incentivising parents to return to employment by providing child care at an affordable price. Studies have shown that for every €4 invested in child care, €7 is returned to the Exchequer in increased workforce participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In light of the fact that 50,000 young people are due to emigrate in the coming 12 months, we would ring-fence €500 million of the spend in each of the three areas I have cited to specifically target employment opportunities for young people, ensuring that at least 20,000 of the 75,000 jobs would go to those under the age of 25 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">In addition to this €2 billion job creation and protection fund from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, Sinn Féin in government would inject a further €900 million into the economy in the form of a family stimulus package funded through additional tax revenue and the abolition of the universal social charge. The aim of this package of measures would be to reverse some of the heavy burden placed on working families and those on social welfare by the previous Government and, in so doing, boost consumer spending. Our family stimulus package would be funded through a portion of a new 1% wealth tax that we would introduce on net assets of more than €1 million. We estimate this proposal would generate an additional €1 billion in a full calendar year. The package would include €140 million investment in refundable tax credits for 113,000 of the lowest income earners, which would benefit 240,000 people in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">We would also restore the Christmas bonus and thereby put €225 million into the pockets of the State's poorest families and, in turn, local economies across the country. We would boost employment and consumer demand through an additional €50 million per annum investment in frontline community sector employment and an €85 million investment in easing the recruitment embargo in frontline public services such as education, health, the Garda and social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">In addition to this family stimulus package, Sinn Féin would immediately abolish the universal social charge, thereby releasing a further €400 million of spending power into the local economy. We would replace the revenue lost to the State under this measure by introducing a third rate of income tax of 48% on individual incomes over €100,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Combined, the measures proposed by Sinn Féin amount to an investment of €2.9 billion in saving and creating jobs and boosting consumer spending. Alongside this package, we would introduce a range of measures to assist small and medium sized enterprises, the full detail of which my colleague, Deputy Peadar Tóibín, will outline when he addresses the House tomorrow afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The policies of austerity implemented by the Fianna Fáil Party and now supported by Fine Gael and the Labour Party are not working. The approach outlined by the Government today, written under the watchful eye of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, will continue to push our economy and society further into the cycle of unemployment, debt and deficit. It is ironic that for the past six weeks the Government has bored us with the mantra that its jobs budget must be revenue neutral and its hands are tied as a result of the economic circumstances when, only a few weeks ago, it committed to inject €24 billion of taxpayers' money into failed banks. Even last week, it repeated that, subject to the stress tests in Anglo Irish Bank which are due in the next couple of weeks, it will commit further billions of euro, in addition to the €30 billion it has already committed, to this failed bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Many people are asking why it is not possible to have a revenue neutral banking policy when we must have a revenue neutral jobs budget. Such an approach would make a major contribution to solving the problem we face. The Government appears to believe it is fine to take a revenue neutral approach to its number one priority of getting 437,000 into work while investing not millions but billions of euros of our money in failed toxic banks which will never pay a dividend for the economy or to citizens. There are alternatives that can break this cycle, based on investment in jobs and boosting consumer demand. The economy is crying out for stimulus and ordinary people are crying out for a change of direction. Sinn Féin today laid out proposals for a €2.9 billion investment in our society and economy, which is the only credible and costed alternative to the failed policies of austerity that were introduced by Fianna Fáil and unfortunately, despite all the pre-election rhetoric, now are being supported Fine Gael and Labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">What was presented in the Chamber today will be revenue neutral but unfortunately also will be jobs neutral. There is a better and different way and Sinn Féin has led the charge in this regard. While some of the measures announced by the Minister are welcome, they are not even a drop in the ocean of what is required. I appeal to the Government to take up Sinn Féin's proposals, change direction and get the economy back on track. I appeal to it to give hope to the aforementioned 437,000 people, many of whom have given up hope on the present Government and who are giving up hope on this country and are emigrating as a result of failed policies of the past. Unfortunately, these failed policies now are being implemented by the new Government and I appeal to it to change direction.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
          <p eId="para_570">I welcome any initiative, however small, that will relieve the present horrendous position in which more than 400,000 people are unemployed. Even as matters stand, unemployment is destroying the social fabric of society and testing people's well-being to extremes. Moreover, in this context one should not forget that many more than 400,000 people will experience some form of poverty or deprivation or will suffer in some way because when one includes the families and children of those who are unemployed, up to 700,000 people are affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">This afternoon, I tabled a priority question to the Minister for Social Protection pertaining to unemployment and social welfare benefits. It sought a guarantee that they would not be cut or interfered with, because that would drive people further into poverty, and that the Government would stick by the agreement its predecessor stated would alleviate poverty by 2016. Although I did not receive a straightforward answer, I agreed with one part of the Minister's reply to the effect that by creating employment with reasonable wages, poverty could be alleviated and spending in the economy could be generated. Were this to be done, the economy could be helped to grow twofold by reducing unemployment and poverty and not being obliged to pay out huge amounts of money on social welfare, while introducing spending into the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I accept that the Government has been dealt a fairly bad hand by its predecessor, but it is unfortunate that I cannot discern initiatives that would alleviate unemployment. This goes back to the old Fianna Fáil way of providing courses and training schemes for the unemployed, who do not want courses and training schemes. Electricians, fitters, engineers and plumbers are being sent on courses to be retrained but for what? Where will they get work? They want jobs for which they are qualified. Were one to trawl through the 430,000 people who are unemployed, one will find many whose families have paid for them to go through university. However, such people now are being put on training schemes or courses to help them to re-educate themselves to get themselves employed. Years ago, FÁS used to teach people how to use the telephone and how to present themselves for interview. It was, and still is, pathetic. The facts speak for themselves. For instance, although only 20% of FÁS trainees have managed to get some form of work in the past five years, the comparable figure in Scotland is 48%. Yet, Members are aware that FÁS splashed out €643,000 in junkets over the past four years. Consequently, putting people on training courses will not fool anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">In common with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and many bodies, I accept that every million euro invested in infrastructure such as broadband, water conservation, home insulation and so on can create jobs. This is the direction we must take. We must opt to create sustainable, rather than part-time jobs. For example, an ISME survey found that one third of small to medium-sized businesses expect to shed jobs within the next 12 months owing to economic uncertainty, lack of finance and increasing cost to business. Moreover, more than 1,000 small businesses have been deemed to be insolvent since January 2010, resulting in significant job losses nationwide. It also has been revealed that 50% of businesses were refused credit by the banks to keep their business solvent within the past 12 months. One can ask any small business for the solution. Two of my friends, who employed seven people, closed their business in Waterford two weeks ago and they will point to rates and rent. They were paying €38,000 in rent per annum before paying rates or staff. They were obliged to let go seven staff and it will cost the Exchequer approximately €140,000 per year, or €20,000 per year each, to take those seven people out of employment and to put them in receipt of social welfare. If one thinks outside the box, small initiatives like forcing down the cost of rent or of rates come to mind. While there is an associated loss in revenue, there is a long-term gain because of the number of people who would not be placed on the live register. I do not understand who wrote the Minister's speeches or who came up with the jargon in the document I have to hand, but the mathematics appear simple. Although I am not a mathematician, if it costs the Government at least €20,000 between payments and statutory redundancy to put someone on the live register, why can it not come up with a few thousand euro to keep that person in work?</p>

Do they not owe the country anything? Why is there no initiative whereby they could invest some money in the country to create employment? Have such companies not been approached to suggest that instead of employing part-time workers, who may still be in receipt of social welfare benefit, they might invest some money? As they are making a bloody good living out of Ireland, could they not leave a few billion or a few hundred million euros or whatever to create employment? This is the kind of initiative that is not being put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">My final point pertains to procurement and the national procurement policy introduced by the Fianna Fáil-led Government in 2002.

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_584">One of the last phrases in the document read out today was that this was a modest proposal. It was not an overstatement. Seven or eight Deputies are in the Chamber. This initiative is about giving hope to people outside the House, but I do not see where the hope lies. A number of these small initiatives are worthwhile, but the scale is modest. I did not bring notes with me when I came to the Chamber, but I listened and made some notes for my response. I was worried before this debate, but I am slightly nearer to being terrified side at this stage. Were I one of the 440,000 people in question or a member of their families, I would be really worried.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I know what I expected to see, given how people were told on their doorsteps during the election campaign that there would be €2 billion in a strategic investment bank — the Government was told that this might not be a good idea — and shovel-ready jobs that would put thousands of construction workers back to work on large projects. There is no evidence of this despite the fact that it relates to one of the severely affected sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Approximately 60% of all jobs are in the domestic economy, yet we rely on an export-led recovery predicated on foreign direct investment, FDI, companies, namely, the multinationals. I do not know how the Government can deliver on jobs if this is what it is relying upon. The small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector is where jobs will be provided. If every SME created one job, it would go a long way towards resolving the problem. A specific problem relates to the banks and securing finance. It is one matter to claim finance will be available, but the type of financing is important. There is no point in giving term loans if overdrafts are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I am greatly disappointed by the provisions regarding the sectoral wage agreements. "Flexible" and "adaptable" are code words for reducing people's income levels. The €356 threshold for employers' PRSI is just above the minimum wage, yet the Government is setting it as an appropriate target. It is much too low. While I accept there must be a limit, this will reduce the amount of money available to go back into the economy via the jobs created. I do not see how it will deliver the kind of return we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The €470 million to be raised in the coming years via the pension levy is a raid on pension funds. It is not targeted at the people who benefited the most from tax incentives that encouraged people to invest in such schemes. Some schemes have lost considerable amounts and some are insolvent. It is not that long since people had the daylights frightened out of them by television advertisements telling them to put money into pension schemes because they would be poverty-stricken when they were elderly. We are now telling them to put money in and that we will take it out. This is a bad message.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The tourism sector is being targeted. The UK and the US have been mentioned as markets we have lost, including a 32% loss in the number of trips from the UK. If one asks people in the UK about where they will go on their holidays, the answer will be anywhere outside the eurozone because their currency has been devalued. It is not a question of Ireland reducing the cost of rooms, although this is a contributing factor. There is good value in terms of restaurants and so on and people have responded, but the issue is the difference between sterling and the euro. This is the main difficulty we must overcome if we are to encourage the British to visit Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I would have liked to see other provisions. In terms of local schemes, 800 km of roads will be improved. This equates to approximately 30 km per county. If we are discussing modest, then this is modest. Could some consideration be given to the level of return we will receive for this modest investment? That 30% of all money invested by local authorities in road improvements goes towards health and safety matters is problematic. It is too much money and, although I would not want to put anyone at risk, the issue must be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I would have liked to see social welfare changes. For example, one must wait 12 months before one can qualify for the back to work scheme. People have told me that they would have loved to have returned to work or started their own business, but that they lost their entire network of people, their confidence and so on as a result of waiting the 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">In February, Kildare County Council ran out of the money it was using to fund the microeconomic sector. If someone is putting together a viable business, funds must be available. We are underfunding the microeconomic sector. Even if someone drafts a business plan or feasibility study, new start-ups will have less chance of succeeding if we do not invest the level of work required. We have missed the boat.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_597">This initiative was our first opportunity to judge the new Government on its merits and on its own measures. I am sympathetic to the Government's daily mantra in the House, that is, to blame the current main Opposition party for the state in which the former inherited the country. This can carry some weight for a short period, but this is the first time we can point to the Government's part of the solution. It is something on which we can judge the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The measure has all of the characteristics of an election promise that the Government has realised it cannot or is unwilling to keep. This is the second leg of a big back pedal by the Government on its election promises, the first being its promise to revise, amend and dramatically change the deal with the IMF and the EU. This budget — I am insisting on calling it a budget, given that it has the characteristics of a budget, including the applause from the backbenches to the Fine Gael Minister for Finance that we traditionally associate with a budget — is a damp squib that promised so much and delivered virtually nothing. One or two of its provisions are good. For example, the concentration on the tourism industry is to be commended and there are some other concessions here, there and everywhere, but the Government is tinkering at the edges. Where is the vision we would expect from a new Government that has inherited such an appalling situation? This has the markings of the Department of Finance. It has been conceded by the Government that this is being dictated by the IMF and the EU. There is nothing new, no imagination and no big picture. There is simply a tiny tinkering with tax rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I will echo the words of my colleague, Deputy Halligan. I cannot believe that the solution to the unemployment problem is to give a bigger mandate to FÁS, the most discredited agency in the nation. The Government intends to put 20,000 more people on training courses with a company that is utterly discredited, not just because of its junkets but also because of its training. The FÁS training schemes have been exposed as empty vessels in many cases. Why did the Minister not say, instead of promising to spend €500 million, that he would cut the FÁS budget by €500 million? Where is the promise to abolish FÁS? Instead of that, we will train people for jobs that will not necessarily be there at the end. There is no big picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">There is one aspect on which I differ from my colleagues. We refuse to acknowledge the role played by multinationals in job creation and the development of this nation. Around 140,000 jobs have been directly created by multinationals and supported by the IDA, while 250,000 jobs have been created indirectly. That is one in seven jobs here. More importantly, this is the only identifiable area in which we can say the number of jobs increased last year, although it was admittedly by few. At a time of depression, when the economy was in decline, this sector managed to buck the trend and create 1,500 jobs. Why, then, do we not look to this sector — which, after all, accounts for a majority of exports — to support us in our hour of need? Why do we not encourage such companies to come in? These are high-end jobs; the average salary for a job in a multinational is €5,000 to €10,000 higher than for any other type of job. This is an area on which we should concentrate. We should not ridicule the prospect of reducing corporate tax if necessary. If it is necessary to attract more multinationals, let us consider the cost of doing so and say "Yes". It is estimated that a 1% decrease is equivalent to the creation of many thousands of jobs. That formula would result in the creation of many more jobs than the one that the Government, as so eloquently interpreted by Deputy Doherty, has come up with — a derisory figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The solution offered by the Government to raise the money has been touched on by all speakers. It is a serious problem when the Government sees a big lump of money and decides to pillage it. As Deputy Murphy so rightly pointed out, a high percentage — nearly 90% — of the pension funds it intends to raid are in deficit. They are insolvent; they are broke. Their liabilities are larger than their assets. Yet the Government says it will go in there and take €470 million a year out of these broken entities. That is the height of irresponsibility. It is also unjust, because these are people's savings. Let us not dress this up as something else: raiding these pension funds will reduce people's pensions and income. In addition, as one speaker rightly said earlier — I think it was Deputy O'Dea — if the Government can raid the savings of pensioners, it can raid next the savings of depositors. That is what will happen, because it is almost exactly the same thing. Reducing the income of pensioners will reduce their power to spend.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_604">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of speaking on the important and urgent debate on the jobs initiative. Before I go into the details of the debate, I must state that I have many friends and family members who have lost their jobs over the past 12 months. It has been a terrible experience for all of them, and that is why we have to focus on job creation as part of any strategy to deal with the economic mess. We must all think of the human side of losing one's job or not having had one at all. I urge all Deputies in this debate, regardless of party, to focus on this as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Unemployment and emigration are two evils that must be tackled. While I strongly welcome some of the proposals in this package, we have a national and civic duty to come up with other ideas and sensibly costed plans to create employment. This is not the time for sitting on the fence, and we all have a role to play. Our first priority must be to buy Irish products and support our local small businesses by buying from them — whether it is a small local shop, a pub, a restaurant or a factory. This is the way forward and it must be part of the solution. For example, on the subject of funding and supporting small businesses, we should start a low-budget campaign to encourage people to spend an extra €20 per week in their local shops and businesses. This has the potential to create 20,000 new jobs. Let us remind ourselves of the €75 billion in savings that are in bank deposits at the moment. This money mostly belongs to people over 55 years of age because many of them are afraid to spend. I encourage those over 55 to get out there and spend an extra €20 per week out of the few bob they have to support local small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">We also need big job creation projects as part of the strategy. One project that is ready to roll, but on which the Government is dithering, is the plan for the metro north. This has major potential for job creation — a couple of thousand jobs — but would also have considerable local impact for small businesses along the proposed route while it is being constructed. This is something that has gone off the boil in recent weeks, but it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that funding will be provided for building projects in schools. In my constituency, for example, Belgrove National School, which the Minister knows well, needs this funding. The project is ready to roll. It is the same with the Holy Faith school in Clontarf.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I have heard much debate tonight about the private sector and the public sector, but we must not forget the role of the semi-state in job creation. There is major potential in this sector to provide jobs. The recurrent theme over the past 12 months has been that private sector equals good and public sector equals bad. I strongly disagree with this. We need a mix of the public sector and the private sector to get job creation on track. A good-quality, efficient public sector can play a major part in creating jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">With regard to the proposals we heard today, I support the cut in the 13.5% rate of VAT to 12% by 2013. I also support the halving of the lower 8.5% rate of PRSI up to the end of 2013 on jobs paying up to €356 per week. I strongly support reversing the cut in the minimum wage to bring it back to €8.65 per hour. When we are creating jobs and providing employment, we must ensure that people have a reasonable and decent wage. I warmly welcome the abolition of the €3 travel tax as part of the deal with airlines to restore lost routes. There is potential there.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">With regard to employment, we need to fix the cost base and consider issues such as commercial rates. We must stimulate the economy, facilitate enterprise and encourage job creation, particularly on the north side of Dublin.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_612">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I wish to share my time with Deputy Niall Collins.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 and to urge its acceptance by the House. This proposed legislation puts forward a structured, comprehensive and legally sound basis for transforming how politics is funded in our country and for making our democracy more transparent. This Bill, if accepted, will be a positive and historic new departure in how politics is conducted in Ireland. It will break the link between business and politics which has long been advocated from all sides of this House but, as yet, has gone undelivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">All of us in public life recognise that the allegations of improper payments from businesses to politicians, which have flowed from the tribunals over the past decade, has done immense damage to the public perception of politics. It has a created a perception that big business can buy influence by financially supporting the election funds of parties or candidates. If we are to renew politics, we need to overturn this damaging impression. The reality is the only way we can conclusively do this is to ensure that campaign financing is not reliant on business or commercial interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The basic principle underpinning our proposals in this legislation is that elections should be funded only by people entitled to vote in them. Specifically, this Bill contains a commitment to the introduction of an effective ban on the receipt of direct donations given to political parties and candidates from businesses and corporations. This commitment is intended to deliver further openness and transparency in the funding of political parties and political activity in order to assure public confidence in the operation of the political system; to ensure the funding of political activity through smaller contributions from individuals, rather than larger contributions from businesses and corporations; and to improve the reputation of Ireland's democratic structures and electoral processes at an international level, which is very important in today's difficult and competitive economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">As well as effectively ending corporate donations, our Bill will also implement key recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal relating to political funding and cut donation limits so that no large-scale individual donations are possible, meaning that no one can attempt to distort a campaign through deploying his or her own personal fortune. The Bill provides for an annual audit of all income from public or private sources paid to political parties and dramatically increases levels of transparency in political funding and expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I believe this Bill, if enacted, will put in place a fair and transparent system of regulation of political fund-raising and spending, which will begin the process of restoring confidence in our politics after a long and damaging run of controversies relating to political donations. I hope that this debate can be conducted in a constructive manner and free from point-scoring. We do not need the type of partisan debate which says Fianna Fáil had a tent in Galway and Fine Gael has one in Punchestown, while Labour coined in compulsory subs from the unions from many people who do not even support its party. These sorts of debates generate more heat than light and go to the root of why so many people are now apathetic to politics and politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The debate on the Moriarty report was not a very positive occasion. The Government benches are filled with many new members elected on the basis of stirring commitments to change politics. In light of this, the complete absence of any form of self-reflection about what the report said about the last time their parties were in office was striking. That they spent most of their contributions on a report which dealt substantially about Fine Gael fund-raising and preferred to talk about Fianna Fáil was textbook old politics. If one cannot accept any criticism of one's leaders and parties how can one change anything? If we are honest with ourselves as public representatives, we should all accept that over the years, the fund-raising practices of all the main parties have done damage to politics. That is why today our debate must be about change and how we give effect to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">For the record, I readily admit that in regard to my own party, there have been some unedifying and unacceptable abuses in regard to fund-raising and donations. I deeply regret that. I am determined that on my watch, as leader of Fianna Fáil, this will neither be tolerated nor possible. From the moment I took over as leader of my party, I made clear my intention to bring an end to corporate donations.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">During the general election campaign I ensured that Fianna Fáil committed to the introduction of a Bill banning corporate donations within one month of the reconvening of a new Dáil and that we would seek all-party support for it. This is also a position that Fianna Fáil had taken in the previous Government and we had prepared a draft Bill, which we had intended to introduce in February, had an earlier than planned election not intervened.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">On Monday, 11 April we published the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 following through on our election commitment. In this respect, and in fairness it should be said, we are only following belatedly in the footsteps of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who, to his credit, was the first political leader of one of the main parties to come out categorically against corporate donations. It was a brave stance and one in which he was ahead of his time. The position was reversed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, as one of his first acts when he became leader of Fine Gael. Since then, Fine Gael has engaged in significant corporate fund-raising and the Labour Party, too, has not been slow in accepting corporate donations.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Passing this Bill will create a new level playing pitch for everyone in Irish politics where corporate donations no longer impinge on our political life. This is now within our grasp.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Fine Gael Party in its famous — or infamous — five point election plan committed to banning corporate donations, it must be said belatedly following years of vigorous corporate donation fund-raising. The Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, on behalf of the Labour Party, has made a similar public pronouncement. It is worth emphasising that because of these factors, this Bill should not be contentious, unless this House is going to revert once again to the same old charade of politics as usual.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">We all agree that corporate donations should go, so the message from these benches is to get on with it. We all agree, so why delay? The only conceivable reason the Government will have for voting down this Bill tomorrow night is that we, on this side of the House, have introduced it. It is to be hoped that politics in this country is ready to move on from this stale and cynical approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The current stated position of all of the main parties in this House is that corporate donations should be banned. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have all given real and concrete commitments to this effect, as did other parties and Independents on this side of the House. Each of these parties campaigned on getting rid of corporate donations during the last election. As recently as 11 April this year, the Taoiseach told Midwest Radio that banning corporate donations is a priority for his Government. This Bill will specifically test that commitment. It gives everyone the opportunity to deliver on their election promises and to walk the walk on banning corporate donations.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">This Bill can and should be accepted by the Government. Especially given that the Government has said in the past that it supports all of the measures in our Bill, we expect it to let it proceed to committee. To do otherwise brings the Government's credibility into question.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">After ten weeks in office, it is surprising that the Government has yet to put a single new piece of legislation before the Dáil or to publish a policy White Paper. The contrast with the first ten weeks of the new British Government is dramatic. It is about time the Dáil started enacting changes promised to the electorate rather than just talking about them.  It is clear there are no principles in this Bill that the Government parties oppose, or at least were publicly opposed to at election time. If we in this House are being straight up about our commitment finally to consign corporate donations to history, there is no need to delay further. Stalling only creates further doubt about the willingness of politicians to reform and to change the way we do politics. It does this House no service and it erodes further confidence. Specifically, the Dáil should be seen to act decisively and without delay on the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal on how the regulation of political funding is organised. Hand-wringing and foot-dragging on these recommendations are not good enough. Earlier the Taoiseach made a rather vague and superficial intervention on the recommendations. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is also on the record as expressing doubt about them. Will he clarify if there is a commitment on the Government's part to implement all the recommendations made in the Moriarty tribunal report on political fund-raising and corporate donations?</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The public is right to be cynical if the body politic cannot get its act together to implement the recommendations in a reasonable timeframe. On 29 March the Taoiseach told the Dáil that the Government would act definitively and decisively on the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal, with Departments to report back in four weeks on how they should be implemented. When the Government promised action on the report's findings within one month, we took this in good faith. However, that deadline has passed by almost two weeks and, having heard nothing further but silence emanating from the Government benches, we are now bringing forward our own initiatives. The Government has missed its own self-imposed deadline for action on Mr. Justice Moriarty's recommendations. With legislation, most of which was initiated by the previous Government, piling up, Fine Gael and the Labour Party may be tempted to quietly put this issue on the backburner. That is not good enough and Fianna Fáil will not be complicit in letting the Government off the hook. The issues at stake are too important.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The Government has committed to introducing a similar Bill to Fianna Fáil's. However, we see no reason to postpone action indefinitely by waiting for its publication. The fastest way of addressing these crucial issues which go to the core of the conduct and the credibility of politics is to pass the Fianna Fáil Bill and allow it to proceed to Committee Stage. Should there be a need for technical amendments, they could be considered and deliberated upon on Committee Stage. Our objective is to ensure corporate donations would effectively be banned before the summer recess and that a formal constitutional ban would take effect before the end of the year. While the issues involved are not complex, the measures we are proposing are based on the clear legal advice that a formal ban on corporate donations could be unconstitutional, advice the Government would also have received.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The most significant part of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 is that it would introduce a restriction on corporate donations from companies, trade unions, societies and building societies to political parties and politicians, requiring the disclosure of any donation in excess of €100. This would amount effectively to a ban. This approach has been taken because of legal advice that a complete ban would be unconstitutional. We are separately publishing a Bill for a referendum on corporate donations which could take place this year. Accordingly, section 5 of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 states it is not possible to prohibit the making of donations by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies without a constitutional amendment since to do so would infringe their constitutional right to freedom of expression. Our constitutional amendment would allow for a more comprehensive ban on corporate donations by ensuring only citizens in the State who have the right to vote in any election or referendum would be entitled to make political donations to organisations or people involved in political campaigning. Our proposal excludes those only entitled to vote for candidates seeking election to the university seats in the Seanad. To ensure no added significant cost to the taxpayer, we are committed to proposing that the referendum be held on the same day as the Presidential election later this year. To ensure this timeframe can be met, this morning I introduced the Twenty-Ninth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill which will be published and distributed later this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Government seems to have accepted that a complete ban on corporate donations would be unconstitutional since it also talks about holding a referendum to ban such donations. We urge it to follow our lead on the matter. While it is not possible to introduce an outright ban on corporate donations until a referendum on the matter is held later in the year, the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 proposes to bring greater transparency to the way in which such donations are made, while also making it significantly more difficult for them to be made. Section 5 provides that all corporate donations over €100 would have to be declared within 14 days, authorised by a general meeting and registered with the Standards in Public Offices Commission, SIPO. It would also ensure any donation by a company or trade union exceeding €100 in value would be difficult to make and extremely transparent. First, the company would have to apply to the SIPO to be registered as a "donating company" or a "donating trade union". It would have to provide it with full details of the organisation, membership and shareholding of the company and have secured support for the donation through a vote of its members or at a general meeting. If a donation was subsequently made which could not exceed €2,500 to a political party, the Bill requires that any donation in excess of €100 in value would have to be published in the company's accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Section 5 would also introduce a new and welcome provision into electoral law, based on the recommendations contained in chapter 62.12.vii of Mr. Justice Moriarty's report. A company would be required to publish in its accounts details of any government contracts entered into or that it intended to enter into at the time of the making of the donation where the contracts exceed €1,000 in value. This provision is designed to ensure transparency. This builds on another important Moriarty tribunal recommendation, namely, that a donor should be obliged to identify any relevant financial, commercial or other interests if donations exceed a certain threshold. This would include identifying any government contracts or involvement in procurement processes. This requirement is not simply limited to the company but also includes its directors, shadow directors or significant shareholders. Section 6 would ensure failure to comply with these requirements would be a criminal offence, punishable on summary conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months or a fine not exceeding €5,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The Bill provides for a major reduction in both the levels at which donations to political parties, third parties and candidates must be disclosed, as well as a reduction in the maximum allowable donations. As well as drawing on Mr. Justice Moriarty's recommendations, the Bill draws upon recommendations made both by the Council of Europe and the SIPO. In 2009 the Council of Europe group of states against corruption, of which Ireland is a member, undertook an evaluation study of Ireland's political system, specifically examining the issue of party funding. The report makes a series of recommendations to enhance transparency and improve controls in the funding of political activity in Ireland. They include a recommendation that all registered political parties should prepare independently audited accounts that would be made public in a timely and accessible way. It is also recommended that consideration be given to lowering the current disclosure threshold to an appropriate level, although a precise figure is not specified. These recommendations from the Council of Europe are covered in the Bill. By passing it, we can do our reputation some good. The Government should be cognisant of this in its deliberations on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Several issues addressed in the Council of Europe group's report were also the subject of recommendations by the SIPO when it addressed the issue of disclosure thresholds: "If the intention of the legislation is to provide for transparency and openness in relation to party funding and expenditure, then it is not achieving this aim". In regard to these and other recommendations, key changes contained in the Bill include reducing the maximum allowable individual donations to political parties and third parties from €6,348 to €2,500, with the level at which these must be publicly declared to fall from €5,078 to €1,000. It would reduce the maximum allowable donation to a candidate from €2,539 to €1,000 in any one year, with the level at which these must be publicly declared falling from €634 to €500.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The Bill would introduce an amendment to section 23A of the Electoral Act 1997, based on one of the recommendations in the Moriarty tribunal report on political funding which identified a problem where one donor made a series of donations all under the declarable threshold. The amendment would provide that where a donor made a donation in the same year to two or more persons of the same party, these would be treated as one donation to a political party or third party, ensuring no more than €2,500 could be donated in total per annum by a donor.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Another key Moriarty tribunal recommendation stated political donations should be disclosed in a reasonable timeframe following an election. Accordingly, the Bill would require the publication of donation statements within 25 days of polling, as opposed to the current arrangement of 58 days for unsuccessful candidates and until 31 March of the following year for successful candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">This Bill provides for SIPO to audit the accounts of political parties each year, with the income and expenditure account, balance sheet and donations statement to be published. A further recommendation by Mr. Justice Moriarty was that SIPO shall publish a record of all donations received by a political party, which shall include the size and amount of all donations and whether the identity of the donor is publishable or not. This will ensure that all income of political parties is disclosed to SIPO. This will also apply to Independent candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I believe that the measures as set out in this Bill are necessary, appropriate and desirable. They will put in place a strong foundation for a political system in Ireland that is, in Mr. Justice Moriarty's words, "not subject to the invisible or disguised influence of powerful individuals or entities" as well as ensuring a new "measure of transparency and openness to scrutiny [which] is essential". I want to conclude by reading the following insightful and wise words into the record of the House:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_640">All over the world, it is recognised that financial support from business to politicians is perceived by the public to have one purpose [namely] the securing of commercial advantage. Claims that such donations are made from disinterested motives are simply not believed. As the lurid tribunal scandals play out before our eyes, one thing is clear. We cannot restore politics until the perceived link between political contributions and public policy is broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">These words were spoken by the current Minister for Finance in 2001. I sincerely urge the Government to accept this Bill and to help us to finally begin to restore politics and to break the perception of a link between political contributions and public policy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_348">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to tonight's debate on this important issue. It is fair to say that as political practitioners we all know our fair share about fund-raising. It is important the debate this evening and tomorrow evening is held in a constructive manner. We must impress upon the wider public at every available opportunity that politics and the practice of politics and funding of political parties is necessary. Political parties and campaigns do not run on fresh air. However, we must in this regard try to achieve a balance which will reinstate confidence in the profession of politics which has, during the past number of years, taken a severe denting. We all partake from time to time in exercises with the various third level institutions and in other forms of research. Often the focus of questionnaires circulated to us by the institutions and other researchers focus on the standing of politicians, politics and political parties. We need to ensure a collective approach on this issue within the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I have been a Member of this House since 2007. I believe too often a partisan approach is taken on issues common to all of us. With the exception of the Independents, all Members of this House are members of political parties of one shade or another. As I said earlier, it is fact of life that political parties must fund-raise. If we are to have active and interactive politics the profession must be put on a sustainable footing, while ensuring the public remains confident everything is being done in a proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Deputy Martin in proposing the Second Stage reading of this Bill referred to the Moriarty tribunal. It behoves all of us in this House to take seriously Mr. Justice Moriarty's recommendations. The Moriarty tribunal sat for many years, culminating in the recently published report which was debated at length in this House a few weeks ago. Given the number of years for which the tribunal sat, the detail of what was investigated and how the tribunal went about its business in following the money trail, we must take seriously Mr. Justice Moriarty's recommendations. Whether through the Bill before us or by way of other legislation, these recommendations must be implemented. The wider public expects that. There has been fair criticism of the tribunals in terms of the length of time taken to come to their recommendations. However, cost and time aside, it behoves all of us to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">There has been too much populism and political point scoring in this House down through the years in regard to the Galway tent, Punchestown or, in respect of the Labour Party, trade union alignment. There is in place legislation which provides for the accounting and recording of moneys of particular events. The fact is that all political parties and candidates engage in fund-raising exercises and activities. However, we must ensure a common approach in terms of how we go about this, which is seen to be, and is, above board and must do so in a fair and balanced manner. In this regard, we need to consider broadening the base of political financial support. The recent Obama campaign included the targeting of a large number of people to donate one or two dollars, thus allowing people to take ownership of their political parties for a small fee, which is a good way to get involved. It is better for parties to do this rather than being seen to be aligned to big business.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">All political parties have operated various fund-raising mechanisms down through the years, regardless of whether one believed them to be right or wrong. Aligned to whatever legislation is introduced must be a code of practice. I do not wish to engage in political point scoring but I recall a friend of mine who is a Fianna Fáil councillor in business in the southern half of the country receiving a letter from a fund-raiser in the Labour Party, who is now a Minister. It was a cold calling letter sent to him because he was on a register of business directories. Is it right that my party or any other can spray correspondence in all directions seeking support because they may, according to opinion polls, be the next parties in Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Constitutional issues arise and as such we will have to hold a referendum to provide for a complete ban on corporate donations. It will be important that a commonsense approach is taken to this matter. In the absence of a referendum and anything that cannot be legislated for, all political parties should consider signing up to a code of practice. This idea could be first discussed by the party Whips.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The Bill seeks greater involvement of SIPO relating to corporate donations, which I support. The notion of companies who intend donating having to apply to go on a register of potential donors for political purposes is a good idea. Too often, there has been hard evidence and anecdotal evidence that companies donate to individuals and political parties to gain competitive advantage. From that point of view, I support the Bill. I welcome its timely publication and ask that the Government parties take cognisance of it and expedite it. We are at a crossroads in this country. We have moved on from the election and this is a new start for everybody, including the Government. The people rightly want us to take whatever measures are within our ability to promote and re-instill confidence in the political system. I believe that is paramount.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_349">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_649">Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin ábhar fíor-thábhachtach seo. I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I am disappointed the Government cannot accept the Second Stage of this Bill. If it did accept the Bill, it would have six months to replace it with a Government Bill. This would put a time limit on the Government's efforts. Much work has been done already on this Bill, much of it during the term of the previous Government. Contrary to constant media reports, there was no difficulty in the Fianna Fáil Party with dealing with this issue. We agreed it had to be dealt with, but we had to deal with some legal issues which have been well outlined today.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Laws should not be there to trip people up. We have all read historical accounts of how the innocent were caught and the guilty got away because the law was so complex that ordinary people did not understand it. It is time we simplified and codified this legislation in a new way. Even the fact that the monetary limits are in odd amounts, because they were set in the days of the Irish pound, needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I have always had a slight reservation about banning corporate donations completely. This is because of something that happened once, totally innocently. An event was being organised locally with a subscription of €100. That is not a huge amount of money in any person's language. I happened to notice that one of the cheques was in the name of an individual. The person had a private business and, obviously, wrote the cheque on the company account, because "Teo." was written after the individual's name. It would take a fairly sharp person to realise that it was, technically, a corporate, and not a private, donation. That is the kind of tripping up of an innocent action that we must avoid.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">My preoccupation was never with whether a donation came from a corporate or private source but with the amount of money involved. The Bill makes very good steps in that regard. For example, it proposes reducing the total amount one can give to a party to €2,500 and the amount above which one would have to publish to €1,000. The maximum donation from an individual would be €1,000 and the amount above which one would have to publish would be €500. These are modest amounts of money and are realistic. No matter how little a party receives, it must account for it in its donation statement. Therefore, this is a step in the right direction. It is balanced, as it must be.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">On the other hand, we all go to party meetings. Someone might pay a membership fee of €5 or put €20 in the bucket at a church gate collection. When Fine Gael recently had their national collection, Fianna Fáil people coming out the church would not pass the Fine Gael collectors without putting a few euro in the bucket. I often saw Fine Gael people putting money in our bucket, because they respected people's involvement in politics and were mature about what was going on. The idea that one would have to declare every euro donated, which seems to be the demand in the media, is unrealistic. The idea that someone who throws a fiver into a bucket is likely to hugely influence the political system is bizarre.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Therefore, we need limits under which a declaration is not required. What we propose is reasonable. I would have no problem declaring every donation. I do not take political donations. The last €50 euro went into my political donations statement account five years ago. That is my decision. It is how I operate. On the other hand, I have, quite legitimately, passed money on to the party that was given to me for the party. The limits we propose are operable and reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Another issue must be dealt with. The difficulty of multiple donations can arise, especially with people who have their own personality and a good number of companies. Such a person could try to circumvent the law by giving large sums of money to several parties, spend quite a bit of money keeping in with all sides and donate to the very limit. That type of multiple donation should be dealt with forthwith, and it is addressed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I would like to touch on the issue of the publication of the accounts of political parties. Our own party, for some reason I can never understand, traditionally has not published all its financial affairs. Whatever justification there might have been in times gone by, and I do not know what it was, it is not justifiable today. We live in a totally different atmosphere. The idea that all political parties would publish their accounts is reasonable and practical. I have one caveat, being practical about this issue. Most of us have a central party, and it should publish its accounts. We also have local branches. In my constituency there are 80 branches — we call them cumainn — eight comhairlí ceantair and a comhairle dáil cheantair. One must multiply that across the country. How could a party get down to every last fiver given to a local branch and get it all together in some super account? I do not know how good other parties are at getting their guys to fill in all the fivers donated at the AGM. We normally charge a fiver. In the midlands I know it is often more, because they are richer than we are in the west.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_659">We need to deal with this practical issue. I often ask our European colleagues to put some kind of <i>de minimis</i> clause in legislation. It is easy to include a <i>de minimis</i> measure to deal with this small local issue, which in no way influences anything at a national level. We should ensure that is provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">We must consider the issue of referendums and interest groups. I have no problem fighting elections with professional politicians who are fighting by the same rules as myself. I have never spent big money because I believe the best way to win an election is through the hard slog of volunteer workers. There is no way of buying an election that matches getting a big team of committed people together and doing the work. On the other hand, it is wrong if campaigning groups, in referendums or otherwise, can spend huge sums of money from sources they never declare and fight very well-financed campaigns against professional politicians and parties who have been fighting with transparent and limited resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Things happened in the past that should not have happened. Tarring everyone with the same brush is wrong. Most politicians and parties have acted honestly and fairly. When people start pointing the finger at individuals, I am reminded on an Irish seanfhocal: an té atá thuas óltar deoch air; an té atá thíos buailtear cois air; an té atá saor chaithfeadh sé cloch. They toast him who is up; to him who is down they give a kick; and let him who is free throw a stone. The implication is clear. There are many ways, beyond money, of not playing fair in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Money was wrongly used in the past. I will not point a finger but it may have been used to influence decisions. I never collected enough money to be influenced by anyone and no one ever came to me, in all my life as a Minister, and said I would have to do this or that because certain people had contributed. I do not know, and no one ever intimated to me, who gave money to my party. I never saw donations as influencing decisions. There is a possibility, however, that it could exercise influence. Perhaps it did, and we will leave to do so those who have been appointed to decide those things. If donating money influenced decisions, then it must be stopped. We must have limits that put influence off limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Let us not fool ourselves. Human beings are creative in how they get their way. At times, we are all prone to other kinds of political dishonesty that are equally wrong. There is the dishonesty of promising things we know we can never fulfil and of buying elections with promises. I have often said in Galway that if, at an election time, someone proposed to build a bridge from Connemara to America, there are very few politicians who would not promise to do it. They would say: "Fine, lads, whatever you want me to sign up for." They would know they would renege on the promise afterwards because it was not possible to do what was promised. Let us be honest about it — that is corrupting of politics. We have had elections where promises were made when it was known at the time by the people who made them that they could never be fulfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I wish to raise a final issue which came to my attention when, along with my colleagues, I decided not to take the ministerial severance pay. I made an inquiry as to whether I could donate some of the money I was foregoing to the party. I was told by the authority that if I gave more than €5,000, it would be a political donation, although it was a legitimate sum to which I was entitled from the State and which I wanted to pass on to the party of which I am a member and a public representative. That response was fair enough, so I decided to leave the money in total to the State as it was the simplest thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">However, I have heard politicians in this House boast that they only take the average industrial wage, and I understand those people have the full amount of their wages put through the books of the Houses. Somebody needs to explain to me how they manage to make donations I could not make.</p>

I would have loved to give that kind of money to Fianna Fáil, which could badly do with it at present. However, I was told that while I could take the money myself and pay tax on it, if I donated more than €6,350 a year, it was a political donation over the limit and I was not allowed to do it. I could spend it on myself but I could not give it to the party.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
          <p eId="para_668">At the outset, I acknowledge that the Bill contains some good and welcome proposals and I would not take issue with a number of the points made by Deputy Ó Cuív. However, in many respects the Bill is too limited and narrowly focused. It also contains a number of flaws that would make some of its intended provisions unworkable. The Government has a more ambitious programme for the reform of political funding arrangements and we will, therefore, be opposing this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I am somewhat surprised by the speed at which this Bill has been brought forward. Notwithstanding what Deputy Ó Cuív said, there was ample opportunity for the previous Administration not only to publish a Bill, as Fianna Fáil has now done, but to have it enacted and implemented. Clearly, this did not happen during the lifetime of the previous Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">However, rather than focusing on what should have been, I want to talk about what is going to be. I want to deal specifically with what the Government will do to radically overhaul politics and Government work. Our plans for reform are set out in the programme for Government, which we are already implementing.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Provision is made in the Government's legislation programme for the current Dáil term for the publication of an electoral (amendment) (political funding) Bill. This Bill will amend the Electoral Acts so as to implement political funding commitments set out in the programme for Government. Work is currently under way on its preparation and I expect draft legislation will be published in a matter of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">On matters related to the reform of the funding and operation of politics, the programme for Government makes the following commitments. We will introduce spending limits for all elections, including presidential elections and constitutional referendums, including for a period in advance of scheduled local, European, general and presidential elections. We will significantly reduce the limits on political donations to political parties and candidates to €2,500 and €1,000, respectively, and require disclosure of all aggregate sums above €1,500 and €600, respectively. We will introduce the necessary legal and constitutional provisions to ban corporate donations to political parties. Our open government legislation will also establish an electoral commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Public funding for political parties will be tied to the level of participation by women as candidates achieved by those parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Government is serious about changing the way politics is conducted. Although we have been in office for just over two months, tangible actions have already been taken. Last week, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, announced decisions taken by Government to deliver real and tangible political reforms in regard to other commitments outlined in the programme for Government. These decisions include changing the terms of reference of the constituency commission to facilitate a reduction in the number of TDs. A constituency commission is due to be established upon the publication of the 2011 census preliminary results, which are due in June. That commission will report within three months of the publication of final census results in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">It also includes the reduction of the presidential election spending limit from €1.3 million to €750,000 and a reduction in the amount that candidates can be reimbursed for expenses from €260,000 to €200,000. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to show restraint in all aspects of spending involving public life and our belief that we need to start at the very top. In all walks of life, we have to do more with less, and that applies to political parties and politicians as much, if not more, than anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Government has also decided that Dáil by-elections should be held within six months of a vacancy occurring. Democracy and the holding of elections are a right. They should not be regarded as an inconvenience to be avoided and it should not be in the gift of the Government of the day to decide if and when by-elections are held. Separate legislation is currently being prepared to give effect to these changes, which follow other reforms already introduced by the Government including the removal of the automatic entitlement to ministerial cars and drivers, the cutting of the pay of the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State, and the removal of severance pay for Ministers. We are a Government in a hurry and we have a lot to do. However, we also want to do things right and to implement legislation that will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I will now address some of the measures contained in the Bill. Provision is made to place restrictions on corporate donations from companies, trade unions, societies and building societies. However, there are a number of other corporate structures that have not been included. For example, no provision is made for donations made by partnerships, unincorporated bodies, trusts, sole traders and non-governmental organisations. As it stands, the Bill before us would allow a number of corporate-type bodies to continue to give political donations, while restricting others. In its present form, the Bill would not work in practice as it does not address all donors who are not individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The Bill provides for a reduction in the level of donations that may be accepted by political parties from €6,348 to €2,500, and by candidates and elected members from €2,539 to €1,000. The Bill provides for the level at which donations must be declared to be reduced from €5,078 to €1,000 for political parties and from €654 to €500 for candidates and elected members.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The provisions contained within the Fianna Fáil Bill represent a change from what was being proposed by that party during the recent general election, with greater reductions now being advocated. In fact, three separate positions have been adopted by the party opposite since the beginning of this year. There was the position taken when in government, then the position taken during the general election campaign and, now, the position has been modified again in the Bill before us. Each change of policy has been an advance on the previous position, and it would be churlish not to welcome this. However, I am of the view that the programme for Government and our own plans for legislative change on political funding are more comprehensive, better thought through and will be more effective in providing the improvements that the people of Ireland want to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Bill before us would require the publication of donation statements within 25 days of polling by unsuccessful candidates and by 31 March of the following year for successful candidates. This change purports to address a recommendation in the Moriarty tribunal report for information on donations to be made available in real time. However, the measure put forward would not appear to provide any demonstrable improvement on current arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The Fianna Fáil Bill provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission would audit the accounts of political parties each year, with the income and expenditure account, balance sheet and donations statement being published. This provision does not appear to have sufficient regard to existing arrangements that are in place for reporting by political parties to the Standards in Public Office Commission. Currently, political parties are required to submit audited financial statements in respect of State funding received under the Electoral Acts and through the party leader's allowance. On the one hand, we would still have parties continuing to prepare these audited statements that the Standards in Public Office Commission would examine, while on the other hand the Standards in Public Office Commission would also be carrying out a further separate audit. I am not dismissing the proposal put forward, but clearly we need to avoid duplication and overlap and we need to target the resources of the Standards in Public Office Commission in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Fianna Fáil has stated it will extend the supervision of the Standards in Public Office Commission to independent expenditures in referendums. The Government agrees that change is needed in the regulation of spending and donations at referendums, as outlined by Deputy Ó Cuív. Particular problems have previously been identified in regard to the regulation of spending and the sources of income of groups campaigning at referendums. I refer in particular to a report prepared in March 2009 by the Standards in Public Office Commission on the operation of provisions applying to third parties at the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty in 2008. Third parties are typically campaign groups and are defined under section 22(2)(<i>aa</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 as a person other than a registered political party or a candidate at an election which accepts a donation exceeding €126.97 in value.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Referendum campaigns involve decisions on matters that have significant and far-reaching implications for the country. It is important that citizens know how much money is being spent by campaign groups and from where they get their money. However, the actual provision in the Fianna Fáil Bill amounted to a relatively minor amendment in the definition of what constitutes a third party, and a referendum would appear to be wholly insufficient to achieve anything of substance. It will take much more than inserting a few lines into the Electoral Acts to bring about effective reform in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The explanatory memorandum published with the Bill states that it seeks to apply equivalent obligations in regard to financial transparency to Independent or non-party candidates as apply to political parties. It is doubtful whether the measures in the Bill would have this effect. The provisions in the relevant section of the Bill appear to relate more to third parties than Independent candidates. In short, although the stated intention of the Fianna Fáil legislation in this area appears to be clear, the measures to achieve the policy objectives do not appear to match up. The same point can be made, specifically in regard to this measure, but also more generally in regard to the Bill as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">In making these observations and criticisms of the Bill, I acknowledge the work done in its introduction and acknowledge the understanding on the part of Fianna Fáil that more needs to be done to the Bill in any event to amend it and make it workable in practice. The press release issued by Fianna Fáil when it published this Bill on 11 April states: "We believe that the Government should support this Bill and allow it to go forward to Committee where amendments can be made". However, this Bill is too incomplete and not sufficiently comprehensive and for that reason the Government cannot support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">An important context for the Government in the introduction of its legislation to reform political funding is the recent report on the tribunal into payments to politicians and related matters, more commonly referred to as the Moriarty tribunal report. The private Members' Bill before the House purports to address recommendations made in the tribunal report albeit in a relatively limited and selective manner that lacks co-ordination. It is important to re-cap on what is actually in the Moriarty tribunal report. In line with its terms of reference, the tribunal put forward observations on the subject of political funding and its report makes 12 specific recommendations in this area. In paragraph 62.07 it is acknowledged that considerable advances have been made in the governance of political donations since the matters into which the tribunal has inquired arose. The report mentions the Electoral Act 1997 introduced by the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 and the legislation which established the Standards in Public Office Commission but under current regulations the large-scale donations that were the subject of the tribunal's inquiries could not now be accepted. The maximum donation that can now accepted by a political party is €6,348, while the maximum that can be accepted by a politician or candidate is €2,539. The programme for Government commits to reducing these amounts to €2,500 and €1,000 respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The Moriarty tribunal recommendations represent a substantial contribution to consideration of policy in this area. They are made in a report that lays bare the failings in the system that existed at the time. Although rules and regulations have been changed since the 1990s, some of the failings identified still prevail. The potential continues to exist for undue influence to arise from the corporate funding of politics, to the detriment of the wider public good. In addition to the potential for corruption, the perception that there is some form of mutually beneficial relationship between politics and business can have a corrosive impact on public trust. This is based on the view that the corporate funding of politics contributes to a public belief that those who pay can exert inappropriate influence in the formation of policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Therefore, the recommendations in the tribunal report are timely, as the Government is embarking on a major programme of legislative reform to improve governance and Government. Every recommendation is being considered in the preparation of this legislation. The programme for Government already commits to making radical changes to how politics is funded and operated here. On the most crucial issue in this area, the programme for Government goes beyond what the Moriarty report was in a position to recommend. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_688">It may be observed in passing that, ultimately, the only cast iron guarantee against corruption and abuses in the political system, and against the risk of distortions in the democratic process that may arise from the private funding of political parties and political representatives, would be to provide for a complete ban on private funding and, as in some other European countries, to fund political parties entirely from the public purse.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_689">The desirability and feasibility of such a general ban, having regard also to any constitutional law issues that might arise and to the national financial exigencies, is pre-eminently a matter for the Oireachtas and for public debate and consideration, and falls outside the remit of this Tribunal, whose focus under its terms of reference is on political funding from undisclosed sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The programme for Government contains a commitment to address corporate donations, to substantially reduce the level of donations that can be accepted and to reduce significantly the level at which donations must be disclosed. It may also be noted that the recommendations and views put forward in the tribunal report have some similarity with recommendations made by other bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Ireland is a member of the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO. In 2009, this body undertook an evaluation study of Ireland's political system, specifically examining the issue of party funding. Among the recommendations made was that all registered political parties should prepare independently audited accounts that would be made public in a timely and accessible way. It also recommended that consideration be given to lowering the current disclosure threshold for political donations. This report recommended the extension of the election spending control period, pointing out that expenditure outside of this period is not disclosed. Stronger investigative powers for the Standards in Public Office Commission are also advocated. Similar recommendations have been made by the Standards in Public Office Commission. Over the years, the commission has raised a number of concerns about the effectiveness of certain aspects of political funding legislation and has put forward specific recommendations for change. The commission's 2009 annual report, published in July 2010, is a case in point. Chapter Three of the report deals with the commission's responsibilities under the Electoral Acts. The report notes on page 32, that,"while the current system of regulation of political funding has some strong features, there are other fundamental measures which are yet to be developed". The same annual report also summarises the most significant proposals from previous reports of the commission in an appendix, along with updates on any progress which may have taken place in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">It is clear from the extensive and detailed range of recommendations made by the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, the Standards in Public Office Commission and, more recently, the Moriarty tribunal, that there is no shortage of analysis on the shortcomings in Ireland's arrangements for the funding of politics. The one thing that has been lacking is a willingness to act. That may have been the case before but is so no longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The Moriarty tribunal was set up at a time when politics and political parties were predominantly funded from private sources. It is important to acknowledge the extent to which the taxpayers and citizens have taken on much of this burden in the interim. Considerable State resources are now committed to supporting the operation of our political system. There are three direct sources of public funding. Qualifying political parties can receive funding under section 18(1) of the Electoral Act 1997, whose provisions were introduced in 2001. To qualify, a political party must be included on the register of political parties and must have obtained at least 2% of the first preference vote at the preceding Dáil general election. Based on the most recently available information, the total funding dispersed through this source in 2009 was €5,438,385. This funding is used for the general conduct and management of a party's affairs, and cannot be used for electoral purposes. Each qualifying political party must submit an annual statement of expenditure of this funding and an auditor's report to the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The party leaders' allowance provides for the payment of an annual allowance to the parliamentary leaders of a qualified political party in respect of expenses arising from the parliamentary activities of their party, including research. To qualify, a party must have at least one member in the Dáil or Seanad. An allowance is paid to the party leader in respect of each member of the Dáil and Seanad. The combined total received by all party leaders through this source in 2009 was €8,164,879. Provision for these payments is made in the Oireachtas Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act 2001. Each party leader must submit an annual statement of expenditure of this funding and an auditor's report to the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The Electoral Act 1997 provides for the reimbursement of election expenses to qualifying candidates who achieve one quarter of the quota at a Dáil, European Parliament or presidential election. The maximum amounts that can be reimbursed to a candidate are €8,700 for a Dáil election and €38,092 for a European election.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">In the 2007 Dáil general election, some 304 candidates qualified for reimbursement payments and this amounted to €2,368,013 in total. In the 2009 European Parliament elections, a total of 26 candidates qualified for reimbursement payments and amounted to €981,860 in total. Up to now the maximum reimbursement in a presidential election was €260,000. This is to be reduced to €200,000 for the 2011 presidential election.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Apart from direct sources of funding there are indirect supports. Candidates at a Dáil, European or presidential election are entitled to send one item of post free of charge to each elector. The total cost of this provision in the 2009 European elections was €10,980,518, which was paid from the Exchequer to An Post. There were further costs totalling €540,669 in respect of the two Dáil by-elections held on the same day. The estimated cost of the facility for the 2011 Dáil general election is €8.4 million. Other indirect supports include free air time for party political broadcasts.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The State pays for much of the administrative apparatus of political parties through the funding mechanisms I have described. When discussing legislation to reform the funding of politics, we are predominantly discussing how parties and candidates fund their election campaigns and contributions made to pay for the running of election campaigns. This is why it is so important that political funding is more open and transparent with regulatory measures in which the people can have confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Moriarty tribunal recommendations that I have already described in some detail have as their main focus the funding of politics and political parties. This was in line with the tribunal's terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Another crucial aspect in the funding of politics forms part of the Government's plans. This was referred to already by Deputy Ó Cuív and concerns spending at elections and referendums. The programme for Government contains a commitment to have spending limits for all elections and constitutional referendums, including for a period in advance of scheduled local, European, general and presidential elections. Given the proximity of the presidential election, the Government has moved to reduce the spending limit from €1.3 million to €750,000. The legislation for this is being prepared. Spending limits apply at Dáil, European Parliament, local authority and presidential elections. At each election a candidate must submit a statement of election expenses and statutory declaration and must stay within the spending limits or potentially face prosecution. However, as I have already noted, no equivalent spending limit applies at a constitutional referendum or a requirement to submit a declaration of expenditure by those involved in a referendum campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">At the moment the spending limits in force apply only to the period immediately leading up to an election. At the recent general election, the spending period commenced on the date of dissolution of the Dáil, which was 1 February 2011. The election was held on 25 February 2011, candidates had to declare their election spending during that 25-day period and it had to be under the legal spending limit. Ordinarily, spending on election materials used before 1 February would not count when calculating a candidate's election spending. A similar provision applies in respect of elections to the European Parliament in which the spending period commences on the date the order appointing polling day is made. A spending period of 38 days applied at the 2009 European elections. At local elections a spending period of between 50 and 60 days applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Concerns have been expressed that spending by candidates and parties before the election period is not captured under the current arrangements. I noted earlier that this point has been raised by the Council of Europe's Group of States Against Corruption. The Standards in Public Office Commission has also highlighted this as an issue which should be addressed, as has the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in an election-monitoring visit to Ireland in 2007. As the commitments contained in the programme for Government make clear, the current arrangements that apply to spending at elections and referendums must be improved and we are committed to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I have outlined some of the key decisions on political reform that the Government has already taken. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill is being drafted for implementation during the current Dáil session. There will be no delay or foot-dragging. As the Government's legislation programme states, the Bill will "amend the terms of reference for a constituency commission to provide for a report on Dáil constituencies to be made based on a reduced number of TDs in Dáil Éireann". It will also reduce the spending limits for presidential elections and legislate for the holding of Dáil by-elections within six months. Separately, the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 is to be published during the current Dáil session. As I have noted, the Bill will amend the Electoral Acts to implement political funding commitments set out in the programme for Government. The electoral commission Bill is also on the Government's legislation programme and is to be enacted during the lifetime of this Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an electoral commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. This is another part of the Government's wider commitment to a radical overhaul of the way Irish politics and government work. An electoral commission will be an important element in a reformed and revitalised electoral system. In developing proposals for the establishment of an electoral commission, the Government is aware that there is extensive knowledge and expertise in electoral matters on all sides of the House. The Oireachtas Joint  Committee on the Constitution, which published a report on the electoral system in July 2010, stated that it strongly supported the establishment of an independent electoral commission. Those of us on this side of the House look forward to the continued input of Members in the implementation of the programme for Government commitment to establish such a body. It is noteworthy that during the recent general election campaign all the major political parties put forward policy proposals to set up an electoral commission. While there is broad agreement on the principle that an electoral commission should be established, setting up this new structure will be a major body of work and it needs to be done right. Issues forconsideration include international best practice, the commission's structure and functions, to whom it should report, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in electoral administration and the approach to be followed in respect of the extensive legislation that will be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">In addition to determining what areas of responsibility the electoral commission will have, we must consider practical matters such as its operational structure, staffing arrangements, budget, reporting arrangements and performance indicators. We have no wish to end up duplicating tasks currently performed elsewhere. The new electoral commission will have to be effective in the performance of its tasks and must be cost efficient. It should improve accountability and enhance the efficiency of elections. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is giving consideration to how the necessary measures to establish an electoral commission can be advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill is a useful contribution to the national debate taking place on the role of politics and how it is supported and funded. It would appear to address some of recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal, albeit in a relatively uncoordinated fashion. Similar provisions to those contained in the programme for Government have been included, especially in respect of reducing the donation limits and the thresholds for their declaration. The provisions for dealing with third parties at referendums are relatively limited and in their present form are unlikely to have a significant positive effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The principal measure in the Bill dealing with restricting corporate donations also appears not to have been fully thought through. Loopholes would allow several corporate-type bodies to continue to make political donations. Overall, the Bill lacks vision, credibility and detail. In many ways, this sums up the difference of approach between the Government and the political party opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The Government's proposed approach is a good deal more comprehensive and considered. It offers a joined-up approach to reform and addresses the following — how our political institutions work, or, in many cases, how they do not work to their full potential; political funding and election spending; and the reform of electoral administration. In bringing forward draft legislation on political funding, which we intend to publish shortly, we will also have regard to recommendations made by other individuals and bodies, including the recommendations made in the Moriarty tribunal report. Our legislation will match the expectations of the people for action with legislation and policy measures that will work. It will make the system more open and transparent for the voter. Accordingly, on behalf of the Government I oppose the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_355">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_709">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill. At a time when the profession of politics has been besmirched by the corrupt and greedy actions of the few, it is imperative that the House moves immediately to restore confidence in the political system. Dealing with the issue of political donations is but a small step, albeit an important one, in restoring this confidence. During the past 14 years, Sinn Féin has called for legislation on corporate donations. During these 14 years, the previous Administration led by Fianna Fáil failed to respond in a positive way to those calls.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">In some ways this should not come as a surprise. For the last 14 years Fianna Fáil was the party with its hand on the wheel of power, its ability to court large businesses was unrivalled and its lack of morals to do so was never in question. The Galway tent did a roaring trade, the whip arounds in Manchester were fruitful and the golf classics were plentiful.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">How times have changed. After being run out of office by the people, Fianna Fáil went into a period of reflection and like St. Paul on the road to Damascus, the party has had a revelation. Of course, the fact Fianna Fáil is no longer in power and its ability to attract and court big business having diminished has more to do with this recent conversion to the Sinn Féin way of thinking on corporate donations than any sense of redemption. There will be people at home laughing to themselves at the idea of Fianna Fáil tabling this legislation when they consider the previous leaders of the party, such as Bertie Ahern and Charles Haughey. We all know what happened on their watch and the allegations of payments, mysterious amounts of sterling won on the horses and briefcases full of cash. How many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies proposing this legislation tonight knew of those goings-on and what did they do while they were Fianna Fáil members in that period? From where I am standing, they have no sense of the meaning of the word hypocrisy.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Bertie Ahern presided over a decade of Government, a Government in which the current leader of Fianna Fáil was a senior member, which saw a deepening inequality in our society and the squandering of our economic prosperity. Now Fianna Fáil has the brass neck to preach to us about credibility in politics. One has to ask why Fianna Fáil even picked this issue to debate when we consider that recent reports from the Standards in Public Office Commission repeatedly tell us the party received no donations.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">According to these reports Fianna Fáil is not alone in this respect. The 2005 SIPO annual report stated that Fine Gael and the now defunct Progressive Democrats received no donations whatsoever in the course of the previous two years and that the Labour Party did not receive any donations in that year either. The 2006 SIPO annual report states that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael received no donations that year. Are we seriously expected to believe that the Christian Solidarity Party received more in political donations than Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael put together in 2006? It is preposterous and everyone listening to this debate will be chuckling at the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Even more recent SIPO annual reports, such as the 2009 report, state that neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael received any donations over the limit set for disclosure. As a party, Sinn Féin has consistently been the only party to make accounts fully available to the public. We have nothing to hide in regard to where we receive our funding and how we spend it, despite accusation thrown across the House about how we raise funds for political campaigns. The challenge I set other parties in this Chamber is to do the same and not hide behind legislation that allows political parties to hide significant donations from the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Political parties should be obliged to publish annual financial statements. The failure to do so in the past has led to international observers viewing Ireland as suffering from high levels of what is termed "legal corruption". Previous reports from Transparency International were correct in its assertions that patronage and personal relationships have influenced political decisions and policy in Ireland. This has been to the detriment not only to Ireland's international reputation but also at a cost to Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">This scourge on Irish politics and society as a whole is underpinned by Fianna Fáil's 1980s golden circle culture. Under Fianna Fáil, the last Government undermined our economy, fattened the bank accounts of big bankers and greedy developers and left critical public services such as education, transport and health under-funded and in disarray. We hear that every day in this House from the Government that has now taken the reins of power. The current Government, however, was no different when it came to developers, bankers and fattened bank accounts. We know this only too well from previous tribunal reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In the Six Counties, political parties are required under law to provide a full income and expenditure annual financial statement to the Electoral Commission. Sinn Féin commends this requirement and believes a similar practice should be in place in this State. Like all organisations a political party needs an income in order to cover its expenditures. The public understands that raising funds and donations are part and parcel of generating that income. Public doubt starts to creep in when political parties are not open and transparent about their financial affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The issue of donations to political parties is part of a broader issue of corruption that has been endemic in Irish political life. The recent Moriarty tribunal was a stark reminder of the cosy relationship between political parties and big business. There are still unanswered questions about the Lowry affair. Why was that debacle let happen in the first place? How can we create a system where this cannot happen again? How can we create a system that will not let big business influence political decisions?</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Deputy Martin has already quoted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who in 2001 said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_720">All over the world, it is recognised that financial support from business to politicians is perceived by the public to have one purpose [namely] the securing of commercial advantage. Claims that such donations are made from disinterested motives are simply not believed. As the lurid tribunal scandals play out before our eyes, one thing is clear. We cannot restore politics until the perceived link between political contributions and public policy is broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">It is rare that I will agree with anything that the Minister for Finance has to say but he was correct on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">In 1997, the massive level of corporate donations to political parties emerged when a box of files that contained information on donors was, supposedly inadvertently, thrown in a skip outside the now defunct Progressive Democrats' head office during a spring clean. After the publication of the contents of that box of files by a Sunday newspaper, we got an insight into the level of political donations from big business to political parties and those of which the Progressive Democrats were in receipt. It is a pity that the cleaners in the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil head offices were not as enthusiastic in their cleaning efforts. It is one box of files l would like to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">In the last general election campaign, buzz words were bandied about like confetti — words such as job creation, change and political reform. This came from all sides, including the current Government parties. The time for buzz words has passed and the time for legislation has arrived. The citizens of this State need to be assured that the State's decision-making process is transparent, structured and disciplined. Anything less is not good enough. These structures need to inspire confidence. We need to restore confidence in our political system because if not, all of us fail. Members of all parties on all sides of the House will be tarred with the same brush so it is incumbent on all of us to work together to bring about the changes required to inspire confidence in the political system again.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I welcome the comments by the Taoiseach during the recent debate on the Moriarty tribunal report when he said this Government will move to ban corporate donations. I welcome this Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill as a step in the right direction. However, it is very difficult to take it seriously when its author is the Fianna Fáil Party. Nevertheless, the Bill will be debated and considered by the House and we will vote on the motion tomorrow night. Regardless of the outcome of that vote, there is more work to be done. If we do not do the work in this 31st Dáil, then we will all suffer, not only as Deputies and political parties, but society as a whole. It is incumbent on all Members of the House to get this right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_725">I will share time with two other Deputies who will speak tomorrow night.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill. I listened to the contribution from Deputy Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil. He spoke about this opportunity to walk the walk regarding reform of the system of donations to political parties. Other speakers have alluded to the fact that after 14 years in Government and having lost an election, the Fianna Fáil leader now decides to walk the walk and put forward these proposals. He also stated that this Bill is an opportunity to consign corporate donations to history and to end the culture of corporate donations once and for all but I do not agree. It is obvious that in the past year or two, the level of donations to Fianna Fáil has dried up and this can be seen by the level of debt the party holds in the aftermath of the general election. It is probable that in the same period the level of donations coming into Fine Gael and the Labour Party has gone through the roof and has reached an historical high. It is very interesting to hear the previous speaker quoting from the annual reports of the Standards in Public Office Commission in which, amazingly, even in 2009, neither party managed to declare any donations, when even the dogs in the street knew that money was coming in.  However, they did not feel free to declare any of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">This Bill is probably a cynical exercise by Fianna Fáil to put forward this amendment to ensure the Government will vote it down tomorrow night and Fianna Fáil will gain a bit of the moral high ground for a day or two before the Government publishes its own proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I listened to the Minister outlining the Fine Gael proposals in the programme for Government which also limit corporate donations. The Minister stated that current legislation prevents what used to happen in the past when large cash donations were given to party members who were able to hide them. The current legislation limits the amount of donations and imposes an obligation to report them. However, the Standards in Public Office Commission report shows it is obvious they are not being reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">We are all in agreement that ending corporate donations is the way forward. This could be done with a Bill containing a single section declaring that no donation of any kind from an individual, a company, a co-op or a trust, could exceed €100. This would satisfy the requirements once and for all and effectively ban corporate donations. There would be no requirement for a referendum because anyone could donate up to €100 to a political party. No donation higher than this amount could be accepted and this would have the effect of banning corporate donations. Such a Bill would pass without difficulty as all sides of the House would accept it and it would achieve the desired goal of every political party to end corporate donations. There is no need for the Government to go through the rigmarole of detailed legislation because I suggest that a simple amendment to this Bill would achieve one step along the road and it could then proceed with the other changes as outlined in the programme for Government. There would be no need for a constitutional referendum, nor would the constitutional rights of any individual wishing to contribute to the political system be endangered.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy</from>
            <p eId="para_730">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, and I look forward to a positive reply. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this issue. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the issue of Abbeystrewry national school in Skibbereen, in the constituency of Cork South-West. As Members are no doubt aware, for some time now the school has been campaigning to secure funding from the Department of Education and Skills to help it to settle outstanding debts that arose from renovation works that were carried out recently. The school is seeking a contribution of any size from the Department to help it to bridge the €80,000 deficit it incurred over the course of construction works. Abbeystrewry national school is a Church of Ireland-run school which also absorbs Methodist congregations. It accepts children of other denominations. For this reason, the school is held in high regard locally. It is renowned for consistently producing high achievers and good results and pupil numbers have been increasing as a consequence. The school has 96 pupils, four full-time teachers and four resource teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">The Department has been extremely generous to the cause of the school in the past. Not very long ago, it sanctioned funding which enabled the school to construct two additional classrooms on the campus. Such extra accommodation was required because the school's pupil numbers had increased substantially. The management of the school recently decided to construct an astroturf pitch and sought to fund the facility independently. The pitch was formally opened in recent times and is a wonderful addition to the school campus. The school authorities envisage that local organisations could rent the pitch for sporting purposes, which would help to gradually offset the cost incurred. I understand that finances are extremely limited at present. There has been a very significant clampdown on what can and cannot be spent. It is with that reality in mind that I make the case for funding from the Department. Regardless of how small such a contribution might be, it would be important in offsetting the costs associated with the construction project I have mentioned and would be appreciated in these fiscally constrained times. The existence of external factors, such as the presence of the IMF, mean we do not have as much funding available to us as would have been the case in the recent past.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, to support this request for funding for educational infrastructure. He is well aware from his own area that one of the benefits of such investment is that it is repaid to the State time and again. In the current climate, one cannot classify any euro of investment in a school as a bad investment. It offers dividends such as raising the standards of educational attainment in the area and providing the infrastructure necessary to equip young students with knowledge and practical experience of curricular and non-curricular subjects. We hope that when the upturn comes and our young people enter or re-enter the workforce, they will be high earners and pay tax to the Exchequer at a higher rate. The benefit of that will be felt for a long time.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">I ask the Minister of State to show solidarity with this project. There will always be a number of schools in various areas that are looking for funding for capital works and access to the summer works scheme, for example. The repair scheme that was announced today under the jobs initiative is a welcome development. It shows there is a recognition at departmental level of the undoubted deficits in our educational infrastructure. In fairness to the Government, it has made a commitment in this area as a major plank of the jobs initiative, which aims to stimulate jobs and growth in the economy. If we invest in this area, not only will we help to bridge the infrastructural deficit, but we will also provide funding to the construction sector, which has been badly affected by the events of recent years. If the local construction economy is to be rebooted, it needs a shot in the arm from the Government. The economy of west Cork, for example, would have been very much plugged into the construction activities of recent years. There are sufficient construction skills in the area. It is obvious that there are unseen levels of unemployment, by comparison with the Celtic tiger years.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">If we create employment and give work to people who are currently on social welfare, there will be a wider benefit to society. When lost taxation and social welfare payments are taken into account, every job that is lost costs the State approximately €20,000. The request I am making is for a marginal contribution to be made in that context. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, will look favourably on the request.</p>

            <p eId="para_735">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Skills regarding the allocation of funding for Abbeystrewry national school near Skibbereen in County Cork. In July 2008, the Department introduced the additional accommodation scheme, which gives schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation that is likely to last for more than three years the option of using a devolved grant to purchase prefabricated classrooms or construct permanent classrooms. A central tenet of the scheme is that responsibility for the management of a project, including cost control, rests with the school authorities. Schools are informed of this in their approval letters.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">In March 2010, Abbeystrewry national school was approved funding of €130,000 under the additional accommodation scheme to enable it to provide an extension consisting of an 80 sq. m. mainstream classroom and a 25 sq. m. resource room. In July 2010, the school authorities wrote to the Department to ask for additional funding for a staffroom and a corridor, which were needed because of increasing staff numbers. Following an examination of the school's application, the Department advised the school authorities that as the additional accommodation scheme is designed to cater for immediate and urgently needed classroom accommodation, it was not in a position to approve the school's request for ancillary accommodation. In August 2010, the school authorities again wrote to the Department to request further additional funding for ancillary works associated with the building project. The Department advised the school authorities that funding was not available for these works for the reasons that had been outlined in previous correspondence. The school appealed the Department's decision, providing detailed drawings and maps of the schools extension, in support of its appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">When the school's application was being reassessed, it emerged that the school had changed the scope of works for which the funding had originally been approved. The Department advised the school authorities that the appeal was unsuccessful and that it was satisfied that the grant provided was sufficient to provide the level of accommodation originally approved. The management authorities of Abbeystrewry national school were advised that the building works carried out were over and above those approved and, therefore, the onus was on the board of management to fund the costs of the extra works. Between 2006 and 2010, the school received over €327,000 in funding under the summer works scheme for roof works, replacement of windows, electrical upgrade and tarmac. Further funding for sewerage works was recently approved under the summer works scheme 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">I am sure the Deputy will appreciate there are many competing demands on the Department's capital resources. In this context, it must prioritise applications for the provision of much needed additional classroom accommodation. A total of €383 million will be spent under the Department's schools building programme this year. In the current economic climate, it is essential that costs are kept under control in the construction of school buildings and that those responsible ensure value for money is achieved for the taxpayer. In this way, the Minister can ensure the maximum number of projects are completed from within the funds available for the schools building programme. I thank the Deputy again for giving me an opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_739">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important issue, namely, the need for the Minister for Social Protection, or the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to restore funding to Lough Ree Area Development Co-operative under the Pobal community services programme. The loss of the invaluable service the co-operative provides to the community would have a detrimental effect on County Longford and the midlands as a whole. Lough Ree Area Development Co-operative in Lanesborough, County Longford, has had its funding for community development projects withdrawn by Pobal. This grant aid was essential to the running of community-based projects as it paid staff salaries. While youth services and the boxing and bridge clubs are not affected by the decision to withdraw funding, some other services are set to be scaled back. Not only will the projects in question be lost to the community but six members of staff have lost their jobs. Considering that the midlands is experiencing a high level of unemployment, there is little chance that the staff members in question will find alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">While I am aware that the withdrawal of funding was made on foot of an internal verification visit to the centre, the directors of the co-operative believe the decision to withdraw funding was unreasonable on the basis of the information provided. The main area of contention appears to be the manner in which time keeping was recorded and managed for the audit period. Following the findings of the audit, Lough Ree Area Development Co-operative has made every effort to resolve the problems highlighted. It is essential, given the valuable work the co-operative undertakes on behalf of the local community, that a full review of the audit be carried out. It is surely reasonable in light of the current financial and employment crisis being experienced in County Longford that every effort be made by Pobal to work with the co-operative to iron out any perceived problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">The termination of funding to an organisation which provides a valuable service to the community, coupled with the loss of six jobs, is a major blow to County Longford. The co-operative will do everything possible to continue to provide services in the short term, although many initiatives have been threatened by the withdrawal of funding. It is almost inevitable, however, that services will have to be scaled back as a result of the withdrawal of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The Lough Ree Area Development Co-operative was established in 1999 to help develop and promote the twin towns of Lanesborough and Ballyleague, which are linked by the River Shannon. It was involved in the establishment of the Lakeside community broadband project, among other valuable initiatives. Speaking at the launch of the project, the then Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, highlighted the valuable work carried out by the co-operative, stating that the "commitment of the Lough Ree Area Development Co-operative to improve the quality of life of the community must be lauded". This commitment on behalf of the community it serves remains as strong as ever and the work undertaken by Lough Ree co-operative is needed more than ever.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The Lough Ree Area Development Co-operative is more than willing to work with Pobal to rectify any perceived difficulties. To date, the board has used every possible means to meet any requirements for the restoration of this essential funding. At a time when every job is vital to the well-being of communities in County Longford, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, who has a seat at the Cabinet table, will recognise the major blow delivered by the loss of funding to Lough Ree co-operative. I have every confidence that he, with the relevant Minister, will do everything possible to have funding restored and get the co-operative up and running again.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_744">I thank Deputy Bannon for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">The community services programme is designed to address locally identified gaps in the provision of services to communities and exploit the potential of community assets and resources already in place in support of the delivery of services to improve community well-being. Responsibility for the programme transferred from the then Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs to the Department of Social Protection in September 2010. A core requirement of the programme is that each service provider generates a significant level of its financial needs from non-public revenue sources, such as by charging fees for services delivered, trading or fund-raising. Service providers in contract with the programme must be not-for-profit, social enterprise or community business in nature. The approximately 445 service providers approved for support employ an estimated 2,700 men and women in full and part-time positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The day-to-day operational elements of the programme are managed by Pobal on contract from the Department. Pobal is a not-for-profit company that delivers a number of publicly and EU funded programmes on behalf of Departments. As part of the services contracted by the Department, Pobal operates an independent audit and verification function to provide assurance that public funding has been spent for the purposes intended and bodies in receipt of public funds are in compliance with public accountability requirements and EU regulations, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">An essential requirement of the community services programme is that each contract holder operates to good practice norms in respect of corporate governance, financial management, employment practices and quality of services delivered to the public. Pobal conducted an audit of Lough Ree Development Co-operative Limited in early 2010. Significant issues were identified in the operations of the co-operative which drew into question a risk to public funds. The issues identified related to corporate governance, poor management practices, inadequate financial control, poor quality record keeping and reliability of reporting. The outcome of this audit was sent directly to board members of the co-operative for their input and comment prior to any decisions being made by Pobal on continuing support from the programme. Following consideration of the audit findings and the responses to it received from Lough Ree Development Co-operative, the board of Pobal determined that the contract should be terminated. Notice of this was issued to the co-operative and an opportunity afforded to have the decision reviewed. A review was subsequently requested and conducted by a board member of Pobal who was not involved in the previous decision. The conclusion of this review was that the decision to discontinue funding was found to be correct and fair and that the process had been properly observed. The board of Pobal subsequently accepted these findings and confirmed its decision to terminate the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The Deputy will agree that it is necessary that the highest standards should apply in respect to how public funds are managed and applied. All parties involved in the finding process must play their part in giving assurances to this House and to members of the public that funds are being properly applied and value is being achieved in return. Failure to do so must have consequences and may ultimately lead to loss of support from this or any other publicly funded programme. I will pass on to the Minister the points raised by Deputy Bannon.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_750">That is correct. I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, for being present to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">Tenant purchase of local authority flats has been an issue for more than 30 years. Ultimately, it boils down to a fundamental issue of fairness. Across Ireland, tenants living in local authority flats are being denied the right to buy their homes while neighbours living in local authority houses may avail of this right. In the past 20 years, as property prices and the level of home buying increased exponentially, this group of tenants remained marginalised as a result of being precluded from buying their homes. The right to buy a home is a basic tenet of Irish society.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">I hope measurable progress will be made on this issue on which the previous Administration procrastinated. As I speak, Cork City Council and every other council are issuing letters to their respective tenants informing them about a new tenant purchase scheme that is being established. Tenants who have been <i> in situ</i> for 15 years will be able to obtain a 45% discount should they decide to purchase their homes. Tenants of local authority flats, however, a group that has been campaigning on this issue for more than 20 years, will continue to be denied the right to buy their homes. I ask the Government to take a new approach and resolve this issue by affording tenants of local authority flats the right to purchase their homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The previous Government, in debates on its Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, indicated it would introduce a statutory framework to allow local authority tenants of flats to purchase their homes under the incremental purchase scheme. While there are some difficulties with this approach, it at least amounted to a step in the right direction. The difficulty is that local authorities have not been facilitated to avail of such a legislative framework. While the House debates this issue, people continue to be denied the right to buy their home.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_363">
            <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
            <p eId="para_754">I thank Deputy Lynch for sharing time. The key issue in this debate is one of fairness. Many people in my community believe they are being discriminated against because, having been born and grown up in a local authority flat, they are denied the privilege of purchasing their home. In 1988, when the offer of tenant purchase was rolled out across Dublin, many local authority tenants in my area and the area represented by the Acting Chairman, Deputy Costello, wanted to purchase their homes. This would have many benefits, including the stopping of the rapid changeover within the flat complexes. It would allow people to put down long-term roots within their communities and to envisage their areas as long-term home prospects. Instead, they have been constantly denied.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">As Deputy Ciarán Lynch has just noted, there is no difference between a family living in a flat complex and one living in a local authority house. At present however, those who live in the latter are offered a 45% discount on their homes, whereas those who live in a flat complex are told to go on the transfer list in order that they might be transferred into a house some day with the possibility of purchasing it thereafter. Court cases ran from 1988 to 2009 in which families fought a challenge on the grounds they believed they had an agreed purchase price with the local authorities on their homes. They lost that case in 2009 and were tied in a legal limbo. As many of them have stated repeatedly, they have been discriminated against.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">There are many positive elements to this initiative, which provides an opportunity for low-income families to put down long-term roots. I refer to the recent "Prime Time" special on Dolphin House. Members are also aware of how strapped financially are local authorities. The selling off of some of their apartments would allow local authorities to generate an income and to invest that money in the stock. It is a natural progression to allow people to put down long-term roots in their own communities and I ask the Minister to fast-track this legislation as we need to move quickly on it. A young family who applied to purchase their home in 1988 still are in limbo and consequently, I ask the Minister to move on this matter as soon as possible and thank the Minister of State for taking the debate.</p>

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_364" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_757">I thank my party colleagues, Deputies Ciarán Lynch and Kevin Humphreys, for raising this important matter and am pleased to have the opportunity to inform the House of the position with regard to the proposed scheme for the tenant purchase of apartments.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The sale of local authority apartments to tenants has a long and chequered history, as outlined by my colleagues, due largely to the complexity of the issues involved in devising ownership arrangements that will protect the interests of everyone involved into the future. Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 underpins the scheme now proposed, building on the long-standing arrangements in the private sector for the ownership and management of multi-unit residential developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">The scheme provides for individual complexes to be designated by the housing authority for tenant purchase, where they meet certain statutory criteria and a substantial majority of the tenants living in them signal in a plebiscite that they wish to have the opportunity to purchase their apartments. Before the first apartments are sold, the authority transfers ownership of the entire complex to a management company established for that purpose, which immediately leases all the apartments back to the authority. The sale of individual apartments is effected by the transfer of the management company's apartment lease from the housing authority to the purchaser.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">The new apartment sales scheme will be based on the incremental purchase model introduced in June 2010 for designated newly-built social housing. The level of discounts under the new scheme will, therefore, be related to household income rather than length of tenure. The incremental purchase approach will promote sustainable communities in the complexes concerned because it gives an incentive to purchasers and their families to remain living in the apartments. At the same time, the selling arrangements will ensure the State shares in any windfall profit from re-sale of the apartment before the housing authority's charge on the property withers away. I emphasise I have no proposals to amend the 2009 legislation with a view to selling apartments by any other method.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">The necessary commencement order, regulations and detailed guidance must be finalised for the apartment sales scheme to be introduced. The transition from a rented social housing apartment complex to a mixed tenure of privately-owned and social-rented accommodation adds an extra dimension to the legal and practical problems that can arise in private apartment complexes. For this reason, my Department is giving particular attention to the drafting of the necessary documentation for the three complex transfers of property ownership involved in the scheme and for the establishment of the management company, as provided for in the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">My aim is to put in place as soon as possible the last building blocks in a robust legislative framework that will stand the test of time for all stakeholders, that is, apartment buyers, apartment tenants who choose not to buy, and local authorities. I will commit to making progress as quickly as possible on this important issue which, as expounded by both Deputies, focuses on fairness and equality. I will pursue it as expeditiously as possible within the legal complexities as outlined previously.</p>

Creidim nach bhfuil sé sin ceart. Tagann an t-Aire Stáit isteach i gcónaí agus tá a fhios agam go maith go dtuigeann sé an cheist seo. Ach an oiread liom féin, tá sé ar an mbeagán atá ag cónaí san Ghaeltacht agus atá mar Theachtaí Dála. Tá an tríú duine ann. Is é sin comhghleacaí an Aire Stáit, an Teachta de Shinn Féin atá i nGaoth Dóbhair.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Tuigeann an t-Aire Stáit an riachtanas atá ag an údarás agus gan an t-údarás i mbun cúrsaí fiontraíochta nach mbeadh rath ar an nGaeltacht. Tá mé ag iarraidh air go ndéanfadh sé cinnte de go gcuirfear dóthain airgid ar fáil don údarás le go mbeidh sé in ann leanacht den obair a bhí ar bun ag an údarás faoi chúrsaí fiontraíochta agus forbartha san Gaeltacht le blianta beaga anuas agus le fada an lá. Ceist í seo a phléamar go minic cheana. Nuair a bhí an t-Aire Stáit ar an dtaobh eile den Teach is minic a thóg sé an cheist chéanna.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">Bhí plé ann le gairid faoi cé mhéid airgid a chuir an Rialtas deiridh ar fáil, i bhfoirm chaipitil, an fhaid is a bhí mise mar Aire. Ins an bhliain 2007, bhí €34 milliún ag an údarás, de réir figiúirí an údaráis féin, le haghaidh chaiteachais chaipitil. Ins an bhliain 2008, bhí €33.93 milliún aige. Ins an bhliain 2009, bhí €30 milliún aige. Ins an bhliain deiridh a raibh mise mar Aire, bhí os cionn €23 milliún ag an údarás. Glacaim leis go bhfuil sé fíor nach bhfuil ach €12 milliún ar fáil do chaiteachas chaipitil i mbliana ó na foinsí éagsúla atá ag an údarás, agus is léir nach leor é sin. Bhí go leor rudaí a tharla ag deireadh na bliana seo caite a bhí chun tsiochair ar an bhfigiúr sin a bheith socraithe don Roinn. Bhí tuiscint soiléir ón Taoiseach deiridh go gcuirfí achmhainní ar fáil leis an straitéis 20 bliain a chur i bhfeidhm agus le déanamh cinnte de go mbeadh rath ar an nGaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, tuigim an chath ata roimh an Aire Stáit. Ní haon mhaith domsa a rá go mbeidh a jab éasca, mar ní bheidh. Ar ndóigh, bhí an Roinn Airgeadais go láidir den tuairim nach ceart go mbeadh cúrsaí fiontraíochta fágtha faoin údarás ach níor aontaigh an Rialtas leis sin. Tá mé cinnte nach n-aontaíonn an t-Aire Stáit ach oiread leis sin. Ach, má tá cúrsaí fiontraíochta agus forbartha le bheith faoin údarás, caithfidh airgead a bheith aige. Teastaítear, ar a laghad, €20 milliún in aghaidh na bliana, don údarás.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">Bhí an t-áth orm nuair a bhí mé mar Aire mar bhí mé in ann an-chuid airgid a fháil. Bhí mé in ann airgead a fháil le haghaidh céanna, bóithrí agus go leor rudaí mar sin. Chomh maith leis sin, bhí foinsí airgid dá gcuid féin ag an údarás. Níl na foinsí sin chomh fairsing anois, agus tuigim é sin. Táthar ag brath ar airgead Stáit agus ar airgead díreach ón Státchiste.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">Déarfaidh daoine gurb ionann €20 milliún agus go leor airgid. Ach beidh an Stát ag caitheamh €4 bhilliún ar chaipiteal. Céard é €20 milliún as an méid sin do rud chomh tábhachtach leis an nGaeltacht?</p>
            <p eId="para_769">Tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh an t-Aire Stáit an chath suas. Má chuireann, beidh tacaíocht iomlán aige uaimse, mar dhuine Gaeltachta agus mar Theachta Dála Gaeltachta sa chath sin. Ar ndóigh, má chliseann ar an Rialtas beimid gearánach agus beidh údar againn. Tá a fhios agam cá bhfuil croí an Aire Stáit agus cá raibh sé ariamh. Tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil croí an Taoisigh san áit cheart, fiú má tá daoine sa chóras a bhfuil gráin dóite acu don Ghaeilge. Tá na daoine sin sa chóras agus admhóimís é.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">Tá rud amháin gur mhaith liom a rá mar chríoch. Céad go leith bliain ó shin, scríobh duine anaithnid an méid seo:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_771">As to the Irish language, toleration and patronage have come too late. It cannot be saved alive by any human power. It is at present confined to about one-third of the peasantry, and those the most ignorant and uncivilised. As a spoken language, it can hardly survive the present generation. The fathers and mothers will retain it till their death, but by the children it will be neglected and forgotten.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">Scríobhadh é sin céad go leith bliain ó shin agus is mór an mhaith, ainneoin an méid a bhí ráite ag an am sin, gur tháinig an Ghaeilge slán. Bhí go leor daoine páirteach san iarracht sin agus rinne go leor daoine an t-uafás oibre. Ar ndóigh, le céad bliain anuas, bhí na daoine ann a deirfeadh i gcónaí, go mór mhór nuair a bhí brú airgid ann, nárbh fhiú an Ghaeilge nó nárbh fhiú an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar an nGaeilge. Cuirtear an argóint sin chun cinn go mór mhór nuair atá géarchéim eacnamaíochta ann.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">Críochnóidh mé leis an méid seo. Dá bhfaigheadh an Ghaeilge bás, bheadh teanga nach mbaineann le haon treabh, cine nó dream ar domhan, nach bhfuil a shíolra in aon áit eile ach sa tír seo agus in Albain, tar éis bás a fháil agus bheadh an domhan níos boichte dá bharr. An bhfuilimid chun a rá go gcaillfear teanga na misinéirí, an teanga a bhfuair na mílte daoine bás ar a son agus don dúchas, bás in Éire saor, bunaithe ar argóint go bhfuil géarchéim airgid ann? Tá mé cinnte go n-aontódh an t-Aire Stáit liom nach mbeadh sin ceart agus táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall déanamh cinnte go mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil don Ghaeltacht don bhliain seo chugainn, le jab foirfe a dhéanamh i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta.</p>

Tá lúcháir orm a bheith ábalta a rá go bhfuil tiomantas an Rialtais i leith na straitéise léirithe go soiléir cheana féin. Chomh maith leis na céimeanna atáthar á dtógáil laistigh de mo Roinn chun feidhm a thabhairt do mholtaí ábhartha na straitéise, ar a n-áirím bunú aonad straitéise agus ullmhú dréacht-reachtaíochta, is cúis sásaimh ar leith dom í go bhfuil an coiste Rialtais faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht athbhunaithe ag an Rialtas. Is faoi chathaoirleacht an Taoisigh féin a fheidhmíonn an coiste Rialtais agus tá na hAirí seo a leanas mar bhaill de: an tAire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta; an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna; an tAire Caiteachais Phoiblí; an tAire Cumarsáide, Fuinnimh agus Acmhainní Nádúrtha; an tAire Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais Áitiúil; agus mé féin mar Aire Stáit. Tionóladh an chéad chruinniú den choiste Rialtais ar 14 Aibreán 2011, áit ar thapaíodh an deis plé leathan a dhéanamh ar na féidearthachtaí éagsúla maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise. Ag eascairt ón bplé sin, tá oifigigh mo Roinne chun moltaí maidir leis na féidearthachtaí seo a ullmhú don chéad chruinniú eile den choiste Rialtais agus cuimseoidh na moltaí seo na féidearthachtaí maidir le ról agus cúraimí Údarás na Gaeltachta i ndáil leis an straitéis.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">Is léir, mar sin, go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh agus go bhfuil aghaidh á thabhairt ar na céimeanna is gá a thógáil chun an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm laistigh de na hacmhainní teoranta atá ar fáil san aeráid eacnamaíoch reatha.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">Mar ionadaí pobail ón Ghaeltacht — cosúil leis an Teachta — atá le fada ag plé le riachtanais phobal na Gaeltachta, tuigim go maith na dúshláin agus na constaicí a gcaithfidh Údarás na Gaeltachta dul i ngleic leo sa timpeallacht achrannach gnó atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair. Tuigim fosta an dea-obair atá déanta ag an údarás agus na torthaí fónta atá bainte amach aige tríd an infheistíocht atá déanta aige chun deiseanna fostaíochta a chruthú agus a chaomhnú sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Níl amhras ar bíth ach go bhfuil an ghéarchéim eacnamaíoch náisiúnta agus domhanda ag cruthú deacrachtaí do chomhlachtaí sa Ghaeltacht agus tá impleachtaí dá réir ann do chúrsaí fostaíochta. É sin ráite, caithfear a nótáil gurb é an Rialtas deiridh, a raibh an Teachta Ó Cuív mar bhall de, a laghdaigh soláthar airgid caipitil Údarás na Gaeltachta ó €27 milliún in 2006 go €18 milliún in 2010 agus a laghdaigh an soláthar céanna arís go tubaisteach go dtí €6 milliún sa bhliain reatha, 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">Ní mór a mheabhrú don Teachta fosta gurbh é a Rialtas siúd a d'fhoilsigh An tAthbhreithniu ar Thosaíochtaí Infheistíochta Caipitil 2010 — 2016, inar laghdaíodh buiséad caipitil na Roinne Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, mar a bhí ag an am, ó €105 milliún in 2010 go €86 milliún do na blianta 2011, 2012 agus 2013. Caithfidh mé a mheabhrú don Teachta chomh maith go leanann an soláthar don Roinn ag titim sna blianta ina dhiaidh sin go €40 milliún in 2014 agus €30 milliún in 2015 agus 2016. Ag cur san áireamh go bhfuil beagnach €70 milliún de bhuiséid 2011, 2012 agus 2013 le dul i dtreo an chláir LEADER agus go raibh scéimeanna uilig na Roinne atá dírithe ar an Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht, na hoileáin agus Údarás na Gaeltachta le maoiniú as an bhfuílleach de thart ar €16 milliún, tá mé cinnte go n-aontóidh an Teachta liom nuair a deirim nár fágadh morán airgid agam le caitheamh, ní hamháin ar chúrsaí teanga i gcoitinne, ach le tabhairt d'Údarás na Gaeltachta chun cúraimí forbartha agus fiontraíochta na heagraíochta a chomhlíonadh.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Cé go mbeidh fáil ag an údarás ar thart ar €6 milliún breise óna chuid acmhainní féin i mbliana a chuideoidh leis an eagraíocht a chuid spriocanna a bhaint amach, aithním go bhfuil cur chuige an Rialtais dheiridh ag cruthú deacrachtaí suntasacha don údarás go fóill. Is sa chomhthéacs sin agus i gcomhthéacs na reachtaíochta nua a bheidh mé ag déanamh mo dhíchill chun na deacrachtaí sin a réiteach.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">Mar fhocal scoir, tá mise dóchasach go ndéanfaimid dul chun cinn suntasach faoin chlár Rialtais chun infheistíocht fhiúntach a thabhairt go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Mar a dúirt mé, is cúis sásaimh dom í tiomantas pearsanta an Taoisigh don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Beidh mise mar Aire Stáit ag obair go dlúth leis an Aire Deenihan agus leis an gcoiste Rialtais san am amach romhainn chun spriocanna inseachadta na straitéise a chur i gcrích ar bhonn costas-éifeachtach.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">Ar ndóigh, tá lúcháir orm go mbeidh gach cuidiú le fáil agam ón Teachta agus óna pháirtí. Mar atá ráite agam cheana, tá oidhreacht agam, fágtha ag Fianna Fáil nuair a d'fhág siad an Rialtas, atá ag cothú agus a bheidh ag cothú deacrachtaí. Is é an dúshlán atá romham ná mo dhícheall a dhéanamh feabhas a chur ar rudaí, mar ní féidir leo a bheith mórán níos measa ná mar atá i láthair na huaire.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_791">The challenge for this new Government is unlike any faced before. The priority of this Government is to get our economy moving, restore confidence, fix our banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs. The success of our economic plans will lay the foundation for the rest of our agenda for change and the jobs initiative being announced today is the first step in this regard.  Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for economic stability and growth. To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy. We believe it is appropriate, in order to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the National Recovery Plan for the combined period 2011- 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">Accordingly, the appropriate levels of social welfare rates will be considered in the context of Budget 2012. This Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity. In this regard, it is important to note that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to maintain social welfare rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Jobseeker's Allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme. The maximum personal weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance is €188 per week. The maximum weekly personal rates applicable to certain persons aged under 25 is lower. For those aged 18 to 21 years of age, the maximum personal rate is €100 per week while the rate applicable to those aged 22 to 24, inclusive, is €144. These reduced rates do not apply to people aged under 25 if they have dependent children or if they are participating in a course of education, training or community employment, nor do they apply to people transferring to jobseeker's allowance from jobseeker's benefit or disability allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">The weekly rate of jobseeker's allowance payable is the relevant maximum weekly rate less any means assessed. For means test purposes, account is taken of the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse/partner. In addition, in the case of a single claimant aged under 25 years of age, account is taken of the value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of residing with a parent or step-parent. Accordingly, where the rate payable to a jobseeker's allowance recipient is less than the relevant maximum weekly rate, be it €188, €144 or €100 per week, it is the means assessed in the individual case which reduces the amount payable.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Services division of the Health Services Executive (HSE). Mortgage interest supplements provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. There are currently 18,500 households benefiting from a mortgage interest supplement payment, an increase of 350% over those in payment at end 2007. Applications for mortgage interest supplement and appeals in relation to these applications are made in the first instance to the HSE. Those dissatisfied with the outcome of this process may appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">I am informed by that Office that 153 appeals in relation to Mortgage Interest Supplement were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2009, 140 in 2010 and 84 to date in 2011. The total number of appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in the same period were 10,027 in 2009, 17,499 in 2010 and 7,284 to date in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">The overall number of supplementary welfare allowance appeals made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office was 789 in 2009 and 989 in 2010. While it is not possible to say how many of these related to Mortgage Interest Payments, the numbers decided show that it is quite low.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">While in general, appeals are dealt with in strict chronological order, those appeals relating to basic supplementary welfare allowance payments are dealt with on a priority basis. The average time taken to process these appeals in 2010 was 6.9 weeks for those dealt with by way of a summary decision and 14.8 weeks for those given an oral hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">In an effort to reduce these processing times, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks. These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.</p>

          </question>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_802">Social assistance provision to people of working age was the subject of a review that was carried out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and published in November 2010. The review considered the desirability and feasibility of introducing a single social assistance payment for all people of working age. The report examined the current system of social assistance payments against the background of the broader policy rationale for a single payment, which is based on the policy that people are given or directed to the supports or services that they need in order to return to or take up work or other training or educational opportunities, matched by a requirement that they avail of that support. In other words, the people seeking to avail of income support have both rights and matching responsibilities. This approach builds on the NESC report: <i>The Developmental Welfare State (2005) </i> and on EU and OECD research.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">The principle of a single working age payment is also based on the rationale that the outcomes for people from a poverty and social inclusion point of view must be improved, and also that any changes to the current system must ‘make work pay'. Such an approach would ensure that people are not further distanced from the labour market, especially in the current economic climate, and encourages people to maximise their potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">However, I am aware that moving to a single social assistance payment is a complex task and would represent a fundamental overhaul of the assistance system.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">The recently agreed Programme of Financial Support with the EU and IMF makes references to this report and that the DSP will build on it, together with other studies relating to the structural reform of the social welfare system, with a view to producing a comprehensive programme of reforms that can help better targeting social support to those on lower income, and ensure that work pays for welfare recipients, after consultation with stakeholders. To this end I propose to initiate consultations on the framework for a single social assistance payment and arrangements to hold a seminar for this purpose are currently being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these problems. As outlined in our Programme for Government, a commission on taxation and social welfare will be established to consider a number of issues arising out of the operation of the tax and social welfare systems, including the elimination of disincentives to employment. The Government is currently considering the scope of the commission's work and the practical arrangements around its operation. An announcement on these will be made as soon as possible.</p>

    <b>Deputy Barry Cowen</b>
     asked the

     her target for fraud savings 2011; the measures needed to achieve same; and the cost of these measures. 
    [10431/11]
   </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_376">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_808">For 2011 the Department has a target of reviewing 780,000 individual welfare claims and to achieve €540 million in control savings. This figure is the value of the control activity in the Department and if this work did not take place there would, over time, be a similar increase in total social welfare expenditure.  The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department. A key objective of the Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time. A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud, and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">Measures to control fraud and abuse include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of review forms to selected customers, database checking, medical reviews in the case of illness payments etc. The Department is also engaged in data matching with other Government Departments and public bodies for control purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">The Department supplements reviews of entitlement by the frequent use of direct mail shot letters, particularly in relation to eligibility for child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">In the case of persons receiving illness and disability payments, recipients are reviewed on a systematic basis through medical assessments and examinations, the frequency of which relates to the nature of the illness of disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">Residency checks on social welfare claims by non-Irish nationals are undertaken nationwide in order to determine whether their residency status in the State is fulfilled.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">New claimants for jobseeker payments are now exclusively paid through post offices. The Department's Special Investigation Unit (SIU) carries out a wide range of control activities and projects to investigate social welfare fraud and abuse, some of which are jointly with the Revenue Commissioners and with NERA. This unit participates in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints with other agencies, including the Gardaí, Traffic Corps, Taxi Regulator and the Revenue Commissioners. Some areas in which this unit will be working this year include the hidden economy, cases of concurrent working and claiming, multiple claiming and personation cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Reports of suspected fraudulent social welfare claims can be made by calling Central Control Section. Alternatively, there is an on-line facility for members of the public to report their suspicions of social welfare fraud on www.welfare.ie. All reported cases of suspected social welfare are thoroughly investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">It is the Department's policy to consider for prosecution all cases of fraud against the social welfare system. In 2010, 209 cases were referred for criminal proceedings under social welfare legislation. In addition to the 209 cases, a further 132 cases of serious fraud involving multiple claiming of social welfare payments were referred to the Gardaí for consideration of criminal proceedings under the Criminal Justice (Fraud and Theft) Act 2001. The Department actively pursues the recovery of debts from all persons who have received social welfare payments to which they were not entitled. Officials from this Department are involved with the Cross-Border Operational Forum. This body comprises selected investigators from the social welfare agencies in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK, who liaise at an operational level. Case by case data matching takes place between the Department of Social Protection and the Northern Ireland Social Security Agency and the Department of Work and Pensions in the UK, on cases where social welfare fraud or abuse is occurring.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The new Public Service Card will include a photograph and signature. One of the advantages of the card is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which results from the incorrect identification of benefit claimants. Roll out of the card is planned to commence later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Fraud and Error Surveys, undertaken by the Department, provide an indicator of the estimated risk of fraud on the schemes surveyed at that point in time. This enables the Department to enhance its procedures and processes in relation to risk and control across the relevant schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">The costs of these control measures would include the costs of the staff directly involved. There are some 620 staff whose work includes control activities, who work at local, regional and headquarters level. Some 200 staff work full time on control work, while the other staff are responsible for routine investigations of new claims and reviews under the various schemes. The Special Investigation Unit comprise 89 inspectors whose exclusive function is that of fraud investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant. In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050. Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings. Extending State retirement age will also encourage and support those who have private or occupational pensions to remain longer in the workforce. This will improve overall pension sustainability and reduce costs for the employer. People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 89 years for women and 83 for men. People will still, therefore, be spending at least the same amount of time in retirement as they are today, even with a later State pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">Therefore, as announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of the State pension age at 66 and will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. As agreed under the EU/IMF Memorandum of Understanding, these changes will be provided for in legislation by mid 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The aim of the Framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and includes proposals for an auto enrolment scheme to provide access to private pensions. The Framework also recognises that many people want to have the option to work longer and proposes, for those who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension, to put in place arrangements to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit.  In addition, for those with contribution shortfalls at pension age, arrangements will be put in place to allow them to receive additional benefits if they continue to make paid contributions for pensions purposes while remaining in work or self-employment.  The details and timeframes for these changes are set out in the National Pensions Framework, which was published on 3 March 2010.  An implementation group chaired by my Department is developing the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary reforms into operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">Given the changes to State pension age and the other proposals in the Framework, both employees and employers must be encouraged to change their attitudes to working longer. In the workplace, employers must seek to retain older employees and create working conditions which will make working longer both attractive and feasible for the older worker. Where this is not possible and people leave paid employment before State pension age, they will be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment until they become eligible for a State pension, as is the current situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.   In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists. One of the measures introduced to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) which gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for eighteen months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Rent supplement is not payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, that is for 30 hours or more a week. However, provision was made in 2007 whereby a person on rent supplement, who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS, may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, without losing entitlement to their rent supplement payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The Programme for Government contained several commitments in relation to those who find themselves dependent on rent supplement with long term housing needs including the need to remove any remaining barriers to employment. The Department is committed to targeting social support to those on lower incomes, and ensuring that work pays for welfare recipients. However, in order to fully address these household's needs we have to reduce the reliance on rent supplement, with eligible recipients moving to accommodation provided by local authorities. I am currently in discussions with my colleagues in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this commitment and returning rent supplement to its original intention as a short term income support payment. The latest Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the EU and the IMF does not directly impact upon these commitments.</p>

            <p eId="para_829">Government policy aims to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a modern payments environment in Ireland. In this regard, my Department is currently developing a Payment Strategy to enable the Department to continue to modernise the payment of welfare benefits in line with wider Government policies and objectives such as better public services, better and more effective e-payments and the National Payments Implementation Programme.  As the Deputy is aware, An Post issues Electronic Information Transfer (EIT) payments on behalf of my Department in respect of various Social Welfare schemes. The contract under which An Post provides this service will expire on 31 December 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are usually awarded following a competitive tender process.

            <p eId="para_831">The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives.

            <p eId="para_834">The back to education allowance (BTEA) is one of a range of activation supports and policies with the objective of assisting social welfare recipients to improve their life chances by facilitating access to employment, work experience, education and training. The focus of BTEA is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. The BTEA scheme can offer participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">The Programme for Government 2011-2016 includes a commitment to resource a Jobs Fund that will finance a number of measures which will play an important role in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.

            <p eId="para_840">The challenge for this new Government is unlike any faced before. The priority of this Government is to get our economy moving, restore confidence, fix our banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The success of our economic plans will lay the foundation for the rest of our agenda for change and the jobs initiative being announced today is the first step in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for economic stability and growth. To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy. We believe it is appropriate, in order to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the National Recovery Plan for the combined period 2011- 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">This Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity. This is explicitly recognised in the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">At the same time, there will be an ongoing necessity to curtail expenditure in 2012 and in later years. Any changes to the wide range of schemes and services operated by my Department will be considered in a Budgetary context later this year. This consideration will be informed by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) currently underway which will be completed by September.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">In addition, as provided for in the most recent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF, my Department will build on its recent studies on working age payments, child income support and disability allowance with a view to producing a comprehensive programme of reforms that can help better targeting social support to those on lower incomes, and ensure that work pays for welfare recipients. Consultation with stakeholders will take place. A progress report will be made by end-December 2011 and a programme of reforms will be submitted to Government at the end of the first quarter of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_852">From 1st January 2011 policy and funding responsibility for FÁS functions in relation to employment and community employment services was transferred to this Department in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010. The FÁS schemes involved include the Community Employment programme (CE). FÁS remains responsible for the day to day operation of CE in accordance with the terms of a Service Agreement/Framework Document which it has concluded with this Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">The aim of the CE scheme remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education and training. The programme is managed within this context, subject to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">Within the current budgetary constraints, the number of places on CE was increased to 23,300 in 2010. The budgetary provision for CE in 2011 will allow FÁS to continue the programme at the same level as 2010. In delivering these places, FÁS will continue to operate flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market, while at the same time facilitating the support of community services. There have been no changes to the training budget of CE.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">A number of special community employment projects operate under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016. As part of the Strategy, FÁS is committed to providing 1,000 places on such projects as part of the overall funding for the community employment programme. The primary objective of the Strategy is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs. It is my intention to ensure the continuation of such projects subject to the overall budgetary constraints for the community employment programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_857">The Department has developed, in conjunction with a number of other Government Departments, the specifications for a Public Services Card (PSC) under the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, or SAFE, programme. The specification provides for identification features, including a photograph. The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required.  Over the past few years significant progress had been made on the implementation of the project including the selection of a preferred bidder to provide a managed service for card production and related bureau services. Technical specifications were finalised and the necessary organisational change was designed.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">However, in view of the uncertain economic climate, the project was suspended until formal sanction to proceed was received from the Department of Finance at the end of 2009. A contract was agreed with Biometric Card Services (BCS) as the managed service provider from early January 2010. The contract is for a complete managed service for the production, maintenance and distribution of the PSC. In summary this entails:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">Production of the card</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_860">Personalisation of the card</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_861">Delivery of the card</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_862">Provision of help-desk functionality</p>
            <p eId="para_863">All to be undertaken under strict and secure conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">Since the project was recommenced, significant work has been undertaken including decisions regarding the final design of the card and the physical construction of a secure card personalisation and distribution centre in Bray, Co. Wicklow. A specimen PSC was personalised on this site on 8th December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">It is also necessary to develop a technical infrastructure within the Department to support the client registration as well as the management and administration of the cards. Development of some of this infrastructure is being undertaken by internal resources and this work began last year. Procurement for the remainder was finalised early this year and development work is currently ongoing. While, it is anticipated that the full suite of this functionality will not be available until the Autumn of this year, the technical infrastructure to process client registration is expected to be ready by the end of July.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">It is intended that initial registration will involve customers of the Department and will take a number of forms: face to face at DSP Local Offices, through utilising data already held by the Department in relation to the All Ireland Free Travel Scheme and through utilising relevant data already held by the State (e.g. photographs and signatures held by the Passport Office). Customers of the Department will be contacted to arrange for capture of the data required to produce and issue a PSC to them. The overall timeframe for completion of initial deployment of a Public Services Card is dependent on the rate at which it will be possible to securely register all of those to whom it will be issued. Initial registration will be carried out in the Department. Other options that may exist for external registration are being explored.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">The Public Services Card will replace cards currently in use, such as the Social Services Card and the Free Travel card, with highly secure cards. Other Departments and agencies will also be in a position to use the card and the infrastructure that will support it.</p>

            <p eId="para_869">The purpose of the rural social scheme is to provide income support for farmers and fisherpersons who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments. Persons are engaged for 19.5 hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities. Participants are paid the equivalent of the maximum rate of the social welfare payment they are entitled to plus €20 per week. The scheme is operated by the Department and delivered at local level by 35 local development companies and by Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas. The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 men and women and 130 supervisory staff. Some €46.1 million has been allocated to meet the costs of the scheme in 2011. Opportunities to develop the scheme are limited within the level of resources available and I have no plans to expand it further in the immediate future. However, significant latitude is allowed to each of the local development companies in the manner in which they deploy resources locally in response to identified community needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 61 and 72 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement (MIS), is administered on behalf of the Department by the Community Welfare Services division of the Health Service Executive. MIS provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of mortgage repayments which relate to the essential purchase, repair or maintenance of the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">There are currently 18,500 households benefiting from a MIS payment. This is at an estimated cost in 2011 of over €77 million, an increase of 350% over those in payment at end 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group. The final review of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group was published in November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">The Programme for Government contained a number of commitments in relation to helping homeowners in distress to weather the recession, and to ensuring that Ireland has a sustainable housing policy. These included commitments in areas such as taxation, welfare and banking.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">The Department is currently formulating an implementation plan in relation to the various welfare commitments contained in the programme for Government, the review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme and report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group. The plan will then be considered in the context of the resources available to the Government generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">I can say that the Department is committed to targeting social support to those on lower incomes, and ensuring that work pays for welfare recipients. The latest Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the EU and the IMF does not directly impact upon the commitment in relation to the 30 hour rule for mortgage interest supplement recipients.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_882">I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 63 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection. The objective is to integrate the employment support services currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection with those currently provided by FÁS into a single service. This service will also process payments in respect of employment related benefits and other benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection. The integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and / or seek advice about their training options. The focus will be very much on the individual, his / her rights to a payment, his / her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his / her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided. This should improve a person's life chances.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The Local Employment Service (LES) operates mainly through Local Area Partnership Companies on contract from FÁS. The objective of the LES is to focus on the provision of services to those most disadvantaged in the labour market as a direct response to the local context within which it operates. The intention is that this service will continue and that the relationship that the LES currently has with FÁS is the same relationship it will have with my Department in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">It should be noted that responsibility for skills training undertaken by FÁS currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills. The future development of the training and skills services of FÁS is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, I am determined that this will be completed in the most expeditious manner possible and my officials are already actively engaged in a programme of work towards this end. While this will be a multi-annual programme of work requiring the development of the new service, the assignment of functions to the Service and the development of its organisational processes and operational systems, many aspects of the new service will be delivered within the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year. The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year. This will enable us to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">Planning for the transfer and integration of the Employment Services and Community Employment Services of FÁS to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year. Again this will enable us to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment. This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.  A number of pilot projects have already commenced in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs. These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their rollout nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">The Estimates for the Department of Social Protection, as published last February in the 2011 Revised Estimates Volume, are based, in the main, on an analysis of trends as regards likely numbers of recipients and average value of payments in 2011. Actual trends on individual schemes are closely monitored on an ongoing basis. Given the demand led nature of the wide range of schemes operated by my Department, it is too early to accurately estimate the projected out-turn for 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_893">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the breakdown of the number of disallowed social welfare claims for the years 2009 and 2010 which were subsequently overturned on appeal by Appeals Officers and the categories into which they fall is given in the table. Overall, the number of appeals determined by Appeals officers which had a favourable outcome for appellants (i.e. either allowed or partially allowed) were 3,695 (37%) of 10,027 determined in 2009 and 4,747 (27%) of 17,499 determined in 2010. The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_995">I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 175 and 183 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Figures in regard to the numbers of cases received and awaiting decision, by scheme for 2010 and 2011, the average time taken to process appeals by summary decision and by oral hearing by scheme type and the number of staff in the Social Welfare Appeals Office are given in the following tables.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the overall average waiting time for an appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision in 2010 was 27.4 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing was 45.6 weeks. These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary. A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">In an effort to reduce these processing times, the Department has made 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks. These assignments will augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29. In addition, since July 2010, 8 retired Appeals Officers, equating to a further full-time officers, have been assisting on a strictly part-time basis with the backlogs of appeals and it is intended that they will be employed until the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">In addition to the provision of extra staff, more emphasis is now placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity. As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by way of oral hearing was reduced from 59% in 2009 to 31.5% in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">As a result of the various initiatives taken, a total of 17,499 appeals were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2010 in comparison to 10,027 for 2009. When revised decisions and withdrawn cases are taken into account the total number of cases finalised in 2010 was 28,166 in comparison to 17,787 for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432. In order to be fair to all appellants, appeals are being dealt with in strict chronological order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_1426">The National Employment Action Plan is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people. Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years, who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register, are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to FÁS for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market. The Employment Action Plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection. The objective is to integrate the employment support services currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection with those currently provided by FÁS into a single service. This service will also process payments in respect of employment related benefits and other benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection. The integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and/or seek advice about their training options. The focus will be very much on the individual, his/her rights to a payment, his/her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his/her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment. This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems. A number of pilot projects have already commenced in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs. These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their rollout nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.</p>

     her views that forcing older persons to remain in the workforce longer by raising the age for the State pension will reduce the number of job opportunities for the very high number of persons of current working age who are unemployed.

            <p eId="para_1430">The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant. In particular, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. There are currently six workers for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050. Increasing State pension age is one of the ways in which we can sustain the pensions system and also maintain the value of the State pension at 35% of average earnings. As announced as part of the National Pensions Framework, state pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of the state pension age at 66. State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">Recent research on intergenerational solidarity by the OECD demonstrates that the rate of employment of younger people has no relationship with the rate of employment of older people. Describing what is termed the ‘lump-of-labour fallacy' the OECD state that ‘the idea that public policy can re-shuffle a fixed number of jobs between workers of different ages is simply not true in anything but the very short-term'. The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments. While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, this Department already has a role in supporting people from welfare to work. The National Employment Action Plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">Child benefit payments assist parents in contributing to the costs associated with raising children and play a very important role in the objective of reducing child poverty. A value for money review of child income support policies and associated programmes was published by the Department in November 2010. The review covered policy around child benefit, qualified child increases and the family income supplement payments as well as aspects of some other child-related payments. The Department is undertaking some follow-up work, including a recent consultation seminar with interest groups on the review, which gathered the views of stakeholders as to the future direction of policy on these payments. Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these problems. As we stressed in the preamble to our Programme for Government, in order to address the very substantial problems that we face, it is essential that new ways, new approaches and new thinking will form the constant backdrop to the work of the Government. For this reason we will seek to benefit from the expertise of a commission on taxation and social welfare that will consider a number of issues arising out of the operation of the tax and social welfare systems, including the issue of family and child income supports. The Government considers it a priority that a more fundamental examination of our system of family and child income supports is required. Consequently, the commission will be asked to examine and make recommendations on these payments, with particular emphasis on addressing the cycle of child poverty. The Government is currently considering the scope of the commission's work and the practical arrangements around its operation. An announcement on these will be made shortly.</p>

Decisions concerning habitual residence are subject to five factors which have been laid down by the European Court of Justice, and which are now incorporated into our domestic social welfare legislation.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1445">I can confirm to the Deputy that the person mentioned by him contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs in March 2011 regarding his difficulties entering Egypt from Gaza. The person concerned had in this instance been travelling on his US passport but has refused to seek consular assistance from the US authorities. Notwithstanding the complications arising from his travelling on a non-Irish passport, my Department has been providing consular assistance to him, through our Embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv and our Consular Assistance Section, on the basis that he is also an Irish citizen. I can confirm that our Embassy in Cairo is making every effort, including making direct representations to the Egyptian authorities, in an effort to facilitate his proposed exit from Gaza and will continue to work to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">It is the case, however, that my Department has been advising Irish citizens against all travel to the Gaza strip and if citizens do decide to travel, against this advice, then they must take personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions in this regard and that the provision of consular assistance in those situations may be very limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">I would also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has, over recent months, provided extensive assistance to the person mentioned by him in circumstances where he has, in our opinion, put his own personal safety at risk. I understand that officials from our Embassy in Tel Aviv visited him in detention and assisted his safe departure from Israel when he was deported in June 2010. In addition an official from our Embassy in Ankara met him in Istanbul following his deportation to ensure his access to medical treatment and to facilitate his return home. I am informed that our Passport Office made personal arrangements with him regarding the replacement of his passport. I am also informed that last November 2010, our Embassy in Athens came to his assistance when he reported that he had been kidnapped by boat and taken from Libya to Greece, and was arrested and charged upon arrival.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">My Department, through our Embassies mentioned above, have made representations to members of local police, judiciary and Foreign Ministries on behalf of this individual. I am aware that staff from the Embassies have also been dispatched to ports and airports to assist him. I also understand that consular access to visit him in detention has been demanded on his behalf in both Greece and Israel. In addition, I believe that our Embassies have assisted him on several occasions with emergency travel documents to enable him to return home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">This extensive consular support has been provided at considerable cost to the taxpayer and disruption to the normal working of our Embassies and Consulates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">My Department will nevertheless continue to liaise with the Egyptian authorities on this person's behalf.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1452">The Irish Diplomatic Network is made up of 76 overseas Missions, in addition to offices in Armagh and Belfast. The network consists of 58 Embassies, 7 multilateral Missions and 11 Consulates General and other offices overseas. In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis. The size and scale of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. Any decision to open a new Mission overseas is undertaken having regard to clear national priorities and available resources, and must be on the basis of an anticipated and ongoing significant return for the State. There are no plans to open any new Embassies in the near term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">A detailed table giving staffing and costs of overseas Missions as requested is set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">The staffing figures include diplomatic staff and local staff engaged by the Mission. They also take account of officers of other Government Departments serving in our Missions abroad, most notably Ireland's Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels and in Visa Offices operated within Embassies by staff seconded from the Department of Justice and Equality. Those include some staff whose salaries and other costs are borne by their parent Departments. Figures marked with an asterisk include some positions filled by personnel engaged through local employment agencies and not directly employed by the Missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">The annual costs as set out in the table for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 are the administrative costs of operating the mission. The figures do not include the salaries of the Irish based staff as these are a charge on the overall salaries budget of the Department rather than on a specific Mission. In addition to the administrative costs of operating a Mission, many Embassies fund programmes in their respective countries, in particular the Missions which fund Irish Aid activities. For example, in 2010, while the Embassy in Mozambique had administrative costs of almost €1 million, it managed an aid programme of €37.5 million through the Mission that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The administrative costs of offices in Irish Aid Programme Countries (highlighted in bold) are often high due to issues such as the additional security required in a developing country context. In addition to the normal staffing of Irish Aid offices, which generally consists of a small number of Irish diplomats, working with a maximum of three specialist technical staff from Ireland and a small number of locally-recruited administrative staff, there are often additional staff required to engage in programme activities or staff who are hired to provide specific services such as security — such staff are not included in the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">Also, from time to time Missions may incur significant capital expenditure in relation to their premises or for upgrading of essential infrastructure. These capital costs are not included in the annual administrative costs as detailed below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The promotion of Ireland's economic interests overseas is a key focus of my Department. Ireland's network of 76 Missions will continue its work to restore Ireland's international reputation, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis, and to support Ireland's economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">My Department and the Embassy network works in close co-ordination with the State agencies to advance our economic goals in existing and emerging markets. Emerging markets and the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries in particular, provide significant trading opportunities for Irish companies. The Embassies and State Agencies in these countries, and other priority markets, have detailed market plans and are already very active in the promotion of Ireland's economic interests there. The Government will be looking at visits to key markets over the course of this year. In particular, the Taoiseach plans to lead a major trade mission to China later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">While the specific contribution of Embassies will necessarily differ depending on market conditions and other factors, all bilateral Missions have a role to play in promoting trade and investment. The role of the Embassies in trade promotion includes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1461">promoting an awareness of Ireland and its business potential;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1462">assisting Irish companies in gaining and maintaining access for their goods and services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1463">reporting on economic and business trends and developments;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1464">assisting in the resolution of problematic regulatory issues;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1465">maintaining a network of high-level business related contacts</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1466">providing assistance and support to other Government Departments, agencies and, as appropriate, individual companies</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">The further development of the trade promotion role for my Department is a key priority. Discussions are currently taking place between officials in my Department and in the current Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in this regard. I anticipate that these will result in an enhanced relationship between my Department and Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">Ireland's Embassies and Consulates continue to work closely with Enterprise Ireland abroad towards the advancement of Irish business and economic interests and there is also a very good working relationship between my Department and Enterprise Ireland here at home.</p>

            <p eId="para_1939">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">All passport applications are subject to the provisions of the Passport Act, 2008. Section 6 of that Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that an applicant is required to submit any information and documents in relation to that person that is deemed necessary by the Minister for the purpose of processing passport applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">Changes in the method of application for adult first time applicants and for those adults seeking to replace a lost/stolen passport were introduced on 17 January, 2011. The aim of the new requirements was to strengthen procedures to best protect against identity theft and fraudulent passport applications. Given the importance of strengthening procedures, it was decided that the new requirements had to be introduced without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The new requirements were publicised on the Passport Office website www.passport.ie and on the Passport Office telephone information line. Information regarding the new requirements was also issued to An Garda and to An Post, who operate the Passport Express Service used by over 60% of passport applicants. Public notices were published in national newspapers to inform the public of the new requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">Details of these changes are not, however, reflected in the current version of the Passport Application Form Notes which accompanies each application form. There would have been a significant cost to destroying existing stock of forms and printing new forms. Given that those affected by the new requirements represent a relatively small percentage of overall applicants and in order to achieve maximum value for money, it was considered disproportionate to recall and destroy all existing stock at that time. All offices dispensing passport forms were informed of the changes. Revised information notes and application forms which include information on the new requirements introduced in January since that time are currently being developed. The new forms will be available from June 2011. A decision to re-introduce passport fees for citizens, aged 65 or over, was taken by the previous Government. This measure, which was announced in the Budget last December, took effect from 11 April 2011, which was the date set out in Statutory Instrument 47/2011 signed by the then Taoiseach and acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on 3 February 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">This Statutory Instrument also provided for an increase of €15 on the current fee of €80 for passports, where applications are submitted through the ordinary post or over the counter at the Passport Offices. It is important to note that this increase does not apply to those passport applications submitted through the ‘Passport Express' system (and Northern Ireland Passport Express — NIPX). Nor does it apply to applications received from overseas. Details of the new passport fees were publicised on the Passport Office website www.passport.ie. Public notices were also published in national newspapers to inform the public of this change.</p>

It is now placed before the Dáil. In relation to the exemption of contracts below €200,000 from the Construction Contracts Bill 2010, I understand that the Senator pointed out in the Seanad that this threshold was proposed to reduce the administrative burden on contractors involved in smaller contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">I understand that the provision making the decision of an adjudicator non-binding where the dispute is referred to arbitration was included in the Senator's Bill to ensure that the State had the right to appeal a decision to protect the taxpayer. These two concerns remain valid, nonetheless, I am now examining the Bill and will then decide how best to proceed. It is important that a solution to the problem of non-payment must not place an unnecessary regulatory or cost burden on the parties to the dispute, other parties involved in the project, or the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1958">The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code requires that a regulated entity must ensure that, in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation, it acts honestly, fairly and professionally, in the best interests of its customers the integrity of the market, and acts with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its customers.  Any breach of the Consumer Protection Code may be considered under the Central Bank's Administrative Sanctions Procedure. If a consumer feels that he/she has been improperly treated, or that he/she has grounds for complaint for some other reason, he/she may complain to the institution directly. If he/she feels that the complaint has not been addressed to his or her satisfaction he/she may refer the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman, who deals with individual consumer complaints. The Ombudsman will adjudicate on the complaint on the basis of the regulatory requirements on the firm.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">The Consumer Protection Division of the Central Bank of Ireland is conducting a themed inspection of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) policies sold to individuals who subsequently had their claims turned down. The scope of this themed inspection is limited to establishing whether PPI policies were sold to consumers who would not have been eligible to make a redundancy/unemployment claim under the policy and the information should have been known or gathered at the time of the sale.  This will be achieved by reviewing both the claim file for declined claims alongside the relevant sales file for the policy. Feedback will be issued in the form of a letter to the industry following the review, together with suggested proposed changes (if any are identified) to current practices. In addition, if it is necessary and if it is found that firms are not in compliance the appropriate regulatory action will be taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">In 2009 the Financial Regulator (now the Central Bank of Ireland) conducted an examination of the claims handling processes for PPI policies. The examination sought to identify possible claims-related issues before they arise and assess whether reasons for declining to pay out on policies were appropriate. It did not focus on the sales process of PPI products which are typically sold through banks, building societies, credit card providers, credit unions and, to a lesser extent, independent brokers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">The examination found that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1962">Where claimants have satisfied the terms and conditions of the policy, the insurance companies have carried out the claims handling process in an efficient and fair manner.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1963">The highest number of declined claims on illness/disability grounds related to claimants' pre-existing medical conditions, while the highest number of declined claims on unemployment/redundancy grounds related to employment criteria not being met by claimants.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1964">In the course of the onsite inspections it was noted that some claims can be delayed while the firm is waiting on verification from third parties such as doctors and previous employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">The Financial Regulator wrote to all providers to inform them of the findings of the themed inspection and advised firms that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1966">Sellers of these products should ensure that the relevant exclusions, together with qualifying periods at the start of policies, are highlighted to the consumer at the point of sale.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1967">Insurance companies should ensure that the sellers of regular premium PPI products are aware that the premiums for these policies are not necessarily fixed and may increase. As this may affect whether the consumer can afford the premiums in the subsequent years, firms need to impress on the PPI sellers that this should be highlighted in any product sales material.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1968">The present practice across the PPI industry is that, unlike, for example, life assurance policies, firms do not gather information from customers on their state of health or medical history. This information is analysed at the time of a claim being assessed. Firms must ensure that this practice, and its consequences in relation to claims handling, are fully explained to consumers at point of sale.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1969">Firms should endeavour to ensure that consumers are not disadvantaged due to excessive delays on the part of third parties in supplying claim related information. My Department will consult with the Central Bank on ongoing monitoring in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1973">There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to help homeowners in distress to weather the recession. One of these proposals relates to increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008 and to finance this in part by abolishing mortgage interest relief for new buyers from June 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">When this proposal has been thoroughly examined and analysed and the findings and recommendations are presented to me, I will decide on the appropriate action to be taken. However, it is unlikely that any measures will be introduced before Budget 2012. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the terms "second home" and "investment property" are not defined in the tax code for mortgage interest tax relief purposes and, as such, it is not possible to be definitive on the distinction between the two. However, in so far as a second home is generally understood to refer to a property that an individual uses as a home but which is not his or her principal private residence — for example, a holiday home or an apartment used by family members during the academic year — there is no provision in the tax code for interest relief on loans to acquire or improve a second home and I have no plans to introduce any new interest tax relief for this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">In so far as a residential investment property is generally understood to be a property from which the owner seeks to derive profits through lettings, a deduction is allowed (subject to certain conditions) for interest on borrowed money employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of the premises concerned. However, for interest accruing on or after 7 April 2009, the deduction is restricted to 75% of the interest otherwise allowable. Like all proposals for new tax or expenditure measures, this will fall to be considered in the context of the ongoing development of budgetary and economic policy. I would add that the status of a property for tax purposes can vary over time. For example, a second home in use during the academic year might be let at other times of the year. Alternatively, a letting by an individual of a room in his/her principle residence would not give rise to a restriction of mortgage interest relief where the letting is under the rent-a-room scheme.</p>

The scheme ran for around five years and ended on 31 December 2010. Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2011, all biofuels, including E85, are subject to full mineral oil tax rates; however, unlike conventional fuels, biofuels are exempt from the carbon charge. The promotion of biofuel is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">The National Biofuel Obligation, which is operated by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), is now the Government's means of supporting the use of biofuel in the future. The National Biofuel Obligation requires suppliers of road transport fuels to ensure that 4% of their volumes sold on the Irish market is biofuel; it will underpin delivery of the national biofuel target and will take full account of EU biofuels policy, including the sustainability criteria. Experience in Ireland and elsewhere has shown that short-term fiscal measures cannot provide sufficient certainty to producers, and that only an obligation type system can ensure that Ireland seizes the opportunity to take advantage of biofuel, and that the considerable opportunities for the indigenous production of biofuel are exploited .</p>

A levy of 2% of gross premium income was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October of the preceding year. The levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991 and a reduced levy of 1% applied for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992, when it was discontinued as sufficient moneys had been collected to successfully complete the administration of the former PMPA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1987">The Deputy will appreciate that there would be serious obstacles to be addressed to allow for publication of the individual details of the contracts of employment of senior management in financial institutions of the covered institutions and I am not convinced that this would serve, at this stage, the public interest.

            <p eId="para_1988">What this Government has decided to do to address these issues is to ask the National Treasury Management Agency to oblige the covered institutions to undertake a review of their remuneration practice including an analysis of severance payments.

When this information is to hand the Government will decide what approach to take on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">In relation to the payments to the former Managing Director alluded to by the Deputy, I have stated that the amount of money paid is an absolute disgrace and undermines the concept of social solidarity we need to engender if we are to emerge from our present extremely challenging circumstances.

I am presently addressing this deficit with a view to seeing what actions may be available for consideration.

            <p eId="para_1991">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, under section 1041 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a tenant who pays rent on property located in the State directly to a person whose usual place of abode is outside the State and who has not appointed an agent in the State to collect the rent, is required to deduct tax from the gross rent at the standard rate of income tax, which is currently 20%.  The tax deducted by the tenant is effectively a withholding tax at source. The property owner, however, is responsible for his/her own tax affairs and must prepare and submit rental accounts and pay any additional tax due where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">This provision, which governs the commercial rented sector as well as the residential rented sector, has a number of valid and important functions. Firstly, it is a control measure designed to promote greater compliance in this area, having regard to the obvious risk factors associated with non-resident taxpayers. Secondly, it also ensures that a minimum tax payment is made by non-resident landlords in respect of rental income arising here. In the absence of a withholding tax, it would be relatively easy for non-resident landlords to evade tax as Revenue would have no mechanism to recover the tax due as there is no way to force such non-residents to make an Irish tax return and to declare their income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">Following a commitment given during the Committee Stage debate on the 2008 Finance Bill, the legislation was reviewed with a view to establishing if alternative arrangements could be put in place that would minimise the risk of opening up opportunities for tax evasion. The conclusion was that a withholding tax remained the most effective approach and that an alternative arrangement that would minimise the risk of opening up such opportunities simply did not present itself. It is accepted, however, that the section 1041 provision could give rise to some practical difficulties in some cases. In recognition of this, where a tenant acts in good faith and is genuinely unaware of the obligation to deduct tax, or of the residence status of the landlord, Revenue will only seek to apply the legislation from a current date. This practical approach is reflected in Revenue's operational instructions in this area.</p>

The deployment and management of staff in a Government Department or Office is primarily a matter for the head of that Department in the first instance, having regard to policy and operational priorities and the budgets available. Changes in the services provided and in their delivery, in the allocation of work and in the use of information technology are taking place on an ongoing basis within Departments. The current Programme for Government includes a range of initiatives which are intended to lead to savings in the public service pay bill through the reduction of numbers, while the 2011 Budget provides inter alia for the reduction in day to day spending, among other significant policy changes. All of these measures would have a significant bearing on the need for additional staff, and their recruitment and allocation.

            <p eId="para_2021">The Government decided that Ministers and Ministers of State, the Attorney General and the Ceann Comhairle can appoint two civilian drivers on a contract of employment that is co-terminus with their period of appointment as Office Holder. Alternatively, Office Holders have the option to appoint civilian drivers to a twelve month contract if they prefer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">The right of selection rests with an Office Holder and such appointments are personal appointments, under excluding order, as unestablished civil servants. When a Minister of the Government or Minister of State ceases to hold that office for any reason (including a Minister of State becoming a Minister of the Government or vice versa) the contract of his or her personal appointees terminate on that date. Given the nature of the working relationship between Minister and civilian driver this system of selection and appointment will remain in place for the current round of appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">In the case of the recent HSE Voluntary Early Retirement scheme, persons availing of the scheme are not eligible for re-employment in the public health sector or in the wider public service or in a body wholly or mainly funded from public moneys. The same prohibition on re-employment applies under the HSE Voluntary Redundancy Scheme also, except that the prohibition will be for a period of 7 years, after which time any re-employment will require the approval of the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2041">Given the nature of the EU/IMF Programme and the resulting content of the Programme documents, there are numerous references to assessments, reviews and reports. Most of these concern regular reporting requirements that Ireland has to comply with or the quarterly reviews of Programme compliance by the EU, ECB and IMF (Troika). However, there are references to a number of assessments, reports, reviews and studies where these represent, or are pivotal to, the delivery of an action/condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">The texts of the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MoU) are generally clear on deadlines and responsibility for the item in question is normally clear from the issue it relates to. Furthermore, there are also references in some cases to "independent" reviews, reports or assessments. The Government is committed to ensuring that the deadlines specified in the Programme are complied with. Both the MEFP and the MoU have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and circulated to all Deputies in a composite document that also includes the letters of intent to the Troika.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">With regard to the areas under the responsibility of my Department, and that of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Brendan Howlin T.D., I would draw the Deputy's attention to the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2044">The Government is preparing legislation to introduce a new single pension scheme for all new entrants to the public service. In framing the legislation, a review was carried out by my Department of accelerated retirement for certain categories of public servants and indexation of pensions to consumer prices. The results of the review have informed the preparation of the new scheme which, under the programme, must be legislated for by the end of September 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2045">There are several references to the Comprehensive Review of Public Expenditure, which comes under the aegis of Minister Howlin. This review, which is ongoing, is expected to be completed next September.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2046">Minister Howlin's Department will also have primary responsibility to review by the end of September 2011 whether the achieved and projected savings arising from administrative measures to increase efficiency and from public service numbers reductions will meet the projected level required to achieve the fiscal consolidation targets in the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">Finally, the Central Bank of Ireland also has to complete a number of reports, etc. under the EU/IMF Programme. These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2048">An independent advisor is in the process of validating the methodology used in the estimation of future credit losses of Anglo and of performing a three year lifetime loan loss forecast for INBS. The Central Bank will release the conclusions of this exercise in May.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2049">A detailed action plan to strengthen the Central Bank's capacity to supervise credit institutions is to be prepared by end-June 2011. A comprehensive progress report on implementing this action is required quarterly for the duration of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2057">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that traders in any EU Member State who sell goods at the zero rate of VAT to traders in another EU Member State have legal obligations in relation to verifying the VAT numbersof the purchasers; this may be done through the European Commission website at <i>http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/</i>. Traders also have obligations in relation to justifying the application of the zero rate of VAT. The goods must be dispatched or transported from the State in question and the trader has an obligation to confirm that the purchaser of the goods is, in fact, the holder of the VAT registration number quoted at the time of supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">The purchaser of goods under these intra-Community transactions is then legally obliged to account for and pay over the VAT due on the goods at the rate of VAT applicable to the goods in the Member State of that purchaser. Thus, for example, traders in the State who purchase goods from Northern Ireland traders must account for and pay over to the Revenue Commissioners the Irish VAT due on those goods. The EU VAT directives provide that any VAT-registered trader who exports goods to a VAT-registered person in another Member State must complete a VIES statement detailing all the VAT-registered customers in other Member States to whom he/she has supplied goods in respect of which that customer is liable for payment of the VAT due. The VIES statements form the basis of tax compliance programmes in Member States. Council Directive 2008/8/EC (amending Directive 2006/112/EC) provides for the more frequent filing of VIES statements and provides that traders may submit statements on a quarterly or monthly basis. The increased frequency of filing of VIES statements will assist in countering cross-border evasion of VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">In the case of cross-Border transactions between the UK and this State, checking the validity of VAT registration numbers, and indeed other tax compliance information, with their counterparts in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in Northern Ireland in particular, is part of the checks carried out by Revenue officers during audits and assurance checks where risk or suspicions arise. These checks are carried out using the EU VAT Mutual Assistance Programme, which has been designed specifically to tackle cross-border VAT fraud. This programme allows for exchanges of information between EU Member States in relation to VAT matters, and it also allows the presence of officials from one Member State in another Member State while inquiries are being carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_2060">Checks of the control procedures in place between the State and Northern Ireland form part of the work programmes of Revenue's Investigations and Prosecutions Division and the Revenue Regions. Revenue is currently engaged in a number of investigations involving suspected cross-border VAT fraud.</p>

     asked the

     his plans to ensure that children with hearing loss or absence receive signing lessons from early on in order to understand the concept of language.

          </question>
          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_424">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2062">The Deputy may be aware that Section 2 of the Official Languages Act 2003 states that "the official languages" of the State are (a) the Irish language (being the national language and the first official language) and (b) the English language (being a second official language) as specified in Article 8 of the Constitution. I wish to advise the Deputy that Irish Sign language (ISL) has formal recognition in the Education Act, 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science (Skills) to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2064">the special schools for the deaf have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2065">funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education. The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met. This service is available at pre-school, primary and post-primary levels. Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">The Deputy may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with hearing impairment and their families are funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE), either directly or indirectly. Services provided include communication therapy and lip-reading classes as well as sign language classes. My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design. The HEA has allocated €387,000 in core funding to the Centre in the current academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has commissioned an external, high-level review of the issues surrounding deaf education. This review will focus on models of provision with reference to evidenced-based outcomes and the implications of adopting different approaches. I look forward to receiving the policy advice from the NCSE in this regard.</p>

The figure quoted is the December figure for each year. The Deputy will note that there has in fact been an increase in the number of SNA posts. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2072">When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion. Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts. Some further limited alleviation was introduced for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium. The alleviation arrangements are set out in Circular 42/2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2121">I assume that the Deputy is referring to Circular 0070/2010 issued by my Department on 26 November 2010, which outlined that adjustments in salary should be applied, with effect from 1 January 2011, to all relevant staff in the employment of recognised schools or VECs who were not already affected by the pay reductions introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009. Some of the categories of staff affected by this Circular included non-teaching staff in all recognised schools (including recognised private schools).</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">The Deputy should be aware that this measure was introduced by the previous Government. I am aware of the impact this has had on non-teaching staff in recognised schools. Workers across the public sector have taken pay cuts in recent years and the current Government has stated that it will seek to avoid the introduction of further pay cuts in return for full implementation of the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 determined the criteria for reducing the pay of public servants with effect from January 2010. However, when the Act was introduced, there was a question as to how a public servant should be determined for the purposes of this Act. Subsequently, following receipt of legal advice, it has now been determined that all staff employed by a recognised school or VEC come within the definition of "public servant" solely for the purposes of the Act. The legislation does not exempt any individual or groups save for the Judiciary and the President due to provisions in the Constitution. Section 6 does provide a limited power to the Minister for Finance to exempt or vary the reduction in pay rates provided for in the legislation where exceptional circumstances exist or because of an arbitration award. In view of the time lapse involved in reaching a determination on this issue, the previous Minister for Finance allowed for a temporary exemption from the application of the Act for these categories of staff up until 31 December 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">Accordingly, my Department outlined that adjustments in salary should be applied with effect from 1 January 2011, to all relevant staff in the employment of recognised schools or VECs, who were not already affected by the pay reductions introduced under the Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_2132">The Teaching Council was established under the Teaching Council Act 2001 in March 2006 to promote teaching as a profession and the professional development of teachers, to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State, to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers, to provide for the registration and regulation of teachers and to enhance professional standards and competence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">The Teaching Council became a self funding body from the 28th March 2008. The Council raises its funding, in the main, from teachers' initial registration and renewal of registration fees. There is no annual budget allocation from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">I am fully committed to working with the Teaching Council to bring change and improvement and my Department works closely with the Council on an ongoing basis for the betterment of education generally in the State. To that end, I am not considering the abolition of the Teaching Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">The Department of Education and Skills believes all children should be taught by qualified teachers. The purpose of the Teaching Council is to ensure that all teachers employed in Irish schools have appropriate qualifications and that the high quality of the teaching profession is maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">The Teaching Council is similar in purpose to other regulatory bodies for the legal and architectural professions. There is a need to maintain the high quality of our education system and the Teaching Council is part of this framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">The Department of Education and Skills will continue to review the best way of maintaining rigorous educational standards within our education system and the wider teaching profession while ensuring that this is done in a cost effective manner for both the taxpayer and teacher alike.</p>

            <p eId="para_2139">Under the terms of the Primary School Transport scheme pupils are eligible for free transport if they reside 3.2 kilometres or more from, and are attending, their nearest national school or school of amalgamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupils referred to by the Deputy are not attending their school of amalgamation and are therefore not eligible for school transport under the Closed School Rule (CSR).</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">The Deputy may be aware that the cessation of the Closed School Rule (CSR) as it relates to primary school transport eligibility was announced in the 2011 Budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derives from a recommendation in the published Value for Money Review of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">This change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the Value for Money Review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are in fact attending their nearest school. Before implementing this change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the "on the ground" impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve. This analysis will be based on the most up to date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have this information available to me this summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely effects of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</p>

            <p eId="para_2146">I understand that the changes to the student grant schemes introduced under Budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party government were designed to manage additional cost pressures arising from a significant increase in the number of students qualifying for grants, a proportionate increase in the number of students qualifying for higher rates of grants and payment of the Student Service Charge on behalf of grant-holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">These changes include removal of the automatic eligibility of mature students to the higher non-adjacent rate of grant. This will come into effect from the start of the 2011/12 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">I regret that given current economic circumstances I am not in a position to reverse any of the 2011 budgetary changes to the student grant schemes including that relating to the qualifying distance criteria for the non-adjacent rate of grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">The Deputy may wish to know that qualifying mature students, as with all other qualifying students, will continue to receive student grants at the current rate applicable to their individual circumstances together with full support for payment of fees and the Student Contribution. Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to receive a "top-up" in the special rate of maintenance grant. In addition, some €5m remains available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">In addition, qualifying mature students who reside 45 kilometres or more from their higher education institution will be eligible for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">I understand the concerns of students with regard to the 2011 measures and I will take account of these in considering any future changes as part of the budgetary process for 2012 and beyond, having regard to the position of the public finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_2154">I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and to ensure better curriculum continuity across the system. A key objective is to improve attainment levels in Maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level. The reforms are being implemented on the recommendations of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and build on research on international practice, which was published in 2006 by the NCCA (International Trends in Post Primary Mathematics Education — Perspectives on Learning Teaching and Assessment). There are particular concerns that Irish students' performance in OECD PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is not in keeping with the needs of the knowledge society, and that students find particular difficulty in applying mathematical concepts in non familiar contexts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">Project Maths has been widely welcomed by the partners in education, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the National Competitiveness Council, Engineers Ireland, the Task Force on Innovation, and by higher education and industry interests. Improving understanding of and attainment in mathematics is a critical part of the strategy to promote Ireland as a smart economy Project Maths is being implemented on a phased basis over a three period across 5 strands of mathematics as follows:—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2157">Phase 1: Strand 1 — Statistics and Probability + Strand 2 — Geometry and Trigonometry;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2158">Phase 2: Strand 1+2+ Strand 3 — Number + Strand 4 — Algebra;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2159">Phase 3: Strand 1+2+3+4+ Strand 5 — Functions</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">Strands 1 and 2 began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012 at Leaving Certificate and 2013 at Junior Certificate. Strands 3 and 4 will begin in 2011, and strand 5 will start in 2012. The programme builds on the experiences of 24 schools which started the initiative in September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">Examinations in Mathematics continue to be offered at three levels in the system — Ordinary, Higher and Foundation levels, designed to meet the diverse needs of the student population. Given that a key objective is for students to be able to apply mathematical understanding and concepts in familiar and unfamiliar contexts, the format of questions sets out greater detail on the nature of the problem to be addressed, and questions are more "wordy" than heretofore as a consequence. However, every effort is being made to keep the language at a level appropriate to the age of students and the level being studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">With regard to costs for the programme of professional development, the table below includes average salary and team costs, the cost of seminars and professional development events for some 6000 teachers, the cost of administrative support, the development of materials etc.: 2008, €386,058; 2009, €1,757,620; 2010, €2,163,104; 2011, €2,321,157.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">The costs shown above exclude substitution costs, and the additional costs of post graduate programmes for teachers who need intensive support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">The Department proposes to tender for these courses shortly. Since 2010, up to €2m per year has been made available for substitution costs for teachers attending professional development events in school time. Substitution is claimed by schools on a needs basis and the drawdown for this area of expenditure varies in accordance with school needs at any given time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">Costs for the next 2 years are expected to be similar to those for 2011. Costs for further years of the project will be determined at a later date, following consideration of any further requirements for professional development support at that time, and the available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_2185">The issue referred to by the Deputy relates to the allocation of the 5% administration fee provided for in the Supervision/Substitution scheme. The current arrangements for the allocation of the 5% administration fee provide for the allocation of the fee on the basis of 2.5% towards VEC administration staff and 2.5% to schools. These arrangements are set out in my Department's Circular 26/2009 and only apply with effect from the commencement of the 2008/09 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">These arrangements were put in place following agreement with the relevant staffing and management interests, namely the Teachers' Union of Ireland, IMPACT and the Irish Vocational Education Association.

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_451">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2190">I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 140 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">I take the issue of bullying in schools very seriously and am committed to ensuring that schools tackle bullying in all its forms. Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">Every school therefore must have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. The Department has also issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2193">As a further aid to post primary schools, the Department published a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy. The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">I have no plans to conduct a survey of schools in relation in this area. Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2195">The Deputy may be aware that when a Whole School Evaluation (WSE) is conducted by my Department's Inspectorate, the code of behaviour, including its anti-bullying policy, is reviewed by the inspection team to check that it is in line with the Department's guidelines. Inspectors normally meet with the principal, the board, post-holders, year heads, class teachers, programme co-ordinators, the pastoral care team, representatives of the students and parents. During these meetings there is a particular emphasis on the quality of student care and support. The inspectors' evaluation is also informed by observations in classroom settings and throughout the school. Where there are weaknesses in a school's policy or implementation of policies clear recommendations for improvement are made and are included in the published report of the inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2196">Revised procedures for WSE in schools have recently been put in place. A new element of the revised WSE process involves the issuing of questionnaires directly to pupils and parents. Children and parents will be asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying, discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children. This enhanced engagement with parents and pupils through questionnaires aims to further support all schools to implement effective measures to counter bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2197">The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. Since 2001, national professional development support services have provided ongoing support to schools in planning policies on child protection and the code of behaviour and in supporting teachers and principals in the implementation of SPHE. In addition, training on The Stay Safe Programme is offered on an ongoing basis to primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2198">Other measures in place include the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative, the EU Safer Internet Programme campaign and the establishment of the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) which is currently working with over 70 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</p>

            <p eId="para_2200">The content of initial teacher education courses is, currently, a matter for the individual providers and the methodologies used to address bullying varies amongst the providers. In accordance with Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the Teaching Council is empowered to review and professionally accredit programmes of initial teacher education. The Teaching Council has initiated reviews of a range of initial teacher education programmes and will consider course content in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_2201">In general, at primary level, the issue is addressed extensively in a number of different subject areas/modules including Teaching Studies, Professional Development, Social, Personal and Health Education and Psychology. The topics covered include the nature and incidence of bullying in classrooms, types of bullying, effects of bullying, signs and symptoms of bullying, prevention of bullying, dealing with bullying and school policy and bullying. More generally, students cover the area of emotional intelligence, self-esteem etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">At post primary level, as stated above provision varies from provider to provider. However the topic of bullying is addressed in specific modules and seminars related to professional practice of student teachers e.g. Classroom Management, Classroom Mediation Skills, Psychology and Sociology of education. The topic of bullying is also integrated across subject areas. Some providers also run a number of professional development seminars designed to relate to issues student teachers face on teaching practice which cover the topic of bullying. The topic is also dealt with by tutors of teaching practice on an ad hoc basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">My Department's Guidelines on Countering Bullying in Primary and Post Primary Schools (1993) require all schools to have an anti bullying policy. The anti-bullying policy is subject to school inspection. My Department's Template for Developing an Anti Bullying policy makes reference to the nine grounds listed in equality legislation. Schools are advised to include reference to issues of contemporary concern such as text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">The SPHE Support Service provides advice and guidance to schools at Post Primary level on developing and updating their anti-bullying policies. The SPHE Anti-Bullying Co-ordinator is available to give schools in depth advice and support on issues to do with bullying at their request and in addition runs training courses on positive strategies for managing bullying issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2206">I wish to advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able. The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries are of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment (CCEA), has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students. These guidelines issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">The NCCA/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students. The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is a service under the management of my Department which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able. The service is available to schools who may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school. More information on the range of programmes offered by the SESS is available on <i>www.sess.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2213">In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), also under the management of my Department, provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils, whether less able/more able. Issues around exceptional ability and giftedness are addressed as part of the school planning process which is facilitated by the PDST.</p>
            <p eId="para_2214">Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the Programme for Government sets out this Government's commitment to examining supports in place for gifted students and specifically to the creation of improved links with third level institutions on a regional basis, to provide gifted students with access to new programmes or educational resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_2227">I wish to advise the Deputy that Special Schools funded by my Department are intended to cater for children and young persons with special educational needs from 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.  At that point, the Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years. My Department, at that stage, may allocate resources towards an education component of such provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">However, my Department will consider requests from schools who wish to retain students who are over 18 years of age, for an extra school year, in circumstances where they are following courses leading to accreditation at a level of FETAC 3 or above. Applications received from schools in respect of individual pupils will be considered in the context of my Department's policy in this regard, as set out above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">I understand that the student in question will remain in her present school for the 2011/2012 school year as she will not reach 18 years of age until 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education. It is open to the parents concerned to raise any queries they may have relating to their child's special educational needs, including education planning, directly with the school authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2363">I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers made an application to my Department recently to construct a G.P. room/PE Hall, which was rejected as this school had already submitted an application for large scale capital funding for a project which included the construction of a G.P. Room. That application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.4 rating, reflecting the fact that the deficit in mainstream accommodation represents a significant proportion of the schools overall needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2364">The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">The Forward Planning Section of my Department has identified 43 priority areas throughout the country where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level in the medium term. Factors considered included population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. The area to which the Deputy refers has not been included on this list.</p>
            <p eId="para_2366">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. At that point, options to meet the schools needs will be considered further. Information in respect of the current school building programme, along with all assessed applications for major capital works, includingthe project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2367">However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2385">At the forthcoming International Labour Conference to be held in Geneva, in June 2011, the proposal for a draft Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers is a significant and important agenda item. In accordance with standard procedure in respect of the negotiation of any such international labour instruments at the International Labour Organisation (ILO), this matter will be the subject of discussion on a tripartite basis involving Governments, Employer Representative Bodies and Worker Representative Bodies over a three-week period. The possible adoption of any such international labour instruments such as an ILO Convention supplemented by a Recommendation will be subject to the outcome of these discussions at the Conference in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">The Deputy will appreciate that in advance of the detailed discussion and negotiation on the text of any such international instrument, it would be inappropriate to anticipate our position on a draft Convention, the final text of which is not yet settled.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">However, it is worth pointing out that the full suite of employment rights that apply to workers in Ireland are equally applicable to domestic workers. Indeed, Ireland has been cited internationally as an example of good practice in this area, not least through the introduction of a voluntary Code of Practice entitled <i>Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People’s Homes </i>in 2007. Moreover, during Ireland’s tenure on the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation, the Irish Government representative supported the inclusion of an ILO standard-setting instrument in this area on the agenda for consideration by the International Labour Conference.</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">In the context of the forthcoming International Labour Conference, in June, Ireland will continue to play an active role and it is hoped that the ILO will be in a position to adopt a Convention on decent work for domestic workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2390">The setting of commercial rates is a matter for Local Authorities which come under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Local Authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered into the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">The levying and collection of commercial rates are matters for each individual Local Authority. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) is applied to the valuation of each property to obtain the amount payable in rates. The ARV is decided by the elected Members of each Local Authority in their annual budgets, and its determination is a reserved function of the Local Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">The issue of reducing the burden of rates on small businesses, as suggested by the Deputy, would be a policy matter for consideration by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in consultation with the Local Authorities and the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2393">However, I can report that preliminary results from a review carried out by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on commercial rates for 2011 show that 32 of 88 Local Authorities have decreased their annual rate on valuation this year, while 53 kept the same rate as 2010.  This follows a similar pattern to last year, when 31 Local Authorities reduced their ARV and 55 maintained the same ARV as 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">I have had detailed discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on how we can work together to maximise opportunities for local business development and to keep all costs which impact on business as low as possible. This work will continue and will include the exploration of options for further reducing Local Authority charges to business.</p>

            <p eId="para_2396">The County and City Enterprise Boards have been the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector since their establishment in 1993. The CEBs support the micro-enterprises, employing up to 10 people, in the start-up and expansion phases and also promote economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin their role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to an eligible micro-enterprise.  The micro-enterprise sector is a key component of the indigenous small business sector and, I am confident, that it will be key to our economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">In relation to the restructuring of the CEBs there is no doubt but that the County Enterprise Board model has served the micro-enterprise sector very well over the years but there is also no doubt that some restructuring of that model is now required. There have been many changes to the social, economic and technological landscape of Ireland since the establishment of the Boards in 1993 and so it is timely to restructure. However any restructuring must not compromise the State's engagement with and support for our important micro-enterprise sector and in particular must not make it more difficult for the end-user to access the support services available for the Sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">The question of restructuring of the CEBs has been an issue in the public domain since the publication of the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (the "McCarthy Report") in July 2009. Subsequent to the publication of the McCarthy Report, a variety of consultations and discussions with the main stakeholders involved have taken place, including CEB senior staff and Boards, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation I want to ensure that there is a coherent and cohesive delivery of State support to the indigenous business sector based on clear enterprise policy principles laid down by my Department and to ensure that any structural or institutional changes do not compromise the State's support for indigenous businesses. There are a number of schools of thought on the best way forward in relation to any CEB restructuring. All options are being considered at this stage and I am engaging with my officials and with other Government colleagues in order to determine the best way forward</p>

            <p eId="para_2414">As part of the review mission of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland which took place in April a number of revisions to the Programme were agreed. This revised Programme contains agreed actions for Ireland across the whole of Government, some of which will require assessments, reviews or reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">A number of Structural Reforms fall within the remit of my Department, mainly in the following 3 areas:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2416">1. <i>To facilitate adjustment in the labour market</i>
                        </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2417">Under the terms of the revised Memorandum of Understanding with the EU /IMF, the Government is committed to reversing the recent reduction in the national minimum wage.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2418">The commitment to reverse the recent cut in the national minimum wage will require primary legislation. I intend publishing Heads of a Bill to give effect to this commitment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2419">In addition an independent review of the Framework REA (Registered Employment Agreements) and ERO (Employment Regulation Orders) arrangements was initiated on 8 February last and was undertaken jointly by Kevin Duffy, Chairman of the Labour Court acting in an <i>ad hoc</i>  capacity, and Dr Frank Walsh, School of Economics, UCD, under specific terms of reference. The review is a commitment under the EU/IMF programme, which provided not only for agreement with the European Commission Services on the terms of reference but also for follow up discussions on the programme of actions arising.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2420">The report of the independent review team has been completed and was submitted to me on 28 April last. I intend publishing it following consideration by the Government. It is proposed to have early discussions with the European Commission Services on the main findings of the review, in line with the provisions in the EU/IMF Programme. Arising from these discussions, I will present a time-bound comprehensive action plan to follow up on the report's recommendations before the completion of the 4th Review of the EU/IMF Programme due later this year, setting out proposals for any legislative action that may be necessary to give effect to reform measures.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2421">2. <i>To enhance competition in open markets</i>
                        </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2422">In relation to the commitment on strengthening competition law by ensuring the availability of effective sanctions for infringements of Irish Competition Law, my Department is in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General in the matter with a view to meeting the commitment deadline (end Q3 2011).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2423">3. <i>To encourage growth in the retail sector</i>
                        </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2424">The original EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland obliged the Government to conduct a study on the economic impact of eliminating the cap on the size of retail premises with a view to enhancing competition and lowering prices for consumers and to discuss implementation of its policy considerations with the EU Commission's services. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, commissioned Forfás to carry out this study. Forfás recently completed its study and forwarded a report of its findings to both myself as the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and to the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government on 28 April 2011. Implementation of the commitment in the revised EU/IMF plan on this issue is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to pursue, within whose remit planning guidelines rest.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">My Department is currently taking part in the Comprehensive Spending Review, due to be considered by the newly established Economic Council in September 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_2429">The National Employment Action Plan is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people. Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register, are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to FÁS for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.   The Employment Action plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection. The objective is to integrate the unemployment payments elements currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection and the employment services currently provided by FÁS into a single service. This integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and / or seek advice about their training options. The focus will be very much on the individual, his / her rights to a payment, his / her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his / her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_2431">A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment. This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems. The cohort referred to by the Deputy will benefit from this approach.</p>

The focus of BTEA is to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. The BTEA scheme can offer participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">The Programme for Government 2011-2016 includes a commitment to resource a Jobs Fund that will finance a number of measures which will play an important part in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers. BTEA and all other relevant measures will be considered under this commitment.</p>

Consultation with stakeholders will take place. A progress report will be made by end-December 2011 and a programme of reforms will be submitted to Government at the end of the first quarter of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">Finally, officials from my Department have met representatives of the EU, ECB and IMF on a number of occasions and briefed them on developments in the social protection area generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_2546">The then Minister for Finance announced the introduction of a community work placement initiative for up to 5,000 persons in his Budget statement to Dáil Éireann on the 7th December 2010. The initiative, known as Tús, was launched on the 21st December 2010 and work on developing the necessary implementation structures has been underway since then. The aim of Tús is to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year. Some €30 million has been provided in the Department's Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">Following the launch, the Department conducted two trials to develop the delivery of Tús. One trial was based in the Coolock area of Dublin City with the other based in Mullingar, County Westmeath. A total of 119 persons were randomly selected from the live register and offered the opportunity to participate. The results of both trials have been evaluated and the results have informed the development of the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">The preliminary results of both trials are summarised in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2663">The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg under the Communications Regulations Act 2002. In accordance with this function and with its obligations under EU law, ComReg designs and manages the spectrum assignment process bearing in mind its overarching objective of promoting competition in the market and protecting the interests of consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2664">ComReg has recently engaged in consultations on the proposed assignment of spectrum in the 800/900 MHz and 1800 MHz by means of a competitive auction. Based on expert independent advice, it has set a reserve price for the spectrum at a level that reflects the market value of the spectrum and has set a cap on the amount of spectrum that any one operator may bid for, in order to allow new operators to bid for the spectrum and thus increase the level of competition in the market. As the McCarthy Report states, the policy issues surrounding the granting of such licences, permits or rights extend, in some cases, beyond the narrow one of realising maximum market value. In this case, the opening up of the market to new operators resulting in more competitive prices and choice of services for the consumer is of paramount importance in meeting ComReg's overarching objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_2665">ComReg is independent in the exercise of this spectrum management function and I await the outcome of its deliberations in relation to this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2670">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market. Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_2671">Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2672">In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so. The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2673">EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating. Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2674">I am pleased to say that broadband is now available under the NBS in all designated Electoral Divisions (EDs) in the NBS Coverage Area, including the designated EDs in the Longford Westmeath area.</p>

One of the objectives of the RDP is to equip rural dwellers and communities with the appropriate range of skills and training to derive maximum social and economic benefit from the initiatives available under the Axes. Support in this regard is provided for in the Training and Information measure which has an overall programme allocation of €29.45m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2719">The types of support that may be provided under this measure include the provision of flexible learning opportunities in new technology for women, young people and minority groups in particular; the development of training facilities in rural areas both fixed and mobile; facilitation of distant learning through the use of new technologies and developing the capacity of rural dwellers to utilise ICT including the internet and other public/commercial electronic applications. However, the regulatory framework provides that support under this measure shall not  include courses of instruction or training which form part of normal education programmes or systems at secondary or higher levels. Support for mainstream vocational education and training programmes specifically geared to the general labour market are the remit of the European Social Fund (ESF). Training available under the RDP is targeted towards responding only to local community niche needs specific to the measures contained in the programme, e.g. learning to utilise ICT to enhance a rural tourism project. In this context the course outlined in the question would not be eligible for support under the Rural Development Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2731">Responsibility for the RAPID programme transferred to my Department on 1 May 2011. The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within designated RAPID areas nationally. It is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with regard to projects under their responsibility in the different RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2732">My Department administers the RAPID Leverage Schemes, which seek to support small-scale projects identified locally by Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas. These schemes have been co-funded by the relevant agencies and projects have focused on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities and the provision of playgroups.</p>
            <p eId="para_2733">The RAPID Programme faces significant challenges, given that the budget for the RAPID Leverage Schemes has reduced from an out-turn of €9 million in 2009 to a capital allocation of €2.5 million in 2011. In order to ensure the continued relevance of RAPID, my Department is assessing the case for changing the policy direction of the programme, with a greater focus, inter alia, on the coordination and local consultation roles of the programme, and enhancing the opportunities for input by residents in disadvantaged areas. As part of these deliberations, consultations with the National Monitoring Committee as well as the Chairs and Coordinators of the Area Implementation Teams will take place in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2741">In general, planning permission must be obtained for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast. A decision on a planning application is, of course, a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bórd Pleanála on appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2742">Under Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  These include the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antennae support structure; the erection of an antennae support structure in place of an existing antennae support structure; and the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings (other than education facilities and childcare facilities or hospitals).</p>
            <p eId="para_2743">The above exemptions are conditional, among other things, on the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_2744">My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunication Antennae and Support Structures in 1996. The Guidelines are intended to assist planning authorities, An Bórd Pleanála, the licensed providers of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with these developments within the planning system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2745">The Guidelines set out a locational hierarchy in relation to the siting of radio masts and advise that free-standing masts should only be located within or in the immediate surrounds of smaller towns or villages as a last resort. If such a location should become necessary, the masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for specific location. In the vicinity of large towns and in city suburbs, operators should endeavour to locate masts and antennae in industrial estates or in industrial zoned land. The Guidelines further advise that, only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in residential areas or beside schools. Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to any Ministerial Guidelines in the performance of their functions. The issue of the potential health effects of mobile phone masts was the subject of an Expert Group Report commissioned by the Government and published in March 2007. This Report, entitled "Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields", is available for download on my Department's website (<i>www.environ.ie</i>). The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion to date is that no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, a minority group of scientists believe otherwise and extensive international research on the issue continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">My Department's current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile masts or base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group, is that there is no scientific basis or evidence of adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields below ICNIRP levels. This applies irrespective of the location of the mobile phone mast.</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">I have no current plans to amend the Regulations in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2751">I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, 255 and 256 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">In October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled that Ireland failed to adopt the necessary legislation to comply with Articles 4 and 8 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC, known as the Waste Directive, regarding domestic waste waters disposed of in the countryside through septic tanks and other individual waste water treatment systems. I expect to announce the details of proposed legislation to address the judgment, following Government consideration of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">The introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints. Insofar as support for the upgrading of septic tanks is concerned, this matter is being considered by my Department in the context of developing the overall response to the ECJ judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">The question of carrying out a review of the Environmental Protection Agency's Code of Practice: Waste Water Treatment Systems Serving Single Houses  is a matter for the Agency. The Agency is authorised under Section 76 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Act, 1992 (as amended), to prepare and publish codes of practice for the purpose of providing guidance with respect to compliance with any enactment or otherwise, for the purposes of environmental protection. The Code stipulates that site suitability assessors should carry out all assessments in accordance with the guidance provided in the Code and that the site suitability assessment methodology set out in the Code should be used by planning authorities to satisfy the requirements of Article 22(c) of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2006. The EPA has indicated that the Code of Practice will be subject to ongoing review with regard to emerging on-site wastewater treatment system technologies. However, the frequency and nature of such reviews are matters for the EPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">It should be noted that the Code of Practice provides that where a site is deemed unsuitable for discharge to ground, any alternative options may be discussed with the relevant planning authority. The Code of Practice also provides that innovative products and technologies may be used in Ireland if they have the appropriate certification, are fit for purpose in the conditions in which they are used and meet the performance requirements of the Code.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">Finally, I understand that the EPA is funding a research project regarding the use of on-site wastewater treatment systems in low permeability soils and subsoils. This project may contribute solutions to the difficulties posed by sites with difficult percolation conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2758">My Department's involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. The detailed administration of the schemes, including the assessment, approval of applications and the level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2759">To assess the overall level of demand for grant assistance under the suite of grants my Department requested local authorities to submit details of their funding requirements for 2011, broken down into contractual commitments in respect of works underway, value of applications currently on hand and value of anticipated applications in 2011, with a view to determining the allocations for this year as soon as possible after the publication of the 2011 Revised Estimates for Public Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2760">Exchequer allocations totalling almost €64m were notified to local authorities under the grant schemes on 17 February 2011, giving a combined allocation of almost €79.5m. The allocation to Louth County Council for 2011 is €1.08m. This compares to an exchequer allocation in 2010 of €2.16m of which €2.14m was drawn down by year end, relating to the payment of 244 grants. So far, Louth County Council has not drawn down any of the 2011 allocation.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
            <p eId="para_2788">My Department's involvement with the suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">Three separate schemes are available. The housing adaptation grant for people with a disability assists people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs. Eligible works include the provision of access ramps, stair lifts, accessible toilet and shower facilities, wheelchair access and extensions. The effective maximum grant under the scheme is €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the approved cost of works for applicants, including those in full-time employment, who have gross household incomes of up to €30,000 per annum, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">The mobility aids grant scheme is available to fast track grants of up to €6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. Qualifying works include the provision of stair lifts, level access showers, access ramps, grab rails and some minor adaptation works to the fabric of the house such as adaptation of downstairs room/closet to provide sanitary facilities etc. The effective maximum grant available is €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works subject to a maximum annual household income threshold of €30,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">The housing aid for older people scheme provides grants of up to €10,500 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out. Grant eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating, cleaning, painting etc. Maximum grant available is €10,500 which may cover up to 100% of the costs of works for applicants with gross annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">Matters such as the assessment and approval of individual applications, decisions on the eligibility of particular works, fixtures or fittings for grant assistance, and the payment of grants to householders, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_2797">I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 to 242, inclusive, and 268 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2798">Almost €6 billion in Exchequer funding has been invested in water services infrastructure between 1997 and 2010. The expenditure is administered through the Water Services Investment Programme and the Rural Water Programme. The Water Services Investment Programme is a multi-annual investment plan for the provision of major water and sewerage schemes. The first rolling 3-year Water Services Investment Programme was launched in July 2000 to meet identified water services needs. The water services investment programme 2010-2012  is the current such plan, and is available in the Oireachtas library along with previous plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">Responsibility for the administration of the Rural Water Programme, which includes group water schemes and small public water and sewerage schemes, has been devolved to local authorities since 1997. The selection and approval of individual schemes for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocation provided, is therefore a matter for the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">Total Exchequer expenditure on Water Services capital works in the years 1997 to 2010 is outlined in the following table:</p>

The water services investment programme 2010-2012 outlines the number of major contracts which it is anticipated will commence in the period together with details of schemes in planning. Schemes can comprise a series of contracts, for example for treatment plants and networks. Statistics on activity under the Water Services Investment Programme from 1997 to 2009 generally relate to schemes, while data set out in the table in relation to the number of projects completed in 2010 relates to contracts.</p>

            <p eId="para_2960">This process has resulted in the realignment of local delivery structures and has reduced the overall number of local development bodies from 94 to 52. These comprise 15 Local Development Companies (LDCs) in urban areas and 37 in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">The current phase of this work, which is well advanced, is focused on integrating some 160 Community Development Projects across the country with the 52 LDCs. This process has been the subject of extensive engagement with the various stakeholders and is due to be completed in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">While I have no immediate plans to transfer responsibility for the Local Development Companies to the City/County Development Boards, my Department will continue to work towards identifying further efficiencies to bring about more effective delivery of services and supports for citizens at a local level. This will include the consideration of options for the greater alignment of local development arrangements and Local Government in accordance with the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">The City/County Development Boards (CDBs) already play a key role in endorsing the strategic plans of the Local Development Companies operating within their areas. This process facilitates and promotes a co-ordinated delivery of the services provided by the LDCs at local level, by ensuring complementarity between their individual plans and the CDB Strategy for the relevant county/city. It aims to avoid duplication of work by the local bodies concerned and allow CDBs to identify gaps in the work being carried out by the various local bodies, thereby helping to maximise the impact of programmes for local communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3008">Under the programme in question, I understand that an Area Implementation Team (AIT), which draws up a plan based on the particular needs of the area so that available funding can be targeted where it will do the most good in the community, has been established for the area in question. The inaugural meeting of the AIT took place on 15 April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3009">The AIT includes representatives of the Department of Social Protection, the relevant local authority, An Garda Síochána, Youth Services, HSE, VEC and others. I understand that the community forum structure has been agreed, task groups have been formed and there is agreement on the role of agencies and on chairing of task groups. A Co-ordinator for the area is in place since January 2010, funded by the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3010">As regards the proposal to allocate additional funding for the area in question from the Dormant Accounts Fund, I can confirm that eight projects have been prioritised by Pobal. These are currently being considered by my Department in the context of the reduced level of funding available to the Department in the current year, and also in the context of the review of expenditure that is being undertaken. Any decisions arising will be notified to all applicants as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_3014">The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). Since its establishment in April 2003 to the end of February 2011, the transfers to the DAF have totalled some €589m, which includes interest earned of some €35m. Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to approximately €208m. On 1 May 2011, the functions relating to Dormant Accounts, previously administered by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, transferred to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3015">A summary of the current status of the DAF is available on the website <i>www.pobail.ie</i> and I am arranging for a copy to be sent to the Deputy in the coming days. This provides a profile of the Fund showing yearly inflows, reclaims, disbursements, etc, from 2003 to the end of February 2011. Disbursements from the DA Fund are paid from the Votes of the relevant Departments which, in turn, are reimbursed from the Fund. Expenditure under the Fund is spread across some 10 Departments and Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3016">Under the Government Accounting procedures, disbursements on dormant accounts measures are paid in the first instance "up front" from a Department's Vote in the same way as with any other spending programme. Therefore, Government Departments have to source funding for dormant accounts programmes from their Exchequer allocations. However, once expenditure takes place, either on administration of the measure, or by the project itself, it is reimbursed to the Exchequer from the Dormant Accounts Fund in accordance with the Dormant Accounts Acts, in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid payable through the relevant Department's Vote. In this way, the costs associated with dormant accounts measures are Exchequer neutral, though it should be noted that Government Departments cannot spend Appropriations-in-Aid directly themselves once they are reimbursed from the Fund. They are instead refunded to the central Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3017">Monies disbursed from the Fund increase Government debt levels as the money belongs to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State. Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.</p>

            <p eId="para_3019">The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (The McCarthy Report) recommended the discontinuation of Dormant Accounts Board (the DAB), which has statutory functions relating to disbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund. The Report stated that this would result in an annual saving to the Exchequer of €1.7m. It should be noted, however, that the majority of the administrative budget for DA is paid to Pobal, who administer my Department's and certain other Departments' DA Measures. The DAB receives only a small proportion of the overall administrative budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_3058">The position is that Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 has updated the law in relation to the acquisition of easements and <i>profits a prendre</i> in line with recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, provides that such legal interests in land shall be acquired at law by prescription only on registration of a court order under that section.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">Late last year the Law Society made a submission to my Department which contained proposals to amend the 2009 Act with a view to simplifying the procedures for registering easements and <i>profits a prendre </i> acquired by prescription. During recent discussions involving my Department, the Law Society and the Property Registration Authority, agreement was reached on the outline of a draft scheme whereby the Authority would be empowered to register such legal rights without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act on being satisfied that the claim had been substantiated.</p>
            <p eId="para_3060">In order to give statutory effect to the proposed scheme, amendments to the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 will be required. I intend therefore to include the necessary amendments to both Acts in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will be published later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3062">I can inform the Deputy that the Property Registration Authority (PRA), which manages the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, is the registering body in relation to property in Ireland. A search has been carried out in the Land Registry and it appears that the address in question is an unregistered property.</p>
            <p eId="para_3063">While it is possible to conduct a search in the Registry of Deeds, Henrietta Street, it is difficult to establish the name of an owner from the records held there. This is because the Registry of Deeds is a register of grantors (i.e. the persons who sold or granted the property to the current owners), and not a register of owners. In order to carry out a search the customer would therefore need to know the name of the grantor. Other possible sources of relevant information are:</p>

            <p eId="para_3075">The person concerned applied for asylum on 20 May, 2010. His asylum application was considered by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 3 February 2011, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3076">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

            <p eId="para_3081">Section 14 of the Fines Act 2010, which was commenced from 1 January last, places an obligation on the court to take account of the defendant's financial circumstances before a fine is imposed. Section 15 of the Act, when commenced, will allow a person on whom a fine has been imposed to apply to the court to pay the fine by instalments. If the court is satisfied that to pay in full by the due date for payment would cause undue hardship, it can direct that payment be made by instalments over a period of one year and, in exceptional circumstances, over a two year period. This provision will apply to fines over €100. The Act is being commenced on a phased basis. It is intended to commence section 15 as soon as the necessary arrangements have been put in place by the Courts Service to facilitate its operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">The Deputy will appreciate that the length of time an offender has to pay a fine can vary considerably and is determined amongst other things by the discretion of the judge and value of the fine. I am however informed that the Courts Service has made significant improvements to the fines collection process for court imposed fines. This includes timely and frequent issue of reminders, together with the provision of a convenient on-line payment facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3083">The value of fines outstanding is assessed on a rolling 12 month period. For the 12 months to the end of December 2010, the total value of fines imposed was €43m (120,000 fines). The total value of fines collectable after adjusting for appeals or cancellations was €29m (92,000) of which €21m (68,000) were paid giving a collection rate of 71% based on value and 73% based on volume. This leaves approximately €8m (24,000) fines outstanding in the year ending 31 December 2010. This represents a significant improvement over an estimated collection rate of 50% in 2007 and in 2010 resulted in an estimated additional €8.0m in fines collected. Finally, the Programme for Government 2011 to 2016 contains a commitment to provide for attachment of earnings in relation to fines and I am developing proposals in this regard at present.</p>

The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act of 2006, specifically provides that any person who assaults or threatens to assault a peace officer (including members of An Garda Síochána) acting in the execution of his or her duty, knowing that he or she is, or being reckless as to whether he or she is, a peace officer so acting, shall be guilty of an offence. The 2006 Act also increased the maximum penalty to 7 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty is also guilty of an offence. I have no proposals at present for further legislation in relation to this matter but the situation will be kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3095">I propose to take Questions Nos. 279, 289 to 291, inclusive, and 293 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3096">It should be noted that under the criminal law as it stands at present, it is not an offence, in itself, to sell sex. In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either. Consequently, neither party to the transaction is currently criminalised. Any proposal to amend the law in terms of criminalising the purchase of sex would require very careful examination. In this jurisdiction, the criminal law governing prostitution is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3097">Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution. The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party — a pimp, for example. The Act also provides for offences such as organising prostitution, coercing or compelling a person to be a prostitute, knowingly living on the earnings of a prostitute, or keeping or managing a brothel. In addition, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, which criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation, makes it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">In 2010, the Swedish Government completed an evaluation of its 1999 legislation criminalising the purchase of sex. The Dignity Project arranged a visit to Sweden in September last year to learn more about the evaluation and the delegation included representation from my Department. The Dignity Project was a research project funded by the EU. An inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional initiative led by the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, examined services provided to victims of human trafficking with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries. My Department's Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and the Garda National Immigration Bureau were partners with observer status.</p>
            <p eId="para_3099">I will be examining a report prepared by my Department following the visit to Stockholm and which was submitted to the Attorney General's Office. I will also be examining the Attorney's recent advices concerning the legal and constitutional implications of introducing a ban on the purchase of sex. It will be appreciated that I have not yet had the opportunity to consider the report, including the question of its publication, and the advices received.</p>

            <p eId="para_3119">I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that the Government's legislative programme for the current term provides for the publication of a new Spent Convictions Bill. The new Bill will build on the recommendations contained in the Report prepared by the Law Reform Commission. Unlike the 2007 Bill mentioned by the Deputy, it will elaborate the arrangements in a very comprehensive way, leaving no doubt about the conditions to be met before a conviction can be regarded as spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3120">It is important to understand that neither the 2007 Bill nor the one I will bring forward provide for the removal of a conviction from the criminal record. Instead, the legislation will provide that in certain circumstances, the details need not be disclosed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3121">Currently, the only mechanism available for the non-disclosure of previous convictions is that provided in Section 258 of the Children Act 2001. That section provides for non-disclosure after a period of 3 years has elapsed in the case of certain convictions for offences committed before turning 18. Offences triable by the Central Criminal Court are excluded. In addition, the section can be availed of only if the person has not been dealt with for an offence in the previous three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3122">No similar legislation exists at present in respect convictions acquired by adults. The proposals that I will be bringing forward will provide for the non-disclosure of past convictions of adults for certain offences where the sentence is within specified limits and after a qualifying conviction free period has elapsed. However, the Bill will provide for exceptions, such as job applications for certain sensitive employment posts. It is intended that the provisions will have full retrospective and prospective effect, in other words, it will apply to qualifying convictions acquired before the commencement of the legislation as well as those acquired following commencement.</p>

            <p eId="para_3135">The Deputy's question confuses two reports. The report "Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution — The Experiences of Migrant Women in Ireland" commissioned by the Immigrant Council of Ireland is separate from the report referred to by the Deputy as having been produced by the voluntary and NGO Group ‘Turn off the Red Light' lodged with the Attorney General's Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3136">The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit in my Department were asked by the previous Minister to examine the report "Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution — The Experiences of Migrant Women in Ireland". The Report is wide ranging and its recommendations required extensive consultation. The examination which was conducted in conjunction with a number of other Government Departments and Agencies is at an advanced stage. Many of the Report's recommendations insofar as they relate to the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation have been addressed in the National Action Plan To Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland 2009-2012 published in June 2009 and through the consultative structures such as the Round-table Forum and five interdisciplinary Working Groups described in the National Action Plan. I expect to receive a report in the coming months and I will consider what further actions, if any, are necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3137">The report lodged with the Attorney General's Office was a report prepared by officials of my Department following a visit to Sweden in September 2010 by them and members of the Dignity Project to examine Swedish legislative provisions in relation to prostitution, the so-called ‘Swedish model'. The Dignity Project was a two year, EU funded, research project into international best practice for services to victims of sexual exploitation and human trafficking which concluded on 7 February 2011. In relation to this other report, I would refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply of today to Questions Nos. 279, 289, 290, 291, and 293.</p>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3148">Following the consideration of his case, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned on 8th August, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">This Order was served by registered post dated 12th January, 2005 which placed a legal obligation on the person concerned to ‘present' at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned ‘presented' as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3150">On 28th February, 2005, judicial review proceedings were lodged in the High Court on behalf of the person concerned, challenging the decision of the then Minister to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. The Judicial Review Leave application was refused on 29th November, 2006. The person concerned was advised by registered letter dated 9th January, 2007 that as the judicial review proceedings had been determined, it was intended to proceed with his removal from the State. He was required to ‘present' at the Offices of the GNIB on Monday 15th January, 2007 in order to make arrangements for his removal from the State. He ‘presented' as required and was given further presentation dates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">An application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned, by his legal representative, under cover of a letter dated 23rd March, 2009. While it appeared at that time, based on an earlier High Court Judgment, that a person subject to a Deportation Order could seek the exercise of Ministerial discretion, pursuant to Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, to having a Subsidiary Protection application examined, in circumstances where new facts or circumstances had been advanced which demonstrated a change from the position which obtained at the time the Deportation Order was made, this position was overturned by a Supreme Court decision dated 9th July, 2010 which ruled that Minister did not have such a discretion. As a result, it is not open to the Minister to consider an application for Subsidiary Protection from a person who was the subject of a Deportation Order on the date the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 came into force on 10th October, 2006. Accordingly, the Subsidiary Protection application submitted by the person concerned cannot be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3152">The person concerned, through his legal representative, has submitted further representations which are being treated as an application for the revocation of the existing Deportation Order, as provided for under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This application is under consideration at present. When a decision has been made on that application, the decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">In the mean-time, the person concerned remains the subject of a Deportation Order and, as such, he is legally obliged to comply with any reporting requirements placed on him by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_3154">I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</p>

     the country, if he will consider providing fire fighting services from Defence Forces helicopters; if he will consider the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of aerial fire fighting as distinct from ground fire fighting, with specific reference to the usage of helicopter buckets and bambi buckets, which have the capacity to deliver 2,600 gallons of water; if he will examine the possibility of establishing a national aerial fire fighting service with three or four of these helicopter buckets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3160">The provision of fire fighting services is primarily a matter for the local authorities. Fire service provision, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981. The White Paper on Defence (2000) does however provide for the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities. In that regard, the Air Corps responded to a request from the local authorities on Sunday 1st May last to deploy Air Corps assets to assist fire-fighting efforts in Counties Donegal and Mayo. Helicopters fitted with specialist under slung bambi buckets were deployed continually up until Wednesday 4th May last to release water on fires in Co. Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3161">In addition to their military roles, Air Corps helicopters carry out a variety of taskings including air ambulance, inland Search and Rescue and support to An Garda Síochána. It is therefore not possible to dedicate these assets exclusively to a fire fighting role. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Phil Hogan, T.D., that he has no plans to establish a national aerial fire fighting service.</p>

My Department was not in a position to approve the application from the person named under the Early Retirement Scheme as the scheme conditions were not met. In order to qualify as a ‘category A' applicant under the scheme, the proposed transferee of the applicant's land must be approved for payment under the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme. As this requirement was not met the person named did not qualify for a pension under the ERS. The Young Farmer's Installation Scheme is now closed to new applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3329">My Department wrote to the person named on 8 February 2010, offering the option of resubmitting the application as a ‘category B' application under the scheme which entails the proposed transferee securing a minimum of 5 hectares of enlargement land. Such an application was received in my Department on 6 April 2010. A number of problems were identified when this application was assessed. Officials from my Department have requested clarification of these issues from the person named on three occasions. The latest request was made on 27 April 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_3332">Under the Agriculture, (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc has statutory responsibility for the provision of education and training services to the agriculture sector. The delivery of these services is an operational matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">In the past, the Farm Apprentice Board had responsibility for farm apprenticeship training programmes. The functions and staff of the Board transferred to Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, in 2002. Teagasc continued to offer this programme and graduates received an Advanced Certificate in Farm Management. In line with general trends in agricultural education in the period 2000 to 2006, demand for this course declined, and student intake dropped sharply with the result that the course ended in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">The demand for agricultural education has accelerated greatly in recent years. To cater for future ‘professional farmers' Teagasc now offers specialised two year Advanced Certificate Programmes in Dairy Herd Management, Drystock Management and Crops and Mechanisation at various Agricultural Colleges. These specialised Programmes are very well regarded by students and are viewed by Teagasc as the essential building block for professional farmer training in the future. The Advanced Dairy Programme, for example, currently produces approximately 60 dairy graduates per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">Teagasc is currently assessing future training needs of professional dairy farmers in light of the recent Report from the Dairy Expansion Activation Group, which recommended the current 2-year Dairy Diploma course be extended to a four-year Dairy Herd Management qualification. I understand Teagasc intend to explore possibilities in regard to a ‘dairy internship' type programme with other stakeholders.</p>

Minister McEntee informed the Dáil of these developments on 3 May 2011. Further consideration will be given to the matter on receipt of a revised proposal taking account of additional points raised by my Department.</p>

All applications for sea-fishing boat licenses are considered by the Licensing Authority.

            <p eId="para_3374">Following an oral hearing on 3 February 2011, which was attended by Mr. Leonard and the Licensing Authority, the Appeals Officer upheld the decision that the capacity had expired and refused the appeal.</p>

            <p eId="para_3417">The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) sets educational qualifications and lays down standards for provision of ambulance services in the statutory, private and voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3418">Since its establishment in 2000, the Council has worked in particular to ensure that pre-hospital personnel in the statutory, private and voluntary sectors are appropriately trained for the roles which they carry out. It awards qualifications at three levels under the National Qualifications for Emergency Medical Technicians scheme. These levels are emergency medical technician (the minimum qualification), paramedic and advanced paramedic.</p>
            <p eId="para_3419">PHECC also registers all qualified pre-hospital practitioners, including those in private and voluntary services, and has implemented practice standards for practitioners, through clinical practice guidelines, and for emergency ambulances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3420">The National Ambulance Service College (NASC), in affiliation with University College Dublin (UCD), meets the training needs of the Health Service Executive and its National Ambulance Service. The NASC/UCD does not have a remit or resources to provide training or education for external individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3421">The Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB) paramedic training is provided by its Training Institute in affiliation with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. As the DFB does not fall under the remit of my Department, I am not in a position to advise on its admission criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_3422">An alternative pathway would be to seek a place on a student paramedic programmerun by the two institutes recognised by PHECC. The HSE advertises such vacancies on <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_3424">Action 62 of the National Drugs Strategy (interim) 2009-2016 provides for a review of Drugs Task Forces, including inter alia, a review of their boundaries.  The objective of the review is to ensure that maximum benefit is achieved from the activities of Drugs Task Forces, that best value is achieved from the financial and staff resources available, and that effort is targeted to maintain progress made and address new and emerging issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3425">The National Drugs Strategy also provides for measures to strengthen the governance and accountability of Drugs Task Forces.  In line with the Strategy, Drugs Task Forces are required to report on their activities, including their broader strategic and co-ordination work, during 2010 and their action plans for 2011. The reports will also provide a profile of Drugs Task Force projects, including an assessment of the projects as a group, in addressing the local drugs problem.   In this context, the reporting process will feed into the Article 62 review, which I referred to above. The reports from the Drugs Task Forces, together with the annual report from the Oversight Forum on Drugs, which monitors progress at national level, will form the basis for a national review of outputs and outcomes under the Strategy.</p>

I have been advised that the staff in question were employed in a temporary capacity by the HSE in 2010 for a period of six months. These contracts were subsequently extended on the basis of being terminated on a phased basis from end-June to end-September 2011. The HSE has appointed Transition Managers from within the Community Welfare Service, to work with the Department of Social Protection to oversee the transfer of the service to that Department and assist with practical issues that arise in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3557">As previously advised, there were approximately 1,600 people receiving financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme at the end of 2009. During 2010, over 11,700 people qualified for financial support under the scheme. At end-March 2011, there were approximately 12,380 people in receipt of financial support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3558">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme does not cover therapies because a person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the Scheme.

            <p eId="para_3559">In determining the services covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme (i.e. as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same items or service).</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_3647">Under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme contract, general practitioners (GPs) are obliged to provide services in their practice premises or by way of domiciliary visits, as appropriate, for their medical card and GP visit card patients, for 40 hours each week. They must also make arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum/deputy, for emergencies outside of these hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_3648">GP out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. The total annual cost of funding GP out-of-hours services is some €110 million. In 2010 the HSE provided over €8 million in funding to SouthDoc to provide GP out of hours services in Counties Cork and Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">Persons who contact GP out-of-hours co-operatives are prioritised as either emergency, urgent or routine. In emergency cases a triage nurse will generally arrange for the dispatch of an ambulance and/or duty doctor. For non-emergency calls a triage nurse carries out a structured assessment by telephone of the patient's symptoms. The nurse may provide advice over the phone, make an appointment for the patient to be seen by the duty doctor at a treatment centre or, if necessary, a home visit may be arranged.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">The total payments to GPs under the GMS Scheme in 2009 was over €472 million. The decision to remove the "distance from the GP's surgery" as a payment criterion for the GMS GP Contract was taken in 2010 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009. This decision has to be seen in the light of the country's current financial circumstances and the fact that salaried health staff have all had pay cuts in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_3676">Although FAS is a specific diagnosis, there are many features that need to be present, as well as a history of pre-natal alcohol intake. For these reasons the diagnosis of FAS is difficult and is frequently either misdiagnosed or unconfirmed.</p>

            <p eId="para_3715">During a recent visit to the region my colleague, Minister Reilly, took the opportunity to visit Clonakilty Community Hospital, to inform himself on the range of services provided at the hospital, the rationale for the reduction in long stay beds at the hospital and the potential impact of this decision. During the visit the Minister was informed of the developments which have taken place in Clonakilty Community Hospital in recent years. These include: the development of a Dementia Unit; the refurbishment of inpatient accommodation to provide an improved living environment; and designation of beds to provide respite, palliative care and community support. During the visit the background to the decision to reduce the number of residential beds at the hospital was outlined in detail. This included: nationally agreed model of care for provision of health services to older people, with emphasis on supporting older people to live at home; national and local analysis of requirements for residential care for older people; the requirements to meet HIQA standards including those relating to the environment; the impact of the Public Sector Recruitment Moratorium and the need to ensure that the remaining staffing resources are targeted to meet prioritised needs; and the impact of the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Fair Deal) on the demand for places in public units.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">The HSE set out the reasoning behind the approach taken along with the need to address the issue of ward accommodation at the hospital where there are a number of wards with a large number of beds. The Minister asked that the HSE examine the potential to rearrange beds and services at the hospital in order to determine whether it would be possible to retain some of the 16 beds earmarked for closure for a period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3717">The Department is currently considering the future of HSE Provision of Residential Care for Older People. This review will consider the position of all HSE residential facilities for Older People in terms of meeting the National Standards and Regulations. It will also consider local demographic pressures and the extent of existing public and private provision, with a view to developing an overall strategy on how the Executive should continue to provide this service in view of current budgetary and other pressures.  Any plans that the Executive may have to close or withdraw residential care beds is suspended until the Minister has had an opportunity to consider the findings of the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3718">I should make it clear, however, that, providing quality and safe care for our long stay residents will have to remain at the heart of these considerations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3720">Government policy is to enable older people to remain at home and in their communities, which is where they want to be. This is underpinned by significant investment to support older people to live at home for as long as possible through a range of community services, including home help. In some cases, where the service is approved and funded by the HSE, this may be undertaken through partnership arrangements with non-statutory providers to maximise service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_3721">The Department of Health and Children accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the delivery of home care overall, whether by statutory or non-statutory providers. During 2010, the HSE and the Department progressed various improvements to home care provision, particularly relating to the standardisation and governance of services. The on-going procurement initiative for HSE home care recipients is fundamental to effecting improvement overall. This process does not reflect a policy of privatisation but, rather, a more standardised approach to the procurement of services nationally. It is designed, primarily, to enhance client safety and quality, and complement the long standing partnership model of the HSE. It should be noted that approximately 75% of all home help services are provided directly by HSE staff, and these services will not be affected by the current procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3722">The process has been carried out in accordance with relevant EU Guidelines. All tenderers must comply with quality standards set by the Executive. Successful tenderers will be monitored by the HSE to ensure services supplied are in line with the contract and quality measures set, including Garda Vetting, qualifications or other requirements pertaining to those caring for vulnerable older people on behalf of the Executive. The Department of Health and Children will continue to liaise closely with the HSE in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy, while progressing all other initiatives relevant to developing community based services for older people.</p>

            <p eId="para_3732">Following discussions in 2010 between the Director of the Office of Clinical Strategy and Programmes in the HSE and the Irish Consultant Neurologists' Association (Neurology Faculty) it was agreed to appoint a number of Neurologists to lead three key national programmes. The setting up of these programmes shows the importance that the HSE gives to neurological care and its commitment to improving access to neurological services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3733">In this regard, I welcome the action plan for neurological care by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland (NAI), to which the Deputy refers. This plan emphasises the importance of neurological care and raises many issues that these neurology programmes will address.</p>
            <p eId="para_3734">The first of these programmes deals with neurology outpatient departments and aims to provide standardised care for neurology patients and to increase access so that patients will not wait more than thirty days for an appointment. The programme is due to establish referral guidelines and encourage the increased use of neurolink. The second programme deals with epilepsy services and aims to introduce rapid access clinics and introduce twenty four hour, seven day a week telephone access to expert opinion for all healthcare professionals. It is intended that this programme will assist with admission avoidance and reduce the number of attendances to emergency departments.  The third programme deals with stroke services and aims to establish robust clinical governance systems for stroke care, including local stroke teams and regional stroke networks. This programme is due to include access to safe and effective stroke thrombolysis in all hospitals admitting acute stroke on a twenty four hour, seven day a week basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3735">The HSE has emphasised to my Department that all national programmes, including those concentrating on neurology, will have a focus on patient advocacy. These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals' needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3736">The NAI action plan includes reference to access to neurological rehabilitation services. My Department is in the process of finalising a National Policy and Strategy for the delivery of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 — 2015. The Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2011 includes a commitment to target people waiting for a neurology out-patient appointment, appoint a national clinical lead for neuro-rehabilitation and establish an implementation structure and develop an implementation plan for neuro-rehabilitation.</p>

Regulations are being drafted to give effect to these reductions. The HSE is also taking measures to achieve significant savings in expenditure under the scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_3753">Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, individuals contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 5% of the value of any assets per annum towards their cost of care. The first €36,000 of an individual's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The scheme includes a safeguard that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">An individual's principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap. It means that individuals pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care. After 3 years, even if an individual is still in long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether an individual chooses to opt for the loan or not. The intention of this three year cap is to protect the family home.</p>
            <p eId="para_3755">The ‘three year' cap also extends to farms and businesses in circumstances where:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3756">i. the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability which causes them to need long-term nursing home care, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3757">ii. the person or their partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm or business up until the time of the sudden illness or disability,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3758">and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3759">iii. a family successor certifies that he or she will continue the management of the farm or business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3760">In the case of couples, the measure applies where the applicant suffered a sudden and unforeseen illness and either or both members of the couple have been engaged in the running of the family farm or business. This stipulation is in keeping with the key principle of joint assessment of couples.</p>
            <p eId="para_3761">The ‘three year cap' was extended to farms and businesses at Report Stage in the Dáil because a number of Deputies and farming interest groups, expressed concern, at both Second and Committee Stages, about the treatment of farms under the legislation. In particular, there was concern about the potential impact of the 5% annual contribution on the sustainability of family farms and businesses, specifically, in situations where care is required from an early age and for a prolonged period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3762">This measure is intended to ensure the financial sustainability of farms and businesses in cases where a person suffered a sudden illness and did not have an opportunity to put appropriate succession arrangements in place. It affords additional protection because it ensures that a person's maximum contribution is fully quantifiable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3763">If a farm or business has been transferred more than five years prior to an individual's application for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the asset will not be taken into account at all in the course of the financial assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3764">The Minister for Health does not propose to amend the legislation underpinning the scheme to make the treatment of farms and businesses any more beneficial than at present. Individuals in possession of such assets may already avail of the three year cap. In contrast, the 5% contribution based on assets other than the principal residence or farms and businesses that meet the criteria outlined above is ongoing for the duration of the individual's time in long-term nursing home care.</p>

            <p eId="para_3768">The EU/IMF programme provides for the introduction of legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors by the end of the third quarter in 2011, including eliminating restrictions on the number of GPs qualifying and removing restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients as well as restrictions on advertising.</p>
            <p eId="para_3769">The Medical Council's current Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners, published in 2009, removed restrictions on advertising by medical practitioners. Accordingly, GPs are now free to advertise their services and their prices. No further action is required on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3770">With effect from 1 July 2010, the number of GP training places increased from 120 to 157 per annum. The GP training programme is of four years duration — two years spent in hospital posts and two years in an approved general practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3771">The HSE is working with the Irish College of General Practitioners on a process to fast track GP training for doctors who already have trained in a hospital prior to undertaking the four year GP training cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_3772">In relation to removing restrictions on GPs wishing to treat public patients, my officials, in consultation with the HSE, are finalising proposals for the implementation of this commitment within the specified time frame.</p>

            <p eId="para_3826">Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test. In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EU, all Member States are required to have arrangements in place for the compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of motor vehicles and trailers registered by them. Implementation of a system of roadworthiness testing of passenger cars in Ireland commenced in January 2000 through the National Car Testing Service (NCTS).</p>
            <p eId="para_3827">In 2008, the RSA reviewed the car testing specification and, following this review, proposed that a number of new test items be introduced to the National Car Test (NCT). A public consultation process was conducted by the RSA on the proposals in 2009 and, having considered the views received, the RSA recommended that the proposals, including annual testing of cars over ten years old, be introduced to the NCT. The recommendations were accepted and approved by my predecessor.</p>
            <p eId="para_3828">The NCT is a preventative road safety measure that ensures vehicles, particularly older vehicles, using our roads are in sound working order. In the course of its review, the RSA found that almost half (47%) of collisions that occurred in 2007 involved vehicles that were nine years old or more. In addition, 45% of serious injuries from collisions in 2007 involved vehicles that were nine years old or more. There is a need to ensure that older vehicles are frequently maintained and that dangerous or defective vehicles are not on our roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_3829">I intend to monitor the introduction of this new regime and in conjunction with the NRA review its effectiveness as appropriate.</p>
