        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2">I am indeed. I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> We learned yesterday that the Garda Representative Association, GRA, had voted to take industrial action on four days in November. This is an unprecedented development which will have serious consequences not just for the Garda force but also for the public. Unlike other workers, gardaí do not have the right to strike. The reason for this is they are responsible for the safety of the State. An Garda Síochána has always served the State with great pride and its members take an oath to defend the public and the State, but their decision to strike shows that there is rampant demoralisation and anger within the force. This has happened in the past few years. Like other public sector workers, gardaí have faced pay cuts and a reduction of 2,000 in their numbers since 2009. In addition, more than 100 Garda stations have been closed. </p>
          <p eId="para_4"> The Government has been aware that an industrial relations issue has been brewing in the Garda for some time. It has been in place for five months and one of the biggest issues on its agenda is public service pay and industrial relations problems within the public sector. In recent months deals have been done in respect of low grade entry nurses and teachers and allowances for firefighters, yet the Government only entered into what it thought was an agreement with the GRA late last Friday evening. It is to be regretted that the Government, unfortunately, has stumbled and stalled in dealing with the challenges facing An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> We spend many hours in the House discussing and critiquing the performance of An Garda Síochána, whether it be through reports from the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC; the Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate or commissions of investigation. Do the Tánaiste and the Government recognise that all of these reports and critiques will be meaningless unless we have a Garda force in which morale is good and in which gardaí feel valued by the State and have a sense of pride in their work? Morale is low because of members' terms and conditions, for which the Tánaiste still has responsibility. The Commissioner, GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate are not responsible. The grievances of gardaí have not been treated seriously by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">In the confidence and supply agreement my party entered into with Fine Gael it was agreed that a public service pay commission would be established. When will it be established? Can the Tánaiste give a commitment to the House that the Government does not intend to allow a Mexican stand-off between the GRA and the State? Will she re-engage with the GRA? What is her plan to resolve the dispute?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_3" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">I agree that members of An Garda Síochána are essential and pivotal to civilised living in this country. They protect individuals in communities and never know the day or the hour when they may be exposed to violence or asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. The Government views An Garda Síochána as a key strand in Irish life and is committed to supporting it in every way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> As I said in my statement yesterday, I am disappointed to hear of the GRA's rejection of the agreement which was reached with the Department last Friday and in which we addressed a range of issues. I am also disappointed to hear of the announcement that it is to take industrial action. The agreement addresses in a very positive way many of the issues raised by the GRA in the course of negotiations which, contrary to what the Deputy said, have been taking place for a number of months. In the past four months there have been detailed negotiations between my Department and the representative associations and agreement was reached with the AGSI. The agreement seeks to address, in particular, the concerns articulated about the pay of new recruits, the additional hours gardaí are required to work, access to pay determination and resolution bodies and the completion of the review of An Garda Síochána. The Department has yet to hear officially from the GRA, although its concerns have been articulated in the public arena. The outstanding issues can only be addressed through engagement between the parties and my Department which continues to be available to address them. To facilitate that engagement, I want the GRA to set out to us its outstanding concerns about the agreement. Everybody in the House agrees that it would be most unfortunate if, rather than engaging, further action was contemplated which would not be in the best interests of communities or An Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The AGSI has also raised a number of issues about the public service pay commission, something about which the Deputy asked and which I will address. The Government recognises that members of An Garda Síochána, like all public servants, played a very significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about economic recovery. They were subject to the same reductions as all other public servants during the financial crisis and, similarly, have benefited from the partial restoration of pay commenced on foot of the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_10">I fear that the Government does not yet realise the significance of and danger attached to yesterday's announcement. We, as legislators, and Ministers, as members of the Executive, cannot allow a situation where members of An Garda Síochána see themselves as having no option other than to go on strike. The legal system in the State is dependent on members of An Garda Síochána being available to the public and in the community to enforce the law. If they break the law and go on strike, it will put the legal system in an extremely serious position. The Minister is the person with responsibility to resolve the dispute and six weeks are available to the parties involved to resolve it before the first day of strike action. We hope that what happened in the dispute between Dublin Bus and the bus workers' union will not happen in this case. It is imperative that the Government becomes involved to resolve the dispute which is more important than any other industrial dispute. The grievances of members of An Garda Síochána need to be recognised and dealt with by the Department in the talks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_5" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">I am in no doubt about the seriousness of the situation. That is why my Department has engaged very intensively with the GRA and it is absolutely open, as am I, to meeting to resolve the outstanding issues. It is in the interest of everybody in the country. It is in the interest of An Garda Síochána, as the Deputy rightly said, and of the legal system across the board. Of course, we wish to ensure that we can resolve this. However, it is important that we find a pathway towards pay resolution and restoration. I heard a representative of the GRA say that this morning. It is imperative that we find that way forward and I believe we can. We have shown good faith in the discussions that have taken place already. A range of issues was on the agenda and among the areas addressed in those talks were: the lifting of the increment freeze, backdated; the restoration of the rent allowance; promotion opportunities to be increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with increasing Garda numbers; review of An Garda Síochána to be completed by the end of the year; commitment to review the appropriateness of voluntary overtime; no overtime this year and, by agreement with the Garda Commissioner, in the course of next year and the following year; and a range of other items on the table. There is a very serious commitment to examine the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I will conclude by pointing out, and I know this particularly well because I meet so many gardaí in the course of my work, that we know how much gardaí suffered as a result of the economic meltdown. The financial problems of a garda married to another garda were doubled. As in the case of other public servants, the Government is committed to finding a way forward. On the question about the public service pay commission, the closing date has passed for submissions from various bodies. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has had the consultation process and will make a statement shortly on the establishment of that commission.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">I will follow up on Deputy O'Callaghan's question and remain on that topic. We have heard much about the economic recovery from the Tánaiste and other Ministers and while there is some recovery under way, it has yet to trickle down to many members. Many people have suffered as a result of the austerity that was imposed in the State over recent years and there is no argument about the level of austerity imposed on public sector workers in particular. Gardaí are no different from anybody else in that context. There have been pay restoration demands from various sources, including nurses, teachers, Luas drivers and bus drivers, all of whom have engaged in some level of industrial action over recent months. The Garda is in a unique position in that regard. What was announced yesterday is unprecedented. Nobody inside or outside the Government should take lightly what was said by Pat Ennis of the GRA yesterday. If anybody is naive enough to believe that the GRA will not proceed with the four days of withdrawal of service it announced yesterday, it would be a huge mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> We have a situation with the pay demands and the restoration demands. The Tánaiste said the Department is open to further negotiations. I am glad about that but I believe the Tánaiste must proactively engage with the GRA. The GRA indicated yesterday that it is willing to return to the negotiating table provided there are real and tangible measures from the Government for resolving this. Everybody wants to know what the next step is. Is it a wait and see game on the part of the Tánaiste? Is she waiting for the GRA to come back to her or will she actively engage with the GRA, as of today, to try to resolve this before 4 November?</p>

          <p eId="para_15">I have made it clear that both I and the Department want to re-engage. After many hours of discussions we concluded the negotiations late last Friday evening with an agreement, as we understood it.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">That was with the leadership but it was not accepted by the broader group, as has been obvious through media reports and interviews in the past number of days. We have not heard anything formally from the GRA and we await hearing about the particular issues it wants to see considered. There will certainly be no grandstanding about who approaches who first. The important point is to get back into discussions and see how we can negotiate.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Of course, this must be put in the context of the overall public pay situation, as the Deputy rightly says, where 280,000 public servants have an agreement that is in operation and that has been worked through with the Government. A total of 20 unions have voted their acceptance of it. A number of unions, including the GRA, have not accepted it and the deal has not been concluded. It is my intention and that of the Government to do everything possible to ensure that the negotiations can start again, that the items on the table can be worked through and that we can find a pathway forward. This is what is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_18"> No one person or country is going to recover overnight from the kind of economic meltdown seen in this country where recruitment and investment stopped and where we saw lower numbers of gardaí around the country. Why was that? It was because there was no investment for a number of years. What has this Government done and what did the previous one do? They started re-investing in people in Templemore, in vehicles, in the tools the gardaí needed and in ICT. The Government has shown its commitment to An Garda Síochána. Look at the recent budgets in terms of the initiatives we have taken. Clearly, we want to deal with the issue of pay in so far as we can under the constraints that are there at present and that are well understood by everyone in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">They are very well understood but I do not think it is simply a matter of saying that we do not have the money to resolve this. There is only one way this will be resolved. It will be resolved in the same way that every other dispute has been resolved, namely, around the negotiating table. The quicker we get back to that, the better. We certainly do not want to waste the next six weeks trying to resolve this. I am glad that there will be no grandstanding because this will escalate even within the next six weeks. We know that the AGSI will have a special delegate conference to discuss this matter. Time is of the essence.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The Tánaiste spoke about the deal concluded by the Government with the management last week and which has now been rejected. I spoke to one garda this morning. One thing that really stuck in his craw was the issue of the rent allowance of €4,000. New gardaí are coming in on salaries of €23,000. This is not a case of me sensationalising the issue. I am sure the Tánaiste is well aware of it. Gardaí speak to her as frequently as anyone else in this House, probably more frequently. New gardaí are earning €23,000 and do not have that allowance and are being forced to sleep in their cars. That is not acceptable. I do not think it is fair of this Government to use an allowance like that as a <i>quid pro quo</i> bargaining chip in any negotiations.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">The issue of the rent allowance was raised by the GRA and was a key demand made by it, particularly relating to new recruits. Contrary to what the Deputy said, I am quite sure the rent allowance will be welcomed for new recruits. It was an important support for new recruits in terms of finance. That was something the GRA put on the table. We were able to negotiate to a point where it was available. I think it would be a support for new recruits.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The Lansdowne Road agreement is flexible enough to allow for the concerns of recent recruits in the public service to be addressed in a negotiated way. I agree with the Deputy that we are speaking about a negotiated way forward. That is what has happened. We have seen that happening already in respect of the TUI and the AGSI, notwithstanding its more recent concerns about the public service pay commission. Of course, it is through sitting down and negotiating that this can be resolved. I am very clear, as are most Deputies, about the hardship people in this country have endured and the sacrifices they have had to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Gardaí are certainly within that group. It has been very difficult for them. The economy is recovering and we want to make sure that they, as well as other public servants, get the benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">Farmers are going through one of the most difficult periods experienced on family farms in many decades. Farm families are at an all-time low. Grain farmers throughout the country have lost their crops and many face ruination this year. The year 2016 is the fourth year in a row that many grain farmers are trading at a loss. I welcome the announcement of the round table meeting of tillage sector stakeholders due to take place next month. I expect that, following this meeting, increased supports will be put in place and compensation awarded to farmers who have suffered significant losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> For many dairy farmers, 2016 has been the worst year in farming history, with milk prices at an all-time low. However, there has been an increase in global markets in recent months. These increases must be reflected at the first opportunity in prices paid to farmers. There must be no stalling on milk price increases by co-ops. Since Brexit, farmers have experienced a major drop in prices for beef, which has decreased from €4.70 to €3.70 per kilo. Our beef farmers are trading at a loss with these prices. This drop in prices to farmers has not been reflected in the prices paid by consumers. Suckler farmers are also experiencing great financial difficulties. I feel strongly that the suckler cow grant must be increased from €80 to €200 per cow.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> There are serious issues that need to be addressed. The sheep grant has to be examined. A promise was made in the programme for Government to farmers, but it has not been delivered. Disadvantaged area payments have also been cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Given that this has been an exceptionally difficult year for farmers, I ask that the Government has forbearance, defers the payment of farmers' taxes due this year and spreads payments over the next five years. I am not asking that farmers be exempt from paying taxes. Rather, I ask that they be offered the opportunity to pay them over a period of five years in order to ease the major financial burden they currently face.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I also ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, to intervene with banks, co-ops and the Department of Social Protection to find solutions to providing aid for farmers at this difficult time. I have spoken at length with two of our national farming organisations, namely the IFA and the ICSA, in the past number of weeks. I have visited many grain, dairy, suckler and sheep farmers in recent weeks, from Kinsale to Mizen Head to the Beara Peninsula and Innishannon. I have seen the crisis we are in at first hand. </p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I reiterate my request that the Government does everything in its power to support farmers during this difficult time. I ask the Tánaiste to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to visit farms that have been affected in rural Ireland and west Cork over the coming days. He can see at first hand the acres of grain that will not be harvested and instead ploughed into the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I also ask the Tánaiste to consider tax issues facing farmers who are in significant financial difficulties, and spread the payments over five years. I reiterate that I am not asking for a tax exemption for farmers. Rather, I ask that payments to be spread over the next five years in order to ease their burden.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I thank the Deputy for his points on the farming community and the challenges it faces, in particular in regard to pricing. The Government is determined that the recovery is felt in every part of the country, and that of course includes rural communities. There is evidence of that beginning to happen but, of course, there is more to be done, as the Deputy correctly said.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The IFA briefed Deputies this week about a range of issues it wants to be addressed in the budget. The Minister, Deputy Creed, is actively addressing those issues. On the cycle of tax payment that is due by farmers, I am sure farmers will be considered very sympathetically by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Creed, in the upcoming budget. That is the place where the matter will be dealt with and a decision will be taken on the particular approach that is needed to support our farmers and rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The general economic recovery, which is ongoing, takes time to be felt in every sector. The farming community very often has a cyclical movement, whereby prices can be very high and then low. As Deputy Michael Collins said, this is a very difficult period for farmers, in particular those in the dairy industry. I will make sure that his comments are brought to the attention of the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As I said, I have no doubt this will be considered in the context of the budget. </p>

          <p eId="para_34">I thank the Tánaiste for her response. I would appreciate her bringing to the direct attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, my proposals on a tax exemption or a spread of payments for taxes to give the farmers an opportunity to survive this year. The Tánaiste knows as well as I that when farmers are affected the whole community is affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> We face many serious issues. Some farmers are finding it extremely difficult to get farm assist. We were promised an increase in the rural social scheme where farmers on a low income would get an opportunity to participate on a work scheme. That has not happened in the programme for Government. I plead with the Tánaiste to go to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to plead the case on behalf of the farmers. Many of them face ruination and that is a very serious issue which we must resolve. I ask that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed visit some of these farms over the next few days. I would be happy to show both Ministers around. I would also welcome both Deputies from west Cork to join in the visit to that area, if they would consider that, to see the serious situation of grain farmers and dairy farmers at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">We know, and this reinforces the Deputy's point, that on 50% of farms either the holder and-or their spouse has off-farm employment to try and deal with the economic situation they face. Commodity price variation and volatility is an increasing feature of agriculture markets and it is very difficult to deal with. As the Deputy knows, a number of measures have been introduced to support farmers in regard to the price volatility, including direct payments to farmers which are estimated by Teagasc to be approximately €17,000 per farm, or €20,000 for dairy farms. That is a fundamental hedge against volatility which is going to be very important in the challenging years ahead. As the Deputy has said, the budget decision was taken last year with regard to income averaging from three to five years to give more scope for income smoothing to help deal with that commodity price cycle. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Creed will consider that issue again in this year's budget given the volatility we are seeing in prices currently.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">Earlier this week some 17 leading NGOs came together to brief Deputies and make the compelling case for greater investment in home care and community supports as part of budget 2017. The picture painted by the NGOs is of a system approaching crisis point. Their stories cannot be ignored. Consider, for example, Moira Skelly who cares full-time for her daughter Ciara, a 21 year old woman with autism and profound disabilities. Ciara has a mental age of two and requires 24 hour care. Moira has received a mere six hours of community supports and home care. In recent months this allocation has been cut further to four hours making life exceptionally difficult for Ciara and cutting off this lifeline for her mother. Consider also Sinead McArdle from Louth who was diagnosed with MS in 2005. Due to her condition she had to give up her full-time job. She has been refused home care support by the State and because of this her husband now has had to go part-time in his job in order to care for Sinead, putting the family under huge financial pressure as well as medical pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> In all our constituencies Members are receiving frequent calls from people with disabilities or from frail elderly people who have been approved for home care packages but, because of the funding cuts in this area, are being put on a long waiting list . It is incredible that people who meet the qualification criteria for a full home care package are put on a waiting list. People with severe disabilities and people in their 80s and 90s cannot wait three, six or nine months to receive the kind of support they require to live life with dignity. We also know of many families whose loved ones have no choice but to remain in a hospital bed because funding is not available to allow them to return home safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">We know that these are not isolated cases. They are arising all the time and with increased frequency. Will the Tánaiste give a commitment to prioritise funding in this area in the upcoming budget?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_15" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_40">We are all familiar with the demand for home care packages in our own areas and across the country. Of course, it is a very striking feature at present that there is increased demand. There is increased investment as well but there is a huge increase in demand with the increasing number of older people. Our policy is one of keeping people in the community and making sure that they get the kind of supports that they need. In terms of prioritising areas in the health service, this is a priority area. I reassure the Deputy on that. This is a priority for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for the Government and for the Department of Health. Our health services remain a priority and there are additional resources being provided. As the Deputy knows, there was an additional €500 million provided earlier this year. Some 270,000 extra home help hours have been agreed along with 2,000 more home care packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> Let us be clear. People are receiving these. These are being provided in the community. New home care packages are being given. More people are benefitting from the increased investment. However, there has also been a huge increase in demand. It is right that we fund home care packages and that we support families to enable them to cope with a disabled child, as the Deputy has described, or an older person in order that they can stay in their home. It is a priority. We now have the winter initiative, with an extra €40 million and another 950 home care packages provided. The number of home care packages is increasing all the time. However, no one will disagree with the Deputy that there are cases, individuals and families out there who need home care packages right now. The Government is doing everything possible to respond by increasing the money and the number of home care packages but we are in a situation in which there is huge demand. It is certainly a priority to meet that demand over the coming weeks and months.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_42">While some additional funding has been provided, there is no great evidence that it is making any kind of significant difference to the waiting lists because of the fact that there are so many demographic pressures. The 17 NGOs that came together this week deal with our health system on a daily basis and believe that home care must be made a priority for our health care system. We need to listen to their experiences. There is a need for Government to give a very clear commitment to re-orientate the health service to ensure that there is much more priority attached to home care supports and community supports in order to end this nonsense of people being unable to leave hospital because they do not have home care packages in place or they are waiting for ramps or different aids to be provided in their homes due to the long waiting lists in the local authorities. People are being denied the opportunity to live any kind of life with dignity because of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> We know that providing home care is in the patient's interest. It achieves better health outcomes and makes absolute financial sense from the State's point of view. To remain in their homes, these people need to be able to be assured of the care that they require and they must have the necessary supports. Does the Tánaiste accept that it is now time to move to a situation in which there is a legal statutory entitlement to a home care package, just as there is with a statutory entitlement to a nursing home place? It makes sense to do that. Will the Tánaiste commit to moving in that direction?</p>

          <p eId="para_44">The Deputy raised a number of points. The last point she raised was one of policy in relation to whether there should be a statutory entitlement. The Minister for Health informs me that is in fact being considered by the Department. The second point to make is that the delayed discharges are down this week by 34. Obviously, there is more work to be done because some patients' discharges are being delayed because they do not have home care packages. Each and every one of us here is familiar with that situation. The increased investment is reaching more people but there is still that huge demand. I agree with the Deputy that the focus needs to be evermore on primary care. As the Deputy knows, that is the direction our health service is taking. There is huge investment in primary care. Part of that is having the kind of home care package that enables people to stay in their homes. However, it is very costly. We all know, whether it is from our own parents or what we see with family and friends, just how intensive the demand is when it comes to keeping people in their homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">Yes, and the focus is on home care for that reason. That is also the reason we must make the shift from secondary care to primary care, as the Government is committed to doing. This will not happen overnight, however. We need to get the message out to members of the public that investment in home care packages has increased and they are not being cut back. However, demand has increased also and while the service is reaching more people, there is still the demand in our community that the Deputy described.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Children in respect of whom a domiciliary care allowance is paid and children with severe disabilities are in urgent need of a medical card. When can we expect the health (amendment) (No. 2) Bill to come before the House? The Bill will provide a clear entitlement to these children. Medical cards not only entitle them to general practitioner care and medicine but also to other badly needed medical attention in the health system.</p>

The Government is committed to ensuring these children will have an automatic right to a medical card. This will certainly be welcomed as a support for the families who find themselves in that situation. It is priority legislation to be dealt with in this term.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">The Department of Social Protection commissioned the Millar report on the situation of lone parents. As the report has not been published, will the Tánaiste tell us when it will be published? As she may know, it has been leaked and is in the public domain today. It has found that the mandate from the troika was to save money; that the cuts and changes made affected lone parents and left them financially worse off; that the one-size-fits-all approach to lone parents has not worked; that lone parents who work part time are worse off as a result of the cuts imposed by the Government; that the stigmatisation of lone parents continues; and that all of this contributes significantly to the level of child poverty. As all of this is contained in the report that has now been leaked, I want to know when it will be formally published and we will be given an opportunity to discuss it. Given that the report is a damning assessment of the Government's treatment of lone parents, will the Government legislate to deal with the incidence of child poverty?</p>

I have no doubt that it will inform the budgetary decisions that will be taken in the area of social welfare. The Government is also committed to the development of further appropriate subsidised child care initiatives, particularly for lone parents in order that they will feel supported in the choices they make in combining work and family life.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">I am seeking to put the spotlight on motor insurance premiums again. I thank the Minister for his work on the task force. I am seeking an update on that work in terms of the meetings that have been held, whether progress is being made and the timeline for the completion of its work and the implementation of recommendations.

            <p eId="para_678">The cost of insurance working group, which I chair, is undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of motor insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> The working group brings together all the relevant Departments and offices involved with the process. Its objective is to identify immediate and longer-term measures which can address increasing costs while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> The core areas to be examined by the working group in this first phase are: the motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years; the effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs; the current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims; insurance data and information; the impact of accident rates; the impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector; and other market issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> As the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and in order to get to the heart of these issues as soon as possible, I have established four sub-groups to review them in detail. Chairs have been appointed to these sub-groups and work has commenced. The sub-groups are meeting weekly and their outputs are feeding into the meetings of the working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> The working group has held five plenary meetings to date and will continue to meet every two to three weeks to the end of 2016. I am also in constant contact with the chairs and vice-chairs of the sub-groups to monitor progress and we are keeping to the tight deadlines.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> The Department of Finance has provided additional human resources to the section dealing with insurance policy and servicing the Government task force and associated sub-groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> A consultation process has commenced. I have had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Injuries Board, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, FBD Insurance and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> The working group and the four sub-groups are also meeting with the relevant stakeholders. At its third meeting, the working group met with representatives from the Law Society, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association and the Consumers Association of Ireland. This morning the working group met with representatives of Irish hauliers and the car rental sector. Further consultations will be arranged. In addition, submissions received from all interested parties are being considered as part of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> By the end of October, the working group will provide the Minister for Finance with an updated report which will set out the priority actions required. We are already working on emerging recommendations. From November to December, the working group will develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions. In this regard, I will be consulting regularly with Government colleagues and the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_687">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The starting point in this debate is to acknowledge that the situation is out of hand. The latest example is that Aviva insurance is adding a 20% loading to any volunteer in the community first responder scheme around the country. That is costing the scheme, a life saving service, valuable members. The issue must be addressed because this is not acceptable. I welcome that the level of activity by the working group has been accelerated. There are also the four sub-groups. Can I take it that the objective is that the Minister will have an interim report by the end of the month setting out a series of recommendations that can be implemented? Ultimately, that is what all of us wish to achieve. I accept that there is no silver bullet and that a range of measures will be required. I expect the working group will draw from the testimony heard by the finance committee as well. I look forward to the Minister's response but I seek a commitment that we will have recommendations by the end of the month which we can then seek to implement in an effort to deal with the underlying causes of spiralling premiums.</p>

            <p eId="para_688">At present, we are trying to build consensus on the causes of the increases in premiums. There are many different voices and a great deal of noise so we are trying to distil the information as to what is causing the increases. If we can get a breakdown of the premium and look at the different component parts that are driving up the cost, we can implement measures for each one. For example, if €50 of a premium is due to fraud or €35 is due to uninsured vehicles, we will identify specific measures to tackle each of those areas in the hope that by having a suite of measures we will be able to bring down the overall cost of premiums. The aim is to have emerging recommendations by the end of October. In November, we will take the time to ensure we can put a solid timeline and series of actions in place, be they legislative or otherwise, to have them implemented. The hope is that by the end of October we will have a definite idea of what the emerging recommendations are to hit each of the elements of the premiums.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> I appeared before the finance committee to discuss this a number of weeks ago. The committee is also doing an important piece of work and we are hoping to get feedback from it on where it thinks possible solutions lie. We hope it will be able to report to our working group in advance of me reporting to the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_690">I welcome the initiative that has been taken with the working group. The Minister realises the seriousness of the situation. It affects not just individual motorists but is also a major issue for the economy. Transport is a key input cost for the business community and insurance is a central element of that. There are much wider issues in the insurance industry that must be addressed but the focus here, quite correctly, is on motor insurance premiums. The increases of 70% over a three year period are putting people off the road. There is no denying that. It simply must be addressed. The Minister will have the support of Fianna Fáil when it comes to implementing measures that will make a tangible difference in tackling this issue. It must be a serious political priority. I realise that the Minister is giving the matter much of his personal time. I ask him to continue to do that. He can be assured of our support for any measure required in the House that is designed to tackle the premium hikes.</p>

            <p eId="para_691">I thank the Deputy. This is my political priority. It is incredibly important for people throughout the country. Despite the gains being made in the economy at present through tax reductions and people getting back to work, people are not feeling it in their pockets because they are experiencing this rise in insurance premiums. It is hitting every aspect of the economy, including tourism, hauliers, health care and small and medium enterprises. There is a wider economic issue here and it speaks to competitiveness as well. Of course, we must manage expectations. It is a complex issue that will involve a complex policy response. We will not be able to solve it overnight but we are working day and night to try to get to the bottom of it. I am anxious that we take a consensus approach. There is no point in me coming to the Dáil with a group of measures we think will work if the other parties do not agree. We will pursue it by consensus and that is why the help from the finance committee is so welcome.</p>

          <question by="#PearseDoherty" to="#Finance" eId="pq_2">
            <p eId="para_692">2. <b>Deputy Pearse Doherty</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> if he will direct NAMA to suspend all sales processes under way in respect of an organisation (details supplied) in view of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the sale of the organisation and the forthcoming commission of investigation. [27797/16]</p>
          </question>

            <p eId="para_693">Will the Minister say whether he accepts the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the sale of Project Eagle without condition? The question I tabled relates to that. It asks the Minister to use his authority under the National Asset Management Agency Act to direct the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, to cease or suspend all sales processes under way in respect of Project Gem, a €3 billion asset portfolio it expects to sell before the end of the year, in light of what the Comptroller and Auditor General said in his report and also in light of the fact that the Government has finally agreed to set up a commission of investigation into areas of NAMA.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_66">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_694">It is important to recognise that in no way has the integrity of NAMA or the NAMA board or the integrity of its decisions been brought into question, so I have no intention of directing NAMA to halt sales activities. To do so would irreparably damage NAMA's positive contribution to our recovery and damage our reputation as a credible, open and transparent market. By extension, any such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers. In particular, it would likely: constitute the State taking direct control of NAMA and bringing NAMA debt onto the State's balance sheet; imply a U-turn for the Irish sovereign in the eyes of the rating agencies, the sovereign bond market and broader investor community, potentially increasing the cost of Government debt and damaging confidence in the recovery of our economy; raise competition concerns which may limit NAMA's ability to recover value for the State from its assets; reduce the surplus currently projected by NAMA to be returned to the Exchequer; and negatively impact NAMA's ability to fund the delivery of residential and commercial units on a commercial basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> We must also remember that section 9 of the NAMA Act is unambiguous when it states that NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions. Section 12 of the Act bestows the NAMA board with the power to "sell or dispose of the whole or any part of the property or investments of NAMA, either together or in portions, for such consideration and on such terms as the Board thinks fit". Clearly, from the outset the Oireachtas agreed that political interference in NAMA's independent commercial activities was highly undesirable as such interference would render the agency incapable of carrying out its work on behalf of taxpayers and would cast a major shadow over NAMA's ability to achieve its objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> To return to the Deputy's specific question, the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised issues for further discussion, but he has not raised any systemic concern about NAMA and its operations. He has not suggested halting its activities. The opinions expressed by him in his report, on which there is public disagreement, are being examined by the Committee of Public Accounts. With representatives of NAMA, he is appearing before the committee today to discuss the report. The committee is the appropriate forum in which to consider his report and engage in the exercise of seeking public accountability in these matters. The Government recognises that it has its own responsibilities in all matters of public concern to do with the functions of an important public body such as NAMA. As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach has met Opposition party leaders with a view to seeking agreement on issues of public concern that may require further investigation and the most appropriate nature and terms of reference of such an investigation. Subject to the outcome of these discussions, the matter will be the subject of a Dáil debate. The Government's objective is to ensure all matters of public concern will be addressed in a speedy and effective manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">What is most interesting about what the Minister has said is what he did not say in response to the direct question I put to him, which was whether he unconditionally supported the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the sale of Project Eagle. He has refused so far to stand up and say he accepts it unconditionally. He says it would bring NAMA debt onto the books. That is complete nonsense. We are looking for him to use his powers of direction under the National Asset Management Agency Act to suspend the sale of Project Gem. He has used these powers on a number of occasions such as in the case of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note, in respect of which he directed NAMA. We have a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which I accept. We will find out whether the Minister accepts it. It states there was a possible loss to the taxpayer of €220 million. The Taoiseach is now saying he believes there is a need for a commission of investigation into some of the operations of NAMA, a position which is supported by us in opposition and something for which we have been arguing for a while. There are tapes which we have seen on the "Spotlight" programme on which there is talk about fixer's fees and senior people in NAMA are named as providing information on NAMA debtors and potential bidders. For the Minister to say there is no issue relating to the integrity of decision-making in NAMA is farcical. He must intervene on behalf of the taxpayer to make sure the sale is suspended until we sort out this issue and reach a clear conclusion on the matters at hand.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_698">I have served as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and worked closely with different Comptrollers and Auditors General. I have great respect for the work they do. I also have great respect for NAMA, the chairman of the board and the chief executive who have carried out their functions in accordance with law. No charge of irregularity, wrongdoing or improper behaviour has been laid against NAMA. There is clearly a conflict between the position taken by the chairman of NAMA on behalf of its board and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. There are a number of conflicts about the process and timeline in the disposal of Project Eagle, but the principal conflict that would cause a variation in the estimated value involves the different approaches taken to discounts. That discrepancy is being addressed by the Committee of Public Accounts. I will appear before it next Thursday and answer all of its questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">It is clear that the Minister is unwilling to accept the findings of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor, which in itself is a major issue in terms of the constitutional nature of the office. Even if the Minister does not accept the report and just says there are discrepancies, in the light of these discrepancies and their severity, the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General believes there was a potential loss of €220 million, the fact that issues concerning a conflict of interest were reported to NAMA and not followed up and the fact that many other issues are raised in the report, there is an obligation on the Minister to act. He is the only person with the authority to say to NAMA "listen folks, pause. There is a serious issue here. The Comptroller and Auditor General is saying you lost the Irish taxpayer €220 million. You cannot proceed with the sale of a €3 billion asset that is owned by the Irish people. We have to clear this up." The Minister needs to use his discretionary powers. On 15 April 2014, within days of NAMA deciding to sell Project Eagle to Cerberus, I asked about the number of bidders and the process involved, but the Minister stonewalled me in the answer he gave to the House. He knew at the time about fixer's fees and that PIMCO had had to pull out. He must now step up to the plate. His actions in the past two years in dealing with this issue do not warrant glory, but he now needs to do the right thing. He needs to suspend the sale of Project Gem in the interests of the taxpayer who could lose more money if the inappropriate form of evaluation used by NAMA in the case of Project Eagle is used in the case of Project Gem.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">The Deputy is doing what his party has done in Northern Ireland. He is trying to use the issue to damage his opponents politically. The Sinn Féin chairman of the committee in Northern Ireland corrupted the inquiry by coaching a witness to cause damage to the former First Minister. I advise the Deputy very strongly not to do the same in this House. I am going before the Committee of Public Accounts next Thursday and will answer its questions. Representatives of NAMA appeared before it this morning when the Comptroller and Auditor General also gave evidence. Others are being called. The Taoiseach has consulted Opposition leaders and we will see where things go in seeing whether there are other issues to be inquired into after the Committee of Public Accounts has completed its work. We can all deal with the issue in a very fair way, but the Deputy is trying to turn it into a series of political allegations against the Government and me personally. Sinn Féin wrecked an inquiry in Northern Ireland and corrupted its report by the actions taken by the chairman. It should not try to do the same here.</p>

            <p eId="para_702">This question is on the same topic. It is welcome that the Minister has agreed to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. This is the right decision. The central purpose of my question is to establish whether the Minister wishes to strengthen oversight mechanisms and put new safeguards in place for future NAMA disposals because we are dealing with an extremely serious issue. The Government has agreed to set up a commission of investigation. By admission, that means that there is an issue of significant public concern. This is a very serious issue. NAMA is still sitting on a lot of assets and we need to be reassured that the process in which it will engage for any remaining sale will be safe, have integrity and fully protect the interests of taxpayers.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">As per NAMA's most recent section 55 quarter 1 report which is available on its website, the par value of its outstanding loans was €39.6 billion at the end of March. I am advised by it that its section 55 quarter 2 report will be finalised shortly and disclose the par value of its outstanding loans at the end of June. I am further advised that its disposal strategy is, as previously outlined, designed to take full advantage of strong purchaser interest in loans and property assets securing its loans. NAMA utilises a range of disposal mechanisms, including loan sales, portfolio sales and individual asset sales, to take maximum advantage of purchaser interest and ensure the greatest possible return to the State. Its successful sales strategy which has been predicated on releasing loans and assets for sale in accordance with the level of demand and absorption capacity in each of its main markets - for example, in the period up to 2013, NAMA concentrated sales activity in Great Britain, primarily London, and has since moved to take advantage of the strong recovery in Irish demand - means that it is on track to repay all of its senior debt by 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> As regards accountability, I remind the House that NAMA is already subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial bodies, including commercial bodies in the State sector. Its accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of its work, as most recently seen in the report on Project Eagle referenced by the Deputy. The Deputy will note that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not recommend increasing NAMA's accountability in his report. The value for money report was effectively an accelerated module of the Comptroller and Auditor General's normal section 226 review of NAMA required under the National Asset Management Agency Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">As already provided for in the NAMA Act, in 2015 the Comptroller and Auditor General committed to reviewing a broad sample of NAMA's sales and investment decisions as the focus of its next section 226 report.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> The chairman and chief executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees, and give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so. Indeed, NAMA is appearing at the Committee of Public Accounts today to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's value-for-money report.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> I, as Minister for Finance, also have specific powers to review and assess NAMA's activities under section 227 of the NAMA Act. </p>
            <p eId="para_708">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>

            <p eId="para_709">The last section 227 review supported the implementation of the NAMA board's current disposal strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> In addition to the above, the board of NAMA must comply with its obligations under the NAMA Act. Section 18 of the NAMA Act sets out the principal responsibilities of the board, which are to ensure that NAMA discharges its functions efficiently and effectively, to set strategic objectives and targets for NAMA, to ensure that the appropriate systems and procedures are in place to achieve the strategic targets and objectives and to take all reasonable steps available to it to achieve those targets and objectives. The board has established four statutory committees, under section 32 of the Act, to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities and obligations: audit committee, credit committee, finance and operating committee and risk management committee. </p>
            <p eId="para_711"> NAMA's annual reports, quarterly reports and annual statements are all laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The level of disclosure in NAMA's reports is comprehensive and professional. Any recommendations resulting from the Committee of Public Account's review of the Comptroller and Auditor General's value-for-money report will be considered in due course. However, in light of the high level of accountability to which NAMA is currently held it is not currently appropriate to contemplate any additional oversight measures not already provided for in the NAMA Act. </p>

            <p eId="para_712">I thank the Minister for his reply. The key issue is that there is a major cloud hanging over the Project Eagle sale, which totals £1.3 billion. The Government has conceded the need for a commission of investigation, which only happens where an issue of significant public concern has to be investigated. The Comptroller and Auditor General has told the Committee of Public Accounts today that Project Eagle was not a satisfactory sales process.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> The Minister has told the House that NAMA has up to €40 billion par value of loans that remain to be sold. How can he reassure the House and, more importantly, the Irish people that any further disposals by NAMA will meet the requirement for the public interest to be at the forefront, that taxpayers' interests are fully protected, that any further sales processes will achieve that objective and that the integrity of those processes is protected? That is what I need to know. How can the Minister reassure us, given that a major cloud hangs over Project Eagle and how it was handled? Massive sales still have to go through the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">There are strong accountability requirements under the NAMA Act, and they have been implemented since the Act became law. The activities of NAMA are reviewed as I described, that is, in accordance with the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> The Committee of Public Accounts is reviewing the value-for-money report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General into Project Eagle. In the normal process of the committee's work, its inquiries will be followed by a report and that report will have recommendations. If the committee decides that accountability has to be increased, I am sure that will be reflected in its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> I envisage a similar process will be followed if there is a commission of inquiry. One investigates first, then one draws conclusions and makes recommendations. If the recommendations require additional accountability, of course I will be amenable to accepting them.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> When one compares NAMA to any other commercial State agency, it has a higher level of accountability. Every Deputy knows that the Comptroller and Auditor General has staff embedded in NAMA who work in it for perhaps ten months of the year. They have access to all paperwork and transactions.</p>

I understand the issues around senior debt, contingent liability and all of that. However, we have to be reassured about the integrity of the sales process. Accountability instruments are already built into the system, but they, in the form of the report of the Controller and Auditor General, have identified serious issues which have led to the establishment of a commission of investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">I thank the Minister for taking this question. The charity sector provides essential services to Irish society and is widely respected and supported by public donations and Government grant aid. The imposition of VAT on equipment and services purchased places a considerable burden upon charities and their resources, and diminishes their ability to function to their maximum capacity. Would the Government consider relieving the burden by reducing their VAT liability to as close to zero as possible by introducing a VAT compensation scheme?</p>

            <p eId="para_723">VAT is a tax on consumption and is applied to supplies being made by a person and not to supplies received by him or her. In this context, it is not possible under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, to introduce VAT exemptions based on services received or on the basis of the recipient of a service, nor is it possible to allow for zero rating of such supplies.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> Non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT directive. This means that they do not register for VAT and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. This non-entitlement to VAT deductibility is a general feature of VAT exemptions. There is no provision in European or Irish VAT law to allow a zero rating or exemption for supplies of this nature. However, there is a specific VAT refund order that provides for VAT incurred on the purchase or importation of new medical instruments and appliances, excluding means of transport, which is purchased through voluntary donations, and may be refunded to hospitals or donors, as appropriate, subject to conditions. In addition, there are a number of other VAT refund orders that provide for refunds of VAT in certain circumstances, such as where the VAT is incurred on aids or appliances for persons with a specified degree of disablement.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> A working group was established last year, comprising representatives from my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Irish charities taxation reform group, to examine options available to reduce the VAT burden on charities. The report from the group is available on the budget 2016 website. On the basis of that report, I decided at the time not to introduce a VAT refund scheme for charities as the charities sector already benefits from a range of ministerial refund orders and special tax treatment across a number of tax heads. Requests for new ministerial refund orders have been consistently refused since the 1980s primarily to maintain the integrity of the VAT system.</p>

            <p eId="para_727"> However, A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the difficulties faced by community groups and charities in relation to VAT rates on certain products such as defibrillators and commits to raising the issue at EU level. The European Commission's action plan on VAT was adopted on 7 April 2016 and contains a proposal to look at VAT rate policy across the EU in 2017. The action plan's proposal on rates may offer member states more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services. This forum will provide an opportunity to discuss VAT rates applicable to goods and services. However, the Deputy will be aware that any proposed changes to the current EU VAT directive would require unanimous agreement from all member states.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">I thank the Minister. I understand the EU VAT directive precludes charities from claiming a direct refund but, as the Minister is aware, the Irish charities tax reform group has been part of a working group which has examined how to reduce the tax burden on the charity sector. This group has identified that a VAT compensation scheme operated outside of the VAT system would be workable.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> The Danish system of VAT conversation would be the model most suited to Ireland. Denmark sets aside a fixed pool of funding from which charities can reclaim VAT. The claim is in proportion to the funds raised by public donation, and if a charity has raised 50% of its funds by donation it can apply to reclaim 50% of its VAT. Charities' claims are pooled and the individual charities receive a <i>pro rata</i> proportion of their claim. The size of the refund would depend on the size of the pool which the Government would set aside. The pool set aside by the Government is fixed so there is certainty in the cost to the Exchequer. Charities gain by reclaiming a proportion of VAT paid and society gains by having increased services.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">I thank the Deputy for that information. The European Commission's action plan on VAT was adopted on 7 April 2016. It contains a proposal to consider VAT rate policy across the EU in 2017. The action plans proposals on rates may offer member states more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services. We will avail of it if it comes through. I am sure it will consider comparisons like those the Deputy referenced and the VAT situation in Denmark.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> VAT refunds are quite significant. In 2014, there was a refund of €642,000 on donated medical equipment, in excess of €2.9 million for disability equipment, €18,000 for water rescue craft and equipment, in excess of €100,000 for exports by philanthropic organisations and the disabled drivers' fund received a refund in excess of €5 million. The refund system is working and delivers quite a lot of money to the areas to which the Deputy referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">However, the best course to pursue now is to await the result of the EU review because we are very constrained by EU law on what we can do in VAT. If the EU provides us with the flexibility to move in the direction suggested by the Deputy, then we will not be reluctant to move.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the compensation scheme will not be considered in regard to the budget for 2017? Charities, such as the Irish Red Cross, are providing essential services that the Government is not providing and they fund-raise, sell lines and collect money from schools and GAA clubs. In my county, County Clare, the Red Cross bought an ambulance for public service for €86,000. It raised €76,000 of that fund itself and ended up paying €16,000 in VAT. It does not seem right that it is acting as a tax collector for the Government. There should be some compensation in recognition of its public fund-raising and yet a high proportion of that fund-raising is being returned to the Government. Perhaps the Minister will seriously consider a VAT compensation scheme, which may not return all the VAT but which would return a proportion of it and it would allow charities to provide their services to the maximum extent.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">As I have said, there was a review and report in advance of the budget for 2016 and the charities participated in the review. It is my understanding that they were agreeable to not making the change that was contemplated at the time because they had significant refunds and nobody wanted to change. The European Union has put in place an action plan on VAT and it is to report before too long. It contains a proposal to look at VAT rates across the EU for 2017. Since we are so constrained by EU directives, I do not contemplate making major changes this year in VAT for 2017 but I look forward to the EU report to see if it gives the flexibility to allow me to do the things of which the Deputy is talking.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">I do not believe the Government should discriminate between different approaches to parenting and child care. We need to ensure that full-time paid child care facilities are both accessible and of good quality but I argue that we also need to support those parents who decide to provide full-time care themselves or to use relatives, grandparents or a paid child minder. Parents are the best people to call what is the best form of child care to use for their children and I question why we are using our tax system, and it now looks like new support systems, to favour one choice or form of child care over the other.</p>

            <p eId="para_737">As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has primary responsibility for Government policy in relation to child care and at the outset, I would refer to the interdepartmental working group on future investment in child care in Ireland, which published its report in July 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_738"> Having considered the option of a tax credit that would be available to those who incur child care costs, the group recommended against introducing such a measure. The group had concerns that a tax credit would not be equitable, would have high possible deadweight, could end up being fully absorbed in the cost of child care and might not have a meaningful impact on a parent's decision on whether to join or return to the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> The interdepartmental working group also made some initial estimates of the potential costs of such a tax credit based on available data. Tentative costings, based on estimates of average child care costs per pre-primary and primary school child care place, were applied to Department of Social Protection figures on the numbers of such children in receipt of child benefit. If a tax credit were provided in respect of even half of these children at the standard rate of 20%, it would involve a potential cost to the Exchequer of between €290 million and €590 million per annum. The variation depends on the rate of take-up which is difficult to estimate. It was assumed for the purposes of that costing that all paid child care would be covered by the relief, that is, not just centre-based care.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> It is clear that any initiative that provides tax credits for paid child care would fail an equity test as it could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who choose to stay at home to care for their children. In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2016, 36% of income earners were exempt from income tax altogether.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> As regards other tax measures, the Deputy may be aware that in budget 2016, I increased the value of the home carer tax credit and increased the amount of income the home carer can earn while still qualifying for a full or partial credit. The increase in the income threshold is a measure which is of specific benefit to lower income families and retention of the credit could facilitate the home carer in meeting child care costs associated with working any additional hours.</p>

              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_743">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to further increase the home carer credit and I am considering relevant options as part of the tax package for the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_744"> I would also point out that the social impact assessment of the budget 2016 tax and welfare measures published by the Department of Social Protection showed that households with children were the biggest beneficiaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> It should also be noted that budgets 2015 and 2016 introduced reductions in income tax and USC for all income earners that had a relevant liability.  These reductions were specifically focused to target low and middle income earners and the programme for Government commits to continue reductions in personal taxation in order to make Ireland's personal tax system more competitive and to encourage work and employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">The Minister gave the same response to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. I am not calling for a tax credit. I am asking a fundamental question and I want to hear the Minister's view. It is not good enough to just say that it is the view of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Is the Minister, as a Fine Gael Minister, happy that he is about to introduce a budget that, historically, will say the Government does not want parents staying at home looking after children, that it does not want them using a grandparent to care for children, that it does not believe in unpaid care work and that whatever a person does, he or she must get into the paid workplace because the Government wants to push the economy, whatever it takes, and it does not care if this means discrimination against a choice of different types of parenting. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that rather than getting the same answer a second time, which was not an answer to my question.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> This is not a small change because the sort of subsidy which we have talked about paying, a couple of thousand euro a year, is a huge difference. In my constituency, and in many parts of the State, parents will be faced with a choice in that they will not have the option of staying at home because everyone else who is working will be paying higher mortgages and will pump up the whole economy. One has to be part of a dual-income system because that is what the Government says people have to do by the measures that it has introduced. I would like to hear the Minister's view on it rather than another repeated answer to something I did not ask.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">First, I am not responsible for policy on child care, there is a Minister who is. To establish the Government policy on child care, along the lines of the Deputy's supplementary question, he should put down a question for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and not to me. I have referenced for the Deputy a reply to the notion that different parents should be treated differently under the tax code. I referenced the working party report which said it would be discriminatory to do so. I am responsible for taxes, among other things, and I have given the Deputy the reason applying tax relief to child care would be inequitable. It would discriminate against people who are not in the tax net and who are not in the labour force. I am fulfilling my obligations to the House in being amenable in respect of the policies I control. If Deputy Ryan wants a general discussion on child care, I suggest he raises it with the Minister, Deputy Zappone.</p>

            <p eId="para_749">This is a central issue in the budget and there is a raging debate, from what I read in the newspapers, within the Minister for Finance's party about possible discrimination between those on different incomes. I support the Minister, Deputy Zappone, in trying as much as possible to target support for those on low incomes. However, a second massive discrimination is about to be introduced which is a historic statement that Fine Gael is saying it does not want anyone to do unpaid care work, it wants people in the economy and to stop caring for children and it will make that happen by introducing budgetary measures - the Minister's budget - which give direct financial assistance to those who tick a particular option. I do not have a problem with that but if the Government is doing that, then it should give the same assistance to those who choose other options because parents are best placed to choose what is the best form of child care for their different circumstances. Every child is different and every family is different. Why is it that economic considerations seem to be driving the State and the Government to say that only one approach is right? The reality is that it is the Minister's budget which is delivering that strategic change of direction in this State. That is wrong and I would like to hear the Minister's view on child care, as the Minister introducing the measure.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">As the Minister of State and everybody is aware, drivers have been absolutely crucified by enormous increases in car insurance premiums. Overall, they have increased 20% in the last year and are expected to go up another 25% next year. In some categories, it is off the Richter scale. One of the groups that asked me to give a shout out for it is taxi drivers. Huge numbers of taxi drivers simply will not be able to continue doing their job. Then there are young people, people with older cars - one can go through the list. Is it not time to consider a public not-for-profit State insurance company rather than relying upon a failed private insurance industry?</p>

            <p eId="para_756">In Ireland, the provision of insurance through private companies has been the norm for a long time. This is an operational model which has in general been shown to work well and efficiently. It is acknowledged that over the last 18 months or so, there have been some difficulties with aspects of the system, particularly in relation to the availability and cost of motor insurance. However, a State-owned company would have to operate subject to the same prudential rules as a private company and there is no basis to conclude that the same problems would not periodically arise with this model. In addition, there would be significant capital costs for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> The Government has in the past examined the introduction of a scheme of State indemnification in the flood insurance sector. However, this approach was not considered financially viable because it was concluded that over time it would distort the market and could incentivise the insurance industry to discontinue the provision of insurance cover in medium and high risk areas. This would make the cost of such a scheme prohibitive. Furthermore, potentially complex regulatory implications would need to be examined in detail in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland and the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> In relation to the current difficulties in the market for motor insurance, the cost of insurance working group, which I chair, is undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of motor insurance. The working group brings together all of the relevant Departments and offices involved in the process. Its objective is to identify immediate and longer-term measures which can address increasing costs, while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector. By the end of October, the working group will provide the Minister for Finance with an update report which will set out the priority actions required. From November to December, the working group will develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions. In this regard, I will be consulting regularly with Government colleagues and also with the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">I want to shift the terms of the debate towards looking at a public not-for-profit State-led model. Frankly, I believe the Government is being led by the self-serving propaganda of the private insurance industry. The notion that competition in the private insurance market would produce lower premiums has been proven absolute nonsense. It is exactly their competitive drive for market share and, ultimately, profit that has caused this problem. They are now trying to recover lost profits because of the madness of that blind competition as well as the collapse of Setanta Insurance, Quinn Insurance, all the massive waste on advertising and profit-taking generally. I put it to the Minister of State that we need to look at other models. One he could look it is in Manitoba in Canada which has some of the lowest driver premiums anywhere on the American continent. That model was set up precisely because premiums went through the roof in the same way as they have in our private insurance sector. A parliamentary committee was set up, representations were made, they set up a public insurance company and it has worked. I believe we need to look at that because it has ended up cheaper and better for everybody.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">I do not want to get ahead of the potential recommendations of the working group, but we are looking at the operations in other jurisdictions and different models that are happening in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. We are also looking at new ideas like peer-to-peer insurance. We are looking at everything and I am not going to pre-judge the outcome of what we are doing. Setting up a State insurance company would take time and we need to look at the current problems, as the Deputy pointed out in his question. We need urgent action on that and are looking at short, medium and longer-term solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> We have not finished our work yet but I will give the Deputy an idea of some of my thinking on a State insurance company or even a State insurance model with no private actors. Establishing a State insurance company would not lead to any reform in the market. It might reward bad behaviour that is already in the market. What we would see then is people who are already withdrawing out of riskier parts of the market withdrawing further, leading to an increased cost for the State and expediting that problem. The State would face the same problems that are already there in relation to provisioning and concerns about uncertainty around the cost of claims. Those problems would not go away with a State insurance company. We have to ask who would pay the difference between the market price and the discounted rate being given by the Government. Where would that money come from? Would it come from the taxpayer again? I do not think we can put any more of a burden on them. However, we are looking at other jurisdictions and I am keeping an open mind as to what might come from our investigations into those areas by the relevant sub-group that is doing that work.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">There is an assumption behind that that what the private insurance companies are doing with premiums is justified. They are putting a whole case forward on to that. I do not accept it at all. In fact, the number of fatal and non-fatal collisions in this country has fallen substantially. There are not more accidents. There are serious problems of transparency around the finances of private insurance companies. I put it to the Minister of State that it is actually to do with bad investments by these companies and by a crazy and competitive drive for market share. In other words, it is the fault of the private insurance companies and their pursuit of profit that has caused the problem, as well as the collapse of Quinn Insurance and Setanta Insurance and other things. Legal costs have certainly been an issue although I do not think they are the major factor. The costs of all of these things and others such as needless advertising could be eliminated with a public insurance company. I ask the Minister of State to look particularly at the category of taxi drivers who are being run out of business and will not be able to continue unless we do something about this.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">On the Deputy's final point, we are looking at the issue of taxi drivers. We are meeting with every interest group that we can, either in the plenary session where we met with the hauliers earlier this morning as well as representatives of the car rental companies, or with taxi drivers, with whom we are meeting tomorrow, I think, or possibly later in the week. I am not going to be led by the industry. One of the big problems we have at the moment is transparency from the industry as to exactly what is happening, be it in relation to the claims process, the cost of claims or how they are calculating premiums. We are trying to get that information at the moment. What we are identifying through our plenary meetings and sub-groups are some honest brokers who are willing to share with us their information in an objective way so that we can get a proper sense of the picture ourselves. We will use that information to try then to build consensus around what the actual problems are and use that information to build consensus around what the solutions might be. Transparency will be the core of it as well as getting the information out into the public domain. I also have a fear that the lack of transparency is creating problems when it comes to competition and I have raised that with the Competition Commissioner myself.</p>

            <p eId="para_765">Is the Minister willing to consider removing the exemption from dividend withholding tax for non-resident investors in qualifying investor alternative investment funds on dividends relating to profits or gains relating to lands or property situated in the State? We know from the funds industry that the Irish-registered qualifying investor alternative investment funds have net assets of €383 billion as of March this year. We know that foreign investors are using these funds to buy up property at ferocious speeds over the last number of years since the crash. We also know that our tax law allows for them to have no tax liability on the hundreds of millions of euro of rental income that they receive here each year from the billions of euro worth of property that they own. Would the Minister consider the measure that I have suggested to him?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_766">I am informed by Revenue that once a qualifying investor alternative investment fund is authorised by the Central Bank it falls under the definition of an "investment undertaking" under the taxes Acts. It is therefore subject to the tax treatment provided for investment undertakings. The legislation provides a tax exemption to the undertaking itself and to certain investors, such as investors not resident in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_767"> The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment undertakings is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund. The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_768"> This charge in tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction. The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation, that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution. Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a collective investment vehicle or fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_770"> I am aware that concerns have been raised about the use of funds in the Irish property market by international investors which may be eroding the tax base. Officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners are examining the use of certain structures in the property market and are preparing measures to ensure the tax base is protected. I will consider these targeted proposals on the use of funds in the property market for inclusion in this year's finance Bill. The measures will be targeted to ensure they do not adversely impact on the wider funds industry which is of great importance to the broader international financial services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_771"> I reaffirm the stance that Ireland has extensive protections under our tax code to prevent tax avoidance which are strengthened on a regular basis to keep pace with any new threats to the tax base identified by the Revenue Commissioners or otherwise. In effect, therefore, the answer to the question is "Yes".</p>

            <p eId="para_772">The Minister repeated his statements to a committee and in public that he intends to examine this matter. I have been raising the issue of qualified investor funds, as distinct from section 110 organisations, for most of this year. We have found weaknesses in the amendment proposed in respect of qualified investor funds, although I am aware the Minister is open to strengthening it. It is not clear what action will be taken in respect of foreign investment funds. The current position with regard to these funds has been tolerated for far too long. My office has studied the public accounts of many of the funds in question. To give an example, the public accounts of Kennedy Wilson show the company owns property assets in Ireland valued at €1 billion. In the first six months, the fund generated €26 million in rental income, on which it did not pay 1 cent of tax. Other examples include Cedarwood Real Estate, which does not pay any tax on the annual rental income of €2.5 million it receives from the Central Bank. Ireland is out of kilter with international norms in this area. Kennedy Wilson's accounts note the company is exempt from tax in Ireland, whereas it pays tax in Britain and Spain. In other jurisdictions, such funds are subject to a withholding tax. Will the Minister indicate whether this is the line he proposes to adopt?</p>

            <p eId="para_773">Following consultations with the Revenue Commissioners, the Department published a draft amendment to deal with the position in respect of section 110. We also intend the draft amendment to be a consultation document in order that it can be further refined, if necessary, before the finance Bill is introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_774"> Separately, the qualifying funds to which the Deputy referred continue to be studied by the Department and Revenue Commissioners. We have reached the point where we believe amending legislation needs to be introduced. However, we have not yet formulated the nature of such amending legislation. While measures will be introduced in the forthcoming finance Bill to deal with the issue the Deputy raised, I cannot yet describe the methodology or content of the amendment because it is work in progress. </p>

            <p eId="para_775">While I appreciate this is work in progress, I would like to know what principle will be applied. I refer again to the case of Kennedy Wilson because it is a good example of a fund with properties in different jurisdiction. The company's accounts note that it pays income tax of 25% on profits generated in its Spanish subsidiaries and 20% on profits generated in its UK subsidiaries. Dividends paid to non-residents from assets are taxed at a rate of 26.3% in Germany and 30% in France. That is the position in other jurisdictions. While I appreciate that the fund industry is a major employer, this issue is the abuse of certain funds, rather than the industry. Will the Minister apply the principle that income derived from assets in this State should be taxable in this State regardless of whether the investors in the fund are foreign or domestic? At this point, only domestic investors in a fund are taxed on revenue generated from assets in the State. Is the Department considering applying this principle? If so, the change would at least be in line with what we want to achieve. We would then need time to tease out how to achieve this outcome during the debates on the finance Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_776">I have little to add to what I said. We want to ensure tax avoidance is not facilitated by the way in which the law is drafted. The Revenue Commissioners and Department are working up an amendment that will achieve the purpose to which the Deputy drew attention. I cannot yet prejudge the nature of that amendment. but I would be glad to receive any submission the Deputy may wish to make. I would then have it scrutinised alongside all the other inputs that are being scrutinised.</p>

            <p eId="para_779">Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a stamp duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies which currently stands at 1%. The yield from this charge in 2015 was €424.13 million and I understand receipts to the end of August 2016 were more than €260 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_780"> The financial institutions levy I announced as part of budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which provides for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery. The levy is in place for the years 2014 to 2016, inclusive, with an anticipated annual yield of €150 million. As the levy is a percentage of an institution's DIRT liability in 2011, liability to the levy relates to the size of an institution's Irish operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_781"> The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad. It is appropriate, therefore, that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery. Accordingly, I announced in my budget 2016 statement that I propose to extend the levy out to 2021, subject to a review taking place of the methodology used to calculate the levy. This will bring in an additional €750 million over the period, which is a significant additional contribution to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_782"> With regard to the discussions at European Union level, the Government's position is that a financial transactions tax would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres to prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions. Notwithstanding this, the Government is not prepared to stand in the way of EU member states which wish to work together to implement a financial transactions tax. In this regard, adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced co-operation took place during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_784"> The proposal for a directive from the European Commission in the area of a financial transactions tax was published in February 2013. Ireland had many concerns about the proposal as drafted, not least of which were the potential impacts on, and the trading of, Irish sovereign debt in the secondary market and in total, the potential negative impact on the liquidity of the financial sector as a whole. Members of the Economic and Financial Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets have stated that the introduction of a financial transactions tax would have a significantly negative effect on sovereign debt markets and may impair the good functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and, therefore, higher financing costs for states.</p>
            <p eId="para_785"> Our concerns are widely shared among member states, including some of the participating countries. These concerns have led to the issuing of a communiqué by the participating member states announcing that they have agreed to implement a financial transaction tax in a progressive manner, with the first step being a charge on shares and some derivatives. </p>
            <p eId="para_786"> On 17 June 2016, the ECOFIN Council discussed the current state of play with regard to the proposal of a number of member states to introduce a financial transaction tax. In the context of this discussion, ten of the original 11 member states - Estonia has indicated it no longer supports the proposal - issued a statement setting out their agreement on the core design principles of a financial transactions tax. The statement indicates that further reassurances were needed on two issues in particular, for which two task forces will be immediately set up. First, taxation of derivatives should not have a negative impact on public borrowing costs. Second, tax collection should be cost effective. The outcome of these two task forces was to be discussed in September. We understand the task forces have had some discussions but that significant differences of opinion remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_787"> Much uncertainty remains, therefore, as to the form the financial transactions tax might take and more detail would be needed on the final shape of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on Irish taxation revenue. </p>

            <p eId="para_788">I thank the Minister for his response, which was virtually identical to a reply to a parliamentary question I asked in June. The only difference I discerned was that the 1% transaction tax in share trading had raised €260 million by the end of August this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> The gist of the Minister's argument appears to be that the regime in place in Ireland is much more onerous than the current proposal for a financial transactions tax. In his response in June, the Minister indicated the proposed financial transactions tax would raise an estimated €360 million, which is a much lower figure than the figures he cited today. If that is the case, why is he not encouraging the ten countries proposing a financial transactions tax to introduce a system based on our regime, given that it is effective and works well? </p>
            <p eId="para_790"> The Minister cited figures on the revenue generated this year from our financial transactions tax. Does he have figures for the amounts generated in previous years? There appears to be a lack of understanding regarding the way in which this revenue is raised. </p>

            <p eId="para_791">I do not have figures for previous years but I will have them sent to the Deputy. Our position on a financial transactions tax has not changed since June when I last replied to a question from the Deputy on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">In Europe, one of the countries that was involved, Estonia, has dropped out and the other ten have not yet reached agreement. I think they are about to make a report but, so far, I do not see that there is going to be agreement to any particular financial transactions tax emerging from the enhanced co-operation between the now ten member states. There is still quite a difference of opinion among the members participating in the enhanced co-operation and, outside of that, there is a wide divergence of views.</p>
            <p eId="para_793"> The Irish position is driven by our proximity to the City of London and the view, certainly up to Brexit, that if we imposed a financial transactions tax here and the UK did not, and made it clear it would not, there would be a movement of financial services activity from Dublin to London, and there are 38,000 employed in the financial services industry in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I have two points. First, with regard to the transactions moving, the proposal is that the financial transactions tax is levied on the portion of a transaction that belongs in the member state where the financial transactions tax is in place. Therefore, in effect, for a company to move in order to benefit, it would have to deal only in transactions that are outside all the member states participating in the financial transactions tax. The argument that businesses would move does not stand up unless they stop trading completely with any country that has a financial transactions tax in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_795"> Second, with regard to the risk of businesses moving to London, our rates are already higher than the rates in London and we do not see that draw to London from Dublin despite the more onerous taxes, so that argument does not stand up either. Perhaps the Minister is happy that our tax rates are far higher than the financial transactions tax and that is why the Minister does not want to participate in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">No. We have considered this very carefully and I have stated the policy position. I admit that the relationship and the potential change may be more significant after Brexit, depending on the result of the negotiations regarding the relationships between the UK and the EU. Certainly, the City of London is going to be central to those negotiations. The position is as I have stated and we are not contemplating a change at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_798">I am asking for an update on the situation since the debate in the House three weeks ago, in particular what preparations have been made so far in regard to the appeal. The Minister mentioned a two-month period in his response during that debate. What is happening in regard to Revenue collecting the €13 billion-plus from Apple and with regard to the escrow account? What is the likely cost of the appeal? Is the Minister worried there will be similar judgments against companies based in Ireland in the future?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_799">On 30 August 2016 the European Commission issued a negative decision in the Apple state aid case. The Government profoundly disagrees with the Commission's analysis in the Apple case and will now challenge the decision before the European courts.  Dáil Éireann has also passed a motion supporting the Government's decision to appeal the European Commission's decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_800"> Ireland has a period of two months and ten days to bring an appeal.  The appeal process may take several years.  Apple also has indicated that it will exercise its right of appeal.  An appeal to the European courts takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union, asking it to annul the decision of the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_801"> Ireland's position remains that the full amount of tax was paid in this case and no State aid was provided.  Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple.  Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> Notwithstanding the negative decision, no fine or penalty has been imposed on the State. The European Commission has stated: "This decision does not call into question Ireland's general tax system or its corporate tax rate".  No other companies are subject to this decision by the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_803"> On foot of the Commission's decision, Ireland is required to recover up to €13 billion of alleged state aid from the company covering a ten-year period.  Notwithstanding the right of appeal, Ireland is legally obliged to recover the alleged state aid from Apple in the interim.  Given that this money may ultimately have to be returned to the company in the event of a successful appeal, the money can be held in escrow until the case has concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_804"> The Commission has stated that the amount of unpaid taxes to be recovered by the Irish authorities would be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes on the profits recorded by Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe for this period; and the amount of unpaid taxes to be recovered by the Irish authorities would also be reduced if the US authorities were to require Apple to pay larger amounts of money to its US parent company for this period to finance research and development efforts. This illustrates the contradiction at the heart of the European Commission's decision.  While requiring Ireland to recover the tax sums, the Commission is also acknowledging that the sums may in fact be taxable in other jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_805">Has the Minister or his Department had any contact with senior Apple executives since the decision and since the 93-36 vote in this House? With regard to the preparation of the case by the Attorney General, is the Minister keeping an eye on the grounds for that case? Is it just on state aid grounds, as the Minister has said, or is there a broader case?</p>
            <p eId="para_806"> With regard to the cost, the Minister said this will go on for several years. Obviously, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and, I think, the Labour Party made the decision to proceed with this costly appeal. What does the Minister consider will be the cost to the country? Has the collection of the money started and is the escrow account in existence? How will it be treated in our national accounts? Have any of the countries which have a claim on this money - we heard Spanish Ministers talking about it - been in contact with the Minister?</p>

            <p eId="para_807">The Attorney General's office is preparing the grounds for the appeal, the detailed appeal papers and so on and that is directed by the Attorney General herself. She has two months and ten days from the date of the decision and she is working expeditiously on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_808"> I have no hard information yet on the collection of arrears but it is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners. Some contact has been made with the company and so far there does not seem to be a barrier to the collection of the arrears. However, the calculation of the arrears may be difficult because it goes from 2014 back to 2004, a ten-year period, even though the tax opinion on which the case was made initially commenced in 1991. It is a very peculiar kind of judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> The NTMA will look after the escrow and how it will appear in the Government accounts is a matter for discussion at the moment. I will keep the Deputy up to date but that is the information I have at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_810">I understand that on Monday last, the Minister met Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration. He apparently said that the IRS in the United States could be entitled to much of this money. In the context of the forthcoming finance Bill, will there be any more impacts from this ruling in regard to our progress on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS? On an issue we have been discussing at the budget committee, is the Minister confident loopholes are being closed off fast enough to ensure the Minister has more wriggle room on the fiscal space?</p>
            <p eId="para_811"> I note <i>The Guardian </i>newspaper on 18 September published an open letter from the US Business Roundtable group to 28 leaders of the EU which reads like a veiled threat to the EU on future US investment here and refers to the judgment as a "grievous self-inflicted wound" for the EU and its citizens. Is the Minister aware of this?</p>

            <p eId="para_812">Pascal Saint-Amans, who is the tax director of the OECD and was in charge of the BEPS project, visits us regularly and he was here last Monday.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">He was asked questions about the Apple decision at a press conference he held. He stated two things of importance: first, that in his view the arrears were due to the exchequer in the United States and second, that there was no threat from the Commission or anywhere else to Ireland's 12.5% rate and that under law and the European treaties we were absolutely entitled to maintain the 12.5% rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> The issue of the arrears being due to the American exchequer arises from the fact that Apple paid a very low amount of tax internationally. That has been recited several times, but Apple had a significant tax liability, as distinct from the tax it paid. The tax liability turns into payable tax when profits are repatriated to the United States under US law. His view, and that of the OECD, that the arrears are really due to the United States is because that is where the economic activity took place. That is where the iPad and the iPhone were developed and that is the source of Apple's profitability and if the profits are repatriated to the United States the company's liability for US tax will trigger in to the actual payment of tax at 35%.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">This question relates to AIB and the position of the State in terms of the possibility of it selling its stake in the bank. The Minister made some comments on Bloomberg TV in London recently, but I ask him to advise the House of his current thinking on the possibility of selling a stake. Has that course of action now been ruled out for 2016 and is it an open possibility for 2017?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_117" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_819">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 32 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_820"> The State has a shareholding of 99.9% in AIB. This shareholding is a valuable asset to the State and it is the Government's intention that the State will exit this and our other banking investments in a measured and careful manner. As I have indicated on a number of occasions, my primary objective in the disposal of those assets will be recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> I have indicated in the past that an IPO is likely to be the optimal route to recouping value from our investment in AIB. At the beginning of this year officials in my Department appointed an independent financial adviser, following a tender process, to assist with analysis and exit planning and much of the initial preparation has now been completed. The reorganisation of the bank's capital at the end of 2015 which allowed for the return of €1.7 billion to the Exchequer, the consolidation of the bank's ordinary shares and the maturing of the contingent convertible or so-called CoCo instrument in July of this year, has left AIB with a simplified market-facing balance sheet. The bank's CEO also indicated recently that much of the internal preparation that would be required in advance of launching an IPO process has now been completed. In addition, I also welcome the bank's continued strong performance, demonstrating sustainable profitability and strong capital generation over a number of consecutive reporting periods. I also note the recent comments made by the bank's chairman indicating that AIB may be approaching the time when the board will be in a position to consider the payment of a prudent dividend, in consultation with the regulator, which would contribute to the bank's strong investment case.</p>
            <p eId="para_822"> Nonetheless, given the complex nature of an IPO process, the need to access certain IPO "windows" and the recent volatility seen in stock markets, I now deem it more likely that a market event involving AIB would occur in 2017, rather than 2016. Given the strong state of the national accounts, progress made in reducing our national debt and positive market sentiment towards Ireland, there are no structural factors that would require the State to recoup the value of its banking assets in a constrained time period. The State is in a good position to consider the divestment of some of its shares in AIB, through an IPO, if and when we deem market conditions to be amenable.</p>
            <p eId="para_823"> It would not be possible or prudent for me to estimate the amount which might be received from any future sale of shares in AIB. As the Deputy may be aware, the shares in AIB that are currently freely held amount to only a tiny proportion of the bank's total shares. It is therefore an illiquid share with a distorted valuation, and so cannot be considered a valid indicator of how the market would value AIB in an IPO. I note that we have seen substantial reductions in the value of banking shares in the course of 2016, including those banks that could be considered AIB's peers. The weakness and volatility we have seen in banking equities this year reflect market concerns around Brexit, and a prolonged period of low and negative interest rates, as well as uncertainty around the strength of global economic growth. Clearly, in order for us to proceed with an IPO, we would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the business, bearing in mind its current performance and future prospects and the outlook for the Irish economy. Officials in my Department monitor market conditions and the performance of banking equities on an ongoing basis. When I deem conditions conducive to recovering value for the Irish taxpayer, I will notify AIB and move to ready a market event.</p>
            <p eId="para_824"> As I have previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks will be used to reduce the national debt. That is the prudent course of action as it reduces our ongoing borrowing costs and ensures the future strength and stability of the economy.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_825">I think the right approach is being taken to make the preparations for a possible sale of a stake in the bank, but there is no rush. The market conditions must be right to maximise the return for the State. We will still retain a majority shareholding in AIB for the foreseeable future, but the bottom line is that we want to get back as much of the €20 billion that was pumped into the bank, and as quickly as possible, but we also want a bank that meets the needs of the economy in terms of lending to SMEs, personal customers and others. I welcome the reduction in interest rates, for example, that AIB introduced for variable rate mortgage holders. In his supplementary response could the Minister widen the issue to include his attitude to the Bank of Ireland in which we still hold 14%? I do not believe we should sell that stake now or for the foreseeable future. Could the Minister also outline his plans for Permanent TSB, PTSB?</p>

            <p eId="para_826">I think the Deputy understands the position on AIB. He put it succinctly in his original question. I do not intend to go for an IPO in 2016, but I am leaving the option open for 2017. There are not other considerations now, apart from the best price available. The decision will depend on market conditions and the assessment of whether we will get a good return for the taxpayer in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> We have approximately 14% of Bank of Ireland. Again, we are under no pressure to sell. The stake will be sold in due course but there are no plans to go to market at present. Bank shares took a bit of a hit right across the world and especially in Europe since early summer so it is not a conducive market to selling the stake in Bank of Ireland either at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> PTSB raised money on the markets and approximately 75% of PTSB is now owned by the State and 25% is owned by private investment. The shares are quoted but the value has gone down since the investment took place. PTSB has been doing quite well. It has almost completed its deleveraging and I expect values to increase there as well. Nothing immediate is planned. The same rule will apply to all three investments: when the time comes and the best possible return can be got for the Irish taxpayer then one or the other will be put on the market.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_829">I will repeat our position as a party. We are open minded to the sale of a stake in AIB when the conditions are right. The programme for Government commits that the Government will not sell more than a 25% stake in any institution up to the end of 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_830"> We hold a 14% stake in Bank of Ireland and for now that should remain the position. That bank needs to make more progress in terms of treating customers fairly, especially mortgage customers. That is a drum we will keep banging.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> Permanent TSB is a bank that is in recovery phase. It has made good progress but it does have major challenges in terms of the very large tracker mortgage book it has. The management there is doing a good job and it is important for the economy that there is as much competition as possible in the Irish banking sector. Competition is very limited and we would like to see new entrants. I hope the Department and the agencies are seeking to bring new entrants into the Irish market. It may not be the most attractive market in the world at this time, especially when banks are downsizing and deleveraging internationally but I hope the Minister's eyes are open to any opportunities that would emerge to bring new entrants into the Irish market to increase competition.</p>

            <p eId="para_832">I met recently with the parent bank of Ulster Bank. I met the new chief executive of Ulster Bank as well. There is some competition there. They have assured me Ulster Bank will remain in the Irish market. Ulster Bank is quite significant in the northern half of the country but also in Dublin. Between AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank, there is quite a good presence. I hope that when banking union is completed, there will be opportunities for branches or subsidiaries of strong European banks to trade in Ireland. If the economy keeps growing by between 3% and 4%, there should be investment, but I have no indication of any take-up on that yet.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 18 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> As previously confirmed in my reply to Question No. 308 of 16 September 2016, the Local Property Tax (Amendment) Act 2015 does not provide entitlement to an exemption from LPT on foot of pyritic damage where the property was remediated prior to the commencement of the LPT in July 2013. I also clarified that the exemption is claimed by property owners on a self-assessed basis and the onus is on the claimant to provide the appropriate supporting documentation to Revenue when requested to do so. Where the supporting documentation is not provided or where it does not confirm that the statutory requirements have been fully adhered to, then Revenue has no choice but to withdraw the relief and secure payment of any outstanding LPT liabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_838"> In regard to the particular estate mentioned by the Deputy, I am informed that 40 residents claimed pyrite exemption, of which 14 were subsequently withdrawn because the remediation work was certified as having been completed prior to the commencement of LPT. While Revenue has no discretion in applying the qualifying criteria in respect of the pyrite exemption, I am assured that it will be as flexible as possible in providing suitable phased payment arrangements to any property owners who incorrectly claimed the exemption in good faith.</p>
            <p eId="para_839"> The Deputy should advise the property owners in question to make contact with the LPT team on 065-6849292 as soon as possible so that any necessary arrangements can be finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_840">With respect, they did send in all the requested documentation. I would like to put on the record, in case I need to, that it is not their fault that their houses and their homes have pyrite. They could have no way of knowing when they bought their homes that pyrite was present. They sent in all of the documentation. They complied with all of the rules as they understood them. They even went to the trouble of telephoning the Revenue Commissioners - one of them works for Revenue - to double-check that they did in fact have the exemption, and they did this every year. They submitted large quantities of documentation, everything that was requested of them. They further went to the trouble of making telephone calls just so they could be clear about it. Again, it is not their fault that the records and recordings do not go back far enough to capture this, but they have told me and assured me they did everything possible. What they seek from the Minister is a modicum of flexibility. He must understand, their homes have been rendered effectively worthless by pyrite. The value of even those homes that have been remediated is severely impacted. They are looking, I suppose, for someone to take a compassionate view.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">I think we all understand the plight of people whose homes are affected by pyrite. All sides of this House have moved to remediate the situation. We have introduced amending legislation to do so. The Revenue administers it. I know the Deputy is a new Member but there are dedicated helplines for Deputies to Revenue, which she probably knows. One can take up any individual case through that helpline and one is not deemed to be interfering with the Revenue or anything like that.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> However, I will take a look at the information that the Deputy has brought to my attention, I will transmit it to Revenue and I will see if anything can be done. The crux, according to the reply here, seems to be that the remediation of the homes took place before LPT was part of the tax code. There is a problem of matching an exemption from a tax for expenses incurred before the tax occurred. I do not know whether the Revenue has sufficient flexibility to deal with that anomaly but I will inquire in that regard on the Deputy's behalf.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">This is a very simple question. I do not want to go into the ins and outs of the Apple case and whether we should appeal or not. I think our views are very clear on that. In October 2013, on budget day, the Minister announced that he would bring forward legislation to end the application of stateless companies in this State, which happened in the Finance Bill. When was he or any of his officials in the Department first informed that stateless companies were operating in this State, and can he inform the House who informed him?</p>

            <p eId="para_847">Different countries use different factors to determine the tax residence of companies. Ireland has traditionally relied primarily on a "management and control" test which takes into account where the key strategic decisions about the company are taken. Some other countries rely primarily on the incorporation test whereby companies are tax-resident in the place where they are incorporated. The interaction of these different types of rules has previously led to a situation where a company could be incorporated in Ireland but managed and controlled elsewhere. These were commonly known as "Irish-registered but non-resident" companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_848"> There is a Department of Finance tax strategy group paper from 1998 that details the illegitimate use of "Irish-registered but non-resident" companies by groups engaged in fraud, money-laundering, drug-trafficking and other illegal activities. This report followed work undertaken by the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and what is now the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office were also consulted. The issues outlined in the paper were subsequently addressed by a package of measures including amendments to company law provisions and the introduction of taxation provisions in the Finance Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_849"> The existence of these "Irish-registered but non-resident" companies is a matter of public record going back to the 1990s. Their existence was even debated in the Dáil during this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> The Deputy has asked a question that relates to "stateless" companies. The term refers to the ability of companies to take advantage of mismatches in the tax residence rules of two countries in order to achieve a situation where they can claim that they are not tax-resident anywhere, that they are "stateless" for tax purposes. The concept of a "stateless" company only came to light in 2013, following the US Senate hearings into Apple.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_852"> I acted swiftly on foot of this information and, in the Finance Act later that year, amended Ireland's tax residence rules to ensure that an Irish-registered company could not be "stateless" in terms of its tax residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_853"> In the following Finance Act, I made a further change to bring Ireland's company residence rules into line with those in other OECD jurisdictions and address the reputational damage arising from Ireland's association with the term "double Irish". Owing to recent changes made to the company residence rules, such structures no longer exist as from 1 January 2015 it is no longer possible for an Irish-incorporated company to claim that it is "stateless" for tax purposes, and from 1 January 2015 a new company incorporated in the State is generally regarded as tax-resident in the State, thereby bringing an end to the so-called "double-Irish". This will take effect for existing companies, incorporated before 1 January 2015, from 31 December 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> I have never claimed that these changes will bring an end to international tax planning. For that to happen, co-ordinated action by many countries working together is required. Ireland has continued to play our part in bringing about solutions to such problems, and I have signed up to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting reports and the EU anti-tax avoidance directive as further evidence of that commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_855">The last paragraph was actually the beginning of the answer to my question. The Minister says that the concept only came to light in 2013. We know - the whole world knew - on 21 May 2013 what Tim Cook and his officials in Apple told the US Senate, that he was operating stateless companies that were resident and incorporated in Ireland. Is the Minister telling me that neither he nor any of his officials knew from information from Revenue officials that these stateless companies were operating prior to that date? That is the crux of the question. I do not have to ask anything else. Is that the date, 21 May 2013, that either he or his officials in the Department first found out that stateless companies were operating in this State?</p>

            <p eId="para_856">There was an awareness back in the 1990s of Irish-registered but non-resident companies and that they were used for criminal activity, including fraud. Company law was changed to remediate that. However, no connection was made between Irish-registered non-resident companies and a kind of stateless situation which could be used for the avoidance of tax. This only became an issue after the Apple inquiry in 2013. My Department assures me that was the first awareness it had of stateless companies being used for tax avoidance.</p>

            <p eId="para_857">I appreciate that. We can both agree that Irish-registered non-resident companies are completely different from stateless ones because those ones could be resident in another jurisdiction which should be the norm. Have there been any inquiries with Revenue as to when it first became aware that stateless companies were operating in this jurisdiction? We are aware of the opinions, which, obviously, are at the heart of the Apple tax judgment. Are we to believe that back in 1991 Revenue was under the impression that these companies that were registered but non-resident were actually resident for tax purposes in the US? Was Revenue aware that these were stateless companies? Do we know when Revenue became aware that stateless companies were operating in our jurisdiction?</p>

            <p eId="para_858">They share information with the Department of Finance all the time. Therefore, they would also have been aware after the Apple inquiry. Going back to 1991 we need to look at how corporation tax evolved in Ireland. When Revenue gave its opinion on Apple originally, coming into the 1990s no tax was payable on exports of exporting companies. It evolved into a 10% tax payable. Following a legal challenge, it then had to apply to all companies and not just exporting companies. It then evolved again and was driven up to 12.5% following EU intervention. To see the picture emerging - it is difficult to see - one needs to match what the tax position was to what was happening. The stateless position did not become an issue until after the Apple inquiry in 2013, which focused on it and highlighted it.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">The issue of St. Mochta's school will be the subject of what I anticipate will be an extremely large public meeting in Clonsilla tonight. This is now one of the biggest issues in Dublin 15, which, as the Minister knows, is a vast and growing area. I know the Minister is meeting members of the school management and I hope the news is good in anticipation of that meeting. This was a ten-year project. It was promised to the community. The school management agreed to double its school population on the basis that it would get a new school building and several years later, it has been let down.</p>
            <p eId="para_862"> I raised this in a Topical Issue debate on 12 November 2015. I would like the Minister and other Deputies who were involved to address what was covered in the final paragraph of the reply on that day, which stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_863">While it was not possible to include the projects [St. Mochta's and St. Patrick's schools] referred to by the Deputy in the current five-year building programme, I wish to advise the Deputy that the projects will be available for consideration for the new six-year plan...</p>
            <p eId="para_864">However, five days later two Ministers at the time, the then Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, announced on 17 November that St. Mochta's was to be totally rebuilt with the project to proceed to construction in 2016. How, in five days, did it go from not being on the list to being on the list? However, the school board and the local population subsequently heard the school was not on the list at all. Was it ever really on the list for 2016? That is what people at tonight's public meeting will want to know.</p>

            <p eId="para_865">Members of the board of management at St. Mochta's school contacted me at the end of August to express their understandable shock and disappointment after the Department of Education and Skills wrote to it to advise that the rebuild of the school was being postponed until next year at the earliest. St. Mochta's is an excellent school with brilliant and dedicated teachers and a very supportive school community of parents and pupils who come from up to 52 different countries as well as the old community from the old village of Clonsilla.</p>
            <p eId="para_866"> The school has many prefabs on a four-acre site. There is an extension from the year 2000 which the Department declared to be unfit for purpose in 2012. The late Brian Lenihan was involved in the negotiations whereby the school community agreed to more than double the size of the school to take account of the extra demand for school places in this part of Dublin 15. They were promised, before the crash, that the buildings would be attended to and the project, which is still awaited ten years later, would get under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_867"> As a public representative, I fought hard - as did other public representatives in the area - to support the school community to ensure the rebuild would commence in 2016. I make no apologies for lobbying continually and constantly, as did other Deputies and public representatives in the area. I cannot understand how the Minister could see any justification for the delay to these building works.</p>
            <p eId="para_868"> It was agreed in 2015 that the school would proceed. What has now happened is totally unacceptable. When the Labour Party was in government before the general election, major progress was made with the nationwide school building and the replacement of prefabs, notwithstanding the severe economic crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> Is the Minister seeking an extra capital allocation to ensure that this and other school projects are built as soon as possible? What is the reason for the delay?</p>

            <p eId="para_870">I thank the Deputies for raising the matter. I assure them that the building project for St. Mochta's national school was included in the six-year programme announced on 17 November 2015 to progress. It is one of the 67 projects that were announced in 2016 to be part of the 2016 programme. Of course the commencement of a programme does not mean that it will actually be constructed until it is released to tender. That is the process that we have to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_871"> As I think the Deputies have outlined, the design team was appointed a considerable time ago - back in 2010 - and the board of management was authorised to commence architectural planning. At that stage, it was not included in the programme announced in 2012 but it was subsequently added in 2015. It is now at an advanced stage of architectural planning, so it is proceeding to complete the planning stage. All statutory approvals have been obtained, tender documents have been prepared and the Department has approved the stage 2B submission.</p>
            <p eId="para_872"> As Deputy Coppinger recognised, I have met the principal, the chairman of the board and the patron.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">There are issues that need to be finalised on some of the fee elements of the project, including a further submission by the design team on its request for a fee uplift that would have to be approved in accordance with the requirements set out for every project. My Department is working with the team to advance that matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_874"> On the release of the project to tender, we have a lot of commitments in hand. The previous Minister released projects to tender in April, but I have not been in a position as of yet to release new projects to tender. However, I recognise the importance of this school and I am working with my officials on the timing of existing projects in the programme and their possible release to tender. I am seeking to obtain additional resources to accelerate these projects. I continue to work to try to deliver the St. Mochta's national school project at the earliest possible time. The matter will receive considerable attention from me in the coming months. </p>
            <p eId="para_875"> I can assure Deputy Joan Burton that there is no diminution of my commitment and that of the Department to the completion of building projects. We will have a considerably larger budget for the coming year than was provided this time last year, which is a recognition that there are pressing needs across the system, on which we are attempting to deliver. There is no doubt that the community feels very let down by the lengthy delay in delivering the project. Some of the reasons for the delay were beyond anyone's control. Nonetheless, I fully understand the frustration of parents whose children are in prefabs, many of which have been in place for a lengthy period. There is understandable frustration among the school staff and parents, but I assure the Deputies that I am working to accelerate the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">This is not just about children in prefabs. It is also about the substandard conditions in which children and staff are learning and working. The accommodation is dark, damp and mouldy and completely unsuitable. These are the worst conditions in which I have ever seen children being taught. It is absolutely intolerable. We are told there has been a recovery in the economy. Why can more money not be allocated for the construction of the buildings promised, particularly given that building workers also need jobs? The suspicion in the community is that because of the pressure exerted in electioneering the St. Mochta's national school project and, possibly, other similar projects were included in the list which was widely publicised. There is outright cynicism in that regard, but that is how people feel and it is hard not to feel that way when a new Government enters office and a project suddenly disappears from the list. </p>
            <p eId="para_877"> On the architectural regulations, the school is very concerned that the new guidelines will be applied retrospectively to projects which have already been approved. That should not be the case. It is important that insurmountable barriers not be put in the way of the project. When is it likely to commence? That is what people want to know and I am still not clear on the matter, despite the Minister's reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_878">I welcome the Minister's commitment to ensure commencement of this school project as soon as possible. It is possible to have the tendering process finalised before the end of the year. I understand the new guidelines will apply from 8 January. Will the Minister give a commitment that both he and his Department will work with the school, which has over a period of ten years sought to bring the project to fruition, to ensure the tender process will get over the line before the new complicated guidelines become applicable which it is feared could set the project back for a significant period? Will the Minister, through his departmental officials, assist the school board which has been trying might and main for years, including meeting many of us late at night at meetings to advise us on the progress of the project, to achieve this end? They deserve that assistance. There is no point in the Minister engaging in tech-talk with me or others when that is the responsibility of his officials. Has he met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to seek additional money for the capital programme in order that this project can proceed?</p>

            <p eId="para_879">I assure Deputy Ruth Coppinger that, whatever the suspicions of the community are, that is not the position. We have sought to accelerate the project as quickly as possible. The release to tender occurs when projects reach a certain point. This project had not yet reached that stage when the previous Minister released projects to tender last April. I will be working very hard to bring it to the point where it can be released. As I said, there are obligations on the design team that have to be met before that point is reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_880"> Both Deputies have referred to the new tendering process. Deputy Joan Burton is correct that the latest date by which tenders must be submitted such that the new tendering process will not apply is 8 January 2017. I reassure Deputy Ruth Coppinger that it is not a case of me introducing retrospection. It is something that has been well known by everyone in the business for a long time. It is a new process that will apply from 8 January 2017. </p>
            <p eId="para_881"> I have met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the provision of additional money for building projects. I regard this project as a priority for all the reasons outlined by the Deputies; the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and Deputy Lisa Chambers. I will be working to achieve a satisfactory outcome for the parents and children involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_882">The Minister will no doubt be aware of the importance of INTERREG IVA and PEACE funding to the Border region, in the current round of which in excess of €550 million is available, with a potential sum of €1.6 billion being available into the future. The matter being raised in this Topical Issue debate is probably the first major hurdle we have to cross in the context of Brexit. It is important that we get this right and secure the money being provided by the European Union, the Northern Exchequer and in the South for the continued development of projects and programmes post-Brexit. Up to July this year, 17 projects with a total value of €120 million had been approved for funding, but letters of offer have not yet issued. At a meeting earlier this week of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, indicated that he had signed off on the matter but that there was a log-jam elsewhere. In a response I received on 16 September to a parliamentary question the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, indicated that he was dealing with the issue. However, it has come to my knowledge that the delay centres on two major issues from a Southern perspective: the insertion in the letters of an offer of a break clause for two years to coincide with the possible timing of Brexit and an assurance from all partners that EU rules and regulations will be followed for the duration of the projects, irrespective of when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. This is to avoid any potential claw-back of funding. Local authorities, communities and those involved in the 17 projects are waiting for this money. If we do not get it right, there is no doubt in my mind that the additional moneys due to come down the track will not be forthcoming. This presents a huge challenge.</p>

As the Minister will be aware, the PEACE and INTERREG programmes were put in place in the mid-1990s following on the success achieved in advancing the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The funding provided by successive Irish and British Governments and the EU Commission has been particularly important in building communities and bridges between communities. We are very well aware that many business enterprise and social enterprise projects have been funded through the INTERREG and PEACE programmes. As my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, said, a huge amount of preparatory work has already been undertaken by voluntary organisations and local statutory organisations in putting together applications and projects that would meet the criteria to draw down under the new PEACE and INTERREG programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> We want a clear assurance from the Government that there is a commitment to the full roll-out of the PEACE IV and INTERREG programmes that were agreed some time ago between the Irish and British Governments and the European Commission. The uncertainty setting in now is creating extreme problems for groups working on bringing applications to finality and groups that have already completed the application process and are awaiting the funding approval to enable them to proceed with projects that are necessary for local communities, which will help to provide employment in many disadvantaged areas and will provide facilities that have not been provided by the statutory authorities in Northern Ireland or Southern Ireland. We need the Minister to give a clear assurance the Government is absolutely committed to the full roll-out of these programmes as agreed a considerable time ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_887">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Pascal Donohoe, who is before a committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> The Irish Government remains firmly committed to the full and successful implementation of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes. I am aware of the Deputies' interest in the issue and the Minister and I share their commitment to this important area of North-South co-operation. Just yesterday, the Minister’s officials met representatives of the east Border region and gave them a full briefing on the work that we have been doing to protect the PEACE and INTERREG programmes from the consequences of Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_889"> The Government is proud of its role in securing EU funding for a fourth PEACE programme. Along with its sister INTERREG programme, it will see investment of more than €500 million in the region over the period from 2014 to 2020. The programmes have made an enormous contribution to cross-Border co-operation and remain important drivers of regional development in a cross-Border context. More than this, support for the programmes is a key element of the European Union's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation over the last quarter of a century. This is a key point that should not be lost sight of.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> Earlier this month at the British-Irish Association in Oxford, the Taoiseach put the role of the EU in supporting the peace process, including through the Special EU Programmes Body and EU funding, at the top of his list of issues that need to be addressed to protect the Good Friday Agreement. The UK’s decision to leave the EU will obviously have implications for two programmes that are 85% funded by the European Union, just as it will have implications for all programmes supported by the EU budget. This has created huge uncertainty for everyone involved in the programmes, and the solutions will be neither simple nor easy. The risks to the programmes were identified by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as a result of the contingency planning undertaken prior to the referendum, so that starting on day one, 24 June 2016, officials began working with the Northern Ireland Executive, the Special EU Programmes Body and the European Commission to establish the basis on which the programmes can continue to be implemented. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has discussed the matter with the Minister, Mr. Ó Muilleoir, at the North-South Ministerial Council. They have been in correspondence and I understand they plan to speak in the coming days.</p>
            <p eId="para_891"> The Minister is aware of assurances given by the Treasury on a whole range of EU-funded projects as a response to widespread concern in the UK about the consequences of Brexit. In the case of Structural Funds projects, however, these assurances only relate to projects approved in the normal course prior to the Chancellor's autumn statement in this coming November. As I am sure the Deputies will agree, we would be concerned at any suggestion that it would not be possible to continue to approve projects beyond then. We appreciate there is an anxiety to see letters of offer issue to applicants as soon as possible, but the UK's decision to leave the EU has, as we predicted, raised all sorts of uncertainty. It would be foolhardy to proceed before everyone concerned, including programme beneficiaries, funding Departments and the Commission itself, all understand the nature of the financial commitments they are being asked to enter into for projects that may extend beyond the UK exit from the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_892"> The personal commitment of the Minister, Mr. Ó Muilleoir, to the programmes is well known, but we will nevertheless be looking for assurances from him that approval for projects will be able to continue beyond the Chancellor’s autumn statement. It is important that his officials work with ours to address the complex problems thrown up by the referendum result, so that project beneficiaries can be made robust offers of funding that will survive the consequences of Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_893"> While there are complex financial, technical and legal issues that need to be worked through, let there be no doubt about this Government’s commitment to the successful implementation of the programmes. The programmes are a long-term project and we are in this for the long haul.</p>

            <p eId="para_894">I welcome the Minister's response, but I put it to him that the planning process for any project takes a considerable lead-in time and considerable delivery time. The reality is the Irish Government needs to get a commitment from the EU for the continuation of projects, at least on the southern side. After the Chancellor's budget on 18 November, if the British Government is serious about the peace process and the importance of co-operation North and South, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure the money is ring-fenced. If we do not plan the projects it is no good stating that it will be for two years as has been suggested by the Department; it is not a case of live horse and you will get grass. If we want to get projects off the ground we must have a commitment right through. This is what is needed if people firmly believe in the peace process and believe that it is about getting on as a community on these islands, North and South. Everybody should sign up to it regardless of Brexit.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">I thank the Minister for his reply. As the Minister is aware, uncertainty will kill off the best interests of the people involved in these programmes. They work on a voluntary basis to better their local communities. In many instances, they create local employment to provide better services and better facilities for, in the main, disadvantaged communities on both sides of the Border. It is essential that the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Noonan, make direct contact with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Hammond, MP, regarding this issue. The Taoiseach needs to continue to pursue it with the British Government and the President of the European Commission. This is relatively small money in the scheme of things when one considers the expenditure incurred by the European Commission, but it is hugely important for areas that need investment which have been so adversely affected by trouble over the years. We have made progress on this island and much progress is still needed in these disadvantaged communities. We need to try to ensure social infrastructure is not lost through these programmes not being rolled out fully. There is a need for the Government to give an absolute message and commitment that there will be no dilution or delay in having these projects proceed. We must seek this assurance from the European Commission and the British Government. If uncertainty prevails the entire programmes will fall.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">The Deputies recognise that between us, North and South contribute 15%, and 85% comes from the EU. There is absolutely no question about the Irish Government's commitment to this project. The issue continues to be that we need to have clarity about the EU's commitment and the UK's commitment. Both of these must be in place for us to give the type of assurances the Deputies require. This is what we are striving to achieve. The guarantee offered by the Chancellor is limited in its time, and it does not deal explicitly with what happens after the UK has left the European Union. This needs to be clarified to know exactly where these projects stand in respect of this contribution. We also need to know exactly what the EU commitment is in respect of cases where a member state has left and programmes are outstanding. We are absolutely committed to it, but the Deputies can see why it is imperative the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform achieves, through discussions North and South and with the UK and EU, the line of sight we need to give assurances to communities that these projects, which are so important, can be fulfilled. This is what he is working to achieve.</p>

            <p eId="para_897">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis na Teachtaí a rinne na hathruithe chun an t-ábhar seo a phlé níos luaithe.</p>
            <p eId="para_898"> I have been watching the broadcast of the Committee of Public Accounts meeting on NAMA. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Environment and Local Government is not present. While I was thinking of what to say to him, the figure of €190 million that may have been miscalculated in selling off the NAMA portfolio in the North kept ringing through my brain. Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that since January, the 23 families who were evicted by armed gardaí on trucks from Woodlands Park halting site outside Dundalk have not been rehoused in full. Seven families currently live on the side of the road without access to toilet or water facilities or electricity and three of the families have children under the age of ten. I spoke to another family who parked their caravan beside their mother's place somewhere in County Cavan and they do a 100 km round trip every day to get the kids to school because the one constant in their lives is the school in Dundalk. They are hopeful that they will be rehoused and looked after in the town.</p>
            <p eId="para_899"> Last March, when funding was meant to have been released to the local authority, the families were promised that Woodlands Park would be refurbished and they would be rehoused by October. Kitty Holland of <i>The Irish Times</i> went on to the site yesterday where some men were looking at maps and papers. When she asked what was happening, they said the job should start next week and would be completed in 12 weeks, which brings us right up to the new year and the harshest part of the winter. The seven families living on the side of the road are indicative of what happens in respect of Traveller accommodation in this country. I chaired the local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC, on Dublin City Council for six years and I never experienced as much obfuscation, hesitation and deliberate twisting of figures, facts and promises in my role as a councillor until my final year on the council when the staffing changed and different officers were put in charge. This is the experience of Travellers in every local authority area and the figures bear it out. In 2008, €40 million was allocated to Traveller accommodation. This was reduced to €4 million by 2013 while last year, €4.3 million was allocated. The National Task Force on Traveller Accommodation in 1995 highlighted the need for 3,100 new Traveller units. Less than 10% of that number has been delivered two decades later. There is a now a need for 3,741 units. In my experience as a local authority representative, it was like pulling teeth to get money to refurbish houses that were badly needed for families and to get basic facilities such as bays, toilet facilities and water services installed in Labre Park, Ballyfermot.</p>
            <p eId="para_900"> I wanted to make a plea to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on behalf of Rebecca Quinn from Dundalk to whom I have just spoken. She met him and other political party representatives in May and she was promised that the sun, moon and stars would be delivered. Since then, she has written to the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Health and Children and Youth Affairs and several times to Deputy Coveney and she has rung his office but she has been ignored by everybody.</p>

            <p eId="para_911">I should clarify that Louth County Council is the authority with statutory responsibility for the assessment of accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, in the Louth area. Following the removal of families from Woodlands Park halting site in January, the county council commenced a review of its Traveller accommodation programme 2014-2018 to facilitate all households and families who wished to make applications to be considered for housing or amend their accommodation type choice. The LTACC is currently meeting with regard to this review. It is important, as we discuss this, that we do not undermine the key role of the committee in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> A media report published today suggests that seven families are on the roadside with no water supply. Louth County Council is aware of four caravans that have been placed at Naughton's Close, approximately 1 km from the Woodlands Park site. The council is not satisfied that these caravans are occupied. I understand the council is currently investigating the situation to bring some clarity to the matter. The media report also suggests that the seven families are among a number of families removed from Woodlands Park halting site in January this year. While the families' representative claimed that there were 23 families on site at the time of the initial removal, only 15 families presented to Louth County Council seeking alternative accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_913"> Since the removals, the council has met with every family who presented to them seeking accommodation. In line with housing regulations, where the council considered that a family's housing needs were being met in other accommodation, they were not provided with emergency hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation. However, of the 15 families who presented to the council following the removals from the Woodlands Park site in January, 14 have since been accommodated through various social housing supports including housing assistance payment, social and voluntary housing, and emergency bed and breakfast accommodation. One family is no longer receiving support as they have refused two offers of accommodation from the council.</p>
            <p eId="para_914"> Immediately following the removals from Woodlands Park, and in advance of the review of its Traveller accommodation plan, the council formed the view that there would be likely demand for a halting site in the area and, accordingly, sought financial support from my Department to refurbish the Woodlands Park site. This was granted and the council has advised my Department that work on the site commenced last Monday morning, as scheduled. Accordingly funding will be provided by my Department in line with the approved budget for these works. Offers of accommodation on the site will be made by the council over the coming weeks with likely occupation before year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_915"> I have every confidence that Louth County Council will continue to work with the Traveller families, the LTACC and all concerned to ensure that the accommodation needs of Travellers in the area are met.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">I am sorry if I rudely interrupted the Minister of State. The expression "sun, moon and stars" is relative and, in this case, it could mean the supply of water or electricity or a simple home. Obviously, I do not say there is a demand for, or a request for, lavish expense on Travellers similar to that which is often lavishly expended on other sectors of society but, like everybody else, Travellers deserve to have their human rights fulfilled. Despite the obfuscation in the Minister of State's reply on the part of Louth County Council regarding the number of families and whether they are living on the roadside, families are being deprived of a decent place to live and plans were presented to the families following their eviction.</p>
            <p eId="para_917"> As chairperson of the Dublin City Council LTACC, I attended a special meeting with departmental officials and we were told that when the fire service took part in the audit of all the halting sites around the country, no evictions would ensue without alternative accommodation being provided. However, this is not what happened in Dundalk and, all this time later, families are still waiting for the site to be refurbished.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">I resent the way the Minister of State said, as if it were in brackets, "as scheduled". That is not what the original schedule said. It said that it would be ready by October, not that it would begin in October. Now we have to put these families on the side of the road through the winter without the building being completed as was promised. I repeat the request from Rebecca Quinn. She wants to meet the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney. I understand the difficulty as I am also a busy woman and find it difficult to arrange an appointment to meet somebody, although I am not nearly as important as he is. I am probably more important than he is in some ways. He has a duty to meet that woman. Since the last meeting they have been let down left, right and centre. She represents Dundalk Travellers and has repeatedly requested a meeting with the Minister, so I ask him to spare the time to meet her rather than fob her off to representatives of his Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">I again thank the Deputies for their comments and observations and assure them that I am committed to ensuring that Traveller accommodation needs will be met in a safe and sustainable way. I reiterate that safety on halting sites is paramount and I hope that Travellers will feel reassured by the steps that are being taken by my Department in the context of the review of fire safety programmes in Traveller accommodation. Members will be aware that my Department published the report only last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_920"> While recognising broader issues related to Traveller accommodation, the review process focused on life safety and on the fire safety measures which are perceived to be the most effective in protecting life safety among the Travellers. Recognising that what has been done is a first stage in a process which needs to be mainstreamed into ongoing work programmes, the report makes a number of recommendations to clarify recommended approaches and to embed the issue of fire safety in Traveller accommodation into future work programmes. One of the key recommendations to emerge from the report is that in order to mainstream fire safety as an ongoing item, it should be included as a standing item at all local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC, meetings. At the same time, it is recommended that oversight of the LTACC's role in relation to fire safety in Traveller accommodation be added to the brief of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC. The NTACC will seek regular updates that LTACCs are meeting this requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_921"> I assure the House that my Department will continue to support and work with local authorities and national Travellers' representative groups to ensure the continued provision of safe and secure accommodation for Travellers, in accordance with their choice, and through the comprehensive local and national collaborative structures which are in place. Work has begun on site and money has been allocated. We expect people to be housed there before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_922">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this very important issue for both our constituencies. This story goes back almost ten years. The cranes that have been stalled in suspended animation in Naas are an unnecessary symbol that we must hope will go away soon. Approaching the town from all angles, locals and visitors alike are confronted with the sight of a town centre that has stalled in its development. It has had a negative effect on the town because it gives a negative appearance to the town and it would appear that nobody cares. I know that not to be true but for one reason or another, negotiations have been taking place now for ten years, or have not been taking place as the case may be, with a view to bringing together all the various strands that have been outstanding for all that time in respect of wayleaves, CPOs. There has been an issue in respect of arbitration, which started a year ago to resolve one of the outstanding issues. Mysteriously, and in an extraordinary fashion, it disappeared and is to be resumed next spring. It would have been much more efficient and effective and would have given a much greater impression of animated activity and of there being a degree of concentration on the job, if the process had been concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_923"> The local authority is awaiting developments as the arbitration will not start again until next spring but in the meantime, matters remain the same. There are numerous offers and options available to further the development in the event of the problems being resolved, so I ask the Minister to use his influence within his Department to influence local officials, although they do not actually need to be influenced, and to influence officials in adjoining Ministries to the greatest possible extent to move the process forward again and to remove the obstacle to the development of the town which has had an unnecessary psychological effect on the town's development. It is one of the country's best provincial towns and there is no reason that image cannot continue but the longer the cranes remain static on the horizon, the longer their image will prevail.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> I ask that every effort be made between now and the end of this session to regenerate the activity that should be taking place now, thereby eliminating the issues that have strangled the centre of the town for so long.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_925">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position from my point of view and that of the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, regarding town centre development in Naas. I had the opportunity to view the site with Deputy Durkan and county council officials on Tuesday during my visit to Naas County Council. I can see exactly what the problem is and if I was not convinced before of the urgency with which this needs to be addressed, I am now. As Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal and urban regeneration, this is not something I want to continue and it has to be dealt with. It is a fine site in a very busy, functioning and competitive town with a lot to offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_926"> As indicated in earlier replies on this matter, the management of stalled development in Naas is a matter for Kildare County Council in the first instance. I am informed by Kildare County Council that the securing of a satisfactory conclusion to the development of the Naas town centre site has been a particular focus of its efforts over the past number of years. In this context the council, on foot of arbitration procedures, has successfully completed an agreement with one of two site owners relating to the provision of roads infrastructure to service the town centre site. The arbitration case relating to the second site owner remains to be heard by the property arbitrator. I understand that the hearing in this case is not scheduled to take place until April 2017, due to the property arbitrator's caseload. Everyone involved, however, is trying to deal with this as urgently as possible and Kildare County Council and my Department are certainly treating it with urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_927"> In parallel with these arbitration cases, Kildare County Council has also been involved in ongoing discussions with the owner of the town centre site and his agents with a view to advancing the development of the site as early as possible. The council continues to encourage both the financial institutions that have a controlling interest in the site and the owner of the site to either apply for planning permission for development on the site or to offer the site for sale on the open market. I am informed that this is the key action required at this time to secure progress in regard to this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_928"> The Minister's role in relation to planning and development generally is mainly to provide and update the legislative and policy guidance framework, including in relation to national urban policy. He has no mandate in relation to individual town centre developments which, as I have outlined, are a matter for the relevant local authority. Numerous initiatives have been undertaken by Government to stimulate urban renewal and address urban blight and decay, which has been one of the main negative legacies of our recent economic difficulties. Even before that, urban decay had started in many rural areas. The initiatives have been set out for the Deputy in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 373 of 17 May 2016. We are trying to drive this on and we had a very productive meeting of our steering committee to develop a new policy and to find ways to regenerate our towns, villages and inner cities, in the greater Dublin region and beyond. With the movement of people in the past 30 years towns have really been under pressure and while this site is slightly different, there is the same necessity to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_929"> The combination of these many measures and initiatives, building on those of the previous Government, is evidence of the commitment of this Government to address town renewal issues generally. We will continue to progress such initiatives as appropriate, with a view to revitalising towns like Naas and assisting in their economic recovery in a planned and sustainable manner. We are trying to develop new policies and in our action plan, Rebuilding Ireland, there is a commitment to produce new initiatives before the end of the year and to publish them next year. We are also looking to strengthen the laws around derelict and inactive sites so we will hopefully have more powers to enable local authorities to deal with situations where there is neglect. Hopefully, those new initiatives will not be needed in the case of Naas and it will be dealt with before that.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The management of the stalled town centre development in Naas is mainly a matter for Kildare County Council. The council is in contact with our Department and we will continue that engagement to see where we can help. It might not be appropriate for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at this time, in view of the arbitration process, but he said he will contact the Deputy to discuss it and what can be done.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_931">The Ceann Comhairle and I readily recognise that tardiness in situations such as this does not help or impress. The Minister is concerned about such matters as well. Samuel Beckett famously wrote in this regard in "Waiting for Godot". The local authority has been waiting for quite a long time and the Ceann Comhairle and I know what that means in our respective constituencies. The Minister of State observed the famous cranes at very close quarters just two days ago. It was appropriate that he should have the opportunity to see what is happening there. The visual impact is one thing but the problem has continued for so long, hence the reference to "Waiting for Godot", that many people wonder if it will ever be resolved. The longer it continues, the worse the problem becomes in terms of the debilitating effect it has on the town, physically and psychologically. Between now and the end of this session, every effort should be made by all of the authorities involved to bring matters to a conclusion, once and for all. Instead of waiting for Godot into the future, we can say Godot is here.</p>

            <p eId="para_933">I will just bow out at this stage. I agree with Deputy Durkan that this matter must be dealt with. If there is anything the Department can do, it will be done where appropriate. In some of these matters, it might not be appropriate. However, I and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have heard the message loud and clear from Deputy Durkan and others that it must be dealt with very soon. That is only fit and proper, so we will do all we can on the issue from our end.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_934">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_935">That Dáil Éireann shall consider the Interim Report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 4th August, 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">It is a great pleasure to present the interim report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. This committee had its origins in a motion passed by the Dáil on 1 June last. It was a historic motion. While health is a matter of concern to every Member of the House, and they represent the concern of the community, I am not sure if at any stage we, as representatives of the public, have come together to decide on the best type of health system the country can have to meet the needs of the people. In many ways, our health system has developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner since the foundation of the State. We have never taken an objective view of its strengths and weaknesses and where it should go in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> The purpose of the motion agreed by the Dáil on 1 June was to recognise the fact that there are serious difficulties in the health service. Given the spend on the system, a total of €19 billion, it is certainly not providing the type of modern accessible service we should aspire to have. A big element of that is the nature of the service and the fact that it is a two-tier service which is very expensive for everybody involved, be it the 46% of people who are paying for expensive health insurance or the more than 40% of people who are public patients and are left waiting for long periods to access services. That is the backdrop. We are all conscious of the shortcomings in the health service. I believe there is a genuine shared aspiration to do something worthwhile to make our health service fit for purpose and to take the key strategic decisions which will enable us to move from the current somewhat dysfunctional two-tier health service, with all of its problems, to having a modern, accessible, single-tier health service. That is the desire of every Member of the House and it reflects the desire of the public which has expressed its views very clearly not just in the last election but also in several opinion polls over the years and through contacts with public representatives. People strongly feel that a good functioning health service is key to a modern republic. That is what we must achieve for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> That was one of the key provisions of the motion passed by the House. It sought to develop a consensus at political level on the future of the health service and the funding model, based on population health needs and the need to establish a universal, single-tier health service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than ability to pay. The motion also recognised that the best health outcomes and best value for money can be achieved by reorienting the model of care towards primary and community care, where the majority of people's health needs can be met. We determined that the Oireachtas would work to establish a ten-year plan for the health service, based on political consensus, that can deliver all of those changes to achieve a modern reformed health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> The committee was established on foot of that motion, with 14 members drawn from all parties and groups in the House. From the start there was unity of purpose among the members and a clear determination and commitment to work together as best they could to put together a strategy for a ten-year plan for the health service, recognising all of the challenges involved but also recognising the importance, once and for all, of coming together at political level, setting past political differences aside, looking at the evidence relating to best practice, identifying the problems and roadblocks to modernising the service and making it more accessible and considering in an honest and genuine way the best type of funding model that would deliver a single-tier, accessible, equitable and modern health service. I pay tribute to the 14 members of the committee. I am pleasantly surprised by the level of commitment displayed, the attendance at meetings, the work that members had to do aside from the weekly meetings in terms of reading the volumes of material the committee received and their real engagement in the complex issues involved in moving from the current system to a new and better system. I appreciate the commitment and enthusiasm of the members in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> The committee was established on 1 June and held its first meeting on 23 June. We met weekly at the end of June and through July. Initially, we sought to have private meetings at which we were given detailed briefings from some of the main players. We received very good briefings from the Department of Health and I acknowledge the full co-operation and support of the Minister and his senior officials for the work we have undertaken. We received a briefing from the HSE. We are also conscious of the huge amount of research that has been done already, the policy papers that have been drawn up and the examinations of different aspects of the health service, both at international and national levels. Indeed, we are very much of the view that this area has been researched in minute detail over many years. What we must do now is take decisions at political level and move into the implementation phase of what needs to be done to reform the health service. A vast amount of research has been done already.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">We received briefings on much of that research from the ESRI and the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Trinity College Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> We were also very conscious of the project management role that is necessary. It is not just a case of producing a report. It is about implementation. How do we ensure we deal with those cultural issues within our health service that prevent us from moving ahead, modernising and streamlining the service and making it more responsive to patients' needs? Dr. Eddie Molloy has done a lot of work in the area of implementation and we are very conscious of the work he has done in the public and private sectors. We invited him in for a briefing session, which was extremely worthwhile. He got a spontaneous round of applause at the end of his briefing, which is a first in my experience at a committee. Members were very impressed by his knowledge of this area and his stressing of the importance of cultural change and commitment to implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> That is the work we did prior to the summer and it is referred to in the interim report. We began a public consultation process in July. We issued invitations for submissions from members of the public, service users, patient groups, people working in the health service, different professional groups and so on. The closing date was the end of August. We were very encouraged by the fact that we got some 160 submissions, which were very detailed and thoughtful. We also received requests from many people to meet the committee. Those submissions are being evaluated and summarised. The secretariat of the committee is working through them preparing them for the committee and making recommendations to us on which of those groups or individuals we should invite in to make oral submissions. We have taken a number of those decisions so far. After the August break, we went straight back into weekly meetings. Two groups of individuals or service users or representative groups come in and present to us every Wednesday morning. This has been really worthwhile. It has produced a huge level of thought-provoking activity in the committee and has challenged us all possibly to revisit some set views or preconceived notions we may have had. It has challenged us to learn from the evidence presented to us and in particular to learn from best practice elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> We have identified 11 different work streams at an early stage. They involve the future vision and strategic challenges involved in what we are doing; the funding model on which a lot of work has been done by the ESRI to date; the related areas of primary care, integrated care and chronic disease management, which are key; access to care; quality and safety; resource allocation, which is emerging as a very big issue; organisational reform; workforce planning; and the key issue of implementation and monitoring. I think I am speaking for all members when I say that we are determined that when we produce our final report, it will not be just another report on the health service. An implementation plan will be part and parcel of that. I hope the current Minister and future Ministers over the next ten years will subscribe to it and take it very seriously and that it will be the programme of work for future Ministers for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> In respect of the various groups that appeared before us before the summer, which is referred to in the interim report, our priority was to ensure the voice of patients and service users was heard. There are very loud voices in health, including very loud commercial interests. In some cases, one could even talk about vested interests. Too often, they are the voices that dominate. We said from the beginning that this is about serving the patient and that we were determined to put the patient front and centre of all that we do. That was the reason why our first public hearing involved the Health Reform Alliance which represented a number of different groups of service user representative bodies and which made an excellent presentation to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> We have been meeting every Wednesday with groups since then. There is no doubt that to date, very common themes have been coming through. There is an extraordinary level of agreement across the board regardless of whether it involves service users, patient groups, professionals working in the area or researchers. There is a significant amount of agreement. I will very briefly run through those areas. They are the importance of the patient voice, inequality of access and the fact that we have a two-tier system, the geographical lottery that applies because of the unequal distribution of resources, moving from the hospital-centric model we have currently to putting far greater emphasis on health and social care within the community, the traditional under-resourcing of primary care where there are huge gaps not only in GP services and practice nurses but in other critical allied professionals who do such an important job at community and primary care level, access to diagnostics for GPs in particular where there is a sense that they are locked into a system where diagnostics are only available in hospitals, the lack of direct access for GPs and the logjams that creates, the question of multiple morbidities and ensuring that the next contract for GPs recognises the important role of chronic disease management - key to that is recognising the fact most people with chronic illnesses have multiple chronic illnesses and the need for a model of care that addresses to be reflected in the contract, staff shortages and the recruitment and retention of staff across the board which is a major challenge with morale emerging as a key issue because people do not feel valued in the service, and organisational structures which is an issue that is emerging as a significant problem relating to the organisation of hospital groups and the fact that we have six hospital groups and nine community health organisations that are not aligned and the difficulty that causes in terms of integration.</p>

There is excellent ongoing work and there is huge potential for political consensus in producing our report in the coming months. I pay tribute to the exceptional work done by staff supporting the committee in its work.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_949">When I spoke in the Dáil on 1 June last about the Government motion to set up the all-party committee, I said that I regarded this as one of the key health initiatives of the new Oireachtas. Four months on, I am even more convinced of the need for a long-term consensus on the direction of health policy. We can make, and I contend that we are making, improvements to our health system but the task that faces us is one that requires substantial and sustainable efforts underpinned by a long-term common purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> At the outset, I acknowledge the work being carried cut by the committee. It is so encouraging to hear the positive update, in particular the leadership role taken by Deputy Shortall both in the establishment of the committee and now as its Chair. I am genuinely excited about this project. I think we are on the verge of potentially achieving something really lasting in terms of our health service. Much work is already underway, as set out by Deputy Shortall and as set out in the interim report. I understand and am pleased to hear that there has been a large response to the committee's call for submissions. I have had the opportunity to read a number of submissions that have been sent directly to me and to meet with a number of groups that made submissions. The volume of submissions does say something about the huge level of interest in this fundamental societal issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_951"> The committee has set itself a very ambitious work programme. This includes work packages on the funding model, integrated care, resource allocation, access to care, primary care, chronic disease management, organisational reform and workforce planning, among others. I appreciate the breadth of this agenda and I do not think anyone in this House underestimates the challenging agenda that the committee has taken on. I reiterate my pledge to continue to support and assist the work of the committee in any way I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The central objective of the new Government, as reflected in the programme for a partnership Government, is to use the strengthening economy to make life better for the Irish people. As Minister for Health, that means improving the public services that people depend on and that really matter to families and communities across the country. We all know that the health service faces many challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> Moreover, the programme acknowledges that we now have an ageing population which, thankfully, is living longer and whose needs will become greater and more diverse. As well as an ageing population, we also have the highest birth rate in Europe. Most immediately, there are problems for patients trying to access services, whether from emergency departments or waiting lists, severe pressures on very dedicated staff and increasing demand and pressure on resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> As citizens, all of us at some point in our lives will need to access health services. Therefore, we all have a common interest in finding a common way forward for improving and developing our health services. During debates of this nature, it is important to note that the health service has been changing and it would be only right to acknowledge where improvements have happened. For example, life expectancy in Ireland has increased by 2.5 years since 2004, to a place where it is now above the EU average. </p>
          <p eId="para_955"> There has been a decrease in the average length of stay in our hospitals and significant progress in reducing tobacco consumption. Progress has been made in many health areas and it is important to recognise that progress, along with recognising those who work so hard at the front line. I spent the summer visiting hospitals and other local health care facilities around the country and I was again struck by the many positive things that are happening but are rarely seen. The television programme "Keeping Ireland Alive" has gone some way to shine a light on the real story of health services in Ireland. It is a remarkable combination of skill, professionalism and care, often in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. </p>
          <p eId="para_956"> There are long-standing challenges that need to be addressed. Deputy Shortall outlined some of them. They include health inequalities and the geographical lottery. The Government and Oireachtas are clear in their objectives. We are committed to a goal of universal health care and working with others in the Oireachtas, in particular the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, to achieve the single tier health service that best suits Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_957"> The phrase "best suits Ireland" is key. We need to take account of the Irish context. In the past, we have considered the idea of lifting a model from another country. We do not need to do that do that. Rather, we need to do what is best for Ireland. While we can examine how others do things, we cannot simply transplant something that works somewhere else to here, nor does the health system in any country operate in isolation from the rest of society. Housing, education and employment are major parts of the universal health care equation. Therefore, this requires a whole-of-Government "health in all policies" approach and this is echoed in the healthy Ireland framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> The committee has been established to allow us to reach consensus on an overarching vision and fundamental principles for the health system. There are three significant areas that need to be examined in this regard, all of which have been identified by the committee in its work programme. They are: the model of care; universal health coverage; and the funding model. Before we consider the financial implications of health care or how we manage it, we should first consider what kind of care we should provide and what the best model of care for the future is. </p>
          <p eId="para_959"> We can, and should, all support the need for a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care and the effective delivery of primary care in every community. The more intervention we can have for patients at the earliest possible stage and as close to home as possible, the more likely there will be a better outcome for patients. To do this, it will be necessary to build up GP capacity to respond to patients' needs and to expand chronic disease management in general practice. GPs want to do more and are able to do more but they need to be empowered to do so. That has to be the purpose of the GP contract negotiation due to begin this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> We need to continue to embed social care and mental health and disability services within the community where appropriate and to support people to live as independently as possible. My view was echoed by the Chairman of the committee. There is a disconnect between the acute and the community and it is causing a problem. In terms of delayed discharges, there is a focus on acute hospitals and what we are doing about the pressures in them. Often, the solution lies in the community but a person in an acute hospital does not have the levers to release the solution in the community. That lack of integration is causing a real problem and adding to our delayed discharges in a very real sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> The campaign of prevention and health promotion also needs to be continued and stepped up. I do not wish to be the Minister for ill; I am the Minister for Health. We all acknowledge that better integration across our health service is key to achieving a better patient experience, improving health outcomes and unlocking efficiencies within the system. In developing models of person-centred, co-ordinated care, we can draw on the work of national clinical programmes, in particular the piloted integrated care programmes. </p>
          <p eId="para_962"> Through the work of the committee, I hope we will be able to clearly articulate our desired model of care, the implications of moving towards it and how it can be achieved. I agree that we do not need a report to sit on a shelf. Rather, we need a model that we can get on with actually implementing. </p>
          <p eId="para_963"> The second area I have referred to relates to universal health care. As an overall goal to improve our health services, universal health care involves four main objectives, as set out by the World Health Organization, namely reducing unmet health needs, reducing inequalities in access to health goods and services, improving service quality and improving financial protection, which means patients must not face catastrophic or impoverishing levels of spending as a result of seeking health care. The WHO notes that no country fully achieves all the universal health coverage objectives for 100% of the population, 100% of the services available and 100% of the cost without waiting lists. However, it believes that every country can improve efficiency, reduce waste and increase value from its health spend. This is especially true in Ireland, where we know there are many challenges across the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> The Government is committed to a health service where all people can access the health services they need in an integrated and timely way, of sufficient quality to be effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose them to personal financial hardship. Among the key building blocks for universal health care that are currently being advanced are the following important initiatives: the strengthening of primary care and improved management of chronic diseases; the creation of hospital groups and community health care organisations; implementing Healthy Ireland; the introduction of more efficient payment systems such as activity-based funding; the introduction of a wide-ranging package of patient safety reforms, which is a very important agenda; strengthening the ICT capacity within our health service; and the maintenance of a vibrant and sustainable health insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> Work is progressing on these various reforms. As well as representing major building blocks for universal health care, they comprise important initiatives in their own right with the potential to drive performance improvement and deliver significant benefits in terms of timely access to high-quality care.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> In striving for the optimal single-tier health service for Ireland, there are inevitable policy trade-offs to be confronted. These trade-offs often involve tensions between efficiency and equity or between comprehensiveness and cost control. In all countries, not only Ireland, the trade-offs centre on three basic dimensions of the health service which must be confronted when designing a health service. These are the proportion of the population to be covered, the range of services to be covered and the proportion of the total costs to be met. Through the committee, I hope we will be able to more clearly define our ambitions for universal health care and the means by which it can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> One of most important features of any country’s health service is how it is funded, in terms of the amount of money required and the manner in which it is financed. These are difficult questions to answer and will clearly be central to the deliberations of the committee. Making changes to funding levels and financing methods takes time and requires careful management, not least to avoid disruption to vital existing services. That is one reason it is important to take a long-term view, such as a ten-year plan, of how the health service can be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> I am not making major structural reforms in this area while the committee does its work, as we have to be serious about building consensus on how to fund a shared vision of universal health care. As a new Minister, my first step was to put the health service on a sustainable financial footing through an additional €500 million in funding. I have also met the HSE and all hospital group CEOs to stress that I want to see results for patients and management controls to stay within budget. This additional funding allowed new commitments to be delivered, such as an additional €40 million for home help services and €31 million for people with disabilities, restoration of the ring-fenced mental health budget and funding for the recently-launched winter initiative to address emergency department overcrowding.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> While the committee deliberates on some long-term issues, life goes on and so does the health service. We have pressing challenges we must continue to work towards. My focus is on delivering practical, achievable improvements for patients and meeting key programme for Government commitments. The Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath, Corcoran Kennedy, Catherine Byrne and McEntee and I have been putting in place a number of initiatives designed to create further improvements for our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> I was glad to be able to launch an initial waiting list action plan this year and began reactivation of the NTPF with the endoscopy initiative 2016 to treat an extra 3,000 people, and reduce waiting lists and times in this area. I have confirmed plans to deliver more than 10,000 medical cards for children with disabilities whose parents are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance. The HSE published details of the winter initiative 2016-2017 which will increase the availability of community care, facilitate timely discharge from hospital and increase hospital capacity using an integrated care approach. I am especially pleased that we can do something under this plan to reduce waiting lists for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis patients. </p>
          <p eId="para_971"> The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is establishing the task force on personalised budgets to empower people with disabilities to live independent lives. We have to move away from the unaccountable block grant system of delivering our disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The Minister of State with responsibility for mental heath and older people, Deputy Helen McEntee, has established the national task force on youth mental health to improve the mental health and well-being of children and young people in Ireland. Crucially, the national patient safety office will be established in my Department this year. We are also co-operating and co-ordinating with other Departments to deliver key health commitments. A recent example is the Health Innovation Hub Ireland which I launched earlier this week in Cork and which is the first national innovation hub in the area of health in this State. It is a key element of the action plan for jobs 2016 and the programme for Government as well as being good for our health services. The action plan on housing and homelessness includes additional healthcare support services for people who are homeless, enhanced in-reach primary care services and additional funding to support the voluntary and community sector to make sure we are putting in place those wrap-around services that people who have been homeless need when they are housed. The Minister of State with responsibility for communities and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has launched a public consultation on the new national drugs strategy which will be action based and published in January. Last week, the Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, and I launched A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025 which announced the intention to establish a healthy Ireland fund to allow for further joined-up working between Government Departments. Obesity is a ticking time bomb with regard to the health and well-being of our people. There is much more to do. However, these are important improvements already under way on which we can and must build.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> Establishing the Committee on the Future of Healthcare was one of the first programme for Government commitments to be actioned and was one of the first motions before the House. I am very grateful to Members on all sides of the House who worked with me to allow the committee to be established without delay. It is important too that the process does not just create another report to go on the shelf - to echo the words of Deputy Shortall - but that it does actually lead to something tangible that we can all get behind, regardless of future governments or future election outcomes. Universal health care is not just something to implement, it is a direction and a journey. Ultimately, how far and how fast we proceed in the direction of universal health care is a question of choices and how we make them. In this regard, I look forward to the committee’s findings and recommendations, and the evidence on which these are based. The work of the committee will mean that members of the public, patients and those working in the health services can have a sense of certainty that there is a long-term strategy and vision agreed by political consensus, and I hope a societal consensus, about our direction of travel for a universal health service that will not change no matter what the make-up of the next Dáil. This is, I believe, an essential element that has been missing in reform efforts up to now and I look forward to working with people on this. We now have an unprecedented opportunity to achieve something that has never been achieved before in Irish health policy, namely, a long-term political consensus on fundamental guiding principles. As a nation, when we have set our mind to it, we have achieved great things such as the peace process and meeting economic challenges through the decades. We now need to decide, collectively, to work together to achieve that consensus and to meet that challenge in health. As Minister I will do my very best to work with all Members to make that consensus real.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Harty<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_974">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the interim report on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. Deputy Shortall referred to the work of the committee and I also want to compliment the members of the committee. We have had a very positive debate at each weekly session on how we should go about changing our health service. I am a great believer that being in the right place at the right time is far more important than all the policy background decisions that one can make. We are in the right place at the right time. There is now an understanding of how we should move towards a universal, single-tier health service where people get care based not on their ability to pay but on their need. Putting the patient first should be kept on our minds whenever we are speaking about this because it is a health service for the patient and we should wrap the service around the patient, rather than the patient trying to accommodate to the health service. That is the way the service is currently going; it is an <i>ad hoc</i> service which tends to be self perpetuating. Many parts of our health service are working very well. We all tend to be critical of our health service when we see the accident and emergency trolley count and the waiting lists. The problem is getting in to the service. Once a person gets into it, the service works very well. It should be acknowledged that many parts of our health service work very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> Rather than looking horizontally, we need to look vertically down on our health service in a bird's eye view to see what is happening, why is a patient in one place when they should be elsewhere or why is a particular system not working. Looking at it vertically rather than horizontally we should be able to see where the problems, the roadblocks and the challenges are. We have a great opportunity to drive change.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> With regard to the political input into health care, as the Minister said at the committee this morning, there needs to be a political input into the policy of health care, but once the policy is devised - we hope we will have a ten-year policy - then it should be taken out of the hurly burly of political change such as the change of Government or the change of Minister. The plan should be there and it should be implemented irrespective of who is in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> Time after time, the theme that comes though from each witness to the committee is the need to transfer from secondary care to primary and community care, particularly for chronic disease management. Secondary care should be a specialised service for complex and acute medicine. It should not be there to look after the day-to-day illnesses that people develop which should be looked after in primary care. We can keep people out of hospital if primary care is properly resourced. Once people go in to hospital the meter starts ticking. It is a hugely expensive way of looking after people. Coupled with resourcing of primary care we need also to integrate primary care with secondary care. Resourcing primary care on its own is no good as there has to be integration between it and secondary care. There needs to be a streaming of patients into secondary care in a constructive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> It is unfortunate that our accident and emergency departments are a catch-all for everything. Trauma, addiction, alcohol overdose and all the social problems that occur in our society end up in the accident and emergency department. Patients should be streamed away from the accident and emergency departments and into medical or surgical assessment units or to addiction or psychiatric services and the accident and emergency service could be kept for what it is meant to be. We need to integrate our services. Last week the committee spoke about integrated local care committees where GPs, consultants, management, nurses and all the various elements that go into supplying our services sit down as equals around a table and thrash out the problems. There should be no inequality in how we plan our service. That would be true integration of our services. I am a little worried about the community health organisations. They are coming from the top down and they have not been explained properly. We are worried that they may not be the answer to the integration of services; it should come from the bottom up with local integrated care committees. The role of community health service is that we want keep the majority of people in their homes. It is not just about GP services. Public health nurses, community intervention teams and all the other elements need to be bolstered within primary care to keep people out of hospital. This would allow hospitals to look after complex and acute cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> We need to challenge existing work practices within general practice and in hospital services. There are work practices which, if they were streamlined and integrated with primary care, would act much more efficiently. It is important that the committee starts in the right direction. If we head off in the wrong direction we are going to be in serious trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> While activity based funding is important we need to move to a model of outcome based funding. Rewarding lots of activity which may not be productive is not the way to go about it. We should reward productive activity. The committee has also spoken about the inverse-care law where people who need health services most get them least and those who need them least get them most. In deprived rural or urban areas the services are not available to match the need while in affluent areas there are more doctors and GPs. I am not saying that those people do not also require health services but they are probably less in need of them than people in more deprived areas. We must consider how we populate our general practice and our health services in general with regard to supplying for the need rather than for the numbers of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">In general terms, there are a number of things we need to do to improve our health service. One of them is the recruitment and retention of staff such as GPs, nurses and senior and junior hospital doctors. We need to create a health service that attracts these people and keeps them in Ireland. We are producing fantastic health professionals but we are letting them leak away because they have trained in a service they do not like, is overburdened with work and offers no job satisfaction. They are leaving. We need to change that and to address it very quickly. We need to increase our bed capacity and to utilise our beds better. As the Minister suggested, delayed discharges are a problem. Shorter bed stays and people not being in hospital at all by being looked after in the community instead are solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> We need to increase access to diagnostics, which has been a very common theme in the debate. Diagnostics in hospitals tend to operate between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week. We need availability to ultrasound scanning, CT scanning and MRI scanning seven days a week. It makes no sense that the diagnostic services close down on a Friday evening at 5 p.m. We need to bolster our diagnostics because it keeps people out of hospital. If we can diagnose a problem without sending people to a hospital service, we keep them away from the hospital and only send them if it is necessary. </p>
          <p eId="para_983"> As I said earlier, we need to alter our work practices. That is crucial in the integration of primary and secondary care. We need to streamline our practices in order that unnecessary work and duplication of work are not undertaken. Integration of primary and secondary care with nurses, primary care teams, community intervention teams, adequate home help hours and home care packages is crucial in taking people out of hospital and preventing delayed discharges.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> HSE management is difficult to understand at times. It is convoluted, complicated, disjointed, opaque and difficult. We in the medical profession see decisions and cannot understand why they have been taken. The reason we cannot understand them is that we have not been involved in the process of making those decisions. Integrated community teams will get over that and iron out problems before they develop. </p>
          <p eId="para_985"> We need to develop and improve IT, which was referred to again yesterday. We also need to improve communication. We need to have access to patients' records in the cloud, as I referred to it this morning, in order that the GP, the hospital consultant, the junior doctor and the public health nurse, while taking data protection into account, can access a patient's record and maybe prevent unnecessary admissions to hospital and unnecessary access to diagnostics. Communication is the key on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> This is a wonderful committee and when the report comes out in January, I hope it will be revolutionary in changing our health service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_987">I wish to start by thanking Deputy Shortall for proposing this committee. It was a good idea and the fact that it was embraced by people from all parties very quickly is a testament to that. Nonetheless, it did take someone to start the conversation. On behalf of myself and my party, I thank Deputy Shortall.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> I wish to reiterate what I said only a few short months ago on the establishment of this committee. Sinn Féin is committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation for the Irish State. However, as it was then, it still is now, my grave concern with this process is that the report, the recommendations, the expert opinion, potential models and stakeholder engagement will be discarded if it is seen to run contrary to the Minister’s agenda for health, as stated in the programme for Government. Can the Minister advise on whether this is going to be a worthwhile exercise? I hope that we are not tying members, stakeholders, academics and others into a process that will have a few days airing in the Dáil but ultimately end up being consigned to a library.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> I note the Minister's comments on primary care being a building block and I would not disagree with him on that. While we are discussing the importance of primary care and the need to focus on it after having hearings about it, the bricks and mortar are going into primary care but the staff are not. The Minister, I am sure, will be aware that Sinn Féin has repeatedly questioned his Department and the HSE on this and they keep coming back with the same answer as to the number of additional staff that are going to be supplied for the primary care centres. It is a nice easy figure to remember: it is a nice big round zero every time. That is not good enough and does not fill me with hope that the report of this committee will be adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> Yesterday, our committee continued its hearings as part of our work plan and work stream. We were fortunate to have taken part in a video conference with Professor Allyson Pollock, who is an expert on universal single-tier health systems and who could draw on the experience of the NHS to point us in the direction that we should take our health system. One of the most striking points that she touched on was on the issue of hospital trusts, the various experiences in England, in particular, and how the establishment of these trusts may actually be detrimental to the establishment of a universal single-tier health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> In that regard, I was struck by how her comments and warnings on these trusts needed to be heeded in terms of the programme for Government. To refresh Deputies' memories, some of the pertinent parts from the programme for Government document in this regard are: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_992">We will advance progress made on Hospital Groups before strengthening their capacity to be stand-alone statutory Trusts. Hospital Trusts will gain greater autonomy (own their own assets, manage recruitment) while also ensuring accountability... Hospital Groups/Trusts will be required to develop strategic plans to re-organise services within their group of hospitals... We will provide for the temporary transfer of management of hospitals to another provider where there are consistently poor outcomes, patient experiences and financial management... Service providers who fail to meet their targets, and who do not fully engage with the new Unit will be obliged to use their own budgets to ensure targets are met with the assistance of private sector providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> The Minister is smiling because he knows exactly what is coming next.</p>

          <p eId="para_995">Re-reading this after our meeting yesterday really set the alarm bells going in my head. In 1990 in Britain, the direct management of health services by health authorities was ended and replaced with purchasers and providers, turning hospitals into trusts with borrowing powers, their own finance, human resources and public relations departments. Good luck with that if the Government tries it here. Professor Pollock noted in her contribution that since the duty of the Secretary of State for Health to secure and provide comprehensive health care was removed, the rate of privatisation and closure of NHS services has been accelerating. This cannot be allowed to happen here. This is not how we build a foundation for a universal single-tier health care. It will do nothing only undermine it. Handing over control of our hospitals and services to stand-alone hospital trusts is a highly inefficient way of delivering health care and has the danger of introducing new costs that are not experienced in public systems. Performance, it is noted, will be key in these new trusts but the level to which this relates to quality of care leaves a lot to be desired. With all the programme for Government talk of financial management and private sector providers, these trusts are at risk of becoming wrapped up in looking at income and finances rather than integrating with health services, health outcomes, prevention and primary care. These trusts will essentially have the power to generate income privately and, as a result, may choose to use their beds, staff, capacity and resources solely for that purpose. They can feasibly enter into ventures with corporations, sell land and buildings and lease them back. What will be created from these programme for Government proposals is a substantial redesign of the health services towards the private sector - a health service franchise opportunity, more or less. Universal health care does not sit comfortably with the creation of these trusts and the long-term reliance on the private sector to address health inefficiencies. We cannot create a situation where the use of these services does not mean increased patient choice but rather increased choice of patient. In research undertaken by Graham Kirkwood and Allyson Pollock on private provision inequalities in Scotland, it was found that use of the private sector in Scotland was associated with a decrease in direct and in-area NHS provision and may have contributed to an increase in age-related and socio-economic inequalities. Instead, the claim made by NHS Scotland's 2003 white paper that the additional use of the private sector would provide sustainable local solutions to long waits, which might sound familiar to some people here, is not supported by the evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">On the contrary, the level of local provision by NHS boards decreased, while boards which made the greatest use of the private sector for elective surgery experienced the largest reductions in direct NHS provision. It will not be necessary, therefore, to reinvent the wheel in this area. </p>
          <p eId="para_997"> In this State previous waiting list initiatives and injections of cash to the system had a localised or short-term effect but failed to challenge structural inequality. This cannot be allowed to continue. We cannot continue to use the private sector indefinitely to alleviate pressure on waiting lists as this is neither a permanent nor credible solution. The Minister has stated previously that we need sustained investment in waiting list initiatives. The solution to the crisis in public health care is investment in the public system. The Minister seems to believe the National Treatment Purchase Fund is the solution to this deepening problem. Outsourcing is not a long-term solution to the problem and privatising more health care services will simply not work, as the research to which I referred proves.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> The real solution to the crisis lies in the recruitment and retention of staff and the reopening of beds closed in hospitals by successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael-led Governments. Investment in the public health service is needed, not only to provide more resources and capacity but also to directly challenge and eliminate structural inequalities. Building adequate capacity across the health system and eliminating unequal barriers to access will require significant and sustained public investment. The private sector will not do this because it is not interested and does not have the capacity to do so. If we rely on the private sector to fix the problems in the health service, we will be on a hiding to nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> It is important to be clear in our deliberations that authoring a blueprint for a ten-year vision for health care and delivering a universal health care system is not just a question of funding but also one of political will and determination. Irrespective of the good will and hard work of the committee and what it may produce collectively or separately, the co-operation and backing of the Minister and the Government will be required. I do not mean that members should be given a pat on the back or a star in their copy books for their efforts but for a significant political buy-in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> The committee is fortunate to have high calibre delegates appearing before it. If the Minister and the Government proceed with their plans while the work of the committee is in its infancy, this will be a futile exercise. For my part, I would like to take on board the counsel of the committee's delegates when producing our recommendations and I sincerely hope they will form part of the Government’s plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> There are very large swathes of the programme for Government to which I cannot sign up. I do not know how anyone could sign up to it, but that is the Government's business. I will not sign up to an agenda for privatisation, whether it be an outright process or takes place through the backdoor. Privatisation is completely at odds with the realisation of a universal health care system. If he is serious about the committee coming together to work collectively on a vision for the health service, the Minister must clarify that any move to privatise the health service in the form of the programme for Government plans must be shelved. The committee cannot gain legitimacy and respect or develop a comprehensive programme of work if it is precluded from doing its work by the Minister and the Government pursuing contrary plans.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1002">I thank Deputy Róisín Shortall for proposing the establishment of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. This is the first time I have been involved in a committee that has collectively tried to grasp the complex nature of the health service. Finding out about its various parts and the way in which it operates is like going into a minefield. At recent meetings of the committee I have been struck by the number of professionals and researchers who espouse the principles of universal health care, including access to services based on need, free care at the point of delivery and equal access to care for all. This is the message the committee has heard from the Irish College of General Practitioners, nurses and others. We will see how the position develops in this regard when we meet other professionals in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> Members have also been struck by the need to use general practitioners in primary and community care services to reduce pressure on hospitals. Many patients should not be in hospitals which should provide surgery, chronic care services and so forth. If care was provided in the community and services were configured correctly, the health service would be transformed. While general practitioners are up for such a change, as the committee heard, 33% of GPs are aged over 55 years - the figure for County Mayo is 55% - which means that a swathe of general practitioners will retire during the lifetime of the future ten-year plan. This puts the spotlight on the crucial need to address the issue of GP training and retention. We must put in place a policy that will take account of geography, deprivation and so forth and encourages and inspires GPs to stay in the country and play a role in the health service. This will require us to think outside the box. We must ensure the doctors we train are not grabbed by other countries because their training is so good and they conduct themselves so professionally. This is a strategic issue that the committee will have to address and it may mean, for example, waiving education fees for general practitioners who stay in the country for 15 years after graduation and buy into the system. </p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> The Irish College of General Practitioners emphasised the need to use electronic medical records. This will be crucial if we are to achieve an integrated health service with information flowing between hospital consultants, general practitioners, practice nurses, physiotherapists and other health professionals. </p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> The Minister will be aware of the special task force set up in the Carlow-Kilkenny area which has been working very successfully with a local hospital. The committee was informed that four or five years ago diabetes patients referred to the hospital for checks had to wait for months. The task force worked with the chief executive of the hospital and others to reduce waiting times. As a result, diabetes patients are now seen within two weeks of being referred to a hospital consultant by a general practitioner. The system has been transformed in four years because hospital consultants have worked closely with local GPs and agencies. The team meets regularly to discuss how to overcome problems. The committee will need to investigate how this approach can be extended to other areas. Hospitals and GPs need to engage with the Carlow-Kilkenny model. Sometimes, however, people protect what they have and do not want to move out of their boxes. This approach will mean that everyone will win if it is done right. Patients will win, which is crucial, as will general practitioners because they will assume responsibility for the overall health of their patients. </p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> Most GPs know their patients from birth and are familiar with their background, their parents and their health history, including their mental health. They also know how active their patients are and have a great deal of knowledge that can be joined up if a patient develops a chronic disease. This is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> According to Professor Allyson Pollock, the committee must base its work on evidence. Deputy Louise O'Reilly made a point about trust. Professor Pollock pointed out that British hospitals spent 16% of their income on servicing debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">A further 3% is spent on public relations and a certain amount more will go on staff in the hospitals who work to raise money to pay back the debt. It is a waste of money but that is where it goes. I agree 100% with Deputy Louise O'Reilly that we should be moving away from that trust model. The programme for Government should consider slowing down the process in regard to the proposals from the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> The key thing Professor Pollock said was that it has to be underpinned by legislation. In the UK in 2012, following two decades of market incrementalism, the British Government abolished the universal public model by removing the duty on the Secretary of State to provide key health services throughout England. From that point on, there has been a crisis in the hospitals. In England, 75% of foundation trusts are in serious financial deficit. In contrast, no hospital in Scotland is going to the wall because the latter did not implement this and kept hospitals under the health boards. The key point Professor Pollock made was that national health service legislation has to be introduced by any country that seriously wants to drive a universal health model. That Bill will have to be brought through the Dáil and enacted first, not last, so there is a commitment from the Parliament that the necessary legislation will be in place. It is the first step in the ten-year plan. This also came up with GPs in regard to their contract, namely, there has to be legislation in regard to that contract in order to solidify the services they provide. Although I could say more, I will conclude on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_1010">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Normally, when we have had health debates in this Chamber over the years, by and large, they have been partisan and contentious and were often used for political point-scoring. Deep down, however, everybody would still have strong views on health and the health services available to the people. Therefore, while people are partisan and politically motivated, it is a fact that health comes into play for every citizen at some stage in his or her life and he or she will come into contact with the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> Traditionally, people would have expressed varying views on how we fund the health care system. It has evolved over many years and no political party can say that we have the ideal health system or that we will get to it in a short period. The establishment of this committee will give us an opportunity to remove the partisan approach that is very often taken to health debates in the House and allow us to come up with a substantial document that can reflect a real advance in how we see our health care strategy developing in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> Of course, while we talk about a ten-year strategy, with the best will in the world, and even with a lot of resources, it will take us a long time to get to where we would like to be in terms of capital investment and increasing the number GPs, allied health professionals and clinicians. Therefore, it is not just about developing a strategy but about underpinning it with real resources in the coming years. I would instance the issues of training, education and expanding capacity to ensure we have enough clinicians to do the work and underpin the strategy as it evolves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> The motion that established the committee stated we are talking about a universal health care model. Of course, when we talk about universal health care, we have to define what that is, which is difficult. What does the term "universal" mean? Will everybody be entitled to everything? What will be free and how will it be funded? The universal concept would suggest that this would be the case but if one looks at most countries that have tried the universal model, very quickly there is some form of rationing or there are delays in the process, the service is underfunded and under-resourced and waiting lists increase. While universality is the concept, unfortunately, the position with regard to delivery is very different. We will have to be honest in terms of the type of system we want and how we commit resources to it and fund it. Will the system be funded out of general taxation with a direct subvention every year to whatever health agency will be running it? Even the most affluent countries in the world that have moved towards universality, such as France, have found it exceptionally difficult to consistently fund the health services to the standard they would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> Regardless of whether we like it, almost every country in the world rations health care. Decisions are made that mean some people have to wait or are unable to access all forms of health care. This morning, the Oireachtas health committee discussed medicines and the high-tech drugs coming on stream. In that context, there is now a pharmacoeconomics unit that effectively assesses the impact medicines will have on the longevity of an individual patient and makes a decision on whether that person should receive the relevant medication. While receiving the medication could extend a person's life, decisions are sometimes made that do not allow the medicine to be made available to an individual. That is a severe form of rationing of health care to individuals who will die if they cannot access certain forms of medication. That is the extreme but we ration health care on a daily basis. It is a tragic reality of living in a world where we do not have enough resources to fund the health care system we would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> The committee will report at some stage. I hope it will take a broad view of where we would like to go in terms of a universal health care system. A difficulty will then arise as to how we fund it and how much it will cost. As a country, Ireland is quite good at developing policy and already has quite a body of health care policy. Our difficulty is ensuring that we follow through. Whatever comes out of the committee's final report, if the recommendations are accepted by Government and the wider Parliament, some implementation body should be put in place to monitor the ability of whatever Government is in office to move towards that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> The committee has outlined 12 work streams, some of which will clearly be more important in terms of how the patient will experience health care in the years ahead. To take primary care, we have a very fine document, the primary care strategy, in respect of which there is broad buy-in regarding what we need to do to ensure that the vast majority of health care is provided in the least complex areas, at the lowest cost and in a way that is most beneficial to the patient. We all accept that. However, we have not moved the budgets and resources accordingly since the primary care strategy was conceived in order to ensure that primary care has the capacity to do what was intended under the policy. A major shift in resources is required but also a change in mindset at governance level in the HSE and the Department of Health to ensure that acute hospitals are not always front-loaded with funding while we starve primary care. This inevitably feeds the cycle of patients ending up in the acute hospital system because primary care cannot cater for them. Primary care, integrated care and chronic disease management are critical components in moving to a system where primary care has the capacity to deal with many of the issues in the community setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> Some of the evidence we heard in the presentations today was very interesting. Much of it is not novel thinking; it is just very logical thinking in terms of how we deliver care. One area where I would like to get advice and a view from the Minister is in regard to the hospital groups and hospital trusts. The Minister said he does not want to take any more decisions on structural changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">How far down the road are we going in terms of hospital groups and the establishment of hospital groups? Are we now moving to a situation whereby we will establish hospital trusts? During the committee discussions hospital trusts have not come to the fore in terms of something that is needed. They should be established immediately. Are we to delay the commitment on the roll-out of hospital trusts in order that we do not have to pare back on something that has just been established? I urge the Minister to examine the matter and to ensure we do go down the wrong road in the view of the committee. If we had to reverse engines in a short time it could create difficulties in terms of the final recommendations of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> We should take the ideological element out of the discussion on health but I worry that might not be possible because some people refer to private health care as unable to provide the service that is needed. To be honest, much primary care is provided privately. GPs are not employed directly by the State. That is an issue that must be examined. In negotiating contracts we must bear in mind chronic disease management, community care, social care and the demographic changes that will happen in the near future. All of those issues must be taken into account. While the unions are negotiating on the GP contract it is important that the Irish College of General Practitioners should examine the contract negotiations from a clinical perspective. I urge the Minister to take note of the point. I raised the issue with the college last week and its spokespersons were of the view that they should have some say in the matter also. The motivation from the union's perspective will be to try to achieve the best outcome for members, although I accept that the patients will be foremost in their mind. That said, there could be slight conflicts of interest in terms of what is good for the patient versus what is good for the doctor. The Irish College of General Practitioners should have at least an oversight role in terms of the broad clinical issues that might arise out of the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> I compliment and congratulate Deputy Shortall for the part she played in having the committee established by the Dáil. I acknowledge the work that has been done by the staff. It is clear that the committee is a significant undertaking and it might take a little longer than we anticipated. However, we have a deadline and we are determined to meet it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1021">The establishment of this committee was most definitely a positive development and I too commend Deputy Róisín Shortall on her initiative. The terms of reference rightly recognised the severe pressure on the health service and the need to establish a universal single-tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay, something my colleagues and I in Sinn Féin have long been calling for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> While I welcome the fact that the work of the committee to date is before the Dáil, this particular interim report lacks substance and content. That said, I understand that many of the engagements and dialogue with the various stakeholders have yet to take place. However, with the budget looming, this provides us with an opportunity to focus on a number of issues which need to be addressed as part of the committee’s work and indeed, as part of the Government’s budget for 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> On Tuesday, I, as Sinn Féin spokesperson on disability rights, launched our disabilities document as part of our alternative budget 2017 entitled, Rights, Respect and Inclusion. The fact that this document was launched on the first day of the Dáil’s resumption reflects the importance we place on the issue of disability rights. Disability is a societal issue, affecting people of all ages and their families, directly and indirectly. We want to see a society in which all citizens, including those with disabilities, can play a full and independent part in all aspects of life, relying, as far as possible, on mainstream services for health, education and employment but with the support of tailored disability services where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> As part of our alternative budget for 2017 we would invest an additional €54.812 million in the prioritisation of disability services. That would employ 600 additional front-line staff, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. We would provide 500,000 additional personal assistance hours. We would invest in neuro-rehabilitation teams and transitional services and would provide an increase of 20% in respite care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> We have also provided €19 million to ensure that all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance would be automatically entitled to a medical card. We would address the high cost of prescription charges and medicines by investing €56 million. The overwhelming body of evidence shows that charges for drugs can lead to higher costs on the health budget in the medium to longer term, not to mention the serious strain and ill effects they can have on the health of many who need medications. Prescription charges for medical card holders were originally introduced under a Fianna Fáil-led Government and were subsequently increased by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, despite pre-election promises to reverse them. Specifically, we would reduce prescription charges by €1 per prescription and lower the drug payment scheme monthly limit from €144 to €132.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> Those are all costed, credible, necessary and most important, achievable measures that would have a significant, positive impact on the lives of so many, including those living with a disability in Ireland. For too long the most vulnerable in society have been used as easy targets with cut after cut imposed on them. That must not be allowed to happen again. The measures I have outlined are only the tip of the iceberg. Sinn Féin has long been committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care, accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery, and funded by progressive taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> Back in June, and on the establishment of the committee, I said that I hoped the committee would not simply provide a talking shop but rather would be a gathering of people with ideas, vision, and most important, solutions, to bring about the changes that are so desperately required in the health system today. That hope still stands. I wish all involved the best of luck with their work in the time ahead and I look forward to the final report in the coming months, and not too much beyond that because, as Deputy Kelleher suggested, the report might take longer to produce. Ádh mór ar an obair iontach agus tábhachtach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1029">I probably will not need all of the time. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue. Like other speakers, at the outset I compliment the Trojan work done to date by our chairperson, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who has gone far beyond the call of duty to the committee. It is a pleasure to work with her and to see the work that is being done by every member of the committee. It is refreshing for somebody like me, as a new Deputy, to be involved with 14 people working together, all with the same objective, to produce what will, I hope, be a revolutionary change to the way we provide a health care system. Deputy Ó Caoláin mentioned the possibility of the committee being a talking shop, but that will not be the case. It will take political consensus to see the work through and to deliver on the recommendations of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> As other speakers have alluded to, the primary care element of the health system is critical and getting that right will play a huge part in the future of health care provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">We have had many contributions to date from people involved in primary care, and it is becoming increasingly clear to me, and I hope to all the members of the committee, that if we get primary health care sorted out, get our doctors, practice nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, counsellors and so on working and funded, the pressure that will take off the system further up the line will result in our hospitals and accident and emergency departments being able to function properly and general elective surgeries and so forth working. There is also the need for proper step-down facilities to look after people who are well enough to be taken out of hospital but not well enough to go home. A combined strategy on those fronts will result in a much better health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> Regarding the funding of such and where we get it, many models and possibilities are discussed. There is talk about Canadian models, the UK model, the NHS system and the Scottish model and so on. We must look at the Irish model because no one health system in one country will suit another country. There was mention yesterday in our presentation of the Canadian model, which is basically a public health system which is free to all and in which each citizen is treated equally. A person's public health card allows for treatment in every hospital regardless of income or background. That is a fantastic system and certainly something that we should strive to achieve. However, on looking into the Canadian system further, such elements as prescriptions, dental care, home care and physiotherapy care are not free. I imagine that if we tried to adopt that type of model in Ireland, took away the medical card from people and told everybody they had to pay for their prescriptions, it just would not work. There is a need therefore to develop a model that is specific to Irish needs. We have the ability and the wherewithal to deliver a health care system that suits and will work in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> There is constant criticism about morale in our health system and our hospitals. We must reflect that many people in the health system do very good work, and sometimes that needs to be recognised. I will share my own experience a few weeks ago. My mother is elderly. I finished visiting her at the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry at 2.30 p.m. on a Sunday, and by 6 o'clock she was diagnosed, in a bed and being looked after. She is now home, healthy and improving. Things like that happen every day, and that must be recognised in order that people working under extreme duress see the fruits of their hard work. I have no problem saying in the House that people who do such good work need to be recognised and thanked for it. It is up to us to provide the system and the funding that works for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> The establishment of the hospital groups is something we need to look at very carefully. It seems like it might be something that could work. However, there seems to be no onus on the individual hospitals to work together. For example, in University Hospital Kerry, there is one geriatrician doing outstanding work. There are 13 geriatricians in Cork University Maternity Hospital. That does not balance up. Cork University Maternity Hospital, University Hospital Kerry, South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, Mallow General Hospital and hospitals in Waterford are all part of the one group. I do not think a geriatrician in Cork can be told that he or she needs to go to Kerry and assist with the lack of services there. We have to deal with that. We have to establish contracts with our consultants and doctors that make sure every part of our geographical spread is covered properly. Part of this work needs to ensure we take control and get proper cover and care in all parts of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> I look forward to the next three or four months. It is an immense workload. I hope we can get our work done in the timeframe allotted to us. It is certainly our ambition to do so. Nothing focuses the mind better than a deadline. I hope that when we report - I think our full report is due to be published before Christmas - we will get the consensus and the buy-in because difficult decisions will have to be made if we are to buy into this. Every politician in here will have to make some difficult decisions. I hope we are up for it. The committee on which we are working certainly is. I believe we will produce a report that can transform health care in this country. It is up to the rest of us to row in behind it and support it. From this time forward, I hope we can look back at this as the start of the time when we got our health services straightened out in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#MickBarry" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1036">I am a member of the committee. We have heard a range of very valuable and interesting witnesses. I will talk in this session about a key witness from whom we heard this week, namely, Professor Allyson Pollock, the professor of public health research and policy and the director of the global public health unit at Queen Mary University of London. The committee asked Professor Pollock to make some observations on the direction in which health care is being taken in this State. Specifically, we asked her about the provision in the programme for Government for the establishment of hospital groups, the formation of trusts and the ability of trusts to raise private finance and to contract in. She felt that was very reminiscent of the US health care model and of the privatisation measures that have been introduced in the UK since the early 1990s. She felt the experience in the UK in particular has completely discredited those ideas and has left hospitals and hospital groups with major debts. Some 75% of trusts in the UK are now in debt and 15% of their income is now allocated to servicing debt over the next 30 to 60 years. In fact, the majority of private finance initiatives have been forced to do a U-turn and go back in house again to get the best services. Another major problem was that the top priority for those groups became income generation rather than health care provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> She made a very sharp observation which I want to read into the record of this House. She said, in respect of a single-tier health care system, "It is important to note that no country in the world has delivered [a] universal [single-tier] health care [system] through the market, for-profit provision or private insurance." That is a particularly important quote. I want to read into the record of the House another quote from Professor Pollock, "My understanding is that given the committee's commitment to articulating a vision for a universal single-tier health service, [a national health service] Bill for Ireland is the essential first step in a ten-year plan."</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">The reason she said it was a first step was that moving towards it slowly over a period of five or ten years would give time and space to powerful vested interests to campaign against it and to wreck it. Therefore she recommended a Bill for an Irish national health service as a first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> She suggested that such a Bill should include placing responsibility on the Minister to deliver universal single-tier health care and should name the services that would be provided by the State in a basket that could be added to over a period of time, funded by general taxation which, she remarked, the World Health Organization had stated is the best way to fund such a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> The role of private health insurance came up in that discussion. She made an interesting observation that in the UK less than 10% of the population availed of private health service insurance because of its National Health Service, NHS. There is not a need such as we have in this country where 44% of the population avails of private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> She raised interesting points about developments in the health service in Canada where private health insurance has effectively been banned. She felt there was a powerful case for that because it diverts resources from the public health service. In this State, for example, 20% of beds are private, diverting services in terms of not just beds, but also staff from the public system. That could not be done without providing a proper public system on the basis of a national health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> Interesting points came up, not just from Professor Pollock, about the funding for such a model. While in some ways extra funding would be needed, in other ways huge savings could be made. For example, private health care is more expensive than public health care because of administration, invoicing etc. In the US between 30% and 50% of costs are down to administration whereas in the UK under the old NHS model, that was 5% to 6%. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that a national health service would mean a massive increase in funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> In some ways Professor Pollock's contribution yesterday has raised very sharp questions for members of the committee. Opinions will need to be formed and decisions made in the not too distant future as to whether there is agreement on the idea that we need an Irish national health service and a Bill to introduce it as the immediate first step. I am convinced of that argument. I have long been a supporter of that argument. The committee will now need to address that issue as part of its deliberations in coming weeks.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2016-09-29T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1044">This debate, the committee's deliberations and more importantly coming out with a real strategy and plan to deliver a health service that works for all our citizens could not be more critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> One has to put a human face on these things. I know everyone has cases and people they have to deal with. I have tabled several parliamentary questions over the case of a young man, Mark O'Brien, and indeed his father, William O'Brien. I believe he was on national radio recently describing his situation. This is a young man with a very rare disease and as a result has strokes constantly. He is very severely debilitated by this condition. It is acknowledged that he has a need and he is looking for home care hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> When we send the parliamentary questions to the Minister, we get the reply that the budget for home-care hours is at capacity; that is it. He has a desperate need. Mark's father, who is much older and also has a very bad heart condition, and his wife have to travel on a train when their health is not up to it from Shankill to Dún Laoghaire to look after their son. As Melisa in my office said when William, the father, is going to see his son Mark because he does not have the home care and he comes into our office to plead with us to try to get these home-care hours, he is completely out of breath because he has a bad heart and lung condition himself and indeed probably needs somebody to look after him rather than have to go and look after his son, but the budget is at capacity and that is it. They are actively seeking money. This is just not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> When hearing these debates and the different categories of issues in the health service one's head can get fried and one can get drawn into thinking, "Well, I'm not an expert; I don't really know. It's all very complicated. How do we solve this? It's going to take a long time. There are so many different things to balance."</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> What Professor Allyson Pollock said is absolutely fantastic. She said that we have to start from basic principles. If the basic principles are right, everything else will fall into place. She said it starts here in this Parliament passing legislation to the effect that we will set up a national health service and the health services will be delivered on the basis of need and not on the basis of budgets or money and trying to balance private interests against the public system and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> In preparing my interventions on the health debate over the past five years, I have been lucky enough to have a doctor, who happens to be a member of our party, giving me advice. I would always be looking for the complex stuff from him and saying is it not really much more complicated. He says no, it is really simple; we just need a national health system. There has to be a commitment for that. It needs to be provided for free and delivered on the basis of need. If that principle is established and that is legislated for, everything else will follow. In the long term it will save money or certainly will not cost more. There may be more upfront costs to get this established, but it will actually work out cheaper.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> In her comments Professor Allyson Pollock, a very eminent person, underlined all the points we have been making in the past five or six years. She explained it in simple and clear terms. She said, "no country in the world has delivered a universal single-tier health care system through the market, for-profit provision or private insurance." No country in the world is capable of delivering it and yet we still cling on to that system. She went on to explain why:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1051">That is because it is in the nature of markets to operate through selection and exclusion. They transfer risks and costs back to service users and inevitably deny care to those who need it most. Risk selection and exclusion is built into the design of market bureaucracies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">She went on to cite the US system as the worst example of this where health expenditure represents 8% of GDP - much more than countries that have a national health service model such as the UK. The US spends much more than any other country but it denies one in five of its population access to health care. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1053">Overtreatment and denial of care, healthcare fraud, catastrophic costs and spiralling health expenditure are [features of the] US healthcare [system] ... more marketisation, higher administration and transaction costs, the greatest inequalities in access and health outcomes, [a] lack of coverage and the highest out-of-pocket payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">All of these could be comments about our two-tier system. We have €3 billion in out-of-pocket payments because of user charges in accident and emergency departments and prescription charges. Some €2 billion of Irish health expenditure, which is one of the highest, goes to the private health insurance companies. We have all the unnecessary billing, all the administration, all the advertising and all the profit taking. It is all waste and money that should be going into the national health system. If we adopt the principle and legislate for it, all of those resources can be diverted into delivering the public health system that we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I agree with the emphasis being placed on primary care, integrated care services and so on, but let us not allow this to be the reason we do not provide more resources in hospitals. The reality is that acute hospital bed numbers per head of population here are way below the European average. Building up primary care services should not happen at the expense of investment in the provision of staff, beds and resources in hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> My final point is on the wider question of capacity if the two-tier system were to be changed to a single tier system. I have previously made the point that all over Ireland there are private health care facilities that are empty or unused while there are people on lengthy waiting lists or waiting on trolleys in public hospitals. If we were to nationalise these facilities and makes them part of a single tier, publicly controlled universal system, we would have the capacity, beds, staff and resources to deliver the type of health service people need and want.</p>

          <p eId="para_1057">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the interim report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. The work of the committee, with cross-party agreement, has the ability to make a lasting impact on the future health care needs of citizens. There is little doubt that Ireland needs a concrete long-term plan for the delivery of health services. Notwithstanding this, it is important to acknowledge the hardworking staff who contribute greatly on a daily basis to the delivery of front-line services. Much of what is said about health services is negative, but it is important to acknowledge the fantastic work being done. To do justice to all those staff and the people, we must approach our planning and funding of health services in a manner that is cohesive and based on sound principles. A solid plan and a commitment to change will result in the delivery of a health service of which we can all be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> Universal health care is an overarching goal of health systems across the globe. Developing a pathway towards universal health care is a key element of A Programme for a Partnership Government and the Government is fully committed to it. The committee's work will define what we mean by universal health care in the Irish context and provide a roadmap to achieve it. This, of course, includes the funding model that will underpin it. There is an onus on us all to engage constructively with this process and use the opportunity to demonstrate that cross-party consensus is most definitely achievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> When people are ill, all they want is easy access to medical professionals who can treat and provide them with the health outcomes they desperately need. Access to the delivery of these services is the key difficulty that many patients face. The committee has prioritised this issue in its work schedule, which I welcome. We recognise that the current model of high volume hospital-based treatment is unsustainable and costly. This is not the future of health care for Ireland. It is internationally recognised that access to safe, timely care as close as possible to a patient's home is the most effective treatment plan for patients. Accessing appropriate treatment should cause the least disruption as possible to the individual's daily life and the lives of his or her family. This is particularly important for vulnerable persons such as those with mental health issues or the elderly and ageing population. While addressing patients' needs in the community has a myriad of advantages for the patient, it also aims to reduce the cost of delivering care in the longer term. Driving this initiative to have a positive impact must be a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> I am pleased that the committee is consulting widely with national experts and interested parties from within and outside the health care system. What we are discussing is its interim report. It has yet to meet a huge volume of experts and interested parties. I am also pleased that it is reaching out to experts from other countries to ensure a comprehensive search for the best solution for health care in Ireland. Like many colleagues, I too, listened to Professor Allyson Pollock from the University of London who spoke to the committee about her experiences. She rightly stated no one model was perfect. I am sure we all agree with her. We need to build a model that has a real fit with what Ireland needs for universal health care and be prepared to review and amend it when we have not made changes for the better. That is why a ten year term for the model is so important for the future. It is important to note that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has postponed putting the hospital groups on a legislative footing until such time as the committee has completed its work. The Minister has done this out of respect for it as obviously none of these changes can happen until they have been discussed in committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> While the work of the committee is progressing, it is important that the Government make improvements to services where it can. The Minister has already outlined a range of initiatives which we have been able to advance since the new Government took office. These are aimed at delivering immediate improvements for patients and implementing various actions included in the programme for Government. In my area additional funding of €40 million has been provided this year for home care services. I agree with Deputies that that level of investment is not enough, but as the economy improves, so too will our ability to improve on that figure. I hope that following the work of the committee, we will see great progress in that regard. I have established a national task force on youth mental health to improve the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people. These are two important steps in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> The work of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare has the potential to create an historic new consensus and long-term vision for health care and health policy. I look forward to the conclusion of the committee's work and urge all Members of the House to engage in a constructive and positive manner. I wish the committee well in its work. I also wish Deputy Róisín Shortall well in her work as Chairman of the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_1063">I welcome the contributions of all speakers to the debate. It is refreshing and encouraging to have a health debate which is focused not on health problems but solutions. That is a real step forward and it is the general approach that has underpinned the committee's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> We talked about a number of common themes. One of the most surprising things we have learned through the work of the committee is that there is common ground not only among members of the committee but also among all groups, individuals, researchers and so on. That is the basis on which we hope to build the consensus we are all seeking. </p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> One of the most common themes is the integration of services. In other words, there is a need to integrate primary and community care services with acute hospital services to ensure a shift of focus and activity away from acute hospitals where it is most expensive to the community. That, in the main, is what patients want. They want to receive services locally. We know that approximately 80% of health needs can be met in the community within primary care services. That is where patients are happiest and we get the best health outcomes. It is also where we get best value for money; therefore, it makes sense on many fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> The fact that we have a two-tier health system greatly militates against the critical integration required. The concern is that this or a future Government might move to pursue a policy of developing hospital groups into trusts as this would further disintegrate the health service. We would be foolish not to learn from the experience in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions where elements of the health service have been hived off on the grounds that greater efficiencies and value for money will be achieved in privatised models or independent trusts. We know that where this has been tried it has not been the experience and that taking this approach has generally worked out to be more expensive. We would be foolish not to heed that experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> Another issue about which I am concerned in what is being proposed is the organisational structures of the HSE and current hospital groups. Leaving aside the issue of whether hospital groups should develop into trusts, that we have six hospital groups and nine community health organisations that are not aligned does not seem to make any organisational sense. It militates against the objective of having good integration of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">How can we measure activity and outcomes in geographic areas if we cannot define the area and state this is how much is being spent on the hospital sector and this is what we need to transfer to the community and primary care sector? Let us measure this transfer of resources and better value and outcomes. It is very hard to do this if the hospital and community health organisations are not aligned. Nobody wants to engage in further churn in the health services, because constant change is what has done a lot of damage and caused such huge uncertainty and lack of morale in recent years but, at the same time, we must pose the difficult question on whether it makes sense to go ahead with the type of very disjointed, disconnected and disintegrated organisational structure that is being put in place at present. This certainly needs to be addressed if we are to move to a situation where we can profile areas and their level of need, and match resources and services to this need and ensure we get best value for money by having strict data collection and measurement of outcomes. It is hard to see how this can be done in the existing proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> A point we have picked up in recent days in particular is the importance of legislation to underpin eligibility. This has been the problem with the health service. The Department for Social Protection has clear legal eligibility criteria for various payments, but in health we do not have clarity on eligibility. We must legislate for this. The point has been made to us very clearly that if we start with the legislation and establish people's eligibility, identifying the exact services for which they are eligible, by and large the rest will follow. If there is a legal entitlement to eligibility for certain services those services must be put in place. This cannot be done overnight of course, much and all as we would like to see it being done very quickly, because it is a very big ship which needs to be turned around. This is why we speak about a ten year perspective. This cannot be an excuse for delaying reform. We need to put in place the building blocks and make the reform happen as quickly as possible. This is our responsibility to the people we represent, and we would be failing in our duty not to avail of this historic opportunity we all have.</p>
