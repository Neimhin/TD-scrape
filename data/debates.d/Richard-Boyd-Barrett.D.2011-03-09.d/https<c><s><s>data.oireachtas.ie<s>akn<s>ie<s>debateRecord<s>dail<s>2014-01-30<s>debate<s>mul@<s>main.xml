          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> EirGrid’s Grid25 national transmission grid development programme is vital for future socio-economic progress in Ireland, for regional development throughout Ireland, and to ensure that current and future generations of consumers have access to more reliable, sustainable and affordable energy. Grid25 represents an investment in the electricity transmission system of around €3.2 billion in the coming 15 to 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> During the course of engagement by EirGrid in the recent public consultation processes, and most recently on the Grid Link project on which 35,000 submissions were received, a number of key concerns emerged. This has necessitated considerable review and reflection to determine the optimum approach needed to address those concerns that are valid, while at the same time ensuring adequate and effective transmission capacity in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> Arising from examination of the concerns expressed, I have proposed a number of measures to deal with the immediate concerns on the Grid West and Grid Link projects, while also addressing the generality of commentary on the need to improve stakeholder and community engagement on all Grid25 projects for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> I have appointed an independent panel of experts, to be chaired by the Honourable Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness. The panel of experts will decide the terms of reference for comprehensive route-specific studies of fully underground and overhead options for the Grid Link and the Grid West projects. The panel will be required to ensure the process for taking forward the Grid Link and Grid West projects accords with the highest standards of integrity. They will also be asked to ensure the studies are complete, impartial, objective and comparable and will report to me on these matters in due course. The overhead and underground options will be published side by side, in objective and comparable terms, before consideration is given to the appropriate next steps for each of the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> EirGrid will be required to undertake the two studies, as determined by the independent panel of experts, which will take account of,<i> inter alia</i>, environmental and visual amenity impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The independent panel will have power to commission additional work if there is any perceived deficiency in the studies presented.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> Additionally, I will ask the chairperson of EirGrid to undertake a comprehensive assessment, with a view to improving EirGrid’s community engagement processes and procedures, having regard to the significant public concerns raised on this issue. I believe EirGrid will respond to the demands of meaningful and extensive public consultation and will take account of lessons learned from the most recent consultation process in addition to consideration of the Government policy statement of July 2012 on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure. A package of community gain measures to address issues of visual impact and property devaluation for overhead options of grid projects are being developed in close discussion with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will also engage expert assistance to review and report on international developments since 2007 on any potential health effects of electromagnetic fields emanating from transmission grid infrastructure. In 2007, an expert group established by the then Minister with responsibility for energy published a report on health effects of electromagnetic fields. The forthcoming review will bring this 2007 report up to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> The situation is different regarding the North-South transmission line for several reasons. The reality is that planning for this project has been under way for the past ten years. A planning application has already been submitted for the part of the project in Northern Ireland and that planning process is in train.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I thank the Minister. EirGrid's Grid25 project is exercising minds in a raft of the countryside where it is proposed to go ahead. Is the North-South interconnector covered under the jurisdiction of Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness? Will it be part of her considerations? There are conflicting reports from various political parties and I would like it clarified. For completeness, we called for an independent international review prior to Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">Many of the people who have contacted me and the groups that I have spoken to have expressed health issues as their main concern. If there is to be any completeness or confidence in the debate the health issues must be to the fore. I would like the Minister to clarify the current position on the North-South transmission line.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">I shall respond to the second question first. There is no question of the health issue not being included in the panel. Rather it is a matter that relates to the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Responsibility for any concerns in respect of electromagnetic fields or non-ionising radiation is a matter for him also. As I said in my formal statement, he is arranging for expert advice to bring the 2007 report up to date. It is not a question, as has been said, of having nobody on the expert panel with a medical or scientific background in the area. That matter is the jurisdiction of another Minister and the memorandum that I brought to Government requires him to do so and to bring it up to speed. He will do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> As regards the North-South issue, it might be best if I state my few formal words that coincidently happen to address Deputy Moynihan's other question. Detailed studies have already been conducted for the North-South project, most recently by the independent international commission of experts appointed in July 2011, arising from a commitment in the programme for Government. A route-specific underground analysis was conducted by PB Power which found that the cost of undergrounding would significantly exceed the cost of the more usual overhead cables. The PB Power analysis was considered and confirmed by the independent commission who estimated that the cost of undergrounding would be at least three times that of overhead cables.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The North-South transmission line is a critical and strategically urgent transmission reinforcement and is of critical importance in the broader North-South context. This is because as well as reinforcing the grid in the north east region of the State, the transmission line will be a vital link in maintaining the security of electricity supply for Northern Ireland into the future. I recognise, however, that the public would be reassured if it knew that the overhead and underground options for the North-South have both been investigated and that the already published studies are sufficient to enable a similar comparison to be made by An Bord Pleanála when they come to decide on the merits of the planning application.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> I shall give a specific answer to Deputy Moynihan's question. Tomorrow I shall meet the chairperson of the expert review panel, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, to discuss the work programme for the panel. I will ask her to consider what work, if any, the panel might usefully undertake to establish whether or not there has been parity of treatment between the North-South transmission line project, in terms of the work undertaken to date, and the very issues that the expert review panel will examine regarding Grid Link and Grid West into the future.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_19">As the Minister will know, many communities are extremely concerned about the huge pylon infrastructure. Their concerns are all very well-grounded in terms of its huge effect on the environment, fears for their health and its impact on people's daily lives. Is the Minister concerned that many of these groups are unconvinced by the commission that he has established? They view it as a way of getting the issue past the local and European elections that will be a huge point of protest and pressure on the Government. Is he aware that people are concerned that EirGrid, which is driving the project, shall play a key role in the investigation and, therefore, will be seen to have an undue influence on the outcome?</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The committee shall comprise five members and the Minister has included two noted professors. One of them is noted for a report published some years ago that championed privatisation and public sector cuts of an extreme nature. The second professor has pushed for stealth taxes, property taxes and water taxes to be imposed on householders and other taxpayers for many years. I put it to the Minister that the ideological neo-liberal bent of the two individuals will not give confidence that the report, or the views that influence the report, will be anything except what is driven by the interests of the establishment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_21">I entirely accept - as I have on dozens of occasions - that it is imperative that EirGrid is sensitive to the concerns raised by community groups and citizens. I have gone to great pains to ensure that the views and concerns, not just of groups that I have met but citizens generally, are taken into account and assessed in terms of how EirGrid and the Government ought to respond. I also accept that some people are never happy unless they are unhappy and I do not agree with the Deputy's claim that there have been concerns expressed about the probity of the exercise now under way. The steps that I have put in place to deal with the issues - highlighted in the public consultation - will be supervised or overseen by a panel of distinguished experts and chaired by a former Supreme Court judge. I do not and have not heard anybody who believes that a panel of that eminence - established to oversee the integrity of the process - can be questioned in terms of it independent or competence to see that the steps taken are fair, objective, impartial, comprehensive and comparable. I am absolutely satisfied about that and I am indebted to those people for giving their time to supervise or oversee the implementation of measures that are particularly and specifically designed to respond to the concerns raised during the public consultation. </p>

            <p eId="para_22">I thank the Minister but I must call Deputies Moynihan and Higgins. Deputy Moynihan shall be first. </p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_23">With regard to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government having jurisdiction of another aspect of the project regarding health, the project itself and the concerns of the communities, the two Departments should be on song and completely together. With regard the statement that was issued on Tuesday, it should have been announced that one Department was commissioning the report and the other Department was parallel with it, and not that they will do something.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> The concerns that people have about health, the visual impact and destruction of their communities are well founded. Since the project was announced it has generated a large amount of fear. At this late stage the two Departments should say that they shall take the project and do it as one and not say that one Department may update the 2007 report or whatever. That information gives more cause for concern within communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">There is no question about the eminence, independence or competence of the Minister's panel. That was not the point that I made. I made the point that there are two formidable personalities on the panel who are driven by right-wing neo-liberal philosophies. That is bound to have an effect on the outcome in regard to the balance between ordinary people and the needs of the establishment and, in this case, costs. Does the Minister accept that undergrounding, at an extra cost, is worth the prize considering the fact that it will have much less effect on the environment and there are less concerns regarding people's health? It is demeaning to communities and individuals that have expressed their concerns about this huge pylon project for the Minister to describe them as being never happy unless they are unhappy. These people are faced with the prospect of having pylons placed beside them which will be 45 m in height and with cables carrying 400,000 volts of electricity giving rise to serious concerns about the effect of electromagnetic fields on health, particularly children's health.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">These are all very serious concerns so people have a right to be unhappy, to express that unhappiness and to try to get the situation changed.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I most emphatically did not refer to the people expressing concerns as being in the category to which Deputy Higgins refers when I said there are some people who are never happy unless they are unhappy. I was referring to Deputy Higgins and people who think like him who dismiss out of hand the fact a measure has been born out of the public consultation process and is designed to respond to the concerns of citizens and who engage in allegations about the supposed right wing ideology of two members of the panel. For the life of me, I cannot see what their supposed ideology or philosophy has got to do with this. The question is whether they are eminent citizens of probity who will ensure the process is conducted with integrity and that it is fair, authoritative, objective and complete. This expert panel, chaired by former Supreme Court Justice Mrs. Catherine McGuinness, is not charged with making recommendations to me about what should or should not be done about the build out of necessary grid in Ireland. It is charged with the responsibility to ensure the studies we are doing in response to the public consultation are carried out in a proper fashion and that they can be relied on in terms of the professional competence, authority and fairness of the reports. I am not putting in an expert panel to replace a State agency or anything like that. I am putting in a panel to ensure that what is done is done in accordance with best practice and proper principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> On Deputy Moynihan's question, I agree with him that it is imperative there is co-ordination and co-operation between two Departments that have different responsibilities and that is happening. I assure him of that. However, I cannot take over the function of another Minister. If, say, there was a taxation element to this, I would have to deal with the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance. I cannot take over the responsibility that is reposed in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I can assure Deputy Moynihan that there is optimum co-operation between the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and myself on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">In January of 2013, the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Edward Davey MP, and I signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation. That memorandum sent a strong signal of our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green energy from Ireland to Britain and will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding, work is progressing with a view to entering an intergovernmental agreement with the UK in 2014. Regarding the development of the intergovernmental agreement, significant work streams are ongoing in the areas of project management, the intergovernmental agreement itself, European Union liaison, communications and stakeholder management, economic analysis, policy on renewables export and grid issues, regulation, legislation, and land and planning. The work that is being done by my officials on the development of the intergovernmental agreement with the UK is separate and distinct from the work being done by EirGrid on the development of the domestic electricity grid, a point that continues to be confused, sometimes deliberately, I suspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> With regard to the development of the proposed export project, it is important to note that this must await the completion of an intergovernmental agreement, the putting in place of a renewable energy export policy and development framework, and the obtaining of planning permission for project proposals, subject to environmental impact assessment as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> From an Irish perspective the potential benefits being examined include jobs created, community gain, interconnection benefits, corporation tax receipts and rates paid to local authorities. A full cost-benefit analysis is ongoing to determine if it is mutually beneficial for Ireland and the United Kingdom to enter an intergovernmental agreement in the coming months to facilitate trade in renewable energy. The amount of energy to be procured by the UK and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any intergovernmental agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">I am as wise as before I asked the question and I think the people who are listening are as wise as they were before I asked the question. I see companies buying and leasing land, and paying a good deal of money for it, obviously in the knowledge that whatever about changes to planning guidelines or permissions, those companies are going to make money from generating electricity that will be exported to Britain. There is a fundamental aspect here. The Minister said this work is separate from EirGrid and that people seem to be confused and that, sometimes, it may be deliberate. Is it not true that the transmission lines for the export of energy to Britain are not capable of being connected to the Irish grid and that they will never be used to supply electricity to Irish people, even as a standby?</p>

            <p eId="para_38">It certainly cannot be the case that, on the one hand, we are building out and improving the grid, which has no relationship to the wind export project about which people are complaining, and on the other hand that the transmission system for the wind export project can never be connected to the Irish grid. It is one or the other. I say again, for the umpteenth time, that if there is not an intergovernmental agreement and unless the economics stack up for both countries, as with any trade agreement, there will not be a wind export project. The wind export project being worked on is dependent on an intergovernmental agreement and on the economics working out to the benefit of both countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">The fundamental problem is that we simply do not have a national strategy for energy in Ireland, and in the absence of a good national strategy, we have companies who are setting the agenda. I find it extraordinary that after three years of discussions in respect of the memorandum of understanding, the Minister cannot quantify what the benefits will be to this country. I am aware he has said that we will have reached our renewable energy targets by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">I do not believe we reached them in 2011 and 2012. I understand that in December the Commissioner waved a yellow card at us, and that we could be fined €20,000 per day because of our failure to reach targets. I do not know if that is true but it was certainly reported. I would like the Minister's comments on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The fundamental problem is that we do not have a strategy. The companies are doing the running and setting the agenda, and we will pay for it either financially or in terms of lost opportunities. We will be exporting green energy that we need ourselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">We do not need it ourselves. If there was a question of domestic need, that would come first. We have capacity to generate more than what we need domestically. If we can find a market in which to sell the excess, why should we not open a new trade sector in green energy?</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> The process has not been under way for three years. I said in my formal reply that the memorandum was signed last January. I set out in my answer some of the very complex issues that must be resolved. There is no surprise at all that an intergovernmental agreement would take this kind of time. It is important that I, as guarantor for the Irish people, ensure there is a benefit for the Exchequer and State; otherwise there will not be an agreement. If I were rushing into an agreement, Deputy Colreavy would be accusing me of being hasty.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> There is a national strategy in place but Deputy Colreavy fails to acknowledge that, as is his entitlement. I will be publishing a Green Paper on energy policy within the next six weeks or so and perhaps he and I can make a fresh start with that paper. I look forward to his input.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> It is not reconcilable to allege we are improving grid transmission to accommodate the wind export project to Britain and, on the other hand, question whether we will ever be able to connect the wind export project technology to the domestic Irish grid. People must decide which side they are coming down on.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">EirGrid is the transmission system operator, TSO, for the electricity transmission system in Ireland. The functions of the TSO are set out in SI 445 of 2000 and include the operation of a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system with a view to ensuring that all reasonable demands for electricity are met, having due regard for the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> The conventional generation required to support variable renewable energy such as wind energy is covered in All-Island Generation Capacity Statement 2013-2022, published by EirGrid and the Northern Ireland transmission system operator, SONI, in 2013. The capacity statement examines the expected electricity demand and level of generation capacity forecast to be available over a ten-year period. This analysis and forecasting allow EirGrid and SONI to establish the outlook for generation adequacy in Ireland and Northern Ireland over the timeframe. Based on analysis of factors such as increasing levels of renewables and changes in the conventional generation portfolio, the statement forecasts that Ireland’s generation adequacy outlook is positive for each of the next ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> It is important to note that the cost of subsidising renewable generation varies throughout the European Union. The additional costs of renewable generation in Ireland are marginal. The European Commission estimated only last week that renewable energy added less than 1% to retail energy prices in Ireland. This compares very favourably with figures for other member states as well as the average increase of 6% in retail energy prices across Europe. I remind the Deputy in the context of recent discussion on the urgency of the construction of the Meath–Tyrone transmission line that such costs, along with costs called constraint costs, will be further reduced when that link with Northern Ireland becomes operational.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_55"> EU policy is to encourage greater integration and interconnectivity between member states. EirGrid has the statutory responsibility to explore and develop opportunities for interconnection of the Irish transmission system with other systems. Enhanced security of supply, increased competitiveness, and the ability to integrate greater quantities of variable renewable generation resources are some of the potential benefits of further interconnection between the transmission grids of Ireland, Great Britain and mainland Europe. I understand from EirGrid that a number of studies are exploring different aspects of the feasibility of additional interconnection and these will feed into any decisions on future interconnection investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">Given the considerable emphasis on wind energy and the talk about expanding wind energy capacity, is EirGrid or the Government concerned that we could become over-reliant on wind energy such that there would not be enough electricity in the system during crucial periods of high demand if there were insufficient wind at the time?</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> On the subject of the proposed wind energy farms in the midlands that are to export electricity to the United Kingdom, will all the energy be taken underground to the point where it is to go under the sea?</p>

            <p eId="para_58">The Deputy raised a very complex, technical question that I have struggled with for quite some time in an effort to understand. It essentially concerns the capacity of the system to accommodate renewables generally, and wind energy in particular. The transmission system operator, EirGrid, is very highly regarded not only in Ireland, but also internationally in terms of its technical competence in dealing with this issue. The Deputy is correct that when the wind does not blow or blow adequately, backup is needed. This is when additional costs are incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Only last week, the paper produced by the European Union estimated that the marginal cost in Ireland is 1%, as I stated in my formal reply. In some other countries, it is as high as 13.5%. If my memory serves me correctly – one should not hold me to this without checking – there was a day last year on which 50% of our domestic need was met by wind energy. This is very high by comparison with the figures for any other European country. A process called the DS3 process is in train to examine future capacity in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> If the wind export project to Britain gets under way, the cable from the midlands to the point where it goes under the sea will be underground because the technology will be distinct, separate and different.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">That basic point is fundamental to the issue of EirGrid. If we are capable of running an underground cable from the midlands to the point at which it goes under the sea for export, why can we not run cables underground for the internal supply? I refer to the North-South and east-west interconnectors, which are part of the Grid25 programme. If cables can be run underground for the purpose of exportation, it should be done internally also.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">It is not a question of technical capacity only. Undergrounding is possible but it is much more expensive. Deputy Colreavy's party leader said yesterday that the norm internationally is to put cables underground. The international norm is that 1.5% of transmission cables are underground, including in economies that are far wealthier than ours.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">While the issue is cost, there also can be technical questions. In the case mentioned by the Deputy of the North-South interconnector, technical questions exist that have always concerned EirGrid and engineers because unlike southern Munster, the North-South project entails meshing two different systems and even if there never was an issue with money, the engineers have technical concerns as to what technology should be used. However, on Deputy Moynihan's main point as to whether it is possible nowadays to run a DC cable, the answer is "Yes" but there are related questions and a huge difference in cost.</p>

If this leads to comprehensive policy on energy, I will work enthusiastically with the Minister on it and I look forward to it greatly. The European Union surprised me and many observers by deciding to scale back on the renewable energy targets for 2020. It would be instructive to probe into the reasons this decision was made but I do not have access to that information. Will such scaling back on the renewable energy targets by the European Union have an impact on our strategy, when we have one, in respect of renewable energy here? In particular, I refer to the matter on which Members have just spoken, namely, the outworking of the memorandum of understanding regarding the export of green energy to Britain.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">In the first instance, it is important to state the paper published by the European Union last week does not in any way scale back on the 2020 targets. The 2020 targets remain extant across Europe and Ireland is still required to meet its target of 40% of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020. Anything the European Union announced last week in respect of events post 2020 does not in any way affect the targets for 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The European Commission published a package of documents last week, which includes a communication setting out its ambitions for a 2030 energy and climate framework. The Commission’s proposals include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below the 1990 level, an EU-wide binding target for renewable energy of at least 27%, renewed ambitions for energy efficiency policies, a new governance system and a set of new indicators to ensure a competitive and secure energy system. It is not the case that the EU will reduce renewable energy targets post 2020, as suggested by the Deputy. On the contrary, the Commission's communication builds on the framework agreed for 2020, which set a target of 20% of energy in the EU to come from renewable sources. Considerable analysis of the Commission’s proposals is now required by all member states to ensure the framework allows for action that is cost-effective and does not place a disproportionate burden on EU energy consumers. Additionally, the Commission will be working closely with member states to ensure that each member state develops and implements a national plan for competitive, secure and sustainable energy. These plans will require each member state to set out how it will contribute to achieving the EU binding target for renewable energy of at least 27%.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The Government's overriding energy policy objective is to ensure secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies for the economy and society. Renewable energy has a critical role to play in achieving this objective. The sector provides a real and sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland both in terms of further developing a sustainable, indigenous source of energy and, potentially, as a clean export.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_70"> The Government remains fully committed to delivery of the target of 16% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020. It continues to make progress across all three areas and particularly in electricity, where Ireland has set its own target of 40% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2020. In 2012, 19.6% of electricity demand was met by renewable generation. It is critical that every effort is maintained if we are to reach the 16% target for 2020, as it would provide the solid foundation on which to build in order to reach the 2030 objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, approximately 3,000 MW of new generation, the bulk of which is renewable, has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> With regard to the question of the impact on the grid of further renewable energy development, expert technical analysis clearly shows the need for reinforcement and upgrading of the high voltage transmission network to ensure secure, reliable power supplies for all to underpin economic development and to realise the potential of Ireland's clean indigenous, sustainable renewable energy resources. However, as I have stated many times previously, the concerns of local communities must be at the heart of infrastructure development. Early, ongoing and transparent communication is critical if vital energy infrastructure is to be delivered and to ensure these benefits are realised for all citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I am sure the Minister was going to get to the point regarding the question I asked, namely, will this have an impact on the outworking of the memorandum of understanding between ourselves and Britain? I am sure that were I a negotiator on the British side, I would be seeking to ascertain what will happen here after 2020 and how this might have an impact on the cost and financial arrangements in connection with that memorandum of understanding. A huge programme of work is envisaged with regard to turbines and pylons all over the place, which is causing a great deal of public disquiet. Yet, the principles underlying this appear to be that post 2020, the negotiations will be different following this announcement from the European Union. What impact does the Minister believe it will have on the aforementioned negotiations and on the potential benefits to be gained by both Ireland and Britain? Have those potential benefits been changed following the European Union announcement?</p>

            <p eId="para_74">One of these days, Deputy Colreavy must tell me where he stands on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. If we are to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and if we are to move towards decarbonisation of the electricity system, we must then reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and must use more renewable sources. I repeat for the tenth time this morning, that the improvement to the grid has nothing to do with whether there is an export project to Britain because, as I indicated in the last exchange with Deputy Moynihan, it is a separate technology underground to plug into the British grid and so on. The reason the grid is being strengthened in Ireland, on the advice of the expert State agency with responsibility for the delivery of an infrastructure fit for purpose, is to maintain economic progress in Ireland, to disperse employment to the regions and to ensure we have a system that is capable of doing precisely what I stated at the outset, that is, to reduce Ireland's dependence on fossil fuels, which cost us €6 billion per annum to import, as we are net importers. It also is to ensure that Ireland had a transmission system that is capable of exploiting a highly valuable renewable indigenous resource we happen to have in plenty here and this is what the Government is seeking to do in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I wholeheartedly endorse the Government's intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is a project I wish to see work and the reason I ask these questions, put forward proposals and am constantly talking about the need for a national strategy is precisely because I wish to see this work. However, when I see proposals for 2,500 turbines, the energy from which is to go elsewhere, I must be sure the Irish people will get considerable payback on that. I repeat the problem I have outlined from the outset, which is that on the one hand, companies are paying big bucks to buy and lease land while on the other hand, the Government tells me no financial arrangements have yet been agreed, planning guidelines must be considered and discussed and that it is up to the companies in question if they wish to take a chance in this regard. However, such companies are not taking chances. Decisions have already been made and neither I nor the Irish people have been told what arrangements have been put in place. That is my problem in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">I agree entirely with Deputy Colreavy that if we are to open a new traded sector in green energy, the benefit must redound to the Irish nation. I could not agree more and that is what I have been explaining since I got on my feet this morning. This is the reason painstaking attention must be devoted to negotiating an intergovernmental agreement because unless there is benefit to Ireland, there will not be an agreement. In fairness, I believe this is an advance on Deputy Colreavy's position. The position of some of his party colleagues, including in the midlands, is that they are opposed to selling energy to the Brits.</p>

He ended up giving the seal of approval to peasant proprietorship and we have lived with the implications of that ever since and there are many people in the country who would say that was a great step forward. To underline the point, if anybody wants to go to Deputy Colreavy’s part of the country or any part of the country to buy options on land I cannot do anything about it. They have to make their own decisions according to their own judgment and their own commercial opportunity. There would be uproar if I sought to prevent people selling them land and doing business.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">If the recent debate on pylons and wind turbines serves to highlight anything it is to show the limitations on the generation of onshore wind energy. The debate is moving rapidly to offshore wind energy. In 2012 offshore wind energy grew by 33% across the European Union. We seem to be missing out in that area. In the past week the European Commission presented a communication on blue energy to the European Parliament and Council. That is the subject of this question.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I welcome the publication last week by the European Commission of its Communication on Blue Energy, which specifically deals with wave and tidal energy technologies. The communication gives a very clear assessment of the enormous potential of ocean energy, identifying the Atlantic seaboard as the area of highest potential in the EU. The communication also highlights the importance for EU energy security of developing this clean, indigenous, energy source and the particular benefit of this dimension for island member states. With an estimate of the sector creating 40,000 jobs by 2035, there is clearly a huge opportunity here for the EU. </p>
            <p eId="para_84"> The issues covered, and actions proposed in the communication correlate with the content of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, OREDP, which I will publish shortly. It is clear from the work that my Department has been undertaking to develop the OREDP, and the work the Commission has undertaken on blue energy, that cross-cutting action is required to maintain support for this sector if it is to reach commercial viability successfully. Collaborative work at national and EU levels on areas such as environmental monitoring, research and development, consenting procedures and infrastructure requirements will all be critical to realising the potential of this sector as a source of sustainable employment and economic growth, especially in those coastal communities where job creation is particularly challenging. </p>
            <p eId="para_85"> The implementation of the OREDP, led by my Department, will be the mechanism through which a fully co-ordinated Government approach will be taken across the environmental, energy and economic development sectors to ensure that Ireland realises the commercial development of its abundant offshore energy potential, which is among the best in the world. The OREDP will also facilitate our contribution to the achievement of EU blue energy objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">The concern is that we are behind the curve in using the potential we have and which others would envy. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and Portugal called for the EU to set a 2030 goal for renewable energy use but that is not how we are going to state our ambition in the climate change policy. It appears there is a conflict. I produced a Bill that sought just that. Our climate change legislation will not produce targets, it will produce sectoral plans. That is what seems to be called for at European level.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> We should be considering policy development for offshore wind feed in tariff schemes to make it attractive for people to invest and not be looking for parcels of land. I want to see wind energy exported in the same way as tomatoes or beef or anything else but we can do it in a way that does not have the kind of impacts that large industrial onshore turbines would have. Even Portugal, which is under pressure, is investing in floating platforms for wind energy. There are ways of doing it and we are behind the curve.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">I made the point earlier that our system of government does not place any responsibility for policy-making on Opposition Deputies and God knows I was one for long enough. It is equally true that it is a feature of Irish policy-making that as soon as a great idea about developing renewable energy from onshore wind farms, for example, begins to become a reality its earlier proponents start to run away and discover that maybe we should do it offshore. I do not make that allegation in the case of Deputy Catherine Murphy because I do not doubt her commitment to the question of renewable energy. Time and again during the debate on this topic I have seen opposition fomented to the build-out of the grid and people who should know better giving credence to claims that we know are not objectively or scientifically valid. There are valid complaints but there are also complaints that are not supported by science. I do not believe that we are behind the curve in this area. I do not believe that climate change policy is inconsistent with Deputy Murphy’s argument that there ought to be sectoral plans. That is what is happening here. I hope to publish the OREDP within the next month. That is a sectoral plan focused on the area of substantial concern in Deputy Murphy’s question.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">When submissions on onshore energy were called for I made one outlining how that should happen. Unfortunately, we often develop policy the wrong way around. We make the mistake and then try to fix it. We should have studied how they did it in Denmark where the community is involved and where the Aarhus Convention has real meaning. The people who have responsibility for developing the policy have made mistakes. All the criticism can be on this side but we have got away from the point I am trying to make in the question, about the potential for offshore development. That is my focus today. It is very easy to absorb the time by focussing where the row is now.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">It is on future policy development and the conflict on the climate change policy we are going to develop. What the Minister is signing up to, with other European energy Ministers, would seem to be at variance with our national policy on that, which is about a target, not just a sectoral plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">Good morning, Deputy McGrath. I hope that, as he told me, the people of Marino, Raheny and Clontarf are still welcoming my legislative proposals. I am very pleased about that. In response to Deputy Colreavy, the Taoiseach's reference to the programme of work is a reference to EirGrid's programme of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 11, 13, 18 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> EirGrid’s Grid25 national transmission grid development programme is vital for future socio-economic progress in Ireland, for regional development throughout Ireland, and to ensure that current and future generations of consumers have access to more reliable, sustainable and affordable energy. Grid25 represents an investment in the electricity transmission system of around €3.2 billion in the coming 15 to 20 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> During the course of engagement by EirGrid in the recent public consultation processes, and most recently in regard to the Grid Link project, on which 35,000 submissions were received, a number of key concerns emerged. This has necessitated considerable review and reflection in order to determine the optimum approach needed to address those concerns that are valid, while at the same time ensuring adequate and effective transmission capacity in the State. Arising from examination of the concerns expressed, I have proposed a number of measures to deal with the immediate concerns on the Grid West and Grid Link projects, while also addressing the generality of commentary on the need to improve stakeholder and community engagement on all Grid25 projects for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> As Deputy Colreavy said, I have appointed an independent panel of experts, to be chaired by former Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness. The panel of experts will decide the terms of reference for comprehensive, route-specific studies of fully underground and overhead options for both the Grid Link and the Grid West projects. The panel will be required to ensure that the studies are complete, objective and comparable, and will report to me on these matters in due course. Both the overhead and underground options will be published side-by-side, in objective and comparable terms, before consideration is given to the appropriate next steps for each of the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> EirGrid will be required to undertake the two studies, as determined by the independent panel of experts, which will take account of, <i>inter alia</i>, environmental and visual amenity impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The independent panel will have power to commission additional work if there is any perceived deficiency in the studies presented.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> Detailed studies have already been conducted for the North-South transmission line, including consideration of a route-specific underground option and, most recently, an assessment by the independent international commission of experts, appointed in July 2011, which reported in February 2012. Previously, in 2009, the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources commissioned an independent study on the comparative merits of overhead electricity transmission lines versus underground cables. That study was conducted by international consultants, Ecofys. The route-specific underground analysis, conducted by PB Power, found that the cost of undergrounding would significantly exceed the cost of the more usual overhead cables. The PB Power analysis was considered and confirmed by the independent commission, which estimated that the cost of undergrounding would be at least three times that of overhead cables. EirGrid has taken full account of the contents of those studies in finalising the planning application. I understand An Bord Pleanála will be considering the alternatives, including the possible use of underground cables, considered by EirGrid prior to EirGrid's selection of the preferred overhead option. EirGrid will be required to present its position on the alternatives in its environmental impact statement, which will form part of its planning application. The application is expected to be lodged shortly with An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> As the Deputies will know, EirGrid has been engaging in comprehensive processes in regard to Grid Link and Grid West, including the opening of regional information centres. EirGrid has set out its vision for development of the national transmission system through the Grid25 strategy which was published in October 2008. In accordance with its statutory and licence responsibilities as the transmission system operator, the company has prepared a transmission development plan for the period 2013 to 2023. The transmission development plan presents the developments which will be required to deliver the Grid25 strategy, meeting future requirements as they are known at this time, including the requirement to accommodate renewable generation. The vision articulated in the Grid25 strategy is assessed and reassessed on a regular basis, having regard to current and future demand and other factors, and is consulted on through the transmission development plan. Details of the strategy and the transmission development plan for 2013 to 2023 are available on the EirGrid website. In addition, at a project level, detailed needs assessments for each of the major Grid25 projects have been undertaken and are available on EirGrid's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> It is my strong wish that these measures will comprehensively address the issues that have arisen with the Grid25 projects to the satisfaction of all interested parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">Therefore, the answer on the North-South route is "No", obviously. Given the planning application is going in within a matter of weeks and this study will not be commenced and will certainly not be concluded within a matter of weeks, despite all that has been said, the answer is "No, it will not be included".</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> There is a second question. Who is going to prepare and publish the terms of reference for the expert committee? Will there be an opportunity for the public to consider those terms of reference? Will there perhaps be an opportunity for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to consider the draft terms of reference before they are finalised? If we have comprehensive and good terms of reference, we have a chance of getting a good outcome from it. However, incomplete terms of reference would render any subsequent report valueless or of limited value.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">Could the Minister explain how the terms of reference will be prepared, who is going to do it and whether or not the draft terms of reference can be considered by the Oireachtas or the public?</p>

            <p eId="para_119">The terms of reference will be decided by the expert panel under Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and will derive from the public consultation process just ended. There is no great mystery about it. In respect of the initial report I received from EirGrid regarding its initial consideration of the 35,000 submissions, there is a great deal of repetition and duplication. Undergrounding versus overgrounding, the quality of engagement in the public consultation process, despoliation of the environment, damage to visual amenities, equine health and cost factors are all issues that must be addressed in respect of non-ionising radiation. They are the concerns and they will point to it. The commission has not yet convened. No doubt, Deputy Colreavy will come back to this at future Question Times.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_120">I have heard the Minister throw so much cold water on the idea of undergrounding in the past few months. He will have to forgive me for suspecting that it might have a bit more to do with the local elections. In its submission on the Grid Link project, An Taisce argued that EirGrid's failure to facilitate public consultation on the preliminary decisions made in respect of the current Grid Link proposal presents a fundamental legal issue for the project as it does not comply with article 6.4 of the Aarhus Convention which states that each party shall provide for "early public participation, when all options are open and effective public participation can take place". Does the Minister believe that EirGrid's approach thus far has complied with the convention?</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> In respect of public participation and decision making, the Minister is probably aware of a statement yesterday by the Environmental Pillar. It has called on the Government to initiate an inclusive participatory process to develop a comprehensive national strategy on energy. It argued that such a strategy must clearly outline how the energy requirements of future generations can be met in the face of climate change and how energy usage can be reduced and the need to set out the pathway to achieve zero or near zero carbon emissions from energy by 2050. Does the Minister agree that a national energy strategy must be developed and used as the basis for any decisions on proposed energy infrastructure projects? Why is a major public investment programme going ahead in the absence of such a strategy?</p>

            <p eId="para_122">I never associated Deputy Wallace with the kind of cynical disposition that would suggest as he did that I might in any way be motivated by impending elections. I am afraid it misunderstands the very nature of energy projects. If the initiative that I announced yesterday had never happened, it was the intention of EirGrid to lodge the planning application in 2016. That date will now inevitably be pushed back six months, a year or whatever. I do not know. Before yesterday's announcement, EirGrid's intention was to proceed full steam ahead and have the planning application ready to be lodged in 2016. Asking me, as I have been asked elsewhere, about local elections has nothing to do with this. Energy projects are long-term and that was what I was referring to when I said it could not be decided on the whim of a passing fashion after I was asked a question like the one the Deputy just asked me about local elections. This is a long-term decision that must be made in what is considered to be in the best interests of the public. That is the time-span that was envisaged. I know the phrase has been misrepresented but I have lived with that kind of thing for a long time.</p>
            <p eId="para_123"> There is no doubt in my mind that we have complied in every way with the principles of public participation set out in the Aarhus Convention. It is not the formal consultative arrangements that are at issue here. It is criticism by both sides of this House of the quality of the engagement. Nobody criticises the fact that there was a prolonged consultation period. There were dozens of days of public consultation and offices were opened in different parts of the country. The criticisms that have come back to me are about the quality of the engagement. It is that which the new chairman of EirGrid, John O'Connor, is being asked to assess in the package of measures announced yesterday. He is being asked to deal with the question about the quality of engagement in the future. There are no defects in the formal consultation procedures but if every side of this House criticises the nature of the engagement and queries whether the engineers are listening, I must have regard to that. People's concerns in that regard must be responded to.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">We are being presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>. As with much debate in the House, the train has left the station but we are only now being asked to discuss the fate of its passengers and its direction. The reduction in the number of MEPs from 12 to 11 is regrettable and damages democracy. Across the political spectrum, we often hear that Europe is remote from people, that people do not know who their MEPs are or that we need to bring democracy closer to people. A number of years ago, we used to have 16 MEPs and most people were able to rattle off the names of their regions' MEPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> The Bill is a retrograde step. For example, I never suspected that I would wind up in the Ireland north constituency, since I live in the middle of County Laois. People on the Kilkenny border between Durrow and Johnstown and people in the village of Cullahill are now in the same constituency as the people of Inishowen, Achill Island and Connemara. It is a large constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> The two four-seaters will make it difficult for MEPs to represent people, but Dublin's constituency of three seats will make it difficult for independent and smaller parties' voices to be heard in the European Parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">It is important that such voices be heard. The 31st Dáil is different from previous Dáileanna in that it has a number of colourful characters and various shades of political opinion. We need the same in Europe. With the reduction to three seats in Dublin, however, achieving that will be more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> The European Parliament's role has been enhanced. It started with weak powers, but it is now side by side with the Commission. It is important that marginalised communities feel that their voices are represented in Europe. It used to be the view that the dominant lobby groups, for example, corporate Ireland and other sections of society, were well represented whereas people in marginalised communities received crumbs from Europe in the form of local development funds, etc. and had little say. This situation needs to be brought to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> The reduction to 11 MEPs is a <i>fait accompli</i>, but we must oppose the Bill because of it. We must highlight the fact that marginalised communities and people who do not count themselves as being marginalised are not being represented. People all along the western seaboard could now be hundreds of miles from their MEPs. For example, if Mr. Pat The Cope Gallagher, MEP wins a seat, he will also represent my county. That will be difficult. The area is massive. It cannot be done. How the enlargement of Europe is being balanced must be reconsidered. Countries such as Ireland that are more sparsely populated need a greater number of MEPs <i>per capita</i>. It is not like the city of London with its 9 million people where identifying one's MEP is easy thanks to the local media. Ireland north and Ireland south could each have 30 local newspapers and eight, nine or ten radio stations. It will be difficult for the areas' representatives to keep in touch. It is also important that people see the relevance of Europe. Our party supports membership of the EU, although we obviously want a different type of Union. It is key that there be a connection between people and the European Parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">It is important we send strong voices to Europe to let people know the facts on issues such as youth unemployment and the banking debt. The latter is not our debt and we need a better deal that does not choke the economy, our people and the country's future.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The European elections are important, but I am disappointed with the Bill, which changes the constituencies following a reduction in the number of Ireland's MEPs from 12 to 11. The constituencies will be Dublin, South and Midlands-North-West. Currently, there are four constituencies, those being, Dublin, South, East and North-West. This is an attack on democracy and reduces the democratic will of the Irish people in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I mentioned Councillor O'Farrell, who will not be contesting the European elections, only the local elections in the Clontarf ward.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> In Dublin, the population per MEP will be 424,356. In Midlands-North-West, the figure will be 409,276. In South, the figure will be 419,520. How in God's name can the people of Ireland be represented with numbers like these? God help the poor MEPs when they are elected. They will have their hands full.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> The Bill is not acceptable. Germany has one seat for every 852,539 people. Malta has a seat for every 69,352 people. God help the German MEPs. How would the Minister manage to deal with the likes in Kilkenny? He believes he has a big constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Ireland used to have an MEP for every 381,897 people. Now, it will only have an MEP for every 416,615 people. We must be careful not to reduce the level of democracy. If there is a disconnect between people and their parliamentarians, be they in the Dáil, Dublin City Council, like Councillor Damien O'Farrell, or the European Parliament, it will be a threat to society and democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> We need voices in Europe that will be heard and that will challenge the current movement towards a European Union superstate. People are very concerned about that. People want Europe, its peoples and its economies to work together, but they do not want to be forced through the back door into the creation of a European superstate. This morning I heard Angela Merkel making the point that she is getting a bit cheesed off with the rest of Europe because we are not moving faster towards integration. We need to watch this as well. We need voices out in Europe that will deal with the banking issue and the ECB issue. Many people will be concerned about the direction of the European Union. We all want a Europe based on democracy and inclusion, respecting different views and different cultures, but some people out there have this view that we are now bumping into one big superstate, dominated by the big players. That is not acceptable to the people of this country, but it is also not acceptable to the people of Europe. It is unacceptable to have 5.6 million people under the age of 20 unemployed. We have 60,000 young people in this State on youth unemployment, and that is not acceptable either.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The militarisation of the European Union worries me, as someone who serves on the defence committee in the Oireachtas, because we hear a lot of talk about battle groups. I have concerns about that. Ireland has a strong tradition in the United Nations of peacemaking and peacekeeping, and that is the tradition we should follow. That is why we are respected all over the world. I urge the Minister and the Government to be very careful about getting too involved in battle groups. People are also very concerned about some of the foreign policy issues as well. It is important to remember the great anti-war campaigner, Margaretta D'Arcy, who is locked up in Limerick Prison. This woman should be released. She is anti-war, she is a peace campaigner and she should be released now. This is all linked with the whole debate about the militarisation of the European Union, but also the militarisation of Shannon Airport. It was a previous policy of the Labour Party and its members, before they jumped into bed with Fine Gael, that we were going to stand up for people like Margaretta D'Arcy. Now they run away and hide and avoid the issue. I will not avoid the issue, and I will stand up for people like Margaretta D'Arcy and people who are fighting for international peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> This Bill is closing down democracy. I want a country and a State that is built on democracy and that respects the rights of people. This Bill is reducing the number of seats, and that is why I will oppose it strongly.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I will also be opposing this Bill, because it worsens what is already a crisis of legitimacy for the European Union. For a long time, there has been a growing disconnect between ordinary citizens in Europe, whether in this country or elsewhere, and the institutions of the European Union. It is what people call the democratic deficit. This Bill further widens and deepens that democratic deficit. It further exposes something those of us who opposed the various European treaties in recent years have long argued. Those like Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party which supported the various treaties - Lisbon, Nice, Maastricht - have all argued that what they and the European Union are trying to create is a democratic union, a union of solidarity, and the sort of union that is key to preventing the horrors that we witnessed in the 1930s and 1940s, with the Second World War. All the evidence is that it is the exact opposite. The sort of European Union that is developing is a recipe to repeat the horrors of the 1930s and the 1940s. When we look at the frightening growth of the far right, openly neo-Nazi parties around Europe, parading the streets and engaging in vicious racial violence and articulating the sort of obnoxious views that were articulated by the Nazis and the fascists of the 1930s and 1940s, which led to such disaster for the world, we would have to start to question seriously what is going on in the European Union. How has alienation with the European Union grown to such a point that it has become a major contributory factor in fuelling the obnoxious ideas of the far right and neo-fascist organisations across Europe? That is exactly what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> It is terrifying. I have spoken to people in Greece about Golden Dawn, which is an openly fascist organisation. Its support is growing as a direct result of what the European Union has done to Greece. There is a feeling that ordinary citizens are absolutely ignored, dismissed and are simply fodder to be trampled upon by the troika. Even the name "troika" is suggestive of the undemocratic direction of the European Union. I think it is a Russian word which one would associate with autocratic, centralised regimes. The pretence and decoration of democracy that the European Parliament represents belies the actuality of the European Union, which is diktat from the European Central Bank and the European Commission and their pals in the IMF. It makes a mockery of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> Some of us met with a delegation from the European Parliament last week. They came over here to examine the aftermath of the troika programme. Even they pointed out to us that it was ridiculous that they were only now getting a chance to look at the impact of the troika programme after it was all over, essentially asking us was it bad, did we have any input and if there was any real consultation with the citizens of this country over the so-called bailout. We all had to admit the truth, which was that there is no consultation. The citizens had no say whatsoever. It was imposed and inflicted on them by the ECB, the EU Commission and the IMF. It was a centralised diktat by institutions that are dancing to one tune and one tune only, and it certainly is not the democratic tune, the tune of ordinary citizens or voters in Europe. They were dancing to the tune of the financial markets, of the banks, of the financial elites and the European Central Bank which represent those interests. It really makes a mockery of democracy and against that background, to dilute further the influence of the citizens of this State and of other states across Europe just makes a bad situation worse. It is questionable, frankly, whether these elections mean anything against a background where we have the dictatorship of the troika. As much as the Government may trumpet the so-called exit from the programme, we all know that it is meaningless because the terms of the fiscal treaty mean that the ECB and the EU Commission will still dictate to countries across Europe, regardless of what citizens vote for or want.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Against that general background, it is wrong to further dilute the influence of ordinary citizens not only in this country, but throughout the European Union. I am not a little Irelander or parochial politician and I suspect most citizens of this country share my passionate belief in internationalism, international co-operation and solidarity with other citizens of Europe. That is not what this legislation is about, however. This Bill is an example of large states manoeuvring to concentrate their power and influence over the European Union. It is being done against a more general background of a dictatorship of unelected EU bodies, one which was considerably strengthened by the mandate given to the European Central Bank. The ECB's complete independence from any control by elected representatives makes it a thorough financial dictatorship. This is not an empty phrase but the precise position in respect of the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> The consequences of these developments have been disastrous and the political price being paid is a terrifying rise of the far right across Europe. It is not an exaggeration to describe the situation unfolding in Europe as a repeat of the 1930s, albeit in slow motion. The same movie is playing but at a slower pace. We have an economic crisis, a political centre that has become completely discredited, dangerous forces of the far right beginning to emerge on the margins and widespread disaffection and disillusionment with political institutions among ordinary citizens. This measure makes the position worse. </p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I oppose the Bill for the reasons I have outlined. While I suspect it is a forlorn hope, I ask the Government to consider the dangerous implications of what is taking place in Europe. Ordinary citizens have lost trust in the political institutions of the European Union. They were already sceptical about the European project, as it was constituted. The Minister should not misunderstand me in that respect. People draw a sharp distinction between the ideals of European solidarity and co-operation and the reality, which is nothing more than political manoeuvring by large powers and big multinational corporations and corporate interests that have essentially captured and taken hostage the institutions of the European Union to further their own interests at the expense of democracy and the economic and social interests of ordinary citizens, both in this country and elsewhere. I will oppose the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_175">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill. This legislation is only one element in a larger debate that we must have. One of the problems with debates about the European Union is that anybody who queries the current arrangements and their weaknesses or points to developments that may not be in the interests of Europe, Ireland or citizens is immediately labelled a eurosceptic.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Europe is much different from the United States where most people identify with America, mobility is much greater and easier and there are no language differences. People on the west coast, for example, who were born in the east do not feel they have left their home patch. If one examines the pattern of migration from this country, one finds that the largest number of migrants move to our nearest neighbour, with the majority of the remainder emigrating to Canada, Australia and, when it is open, the United States. The different character of Europe and America means the construction of Europe must be different from the construction of the federal state that makes up the United States. Similarly, Germany is a federal state in which the regional states or <i>Länder </i>enjoy significant powers and citizens share a common language and culture. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> There will always be a debate about the power exercised by EU member states through the Council of Ministers versus the power of the European Parliament. I note the presence of Deputy Creighton who has experience of attending Council meetings. In my limited experience of taking part in Council meetings as the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development and, subsequently, the Minister for Social Protection, it was rare for Ministers to vote. Irrespective of whether they represented a large or small country, Ministers' views were generally taken on board and they were largely treated equally. While this is possible when 28 people are sitting around a table, it is difficult to envisage how 11 Members of the European Parliament - 14 in total from this island - who belong to four different groups will be able to influence decisions as powers transfer from the Council to the Parliament. We do not have a sufficient number of members to ensure Ireland is represented on all parliamentary committees. Many MEPs specialise in certain areas, for example, agriculture, consumer affairs or the environment, in a way that Members of the Oireachtas do not. By narrowing their interest base in the European Parliament, they seek to have an input and make an impression. </p>
          <p eId="para_178"> As the European Union grows, the issue of the balance between the Council of Ministers and Parliament will come to the fore. I have never been convinced that transferring powers from the former to the latter has been in the interests of European citizens because many member states have only a small number of representatives in Parliament. I understand a rule was introduced prescribing that the minimum number of MEPs for each member state will be six. This means very small states such as Malta have a high number of representatives in the European Parliament on a <i>per capita</i> basis. Other small states, including Ireland, should also have been allocated a bonus, as it were, in terms of numbers in Parliament. The most recent cut in the number of MEPs from 12 to 11 is a significant reduction. It is interesting that this issue was not discussed in the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Why did such a discussion not take place? When decisions were being taken on this matter last June, why did the Taoiseach not insist that countries of the size of Ireland retain greater weight in respect of MEP numbers? </p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The future of the European Union is based entirely on member states and their citizens believing that their voice and concerns will be heard. This will be difficult to achieve when their representation is being consistently reduced. During the first elections to the European Parliament political dialogue and discourse reflected a view that MEPs were important and influential. They were able to serve their constituencies in a reasonably thorough manner, were known individually by those whom they represented and were able to visit the various parts of their constituencies. </p>
          <p eId="para_180">When we had a three-seat Connaught-Ulster constituency there was a feeling of attachment to and knowledge of MEPs that has not been so apparent in recent times. We are now to have three new constituencies, Dublin and what I define as Leath Cuinn and Leath Moga. Long before Ireland was divided into provinces it was divided by Leath Cuinn and Leath Moga, which is effectively, what is being done now again. It is funny how history repeats itself. </p>
          <p eId="para_181"> In terms of the divisions, it is hard to see how anybody, having spent five days in Brussels, could physically service the Cooley Peninsula to Belmullet and from South Kildare to Mizen Head or retain any reasonable contact with the people he or she represents. This is becoming a big issue and will become an even bigger issue into the future. In regard to the question of who is the queue for membership of the European Union, I understand there are many countries who want to join. With the Parliament now fixed in terms of membership, as the Union grows the number of seats will decrease. As such, this is not necessarily the final cut in seat numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> The balance of power issue within the European Union needs to be debated, without slogans and bricks being thrown at people who question issues in regard to Europe. I believe that if we had been more questioning, not about the concept of international co-operation which nobody can argue with, but about the construction of various elements of change in the European Union we might have saved ourselves many problems. When people ask me about the origins of the collapse in the economy, I point to the decision to enter the euro, which had unanimous support across the political spectrum in this country. Nobody thought about what would happen if the centre was in recession, the periphery was in growth, cheap money was available and all barriers to the movement of money were removed resulting in it being available at low interest rates. Truth be told what happened was akin to a child being given a giant tub of ice-cream and left alone. As everybody knows the child would eat too much and get a tummy ache. There is nothing wrong with ice cream or the fair movement of money. However, success without control and a lack of consideration of what might happen results in the types of issues that have arisen, which Europe with its banking union, etc., is now trying to resolve. Europe will not admit the mistake, it will only seek to resolve it. The next time change is proposed we need to look at the unintended consequences more carefully.</p>

          <from>Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_183">I am a big fan of Europe. What I love about it is its variety. However, I am no fan of the European Union because I believe it is setting about crushing what is different throughout Europe and trying to create one bland flavour that at the end of the day is good for nobody.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> When Ireland joined the European Community it was a community. A community is supposed to care for people in the good and bad times. However, when things went bad for us in terms of the banking crisis the European Union did not take care of us, rather it saddled us with €70 billion worth of debt. That is not something a community does to people it respects. I know many people who in 1973, at which time I was only a year old, campaigned for Ireland to join the European Community and would now campaign at the drop of a hat for it to leave the EU. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The fact that the number of Irish MEPs is being reduced from 12 to 11 makes this situation even worse. It means that we will now have even less influence. Every time something done in the European Union requires to be transposed into Irish law the Irish Government tries to impose it on us by saying it is being forced by Europe to do it. It is then a little baffled when it comes to a referendum as to the reason people are not fans of Europe. One of the reasons for this is successive governments, rather than introducing policies that will protect our water, environment and so on, telling the people they are being forced to do certain things with the result that the people never get a chance to consider whether what is being proposed is a good idea or not. All they are told is that it is a diktat. </p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Listening to some people one would think we would be living in caves if we had not joined the European Community in 1973. What these people point to in support of their argument is the equipment being used on farms at that time and how we have progressed. Norway, Iceland and Switzerland did not join this Frankenstein creation and they have progressed well since 1973. They also have not been saddled with €70 billion worth of banking debt. The European Union in imposing this cut on the people of Ireland and in socialising bank debt around parts of Europe has created the very problem it was supposed to prevent, namely, the rise of the extreme right. It is a simple fact that if one puts two friendly rats into a cage and does not feed them they will eventually try to eat each other. The EU is creating the conditions whereby people are turning on each other. People are becoming desperate because the money that should be in their pockets is now in the hands of the elite. We will see a rise of the right, about which I have heard the Minister, Deputy Shatter, express concern. If he is so concerned why then does he not do something about it? People are rightly sick and tired of socialism for the rich.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> We only get one view on Europe in this country. Last year, Deputy Creighton led a European propaganda campaign which was funded by the taxpayer and which involved her travelling around the country explaining to everybody how wonderful Europe is. However, there was no funding for anybody to travel around the country explaining the downsides of Europe, such as the loss of our sugar beet industry, the losses of turf cutters and the loss of our sovereignty. In a couple of years Ireland will celebrate the centenary of 1916. What is the point in celebrating the fact that almost 100 years ago we got our sovereignty only to give it away again? It is crazy. </p>
          <p eId="para_188"> If the Irish people had the opportunity to debate this issue - these issues are never properly debated - they would come to the conclusion that Europe must go into reverse gear. When we entered into the Act of Union with Britain in 1801, Lord Byron was quoted as saying that there is only union of a small country and a big country, that is the union between a boa constrictor and its prey.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I am one of many people in this country who might be described as eurosceptic, who loves Europe but who does not like the project that is going on now. It is time we started debating that. If we want to get sovereignty back in this country, the first thing we must do is get sovereignty of the mind or the sovereignty to think for ourselves. We should consider the fact that this country can feed ten times its population. The country has many assets, such as young educated people - those who are left. Why have we the hands out with the begging bowl when we have all these assets? The reason is because our experiment as a province of this massive country has failed. We need to think again.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> At the moment as far as I can see from the candidates who have their names put forward in the European elections, almost everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. They are terrified that we would not be able to stand on our own two feet. As I have said, we can feed ten times our population. Still, we do not seem to have anyone going forward in these elections who is willing to stand up and argue that there is a better way for Europe and for the ordinary people. That better way is to think again about Europe, to reverse gear and to do so quickly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_191">One of the most important things we have in this Republic is the opportunity to vote and participate in elections. The Minister has announced that the date for the European and local elections will be 23 May. One difficulty we have in Ireland is with the disconnect between the electoral system and the population and the fact that many people do not believe politics is working for them. One point I have made previously several times relates to the crucial responsibility we have in this House to re-engage with the populace and ordinary people and ensure people recognise the connectivity between their vote and the influence politics can have over their lives. Unfortunately, what happens generally in political systems is that those who have power are those who are richer and who utilise their vote more often. The political establishment, political system or the body politic tends to move around these circles.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I have done some research on the matter and spoken to people who are politically involved in Australia. What is interesting about the political system in Australia is they have had compulsory voting for a long time. The interesting thing about electioneering in Australia is that campaigning happens in the poorest of areas and the richest of areas, it happens with the youngest people and the oldest people. Politics does not generate itself around middle class people who are middle aged, simply because they seem to have all the voting power. It goes everywhere, everyone feels empowered by it, everyone connects with it and everyone feels as if the politician or the political class will listen to what they have to say. We do not have that in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> What we will have in four months' time is an election in which the majority of people will not participate. Average voting rates in general elections are higher, but in European and local elections the rate is rather low. Why is that? It is because people take the view either that politics is not working for them or they have no connectivity with what the European Union does for them. They do not necessarily have connectivity with what the local council does for them either. What we have now is an opportunity, perhaps, given that we are in such turmoil politically, socially and economically, with this election to highlight to the people the importance and power of their participation. Those who know the power of their vote use it and tend to have more power and those who do not know or do not appreciate the importance of the franchise tend to lose out. I know this from the areas I represent and where I have worked extensively over the years. Certain people lose out because they do not vote in the same numbers. If people do not vote in the same numbers, politicians realise it and they know it is worthwhile to spend more time in an area where people vote rather than an area where people do not, or they will spend more time with a group of people who vote rather than a group of people who do not. I have in mind members of the Traveller community and immigrants. Such groups are often easy prey for politicians to criticise because they do not have the same voting power bloc others may have.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> How are we going to re-engage with the people? How do we put it to them that the European Union is important and that, whatever their view of it and what has unfolded in recent years, it certainly has a major influence over all our lives? Why do half the people in Ireland not bother to show up and vote on election day? We should have a proper conversation not only about our connectivity with the European Union but about what type of European Union we want. I hope we can have an ideologically driven debate because too often this becomes a referendum on the Government or it becomes about tribal politics. What is our vision for the European Union? What kind of value system do we believe it should espouse? More important, how can the electoral commission that will potentially emerge from the Constitutional Convention ensure we reconnect with people who are so disconnected that either they do not care or they simply do not want to know? Given these powerful forces that engage in these decisions which affect all our lives, why is it that people are so turned off by the European Union or by elections in general? It is our responsibility to step up to the mark and this is a chance for us to do so. This is the first election in this governmental term to ask these questions of ourselves and perhaps to provide some answers for the future.</p>

        <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_195">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this legislation. I consider this to be of great importance. It is important legislation because the European elections that will take place on 23 May are of major importance for Ireland and the European Union. Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin has alluded to how we often underestimate the importance of the European Parliament and the importance of taking these elections seriously. As citizens and voters, often we underestimate how important and heavily weighted our individual votes are.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I have heard a good deal of hand wringing and expressions of disappointment about the fact we are losing a seat in the European Parliament, and I share these to some extent. Obviously, numbers are important. Would that we had retained our 12 seats rather than reducing to 11. However, I do not accept this automatically means a loss of influence. It is up to us how influential we are in the European Parliament. I have no doubt Deputy Mathews will allude to the matter in a moment but, in fact, quality matters a good deal more than quantity.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I have some experience of the European Parliament. I spent one week of every month, at a minimum, there for the first six months of 2013, sitting in plenary sessions from 9 a.m. until midnight on occasion. I participated in committee meetings and I negotiated with the chief operators in the European Parliament on a range of files.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The reality is that the European Parliament is a parliament which functions extraordinarily well. It is a far better functioning parliament then this dysfunctional Parliament, unfortunately, although fortunately for Europe, I suppose. It is a place where merit actually matters. Committee Chairs and rapporteurs on legislation and policy must know what they are doing. They will not get those jobs if they are not competent and capable of executing those tasks. As we know, that is not the case in these Houses, sadly. One example of this, dating back a decade or so, was the election of Mr. Pat Cox, who was part of one of the smaller groups in the European Parliament, the liberal group. He managed to rise through the ranks and on the basis of his ability and competence, he became President of the European Parliament. He was from a small country and a small political grouping. That would not happen in these Houses, clearly. Let us not underestimate the calibre and quality of individuals in the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I see this legislation and the decision made by the Minister in setting out the terms of reference for the European Parliament constituency committee last summer as a missed opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">We had a chance here to shake up our system of electing representatives to the European Parliament and how we go about ensuring the best possible representation for this country. Like others, I made submissions to the constituency boundary committee setting out a range of options, including a national list system and a series of single-seat constituencies. A number of commentators suggested a combination of both systems, that is, several single-seat constituencies and a national list system, whereby people would be voting far more based on the national perspective and interest and less in accordance with local concerns and geographical interests. This legislation represents a missed opportunity. As with many issues in this country, we are great at talking about political reform and radical change, but when it comes to the crunch we tend to dodge it.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Some months ago, I shared a platform with a former Member of the European Parliament, Mr. Brendan Halligan, a person who is well known to many in this House, at a conference held in tribute to Dr. Garret FitzGerald. Mr. Halligan delivered a paper in which he analysed the role of small member states within the context of the European Union. He highlighted how Dr. FitzGerald, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, shaped Ireland's foreign policy, via its European Union policy, by advancing the common interest of smaller member states within the European Union. It was a fascinating lecture. One of the interesting insights Mr. Halligan provided was that in 1973, when we first faced the prospect of direct elections to the European Parliament, the Government led by Liam Cosgrave deliberated long and hard on the idea of moving away from the traditional multi-seat constituencies. That Government gave serious consideration to doing something radically different for elections to the European Parliament rather than simply aping the Dáil electoral system. Ultimately, however, the proposal to move away from multi-seat constituencies and instead use a national list system was not implemented. It is interesting to recall that these issues were being considered at that time. Here we are, 41 years later, wringing our hands and still talking about the need to change how we approach the engagement we have as voters with the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I noted Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív's interesting remarks. I very much appreciate that different people have different perspectives and concerns when it comes to the European Union. Nobody has a monopoly on all the wisdom on this issue. However, I disagree with the Deputy in terms of his fear of the European Parliament encroaching on the Council. The European Union has become much larger in recent years, with 28 member states and a range of aspirant member states in the Balkans and other parts of eastern Europe as well as northern Europe. The larger the Union becomes, the more unwieldy it will be if we do not have genuine democratic accountability within its institutions. One of the longest-standing criticisms of the European project, and an issue I have raised on various occasions in the past, is the deficit of accountability and transparency within the Union and the need to balance the interests of small and large member states. There is no simple solution in this regard, but one of the most important vehicles for genuine direct engagement between citizens and the European institutions is the Parliament. In fact, one could say it is the only fully and legitimately democratic institution within the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The membership of the Commission consists merely of a series of political appointments. When we talk about quality, calibre and so on, it becomes clear that our appointment to the Commission is extremely important. It should not be a political quick fix as it has been in the past. Instead, we must ensure that we select the right person, with the right credentials and qualities and the capacity to deliver for Ireland at the European table. Every member state is represented equally on the Commission, which is good. On the other hand, the Commission is not accountable to the voting public across Europe. Nor is the Council directly accountable other than in the sense that it represents the Governments of each of the member states. The only directly accountable institution is the European Parliament. We cannot underestimate or understate just how important that is.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The European Parliament has become far more influential in decision making since the Lisbon treaty. This is a very welcome development. My experience showed that engaging with Members of the European Parliament, particularly those who have real expertise in certain areas, such as finance, economics or monetary policy, enhances the process at European level. Several of the solutions to the financial crisis that were mooted in recent years, such as the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism and the proposal for eurobonds - the latter has not yet been adopted but I remain hopeful it will be - came from the European Parliament, not the Council of Ministers or the Commission. Those ideas and concepts came organically from the Chamber and the committees of the European Parliament. The latter has proven itself to be representative, more in touch with citizens' concerns than the other institutions of the Union, and very analytical in terms of its approach to policy making and legislation. When I was Minister of State, I spent a great deal of time in the Chamber debating issues such as the regulation of ratings agencies - something that is critical in the context of the recent economic crisis - accountability for banks, and banker's bonuses. Some might say the latter is a populist issue but I consider it relevant and important in the context of accountability to our citizens. All of those proposals were enhanced, if not originated, in the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Let us not underestimate how valuable the Parliament is. We should not see it as a threat but rather as a very important vehicle of legitimacy and democracy for the European Union. I regret that the Minister has not been bold enough to change radically how we elect our MEPs. The quality and calibre of those Members is vital for this State and all member states of the European Union. We have some fine MEPs and some not so fine MEPs. I hope we will see an improvement in the overall performance and quality of our representatives in the European Parliament after the forthcoming election.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">This is very important legislation. At the end of May voters will be asked to fill Ireland's allocation of 11 seats in the European Parliament. This is one fewer MEP than before, or a reduction of 8% in our representation. That reduction is unfortunate given that the job facing this country is so extensive. When we have something as important as the elections to the European Parliament taking place on the same day as the local elections, there is undoubtedly an element of distraction. Voters will be buried under a blizzard of material from local government candidates. The reality is that it is the European election that will really count for this country and for every household in mortgage arrears or about to go into mortgage arrears, for every household where retired parents are paying out to prevent other loans going into arrears. Only this morning Ivan Yates was talking on his radio show about the non-mortgage debt which is crippling people but which we hear very little about.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Last week, Ken Rogoff said at the gathering in Davos of the richest and most powerful non-elected people in the world: "A debt write-down for Ireland would the right thing for Europe to do." Anybody who has studied Ireland's current position, how we got here and the financial destruction that has occurred knows this is the case and that the two remaining banks do not have enough capital to do the job they need to do, namely, restructuring and writing down their loan books. If they did have sufficient capital, they would be doing it already. It is up to us to elect people to the European Parliament who have done their homework, are articulate advocates for this country and will use those 11 seats wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> It is ironic that three and a half years ago, Deputy Joe Higgins, who was then an MEP, briefed the European Parliament perfectly accurately and articulately on the reality of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, actually lost his temper when he heard the truth, namely, that €70 billion in private banking sector loan losses was being socialised and converted - directly and indirectly - into Government debt or debt held by banks owned by the Government. Deputy Higgins pointed out at the time that this was wrong and he was right to do so. We need 11 individuals who possess the same clarity of mind and ability to articulate and advocate as that displayed by Deputy Higgins to fill our seats in Europe. If we do not elect 11 such people, we will not be able to drain the debt swamp that exists in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> On 7 May 2013, an EMU banking conference took place at the Charlemagne Building in Brussels. It was attended by approximately 500 MEPs and MPs from the various European Union and eurozone countries and it facilitated a useful debate in ordinary English. Mr. Barroso commenced proceedings in the multi-syllable, foggy language of aspiration. However, following the first formal presentation delivered by Commissioner Olli Rehn, the President of the Eurogroup at the European Commission and Dutch Finance Minister, Mr. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and the Portuguese Finance Minister, Mr. Vitor Gaspar, the discussion was opened up to everyone. Deputy Donnelly and I were in attendance and, luckily, I was selected to make the first contribution during the question-and-answer session which followed that presentation. I invite the Minister, his colleagues in the Government and everyone else in the House to view the YouTube clip of my contribution. I felt I owed it to the Irish people to make a robust presentation of the facts in the context of where Ireland stands financially and of the scale of the debt write-down that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Ms Sharon Bowles, MEP, the chairperson of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON, agreed with the assertions Deputy Donnelly and I made at EMU banking conference. Ms Bowles is due to retire from her position as chairperson of the committee but that has not stopped her from pressing the case in this regard. Why are we allowing others to do this on our behalf? I would have thought that the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would have made the point at last week's annual meeting of the World Economic Forum's in Davos that writing down Ireland's debt is the correct thing for Europe to do. I am amazed that our case is being pressed by people such as Ken Rogoff, Carmen Rheinhart, Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman. These individuals have studied what has happened in the international markets and examined how the financial systems in western capitalist markets have hijacked real economies. The latter is the reason 22 million people in Europe are out of work and why 25% of people in Ireland under the age of 25 are unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> My son is in Australia and last night he sent me an e-mail in respect of EirGrid and the 35,000 submissions that have been made in respect of its Grid Link project. He works for a firm in Australia which deals with public utilities and which is responsible for the laying of cables, etc. I will forward his e-mail to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, because it provides a useful insight into how matters of this nature should be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Ireland has not been served well by the efforts made in respect of the issue to which I refer. Those efforts have been limp in nature and have fallen short. How can I say this? I can do so because nothing has happened. The validity, etc., of Ireland's position has been illustrated but there is a timidity when it comes to putting our case across, which is shocking. There will be 11 seats up for grabs in May and I suggest that we clear out the fog and focus our efforts. Those who win Ireland's 11 seats at the European Parliament must be well-equipped and well-briefed. They should form a unified phalanx and pledge that the exclusive priority will be to successfully negotiate a debt write-down. That is what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> In May 2011 the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, was not aware that the €70 billion loan losses of the six Irish banks had been refinanced by means of exceptional liquidity assistance from the euro system. Nor was he aware that these losses were socialised and converted into both national debt and indirect debt in banks owned by the State. When I informed him of the position, he asked whether a paper had been written on the subject. I replied that the evidence was available in the balance sheets of the banks - in both aggregated and consolidated form - and was easy to see. The loan losses to which I refer are not actually in the region of €60 billion to €70 billion, rather they are approximately €100 billion. This has not yet been acknowledged and it is the reason the two big banks are stuck in a shadow world in which it is stated that the insolvency legislation will solve everything. It will not do so. Legislation never solves financial problems. What is required is negotiation in order that debt can be restructured and written down, which is entirely reasonable. If this path is not followed, then the very life is sucked out of businesses and people.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I am not a revolutionary and I am not aggressive. I am persistent and, like Ms Sharon Bowles, MEP, I speak ordinary English. I again plead with Members to view the YouTube clip to which I referred earlier. I am not seeking to advertise myself but the quickest way of doing so is to go to my website, <i>www.petermathews.ie</i>, and follow the link to the six-minute YouTube clip for 7 May 2013. As stated, 500 people attended the EMU banking conference. However, Irish journalists did not arrive until the middle of the day when the free lunch was being served. As a result, they missed seeing what had happened live and were merely presented with press releases. The latter are what I usually refer to as lever arch file <i>précis</i> containing multi-syllable words that mean nothing. Those in the auditorium in the Charlemagne Building on 7 May last greeted my six-minute contribution with strong applause. That was the only time that day when someone was applauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> If those in Government do as I suggest, they will receive applause. That applause will be converted into agreement which, in turn, will be converted into action in terms of the write-down of the loan losses to which I referred earlier. I am confident that this will happen. It is terrible to be obliged to keep going on about something. However, sometimes that is what it takes. A sculpture cannot be completed with just one blow of the hammer against the chisel. Many such blows are required. Even battering rams do not breach the gates of citadels with the first impact. Persistence, patience, good humour and ordinary English are required in order to ensure that things change.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Ireland will have 8% fewer seats in the European Parliament after May. Let us insist that the candidates for Europe should agree a pre-election pledge to the effect that those of them who are successful in obtaining seats will do as I have suggested. What we are seeking is a write-down of €53 billion, some €28 billion of which will take the form of the cancellation of long-term bonds. The latter would replace the promissory notes, which have always been odious, unjustified and lacking in both credibility and validity. The banks will then need approximately €25 billion in order that they can really get on with the job. The €53 billion to which I refer is just over half of the total losses of €100 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I have outlined what is needed in ordinary English. Ireland has an opportunity to create a team of 11 people who can operated in an effective manner in order to win something for the country.</p>

Many issues were raised in the context of the electoral system and with regard to the matters that are going to inform what will be a very keenly contested campaign.

          <p eId="para_220">Yesterday VHI Healthcare announced its fourth price increase in three years. I have no doubt that other health insurers will follow suit in the near future. It could be perceived that this Government is in cahoots with insurers in efforts to drive as many families as possible out of the health insurance market. More than 6,000 people a month are giving up private health insurance. The number leaving exacerbates the problem of providing a sustainable health insurance model. This Government has committed to the implementation of universal health insurance but all policies pursued by the Government have undermined families in their efforts to retain their private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Last night I raised the issue of the costs charged by some private hospitals to private health insurers. In one case a private hospital billed an insurance company €17,000 for one night's accommodation with a bill of €2,000 for surgical procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The Tánaiste's policy for universal health insurance would ensure that as many people as possible would retain private health insurance while the Government would pay the premiums for those who cannot afford to pay. However, the situation seems to be unsustainable. Families are making decisions on whether they will stop paying for private health insurance or else not fill the tank with oil or gas or make other basic cuts in household expenditure in order to fund that private health insurance. This expenditure on private health insurance is not a luxury. The Government encourages people to take out private health insurance but every other policy decision undermines them.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Will the Minister for Finance reverse the cap on tax relief for private health insurance, in view of the fact he said only gold-plated health insurance policies would be affected? On the contrary, it is affecting every family in this country currently attempting to retain their private health insurance. Will he reverse that attack on ordinary families?</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_224">The recession has been very tough on working families. The last thing families need now is an increase in the cost of private health insurance. At a time of increasing competition in the market and with new players seeing the opportunity for themselves, I share the wonder expressed by many people as to why prices are going up and not down. The Deputy will be aware that the Government has no legal power to intervene in the pricing set by VHI or any other insurer. However, we are very concerned about the cost of standard health insurance for hard-pressed families. That is the reason the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, set up a consultative forum under an independent chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with health insurers, the Department of Health and the Health Insurance Authority on the issue of containing costs. Mr. McLoughlin's report on the first phase of this work was published on 26 December 2013. He has started on the next phase of the work which is a study in greater depth of the key drivers of rising costs and how these can be addressed. He will report within three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The first McLoughlin report on costs made recommendations in a number of areas, including adopting a co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling fraud in the industry. It published data on funds recovered from hospitals and consultants. The report also calls on the industry to fund a whistleblower initiative to assist in uncovering fraud. The report acknowledges the important role of clinical audit in identifying unnecessary claims. It is vital the industry makes best use of this tool to address rising costs. The report calls on insurers to make better use of existing information sources to challenge payments, in particular in respect of the most appropriate places for providing treatment, to ensure patients receive quality treatment at the lowest possible cost. Implementation of the policy of money following the patient will support this action by replacing daily charges with case-based charging.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Addressing the age structure of the private health insurance market is also important. The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is considering measures to encourage more young people into the market, including the introduction of lifetime community rating to encourage younger people to take out private health insurance. The industry can make better use of existing legislation by discounting premiums for full-time students under the age of 23. The report also makes a number of recommendations about the processing of claims and admission and discharge procedures. The Minister is committed to progressing these recommendations in consultation with stakeholders. The Minister supports Mr. McLoughlin's recommendations and is committed to making progress in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">We appreciate the Tánaiste sharing in the wonder but we would much prefer if he shared the responsibility for the escalating costs of private health insurance. Every Government policy is inflating the cost of private health insurance for hard-pressed families. I agree that because of the recession there is high unemployment and the country is in difficulty. The bottom line is that the Minister for Finance, with one fell swoop, drove thousands of people out of the private health insurance market. The spurious claim that this would only affect gold-plated health insurance policies is not credible. Every family in the country will be affected by the cap on tax relief. The Tánaiste's reply to my question gives no comfort to any family deciding whether private health insurance can be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Does the Tánaiste agree that the Government is undermining the health insurance market? The debt spiral continues and hard-pressed families are finding it increasingly difficult to retain private health insurance. The Government's policy is undermining intergenerational solidarity, community rating and the subsidising of the old by the young. I ask the Tánaiste to reverse the tax relief cap and consider introducing a policy to attract young people into the private health insurance market before it crumbles.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">There is a problem of rising premia costs in the private health insurance market. The Government is taking its responsibilities seriously with regard to rising health insurance costs. As a consequence, the Minister for Health established the forum under the chairmanship of Mr. McLoughlin. The initial report identifies a number of areas that need to be tackled and addressed. A further body of work is under way and will report within three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> There are a number of aspects to the issue of rising costs in the health insurance market, one of which was instanced by Deputy Kelleher. I do not understand why a health insurance company should receive a bill for €17,000 for one night in a hospital. This is one of the issues which needs to be examined.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">By any standards, Louise O'Keeffe is an extremely courageous woman. Abused as a young child and, no doubt, deeply traumatised as a result, blocked, bullied, browbeaten and threatened by the State, she never lay down. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights and that court ruled this week that the Irish State is directly liable for the inhuman and degrading treatment of an eight year old girl. It further ruled that this State offered that girl, now an adult, no remedy for that abuse. The court could have gone much further. It could have said, correctly, that this State prevented any degree of fairness, justice or resolution of this case for Louise O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Responsibility and liability of this State in this case has now been firmly established.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I hear that the Taoiseach has, in the past few minutes, said some words of apology to Louise, which is welcome. It should be said, however, that given the enormity of the wrong done to this woman and to others, those words of apology should have been uttered in this Chamber. Can the Tánaiste tell me whether that apology extends to those other victims of abuse in primary schools? I understand 135 other adults brought cases similar to that of Louise O'Keeffe claiming the Department of Education and Skills and the State did not provide protection and had a liability for the abuse they suffered. As the Tánaiste knows, following the Supreme Court judgment in 2008 in the case taken by Ms O'Keeffe, they received threatening letters telling them they would face legal costs unless they dropped their cases. Is that threat now removed? Can the Tánaiste tell me why last year the Government argued before the European Court of Human Rights that this State had no liability for what happened to children like Louise O'Keeffe? How is it that officials and counsel were sent, on the behalf of the State and this Government, to again attempt to face down this courageous woman?</p>

          <p eId="para_243">Louise O'Keeffe should never have been subjected to abuse. She should have had a carefree childhood. Her case reminds us of the shocking scale of historical abuse, failures and inaction to protect children. I admire Louise O'Keeffe and I join with the Taoiseach in apologising to her for what happened in that school and for the horrendous experience she had to go through. We now have the judgment from the European Court of Human Rights, which is a very substantial one of about 82 pages, and we will discuss it at the Government meeting next Tuesday.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> This Government has addressed clearly and comprehensively the whole issue of the protection of children. It is absolutely and without question a priority for the Government. We have created a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs and have held a referendum on children's rights. Within the education sector, all schools are required to adhere to child protection procedures which give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in the implementation of Children First when dealing with allegations and suspicions of child abuse. All primary schools now fully implement the Stay Safe programme, which plays a valuable role in helping children to develop the skills necessary to enable them to recognise and resist abuse and potentially abusive situations. </p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The Child and Family Agency is being officially launched today. It will be the first agency dedicated to supporting our children and families and to promoting the development, welfare and protection of our children. The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has published updated Children First guidelines and led a national effort to improve awareness of the need to report child protection concerns, leading to a major increase in reports which are up by one third on 2011. The Minister has also published the heads of the Children First legislation and the revised Bill will be published in March. The legislation will place obligations on professionals and organisations working with children to report suspected child protection concerns, to share information and to engage in inter-agency and multi-disciplinary working. The Minister for Justice and Equality has also commenced the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and it is now the responsibility of every member of society to protect and defend children from sexual and other abuse. </p>
          <p eId="para_246"> It is no longer acceptable, and it should never have been, that secrecy or ignorance on the part of those with knowledge of what were criminal offences could protect those who perpetrated those crimes. As I said, we will consider the implications of the judgment at the Government meeting on Tuesday.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">Not alone should Louise O'Keeffe not have suffered abuse at the tender age of eight in what should have been a very safe environment of her primary school, she should not have been harangued, bullied and threatened by the State. I am sure the Tánaiste will agree with me on that point but that is precisely what happened through the High Court, the Supreme Court and as far as the European Court of Human Rights. It was the Tánaiste's Government that argued the case against Louise O'Keeffe as recently as a year ago. That draws a very serious question over what he said in terms of child abuse being a historical issue. He lists the many legislative achievements, and I applaud them. They are long overdue and very necessary but so too is the necessary sea-change in terms of how the State responds to the Louise O'Keeffes of this world. There is an established pattern that the State and Government close ranks and try to shut down any call for justice from people like Louise O'Keeffe.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">Let it be said that all of the protections which now exist and are contemplated are a direct result of brave people like Louise O'Keeffe stepping forward. Can the Tánaiste answer my question? I asked him whether the Taoiseach's apology and his apology extends to all victims of abuse in primary schools. I would like to hear him say clearly that his Government and the State now fully accept that the State has a liability for the abuse suffered by all of these survivors and that it has a liability for any current or future instances of abuse of that nature.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">As the Deputy knows, the Supreme Court handed down a judgment on this case, I think, in 2009, certainly some time before we came into office. That was the legal position at the time. The Deputy raised the issue about the State accepting liability for current and future cases in terms of what happens in our schools. There are very significant implications in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. We have had a system in this country of schools operating under a system of patronage. My understanding of the Supreme Court judgment in 2009 was that it accepted that system of patronage and, therefore, ultimate liability did not rest with the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights has very serious implications for the relationship between the State and the patronage of our schools. As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Education and Skills has already undertaken a process of considering the whole issue of patronage of our schools. That issue will now be given an added significance by the judgment in this case. That is one of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The Deputy raised the situation in terms of current and future responsibility by the State. That is among the issues that Government will have to consider arising from this judgment. The implications of it are profound for the patronage system of schools and for the relationship between the State and patrons of schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">The policies of successive Governments have allowed an elite golden circle of the rich and powerful in this country to obtain obscene levels of wealth at a time when the vast majority of people have seen their incomes reduced and have been struggling day in, day out to make ends meet. The message from last week's meeting in Davos and from the Paris School of Economics is that Irish society is becoming more unequal. We are hearing the same message from Oxfam, the Central Statistics Office and the Economic and Social Research Institute. That message is supported by the fact that many of the consultants who recently received substantial payments from Irish Water are the same companies and individuals who were paid for bad advice and bad oversight during the boom. The message is further reinforced by the payment of bonuses, the breach of pay limits for Government advisers and the payment of huge pensions. The list goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> In a recent study, the Paris School of Economics showed that the wealthiest 1% of people in Ireland own 10% of national income. Ireland is the seventh worst, in inequality terms, of the 18 countries studied. The figures for accumulated wealth are even more significant and stark. The wealthiest 5% of families in this country own 47% of the wealth. Since this Government came to power, the wealthiest 300 individuals in this country have gained €9 billion, or €30 million each. According to the Central Statistics Office, the incomes of the wealthiest 10% of people in Ireland have increased during the course of the recession, while the incomes of the other 90% of people have decreased. That fall has accelerated as incomes have declined.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I have just learnt of the passing of our colleague, John Carty from Mayo, who served with many of us in this House. I extend my sympathies and those of the Fianna Fáil Party to his wife Kathleen and his family.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> There is an alcohol crisis among our young people. There are several Bills in the Government's programme regarding the sale of alcohol. When will they come forward, in view of the fact that senior clinicians throughout the country are saying that young people continually binge drink? The figures are quite alarming and the health implications are even more alarming. When will those Bills come to the House? The legislation also covers minimum pricing units for alcohol.</p>

        <heading>Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014: First Stage<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T12:50:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_482">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_483">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for a system of examinership that will reduce the costs and time involved for companies falling below certain threshold sizes, by amending the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Bill seeks to improve the examinership process. It seeks to build on some good work the Minister has already done in moving the examinership process from the High Court to the Circuit Court. I am working with senior counsel on putting the Bill together and with a solicitor, Barry Lyons, who has handled over half of the examinerships that have taken place in Ireland over the last 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The problem with the current examinership process, for many companies that are viable, is that it is too expensive and can cost north of €150,000, and that creditors can act in a mischievous manner and can keep the company in court and essentially muscle it out of the examinership process. In the process, there are foreign banks looking to get out of the country which have security on something called on-demand loans. What is happening to many viable small and medium companies throughout the country is that an examiner - an independent accountant - is appointed, the courts approve the examinership process so the jobs and the company can be saved, but the bank insists on security against the asset. The bank activates the on-demand nature of the asset and, in doing so, forces the viable company to try to borrow far more money than it can in these capital constrained times.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The Bill addresses all of these issues. What the Bill does is to bring the examiner, the directors of the company and the creditors together outside of the courts, so they do not incur all of those costs. It allows for a quasi-judicial process where there is recourse to the courts at any stage for any party. We have put a clause into the legislation which means the court ultimately must give approval and rubber-stamp it. However, instead of all of the parties having to go to court armed with their various counsel and, therefore, costing everybody a lot of money, the method is much more like the new insolvency service, where the papers, if non-contested, go to the court, the judge makes sure everything is in order and then gives judicial approval and judicial authority to the examinership process.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> It is my belief that if this Bill can be taken on and brought into law some time this year, there are many small and medium enterprises across the country that can be saved that otherwise will not be saved. I will not be presenting the Bill as a <i>fait accompli</i>. I accept it will need to be improved through the legislative process. Obviously, as I am not a Cabinet member, I do not have access to the Attorney General's office or to the sort of policy weight the Cabinet would have. The Bill will be presented here on Tuesday on Second Stage and I would very much welcome the expertise of the Government and the Civil Service in getting it right, ensuring it is constitutional and ensuring it does not unfairly prejudice various parties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The people who, with me, have put this Bill together have, I believe, more expertise in this area than anyone in the country. We have worked very hard on it. We have had some very generous input from the Minister. I do not know whether he will accept the Bill but, certainly, it is our belief that if this Bill is accepted through Second Stage, and if it can be amended as necessary to guard for its constitutionality and to bring in whatever other good ideas Members of the House may have, there are many jobs that can be saved and fantastic companies which will be able to successfully avail of the examinership process, which they are not currently able to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I welcomed and voted for what the Minister did in December, which was to move the process from the High Court to the Circuit Court. This is the next step. This is the step that says we can reduce the cost of examinership from, say, €150,000 to €20,000, and we can reduce the re-financing requirements post-examinership. I will be sending Deputies an explanatory memorandum, a question and answer sheet and the draft Bill in the next 48 hours or so. We have a worked example which shows that under the current legislation the company would have to re-finance approximately €400,000 whereas under the new legislation it would have to find some €70,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> As I said, I am not presenting this as a perfectly finished piece of legislation as, obviously, I do not have the resources to do that. However, it is being presented in a spirit of co-operation, although I accept some aspects will have to change. I hope the Minister and the Government will have a think about whether this can pass Second Stage and whether, over this year, we can work to tick the boxes, make it work and, I believe, save an awful lot of jobs in this country over the next few years.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">This is becoming a bit of a tradition for me when I stand up to speak. Not only was the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the position of speaking on legislation in the House in which the Opposition benches were empty, this must be the fifth or sixth time when I have done so. I have raised this before. It shows the height of disrespect to the House. I know it is a procedural matter but Opposition spokespersons should at least show courtesy to the presence of the Minister of State, to the House itself, to the legislation coming before the Dáil and more importantly, to the industry itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> This industry creates and sustains thousands of jobs across the country. There are waves of empty seats here on the Opposition side and there is no interest being shown in it These are the same people who disrupted business this morning on a procedural issue for things that were discussed at committees. It makes a total farce out of the operation of the House if we do not have the co-operation of the Opposition. There are about half a dozen Whips over there and they are all in receipt of allowances. It flies in the face of what parliamentary democracy is supposed to be about. It is supposed to be a two-way street, and that is very unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> This is an important Bill in every constituency because there is not a town or a village in Ireland that does not have a bookmaker. There is practically no county that does not have a racetrack for horses - I know you have a great affinity with that industry, a Cheann Chomairle - or for greyhounds. In Limerick we are very fortunate to have two outstanding facilities for horse racing and greyhounds. The focus in this Bill is on the funding of the horse and greyhound industry and the difficulties that they have sustained over a number of years, but there is a bigger issue here in respect of the funding of sport in its entirety, including facilities. I welcome the fact that the Government has brought forward a new round of national lottery funding this year but this Bill goes some way to addressing the shortfall of funding that is available for the horse and greyhound industry in particular. We know that the Bill is primarily targeted at the creation of two new licences for remote bookmakers and remote betting intermediaries. That captures a type of betting that heretofore was not captured, and it is a good thing that they can brought under the remit of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> The number of jobs being sustained by the industry is staggering. It is a €1 billion industry for horse racing alone, sustaining over 17,000 people in employment, and about 11,000 people work in the greyhound industry. There are facilities all over the country, in which the State has made a huge investment. If there was a Bill for any other industry that was worth so much, the Opposition might show a bit more interest in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> One aspect that concerns me - I know the Minister will take it on board - is in respect of problem gambling. The Bill does address it as it is under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality but perhaps the Minister of State might bear in mind the concern about people who show above normal levels of gambling activity. It is a very difficult social ill for many people. The industry is behaving responsibly and does its best to watch out for people. However, it has created problems in many homes across the country and I ask that in future, discussions between the Minister of State's Department and the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Equality would focus on this issue to alleviate problems before they arise. For many people it is a very unfortunate addiction, but at the same time it is a part of the fabric of what we are as Irish people that we have a great affinity with sport. In rural areas, we have a great affinity with the horse and greyhound industry. The revenue that heretofore remained outside the ambit of the legislation and was uncollected should go some way to ensure that the industry can be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Deputy Brian Walsh and I raised the issue of opening hours a while back, on behalf of bookmakers across the country, in order to provide a level playing field. Where a bookmaker might close at 6.30 p.m. while an online operation could continue through the night, we now have some parity of esteem. However, the main thrust of the Bill is to bring in revenue that could not be collected until now, and to bring in operations that are in a vacuum under a legislative umbrella. It will allow for increased funding to be made available to both the horse and greyhound industry, but as I said at the outset, there is a bigger issue in respect of the funding of sport and rural pursuits especially. I ask that the Minister and the Minister of State bear that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I will finish by noting the empty seats of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, and their interest in the horse and greyhound industry, the gambling issue and the betting issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Walsh<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_637">I thank the Government Whip for allowing me the time to speak on this important Bill. It is a very important Bill which will facilitate taxing of online betting for the traditional bookmakers who operate here and for the relatively new practice of betting exchange businesses like Betdaq and Betfair, who have been winning an ever increasing percentage of the betting turnover in the State. All of the major bookmakers who operate online services here are domiciled in other countries, which effectively means that they avoid having to pay the 1% betting tax on bets that are placed. I remember that tax in the past being as high as 10%. It was funded by the punter himself, but as a result of a considerable reduction in the tax over the years, it is now absorbed by the betting industry. In fairness, the betting exchanges are willing to embrace this legislation and see it as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Turnover over the past few years has fallen sharply, from €5.4 billion in 2006 to around €2 billion in 2013 and part of the reason is the downturn in the economy. People have less disposable income to direct towards betting activity but a considerable factor is that more and more people are availing of betting opportunities online with betting exchanges and even with traditional bookmakers. It is more convenient to do so and the traditional high street bookmaker is suffering as a result, with more and more of these shops consolidating their operations. The bigger players such as Paddy Power, Boylesports and Ladbrokes are all purchasing the smaller independent and multiple bookmakers, and in many cases they close the shops and consolidate their existing high street businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> There are now greater online betting opportunities available. I remember on budget day some of the staff here in the Oireachtas telling us about opportunities to bet on what colour tie the Minister would wear, or how many sips of water he would take from his glass, the length of his speech and so on. I can give the Minister of State some comfort as he is long odds on to retain his seat in Louth, according to the bookmakers, who rarely get it wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">Even in horse racing, there are opportunities to bet on the number of horses that will fall or the winning distances. All of these are available online and we would not associate them with our traditional bookmaker. It is very important that such revenue is not lost to the State, and that is what this legislation allows us to do. It allows us to avail of the 1% levy on all bets that are placed by people domiciled here in Ireland. It is important that we capture that income.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Traditionally, and in recent years in particular, the 1% levy has been ring-fenced for the benefit of the horse racing industry. This approach should continue once the legislation to facilitate the taxation of online betting services is enacted and revenue accruing from the levy increases. This additional revenue, which will probably be a multiple of the current income, should be ring-fenced for the horse racing industry because it is in crisis, with attendances at meetings declining significantly and many racetracks in need of significant investment. While some tracks such as Leopardstown, Galway and Punchestown, which hold large festival meetings, continue to do well, many smaller racetracks are suffering and require capital investment. Further legislation will be required to capture the 1% levy in the online betting business.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> As Deputy O'Donovan and other speakers noted, horse racing is an important industry. Betting, horse and greyhound racing and related industries employ more than 30,000 people. Horse racing is arguably one of the sports at which Ireland is most successful internationally. The Coolmore Stud, for example, breeds some of the best flat racing stock in the world and most of the top jockeys operating in Ireland and the United Kingdom are Irish. Tony McCoy recently achieved a phenomenal feat when he rode a winner for the 4,000th time. McCoy is constantly breaking records. Mick Kinane, another Irish jockey on the flat, won all the various group races over the years. Ireland has recorded many significant sporting achievements in horse racing. It is important, therefore, that the industry is protected and receives investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware, Galway hosts a highly successful racing festival each year. The event is worth in excess of €60 million to the local economy over the course of festival week and must be protected and enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> Funding must be made available to look after horse owners, the lifeblood of the industry without whom one would not have any activity. A different Department is considering the introduction of a ban on the sponsorship of sporting events by alcohol companies. While this proposal has merit in respect of certain sports, the horse racing industry traditionally attracts a more mature audience than other sports and horse racing meetings are not often attended by youngsters. The industry should be protected. Drinks companies sponsor all the major races at meetings held at the large tracks such as Galway, Punchestown, Leopardstown and Fairyhouse. A cloud hangs over the future revenue stream from sponsorship by alcohol companies and the State should invest heavily in the horse racing industry given its importance to the wider economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> I welcome the Bill and look forward to the subsequent enactment of legislation required to capture revenue from online betting. I commend the Government on introducing the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_647">One of the few times I ventured into a bookmaker's shop was when my namesake, Anne Ferris, rode the winner of the Irish Grand National in 1984. While I cannot remember what I did with my winnings, I remember remarking at the time that there were not many women customers in the shop, despite the fact we had just had the first female winner of the country's greatest horse race. For some reason, bookmaker's shops mainly attract male customers, despite the dire warnings issued by a fellow parliamentarian in June 1931 when debating the legislation that is being amended in this Bill. Speaking on the 1931 Betting Bill, Independent Senator, William Barrington, was concerned about the risk legitimising betting shops would pose for the morals of Irish women. He stated the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_648">Cases have been mentioned to me of most respectable men whose wives were bitten with this gambling craze. These men hand their wages to their wives; the women go to the betting offices; they neglect their children, their houses, and their husbands, and they keep betting all day.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">From the point of view of the morals of women, the words of Senator Barrington make me smile a little. Similar warnings echoed through this House during debates on other controversial legislation that would purportedly destroy society as we know it but subsequently failed to do so. The legislation on contraception and divorce and, most recently, on the protection of the lives of pregnant women all passed through the House without the roof caving in. Debate on other ostensibly controversial legislation, such as measures to grant access to adoption records and give gay people the right to marry, will undoubtedly follow the same pattern in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> There is, however, one aspect of Senator Barrington's warning from the past that we should not ignore. Gambling is addictive and families often endure serious pain and suffering because a breadwinner or carer is addicted to betting. Gamblers can become thieves to feed their addiction. The secrecy involved in gambling on the Internet in the privacy of one's home no doubt feeds the addiction of as many modern women as men. While it is probably the case that only a small percentage of Internet gamblers become addicts, online betting can do considerable damage. More openness and awareness of addiction is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> I welcome the proposal to extend the betting tax to Internet gambling. A portion of this revenue stream should be ring-fenced to fund addiction counselling and charities that do good work caring for the families of gambling addicts. Owing to the risk of addiction and the wider problems it creates in society, Irish betting legislation has always been cautious about children being involved in gambling. The Bill before us follows this pattern. Since the 1926 Betting Act and the subsequent Betting Act of 1931, bookmakers who accepted a bet from a child under 18 years committed an offence. The Bill goes further by also prohibiting the acceptance of a bet from a minor. It provides that where a 17 year old enters a bookmaker's shop pretending to be 18 years or older and places a bet, he or she will have committed an offence. While I agree with the spirit behind this measure, namely, the need to discourage and prevent young people from engaging in addictive behaviours, whether drinking, smoking or gambling, I am concerned that it criminalises young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> I agree that the fault should not fall only on the bookmaker if a customer misrepresents himself or herself and a fine should be imposed for such behaviour. It is important, however, that we also create a general awareness of the way in which the fine is applied. As it will not be an on-the-spot fine of €60, if it is to be applied, the young person must be brought before a court and convicted. I would prefer if our legislation did not criminalise young people so readily. I accept, however, that there is no other way of managing this issue until we either legislate to allow gardaí to apply on-the-spot fines or require young people to carry identity cards at all times, as is the case in many other countries. I urge the Minister to take account of my reservations about this aspect of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> This is not the only legislation that can result in young people finding themselves convicted in courtrooms. Where possible, we must find new ways of dealing with minor offences under law. In this regard, I look forward to discussion and debate about methods of restorative justice and community service orders. I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on its introduction.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_654">I welcome this opportunity to speak to the Bill. The legislation is framed to ensure fair and equal treatment of all bookmakers and betting exchanges offering services in this State. It will bring into the licensing and taxation regime all remote bookmakers and betting exchanges. This new licensing system for remote operators will serve the important public interest of preventing crime and protecting consumers against fraud and ensure all businesses offering betting services from Ireland or to persons in Ireland are regulated appropriately. The Bill amends, for that purpose, the Betting Act of 1931, which contains the existing provisions governing licensing of conventional bookmakers. Once enacted, any bookmaker offering bets to punters within the State must be licensed to do so and must have paid the appropriate licence fee, with all bets taken being subject to betting duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The horse racing and breeding sector contributes approximately €1 billion annually to the economy, employing in excess of 16,000 people and is responsible for exports worth €174 million. There is a network of 26 racecourses located in 19 different counties which are capable of hosting national hunt and flat race meetings. Our racecourses offer a year-round programme of racing events giving major financial boosts to local economies. As stated by Deputy Walsh, horse racing provides a significant boost to the economies of places like Galway, Punchestown, Leopardstown, The Curragh and smaller areas such as Bellewstown and Ballinrobe and provides employment for many people. </p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The Irish horse breeding sector is an important success story within the national economy. Irish breeders are responsible for 42% of all thoroughbred foals in Europe. In 2008, we exported a total of 6,222 thoroughbred horses, worth a combined total of €126.8 million, to 42 different countries. It is safe to say that Ireland is a world leader in horse racing with national hunt jockeys like Tony McCoy, who recorded a landmark 4,000 winners last year on a horse called Mountain Tunes for his boss J.P. McManus and trainer, Jonjo O'Neill. Tony McCoy is an iconic figure in racing, having won the Gold Cup on Synchronised and the Grand National on Don't Push It. He is a role model for all jockeys and people in the industry. We also have the hugely talented Ruby Walsh and the emerging talent Bryan Cooper, who recently signed for Gigginstown stud. I wish him all the best. We have excellent trainers such as Willie Mullins, Gordon Elliott, Noel Meade and Charlie Swan. On the flat scene, Ireland has world dominating trainers like Aidan O'Brien, Jim Bolger and Dermot Weld, with jockeys such as Joseph O'Brien, Johnny Murtagh, Kieran Fallon and Richard Hughes, who is currently a champion jockey in England.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> The Irish greyhound racing industry supports 10,000 full and part-time jobs and injects €500 million into the economy each year. As with the Irish horse, the Irish greyhound is regarded as a world leader. It is important that both industries are properly funded and supported to sustain and grow jobs. Bringing betting exchanges into the taxation system makes sense, particularly in the context of the changed betting environment with smartphones and tablets. It is important revenue collected under this legislation is ring-fenced for the support of horse racing and greyhound industries, which will as a result become self-sustaining, thus protecting jobs in the sector and giving a much needed boost to the economies of many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> The Bill provides for the extension of the opening hours of registered bookmakers' from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. all year round, with the exception of Good Friday and Christmas day. This is a welcome provision, which has been called for by the industry for a long time and brings us into line with other jurisdictions such as the UK. </p>
          <p eId="para_659"> I welcome this Bill and look forward to its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I commend the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_660">I welcome the Bill. I note that many greyhound tracks are under pressure financially and that this Bill will allow for the raising of additional revenue which, hopefully, will be channelled in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> There is an overlap in respect of betting and gambling between the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance. I would like to speak first about a concern brought to the attention of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. According to the Gaming and Leisure Association of Ireland, GLAI, there are 20,000 unlicensed gaming machines in operation in this country across a number of unlicensed venues. It cites the reason for this as the conflicting regulatory regimes currently in operation. While holders of gaming licences must adhere to strict operational criteria, including mandatory inspections and reporting, holders of amusement licences are required only to hold a tax clearance certificate and are not subject to mandatory inspections of their properties. The Gaming and Leisure Association maintains that this is unfair to the people operating gaming licences in accordance with the law. I would welcome the Minister's at some stage clarifying the facts surrounding this issue, the role of the Revenue Commissioners in this matter and whether the State is losing a considerable amount of money because of this anomaly. It is, perhaps, an issue that should be addressed in the context of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> It could well be that the current legislative regime is adequate. If so, why then is it not being enforced and is the State losing a considerable amount of money because of this and putting pressure on the people who are operating gaming licences properly? I understand that information on this matter has been submitted to various Departments by the GLAI. The association is deeply concerned about this matter and has proposed the introduction of amusement licences in both respects. This matter is also relevant in the context of the gambling control Bill currently under consideration by the Department of Justice and Equality. The association believes that a lot will be achieved by way of clear and simple definitions of these licences and that further discussion on definitions is required. </p>
          <p eId="para_663"> In regard to the proposed establishment of a gaming regulation authority, it could also have a role in this area. Clarity on the proposed licensing regime is required urgently as there are many operators under pressure financially because of this anomaly in the system. I would welcome the Minister's at some stage giving a considered response in the Dáil or in committee to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Reference was made to online accounts, deposits and unclaimed winnings, etc. There are issues around that which also need to be tidied up. I hope the Departments of Justice and Equality and Finance, in terms of the overlap between them in relation to gambling and betting, co-operate in relation to this Bill and the proposed gambling control Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_665">I welcome the Bill. In many of our small towns, and some of the bigger ones, bookmakers and hairdressers are the only surviving businesses. I welcome the proposed tax on online betting, whether that be with Betdaq, Betfair or Paddy Power. I always believed the Exchequer was losing an enormous amount of revenue in this area. With online banking, it is now much easier to place a bet by way of an iPhone, iPad or a computer. This means bookmakers have to do much more to compete. I welcome that following enactment of this legislation when a person wins, for example, €100, by way of an online bet with, for instance, Betfair, the 3% commission charged by Betfair in respect of that win will now be subject to a 15% commission charge, money which will go to the Exchequer. I hope this provision will result in huge revenue for the State. While the amount likely to be collected is as yet unquantified, I believe it could be as much as €20 million. I suspect it will be much more. I hope I am right.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> I congratulate the Minister on his work in this area. I welcome the extended opening hours for registered bookmakers from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. This is innovative legislation, for which the departmental officials should be credited.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">There are difficulties with online betting because one could go into an exchange or go online to play roulette, cards or whatever. It is a major issue and one that has not been tackled enough. We should remind ourselves that gambling is an issue people do not talk about. It is a cause for concern that a man or woman can gamble unquantifiable amounts of money in his or her home. This must be examined by Government and people must be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> I welcome the 15% duty and the 3% online betting duty. I did not think it could be done, but the fact is that the Government has brought in this licensing initiative and enterprises must be licensed to compete or operate in Ireland. I congratulate the Government. I believe the measure will bring in a good deal more than the €20 million that has been earmarked because there is a good deal of online gambling which we do not know about.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O'Dowd)<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_669">I thank all the Deputies for the welcome they have given to the Bill and for their considered contribution to the debate. While the Bill deals with the regulation of the remote gambling sector and provides the basis for the fair and equal tax treatment of all bookmakers, whether traditional or remote, the debate has covered a wide range of related issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Several Deputies have commented on the delay in bringing the Bill before the House. There is good reason for this. What the Bill sets out to do, i.e. regulate and tax the remote sector, is remarkably challenging as we are dealing with a sector which, by its virtual nature, does not necessarily have a physical presence within our State. The Bill was originally published in July 2012 but further work was required around compliance and enforcement issues. The Bill was republished last July and was subject to a three month standstill under the EU technical standards directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> Concerns have been raised by several Deputies in respect of the regulation of the remote sector and the collection of taxes from companies which do not necessarily have a physical presence in the country. There is no doubt that the introduction of a licensing and tax regime for remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries, which in the majority of cases are based outside the jurisdiction, poses significant challenges in terms of enforcement and compliance. However, where a company is licensed by the authorities I believe it is likely to be tax compliant. In the case of companies which are not licensed but continue to offer services within the jurisdiction, the Bill provides a range of powers that may be deployed. If it is found that additional powers are required at any stage in this regard the Government will not hesitate to provide for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Several Deputies have commented on the level of betting duty currently in place and have called for an increase in the rate. The relatively low rate of duty is a function of the changes that have taken place in the bookmaking industry in recent years, in particular, the increase in the remote or online sector. The explosion in the use of mobile telephones, laptops and other electronic communication devices has greatly facilitated the migration of punters to the remote sector. Until the playing field for traditional and remote bookmakers has been levelled in so far as taxation is concerned the rate must be kept at low levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> The Bill will put in place a regulatory framework to allow for the extension of betting duty to the remote sector. This will permit the application of the 1% duty to licensed remote bookmakers and a 15% duty to the commission of licensed betting intermediaries. As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has always said, his priority has been to put in place a regulatory and licensing regime for the remote sector. When this is in place all other options around the level and type of tax involved in the betting industry can then be explored.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Several contributions have reflected on the impact of betting on the most vulnerable in our society. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, shares the views of many Deputies who believe we need to provide adequate protection for consumers. The supervision of operators providing online betting services is a first step in this direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Sections 4 and 5 provide that it will be an offence to offer betting services without a licence or to represent oneself as a licensed bookmaker. These sections provide for the relevant authorities to bring forward proceedings in such cases. As has already been pointed out, it is envisaged that the arrangements put in place by the legislation will be temporary in nature pending the putting in place of a comprehensive modern regulatory framework to cover all forms of gambling and afford the greatest protection to those who need it most. This will be achieved through the proposed gambling control legislation currently being prepared by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality. I understand the Minister is progressing that legislation with a view to publication early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> An integral part of the regulation of those operating within the system is the certificate of personal fitness required before a licence can issue. Grounds for refusal and revocation of these certificates are set out in section 12 and include where a person stands convicted of an offence under specified Acts in Ireland or elsewhere relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to the conduct of gambling; where an applicant who has formerly held a bookmaker's licence has in the past refused to pay sums due or conducted the business in a disorderly manner; where an applicant is not a fit and proper person under the Criminal Justice Acts; and where an applicant is the holder of a pawnbroker's licence or is a registered moneylender. These are important grounds for refusal or revocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Some Deputies have suggested that the additional tax raised should be earmarked to support those with gambling addiction issues or to continue to support the horse and greyhound racing industries. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is not in favour of hypothecated taxes. However, the additional revenues raised will allow the Government some scope to consider areas of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Again, I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate. As the Minister remarked in his opening statement, a small number of matters remain under consideration for inclusion on Committee Stage. The Minister is looking forward to a more detailed debate at that time.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_683">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, for taking this Topical Issue matter. My question relates to the status of the plans by Inland Fisheries Ireland for a fisheries-based salmon life centre in Ballina, County Mayo. In recent years, at the instigation of the North Western Regional Fisheries Board, one of the regional predecessors to Inland Fisheries Ireland, considerable taxpayers' money, staff time and resources were expended on plans to develop this project. Ballina is the ideal location for such a facility given its long history of salmon fishing, its reputation internationally as a major salmon angling centre and its official designation as salmon capital of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> The North Western Regional Fisheries Board commissioned a feasibility study for the visitor centre, which was carried out in 2008-2009 with the aid of funds provided by Fáilte Ireland, Ballina Town Council, Mayo County Council and the board itself, at a cost of some €50,000. The study found that the project had very good potential but did not come within the statutory remit of the fisheries board. It was considered more appropriate to have the town council lead the project, with technical input and support from the board. Following the abolition of the board in July 2010, Inland Fisheries Ireland took over all responsibilities, assets and liabilities of the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> IFI consistently maintained its support for the Ballina project and was fully represented on the planning committee that was formed. In fact, a representative of IFI attended all meetings of the committee, together with representatives of Ballina Town Council, Mayo County Council, Ballina Chamber of Commerce, Fáilte Ireland, the Irish Marine Institute and the Mayo north tourism committee. In August 2012, a joint delegation from IFI and Mayo County Council travelled to Norway to view a number of salmon visitor centres there. Informed by this visit, the county council drew up plans for a visitor centre to be located on its site in Ballina adjacent to the arts centre and overlooking the refurbished weir at the Ridge Pool. The plans were completed and approved through the council's Part 8 planning permission process just before Christmas. Issues remain in regard to management and running costs but these can be resolved in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> Given the expenditure and resources committed thus far to the development of the Ballina project, it was with surprise that I read at the beginning of the week in my local newspaper, <i>The Western People</i>, of IFI's plans to develop a €2 million fisheries-based interpretative visitor centre at the Cong salmon hatchery in south Mayo. Despite the shovel-ready project in Ballina that is only awaiting funding, IFI has apparently appointed consultants to examine the feasibility of establishing another interpretative centre at Cong, which is only 50 miles away. This seems an incredible instance of duplication and a waste of taxpayers' money. If the Cong salmon hatchery requires refurbishment, then it certainly should be done. I have no problem with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> The question does arise, however, as to the manner in which the board of management of IFI is operating. Is it within the statutory remit of IFI to develop such interpretative centres? The chairman, Brendan O'Mahony, who is from the Cong area, was formerly a member of the North Western Regional Fisheries Board and, as such, should have been very familiar with the Ballina project since its inception. What consultants have been appointed to the Cong project and what are their terms of reference? If the proposed centre at Cong proceeds, where will the €2 million in construction costs come from and who will cover the running costs? Why has Ballina Town Council not been consulted about the new plans?</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> With due respect to Cong, does the Minister of State consider it feasible to have two fisheries-based visitor centres not alone in the country but in one county? What is his view of the proposed further expenditure of public funds and resources? These questions must be answered in order to address the uncertainty surrounding the status of these projects. I urge IFI to retrieve the situation in the interests of fairness by publicly renewing its commitment to the Ballina salmon life centre and addressing outstanding issues of support, management and running costs with all the stakeholders who have already put so much into the project.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O'Dowd)<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_689">I thank Deputy Mulherin for raising this matter. I have discussed it with her on a previous occasion and I am aware, therefore, of its importance to her and to the people of Ballina. Her key question relates to what is going to happen with regard to the commitments that have been made in respect of the town. I intend to contact the chief executive of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, following this debate and arrange a meeting regarding all the issues the Deputy has raised. It is also my intention to attend that meeting, when it is held, in the company of the Deputy in order that we might obtain clarity in respect of the actual position.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> IFI owns and operates a fish hatchery which is located in the centre of Cong, County Mayo. It is carrying out a review of hatchery operations generally with a view to rationalising its operations and improving their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The primary focus of the proposal is business efficiency centred on rationalisation of the hatchery function and examining the feasibility of using existing capacity at Cong to yield efficiencies and cost savings in line with the Government's reform agenda. In developing these plans for its core business, IFI is keenly aware of the established educational potential of the Cong hatchery. In that regard and as a small component of the operational review, IFI has examined the possibility of expanding the visitor capacity within the existing facilities at Cong to further develop the policy of allowing limited school tours and facilitating experience and promotion of the inland fisheries resources, specifically brown trout, the rare ferox trout unique to the Cong area, and salmon. The resource and angling can be promoted and experienced by the public on an IFI existing site in an established visitor town with relatively modest investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> The existing hatchery in Cong has been in operation for many years. It was initially located in the old mill building and latterly its has operated as a rearing station. No significant material change is envisioned for scientific operational purposes for the site. It is expected that alterations may be required in terms of providing safe and suitable access, viewing and sanitary facilities, etc., for visitors. This is a working hatchery which is fully staffed and adjacent to some of the most prolific fisheries in the country, namely, the River Cong and the famous Lough Corrib, which is renowned for its wild brown trout fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> Cong is a vital link in the life cycle of the rare ferox trout, a separate species which originates in the waters around the town and which has existed in Lough Corrib since the ice ages. The value of promoting knowledge and understanding of this peerless species alone, on the back of a small investment in an overall business plan, is inestimable. IFI is also cognisant and supportive of the existing proposal for the development of a salmon life centre in Ballina. The feasibility study in respect of this proposed development was undertaken by Tourism Development International and was completed back in November 2008. IFI's commitment to Ballina is not in doubt and the importance of the River Moy to the salmon species and to inland fisheries is well recognised in the context of the investment by IFI of more than €1 million in the restoration and development of the iconic salmon weir in the centre of the town. I understand that this proposal was for a greenfield site and could be a very significant investment should the estimated €6 million to build the facility or, as the Deputy states, to make it shovel ready be secured. The salmon life centre would involve a joint development initiative which includes Mayo County Council, Ballina Town Council, IFI - in its role as the successor to the North Western Regional Fisheries Board - and Fáilte Ireland. The modest proposals for Cong in no way duplicate, replicate or usurp the much more involved and financially ambitious proposals relating to Ballina, which is famous for its salmon. Cong is famous for its unique and ancient species of trout.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> I again emphasise that this is a relatively minor element in the IFI operational proposals, which are based on seeking value for public funds in respect of one of its principal functions as the State agency responsible for the protection, development and management of wild fisheries. The long-term viability of the existing facility in Cong - as a working facility - is a priority and its development for ancillary activity is a modest but worthwhile by-product of a drive towards economic rationalisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">I thank the Minister of State. I am disappointed that IFI did not consider it necessary to discuss this proposition with the stakeholders in Ballina. There is a need to further tease out the issues, including those relating to costs. The headline in <i>The Western People</i> referred to plans to develop a €2 million interpretative centre, but IFI has not provided any details in respect of its plans. From what the Minister of State outlined, I accept there may just be a difference in scale in the context of the projects for Ballina and Cong. If improvements are needed at the facility in Cong, I welcome the fact they will be proceeded with, but the people of Ballina have invested a great deal of effort in respect of the salmon life centre project. As recently as last year, some of those involved with the project travelled to Norway to carry out research. We have both a site and planning permission and there is a need for IFI to engage with us to resolve the issues relating to Ballina. There was never any suggestion that IFI was going to be obliged to pay for the building of the centre in Ballina. The real issue relates to the management and running costs that will arise when the construction phase is completed. Such costs would obviously arise in respect of any project.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> There are questions which remain unanswered and it might be better, as the Minister of State suggests, for these to be teased out further with IFI. I would welcome it if he would ensure the meeting he intends to arrange will involve input from all the stakeholders in order that we might get to the bottom of this matter once and for all. I would also welcome it if IFI renewed its commitment to Ballina and if some positive developments were forthcoming.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for discussion, because it is important to people throughout the country, especially those in rural areas. Prior to Christmas, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, in the company of Mr. Christoph Mueller at the GPO, announced the renewal of the contract relating to the delivery of cash payment services to customers in receipt of social welfare. Said contract is worth €50 million per annum to An Post and it will obviously secure the position of sub-post offices throughout the country. The contract is for two years initially but can be renewed. Obviously, however, we must ensure the need to sustain post offices is recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> The programme for Government contains a specific commitment in respect of ensuring the sustainability of the post office network, which is a national and strategic asset. Commitments are easy to write and verbalise and they can easily morph into aspirations. To put flesh on the bones of the commitment to which I refer, there is a need for the Government to produce a comprehensive plan of action in respect of this matter. A whole-of-Government approach will be required in this regard, with each Department being obliged to have an input or make a submission. When this process is complete, the Government would formulate a cohesive plan of action and produce a report within six months or so. This matter cannot be placed on the long finger. A report must be produced, action must be taken and results delivered. All Departments should be obliged to identify new business opportunities they intend to pursue or existing businesses with which they are involved, the services relating to which could easily be provided by means of the post office network.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency, I have called for many years for the provision of a new banking service for people throughout the country. We are all aware of the many bank branches and sub-branches throughout the country - including in Westmeath and Longford - that have been closed. This has had a hugely negative impact on rural areas. The Government should examine the possibility of providing a banking service through the post office network and operated by An Post. Those who run An Post need to wake up and smell the coffee and be creative and forward thinking. They must rise to the challenge, and rather than always announcing the closure of post offices, they should seek to install electronic funds transfer facilities at all their 1,150 outlets. An Post offers a range of savings products on behalf of the State, via the NTMA. These products are very attractive in the context of encouraging people to save money. However, An Post must expand its operations and provide current account facilities, either on its own behalf or on behalf of certain of the banks. Some post offices provide such facilities but there are huge opportunities in the context of providing services on behalf of Departments, semi-State bodies and local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> Such areas should be considered with an open mind. A very great volume of business is available by means of online marketing and sales. An Post could play a key role in developing capacity to capture this niche market opportunity and be a delivery agent for same. The Government in conjunction with An Post should invest significant capital in these developments in the context of economic and social policy. The two policies cannot be divorced. Social policy is very important and it is very difficult to quantify it on a balance sheet. This is the problem with straight-line economics, quantification and cost-benefit analysis which are unable to capture and encompass the very important aspect of social policy. It discounts social policy and that is the big failing. The post office network has approximately 1,150 post offices available to carry out this work and with a high level of contact with the public. It provides services to 1.7 million people each week, including 800,000 social welfare customers. It is also an important focal point for public interaction. </p>
            <p eId="para_701"> Last March, the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications prepared a detailed and comprehensive report on promoting the sustainable future for the post office network. It represents a very good starting point for the production of a Government-led plan. The committee made a number of key recommendations which I support and I reiterate here. People have a genuine affection for the post office and the service it provides. Very often it is the main point of contact for people who live in rural isolation in particular. It plays a central role in the lives of people across rural and urban areas which explains why this is such an important issue. I urge the Minister of State to go back to the Minister to ensure that a plan is provided to tackle this problem once and for all.</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_702">On behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I wish to reassure the Deputy it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and to maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices. Operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are matters for the management and board of An Post and not ones in which the Minister has a statutory function. However, the Minister has a strong concern about the ongoing commercial position of the company and he regularly liaises with the company in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> I refer to a plan for the future sustainability of the post office network. The Minister welcomed last year's report of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on promoting a sustainable future for the post office network which he found both positive and ambitious. The Minister agrees with the thrust of that report which looked at the configuration of the post office network, the importance of Government contracts and suggestions for extra business for post offices. The pivotal financial and social role of the post office in local communities was acknowledged. The desirability of channelling more Government business through the network is an issue which is often raised. However, any such developments would need to be in compliance with EU procurement obligations and this aspect was acknowledged by the committee in its report.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country. The Minister has impressed on the company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard. He has been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins. In the context of the public sector transformation agenda, the Minister will continue to engage with his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Departments and agencies. He has stressed to his Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over-the-counter transactions. Any such developments would need to be subject to public procurement requirements as appropriate. Having invested in the computerisation of all post offices, the post office network is well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector. Overall, the Minister sees a strong future for the network by using its existing strengths to remain a significant player in the delivery of a wide range of services on a nationwide basis.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_705">The Irish Postmasters' Union commissioned a comprehensive report prepared by Grant Thornton. The report outlined in detail the possibility of expanding the range of services provided by An Post post office network. It set out a compelling case for the new services contracts as identified. An Post has the capacity to facilitate additional services. The recommendation from the joint committee was that the post office network could assume responsibility for the processing of motor tax renewals and hospital charges as well as water charges, property tax, business rates, rents and other Government payments services and the potential of the post office network to deliver a basic payment account as part of the financial inclusion strategy. I ask if there is some innate opposition at Government level. All Ministers, when asked, are wholeheartedly committed to ensuring the viability of the post office network so where is the problem?</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> There is an opportunity to make greater use of the post office network and we should set about seizing these opportunities. An Post has to be proactive and I acknowledge it has diversified into partnerships with AIB, One Direct and Aviva Insurance. The post office also facilitates payment of the property tax. It faces a challenge in the face of the significant decrease in letter and parcel post and the threat from electronic communications such as e-mails and texts. All the relevant Departments must recognise the social aspect of the post office network and this must be embedded as a core objective. The Departments should co-operate in the preparation of a comprehensive plan in conjunction with the board of An Post. I acknowledge the independence of the board and the need to comply with public procurement regulations. The Government should set about this work and report within six months. This would be a vital signal to the post office workers and the sub-post offices in rural Ireland because they feel threatened by the likes of letters from the Department of Social Protection indicating that payments for jobseeker's allowance and pre-retirement allowances will be lodged directly to bank or building society accounts. This is a silly policy. Clients should have the option of using a post office. I ask the Minister for Social Protection to ensure this option is available. Things wither and die if they are not used. This bureaucratic decision will mean that the post office may not have an opportunity to continue doing such business and continue to survive.</p>

            <p eId="para_707">I thank Deputy Penrose for his views and I assure him that I will bring them to the Minister. In 2012, revenue earned from Government business amounted to over €179 million, consisting of mails income at €50 million; election and referendum, €4 million; Department of Social Protection, €59 million; NTMA, €54 million; television and dog licences, €12 million; and other revenue, €0.8 million. As Deputy Penrose mentioned, there have been significant arrangements between An Post and AIB, and with Aviva, as well as the facilitation of payment of the property tax. Following a competitive tender process, An Post has been selected by the Department of Social Protection as the provider of over-the-counter cash services for social welfare customers. Deputy Penrose has made very valuable points in his contribution. He pointed out the social and community importance of retaining the post office network and the strong bond that exists between the post office and its customers, in particular, older people. An Post has many strengths and it is the largest retail presence in the country. The Minister will continue to impress on the company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">The petition for liquidation of Mount Carmel Hospital was <i>ex parte</i>. It was one-sided and it was by NAMA. There were two statements which resulted in the decision. One was that it was hopelessly insolvent while the other was that the 2013 results showed a disastrous trading year. However, this is not true because from October 2013 onwards, there had been a big turnaround as a result of increasing bed occupancy with the HSE relieving the problem by bringing in patients on the waiting lists. Some 2,300 patients were going to be decanted gradually into Mount Carmel Hospital for hospitalisation and after-care treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> There were two bids for the hospital to NAMA. One of them collapsed while the other one was for €14 million, €10 million of which would go to the creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners which had agreed to take its portion of that €10 million, and €4 million of which would go to NAMA. However, NAMA did not want the €4 million but wanted €6 million. For €2 million, the following is now the prospect. The VAT and PAYE for 328 employees amounts to approximately €7 million per year while jobseeker's benefit paid to the same number of staff would be €4 million per year, which is a total of €11 million per year. The redundancy payment from the Social Insurance Fund would be €8 million but that is a once-off payment. Contrast the €2 million extra NAMA sought with the €19 million lost to the public purse in year one, with €11 million per year thereafter. This begs the question as to what in God's name NAMA is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> There are 130 beds in Mount Carmel Hospital. Some 25 beds are for maternity, with 12 for mothers and 13 for babies, while there are 105 non-maternity beds. The figures do not stack up. The staff costs for the hospital are between 70% and 80% of turnover, which was €29 million. That means that 10% savings in one year would have been €2.3 million, which would have more than counterbalanced the €1 million lost in the last trading year.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> It is a bad mistake to close this hospital.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_715"> On the one hand, I do understand that to some it is just another business, a private hospital supported by NAMA and effectively owned by people who have less interest in the hospital than its potential for property development.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_716"> On the other hand, I cannot understand why nobody who might claim to have an interest in the social and political implications, let alone the economics of delivering on a commitment to a mix of private and public health care resources, seems to be doing anything to intervene.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_717"> Mount Carmel had a turnover of €29m last year and an accounting loss of about €1.05m.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_718"> With cost-saving measures in place this year, the hospital was on target to deliver a break-even result in 2014, with the possibility of making a small profit.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_719"> If the issue is debt, closure looks like an action driven by a short-sighted focus on immediate finance and a short-term view of where and how money is and should be invested in health care.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_720"> In the absence of the kind of engagement and discussion that is devoted to other enterprises, it appears to be facilitated by an ability to 'wash our hands' of what this means for the future of the staff, the patients and the longer-term public interest.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_721"> Earlier this week the minister was speaking about the reduction in public waiting lists. Mount Carmel treated many of these patients last year and was preparing to treat 1,200 more in the first few months of this year. These patients will now go back on to public waiting lists.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_722"> Mount Carmel is also currently caring for sick and elderly public patients who were being kept on trolleys in public hospitals. Some of those patients were transferred to Mount Carmel after their operations in the public system.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_723"> These patients will now be transferred back to the public hospitals to be 'cared for' on trolleys in A&amp;E.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_724"> As a country we bail out banks and we prop up loss making five-star hotels and golf clubs, and get exercised about some quite superficial concerns in the political and social arenas, yet allowing a fully functional hospital to close does not appear to be an issue worthy of the attention of anyone with the wit or will to help or care.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_725"> There were offers on the table for NAMA to consider up to last Thursday, two of which were apparently turned down by NAMA, who decided along with Gerry Conlon to go to the High Court and have a liquidator appointed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_726"> Surely it is in the public interest to sell the hospital as a going concern rather than fund redundancy and social welfare payments to over 300 staff.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_728">The closure of Mount Carmel Hospital has left its patients in an uncertain situation. As the Deputies have said, it will result in job losses. As a doctor and as Minister for Health, my primary concern must be the provision of quality care to patients. The HSE is continuing to work with the hospital to ensure patients' choices are respected, their immediate needs are met and there is a seamless transfer to another hospital. As a Minister, I am disappointed at the loss of jobs in Mount Carmel Hospital. I recognise that this is a difficult time for the staff. We will endeavour to support staff in their efforts to secure alternative employment. I have been informed by the HSE that an active process in that regard is ongoing as we speak. Many workers in the hospital have particular expertise that is highly sought after in the public system.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> As the House will be aware, following receipt of correspondence, a high-level examination was undertaken to assess the feasibility of the purchase of the hospital by the State as a going concern, taking account of the impact its closure might have on maternity service capacity. All evidence shows that birth rates have fallen significantly in recent years. According to the projections of the Central Statistics Office, they will continue to fall until the early 2020s, at least. In view of this evidence, the purchase of Mount Carmel Hospital could not be justified on the basis of a perceived deficit in maternity services capacity. We believe that any available funding would be more appropriately used to resource our current maternity services to ensure they can cope with any additional demand. As I announced in May of last year, it is intended to move the National Maternity Hospital from Holles Street and to co-locate it on the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus. This project, together with the development of the new maternity hospital that is to be tri-located on the St. James's Hospital campus, will give us an opportunity to provide additional capacity in the longer term if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_730"> The Deputies will be aware that one of my priorities as Minister for Health is the development of excellence in patient care and safety, thereby leading to better outcomes. It is recognised that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, and in the case of neonatology and foetal medicine should be tri-located with adult and paediatric services. There should also be a high volume of patient throughput in accordance with international norms. A low-volume, stand-alone maternity hospital such as Mount Carmel Hospital does not allow for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> Mount Carmel Hospital provides other inpatient services apart from maternity services. As others have said, during 2013 the HSE secured additional treatment capacity as necessary in Mount Carmel Hospital, as well as in other public and private hospitals. It is important to note that the projected number of treatments outsourced in these facilities represents less than 1% of the total number of annual scheduled outpatients appointments and less than 0.5% of the total number of inpatient and day-case appointments undertaken nationally. The HSE will continue to avail of the support and services offered by other public and private facilities where capacity is required and available.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> As I have said, I am committed to improving patient safety and outcomes across all areas of the health service. In this regard and with particular reference to maternity services, my Department is developing a new national maternity strategy which will determine the future model of services to ensure women have access to safe high-quality maternity care. This strategy will reflect the best available evidence to ensure all pregnant women can make appropriate and informed choices and can access the right level of care and support 24 hours a day. Arrangements are being made with alternative hospitals to ensure as seamless a transition as possible for the patients of Mount Carmel Hospital in accordance with their choices. All inpatients who are currently in the hospital will continue to receive all necessary and appropriate care until they are discharged.</p>

          <speech by="#PeterMathews" eId="spk_280">
            <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2014-01-30T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_733">I acknowledge and respect what the Minister has said. The bottom line is that this decision was made by NAMA after an offer of €14 million was received. I am reliably informed that €10 million would have been used to pay off the creditors and the remainder would have been available to meet NAMA's €6 million test. That means there is a differential of €2 million. As I have explained, there will be a loss of €19 million to the public purse in the first year following the closure of Mount Carmel Hospital, when factors such as the loss of jobs and staff are taken into account. Therefore, the net cost to the State of the decision not to proceed in this manner - all of the other aspects of this issue that have been mentioned also need to be considered - will be €17 million. That is not on.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> We need to hear the figures. NAMA needs to come in. I wanted a NAMA response to this Topical Issue matter rather than a medical response. The hospital's beds are being used to look after 2,300 patients on the waiting list. Some 1,100 public patients have been treated at the hospital already, thereby taking them off the waiting list. A further 1,200 patients are in the course of being treated and addressed, thereby taking them off the waiting list and relieving the pressure on trolleys. There were 309 people on trolleys in Dublin last Monday. Much of this pressure could be relieved. Thirteen or so geriatric patients with cognitive difficulties, who went into Mount Carmel Hospital a few weeks ago, have been shunted out again. The turnaround at the hospital had started before this decision was made. The financial documents show that it would have more than broken even in 2014. NAMA needs to explain this bad decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_737">I mean no disrespect to the Minister when I say that. I do not doubt his commitment to the retention of as many of this country's medical facilities as possible. When one reads the NAMA business plan, one must compare the manner in which it is allowing this wonderful facility to be closed with the manner in which it consistently shovels money into golf courses and five-star luxury hotels, thereby undermining and undercutting private family-owned hotels. I would like the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider what Deputy Mathews and others have said about the net cost to the State of the closure of the hospital when factors like social welfare payments and the loss of revenue are taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">It defies logic. I can understand that the Minister is considering the matter in the context of his individual budget. A little creativity on the part of NAMA and the State, based on an examination of the net cost of the closure of the hospital, would assist this hospital to trade its way out of its difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">NAMA has been very co-operative in helping coherence in Government. In other words, when we were considering the National Maternity Hospital moving to St. Vincent's University Hospital, we looked at the buildings that had been built for a private hospital and other purposes - it may not quite have been for a private hospital, but that was one of the possibilities. However, IDA Ireland had another multinational client and we backed away. IDA Ireland was very successful through Mr. Barry O'Leary, whom I congratulate on his retirement, in securing more jobs for that part of Dublin. We will now build a new co-located hospital for the National Maternity Hospital there.</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> While it is sad to see Mount Carmel close, in 2004 there were 16 private-hospital bodies and today there are 22. There is always this movement within a sector as needs and demands change. I do not have full and intimate detail of all that transpired there once it was bought by a developer and the debts that might have accrued. However, I certainly know that the Department and the HSE undertook an extensive appraisal of how that hospital might represent value to the health system and clearly came to the decision that it was not in the best interests of the health services to acquire it as a going concern, as I made clear in my opening remarks.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> We need to ensure that the patients attending there are looked after in a seamless fashion with the minimum distress. We need to do our best to help to relocate the many excellent staff, as we would not like to see their special skill sets lost.</p>
