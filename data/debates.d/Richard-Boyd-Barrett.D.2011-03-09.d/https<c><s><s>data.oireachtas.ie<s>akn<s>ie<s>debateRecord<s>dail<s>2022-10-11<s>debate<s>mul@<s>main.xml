          <p eId="para_1"> Díreach agus muid tagtha le chéile le gnó na Dála a dhéanamh, tá Jessica Gallagher á cur i gcré na cille i reilig Chaisleán na dTuath, agus tús á chur le sochraid Martin McGill sa séipéal céanna. Tá ocht dteaghlach eile ag fáil faoi réir do shochraid. Sin sochraid i ndiaidh sochraide. Ba mhaith liom, ar ár son go léir, ár gcomhbhrón a chur in iúl do na teaghlaigh i gCraoslach agus i dTír Chonaill atá faoi scamall an bhróin tar éis an phléasctha thubaistigh an Aoine seo caite inar cailleadh deichniúr. Suaimhneas síoraí dá n-anamacha dílse agus leaba i measc na n-aingeal acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> I ask Members to join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the community of Creeslough, particularly those who lost loved ones in last Friday's tragedy. Clearly, words cannot express the pain and grief of those who have lost family members or the loss felt by such a tight-knit community. Those who died, their families and the people of Creeslough are foremost in our thoughts in these very difficult days and in the weeks and months ahead. We also pay tribute to the bravery of the local people who helped the emergency services in every way possible. Beidh siad inár gcuimhne go deo. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse.</p>

          <p eId="para_3">Hugh Kelly, 59; Robert Garwe, 50; Martina Martin, 49, Martin McGill, 49; James O'Flaherty, 48; Catherine O'Donnell, 39; Jessica Gallagher, 24; Leona Harper, 14; James Monaghan, 13; and little Shauna Flanagan Garwe, five years of age. Ten women, men, boys and girls representing everything good, kind and beautiful about Creeslough, Donegal and our country were taken away in a tragic incident on a quiet Friday afternoon; fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, each one an enormous, incalculable loss in the lives of those around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">This is a community bereft. A close-knit people in deep sadness and mourning, devastated by what has happened but it is also a community of great strength and resilience, pulling together to support each other through this terrible time.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> Over the weekend, I met many people who shared their stories of the most extraordinary courage, commitment, heroism and love. They were stories of local people putting themselves at risk and doing everything humanly possible to save the lives of their neighbours in the aftermath of the explosion; of first responders and emergency services from North and South facing scenes that will stay with them for the rest of their lives but never hesitating for a second to do everything they could; of doctors, clinicians, nurses, porters, support staff and everyone working at Letterkenny hospital who were true models of compassion, care and professionalism; of a small village community putting its arms around its bereaved and giving a powerful example to the country and the world of the true meaning of meitheal.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> As the people of Creeslough begin the rituals of funerals and burials, we gather as an Oireachtas this afternoon to offer our sincere sympathy, express our shared respect for the bereaved and the injured and to remember and honour those who have died. It is important, I think, that those struggling to make sense of the enormous and heartbreaking loss now confronting them know that the entire nation is with them in spirit. Words on their own cannot comfort the fathomless grief that so many will feel in the weeks and months ahead but what we can do and what I know we will do is to be there for them. Individually across this House and collectively as an Oireachtas and the service of the people of Ireland, we stand with the community of Creeslough and the people of Donegal at home and abroad. We pay tribute to the true courage and dedication of our emergency services and healthcare staff. We are reminded of the critical role that they play in our national life and we thank them for being there in our darkest moments of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Déanaimid comhbhrón a chroí le gach ar an gCraoslach i nDún na nGall. Tá pobal na tíre faoi scamall mór bróin anois agus iad ag smaoineamh ar a tharla tráthnóna Dé hAoine. Is tubaisteach agus is brónach an tragóid seo do theaghlaigh na ndaoine a maraíodh agus a gortaíodh.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> We put our arms around the bereaved and the injured. We pledge to support this community now and in the time ahead as it comes to terms with this trauma. We remember those who have died: Hugh, Robert, Martina, Martin, James, Catherine, Jessica, Leona, James and Shauna. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">On Friday, our worlds stopped. Our hearts stopped as we learned of the terrible tragedy that was unfolding in Creeslough, a tragedy which makes no sense and whose only lesson is pain and loss. Since then, we have seen the best of each other. A small country becoming one big community to search together, to grieve together and to heal together. This week the world is watching us and it is seeing a nation in tears. As the people from this place, we send our condolences to all those whose grief is still raw and painful and all too terrible to comprehend. A nation stands with you. A nation mourns with you. Seasaimid libhse.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> We give our thanks to the emergency services and the rescue workers and volunteers who came to the scene; the women and men who carried the prayers and hopes of a country with them as they did their work over many long and painful hours. We give our thanks to the countless people who are providing comfort and support and kindness to those heartbroken and grieving, whose compassion is the only response to the cruelty and capriciousness of an unjust and random world.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Today we are a country torn apart by grief but we are also a community joining together to help those worst affected and to do what we can to support each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The Government will put the full resources of the State behind the efforts to rebuild a broken community, to heal the many emotional and physical wounds. That also requires our help in the medium and long term because the deepest wounds are invisible and can last for a lifetime. When loved ones die in such terrible circumstances, they can become frozen in time. We remember them for how they died not how they lived, whom they loved and the many people who loved them in return. Let us not do that here. Let us celebrate the lives they shared with us, albeit for a very short time, the light they brought into the world and the love that will never die. Their story is now our story and that of our country. We remember them in our hearts today and forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Go ndéana Dia trócaire orthu agus go dtuga sé síocháin dóibh. Beidh Dia leo.</p>

          <from>Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">Friday, for the tight-knit community of Creeslough, was the beginning of the weekend. School was over. People were finishing up work. Children were buying treats and families in this peaceful rural community were running errands and stopping at the local Applegreen petrol station. Some had stopped to go into the station shop, were queuing for the post office or simply wanted to buy an ice cream. In the blink of an eye their lives ended after a deadly explosion tore the station and apartment complex apart. Everyday scenes in Creeslough's small rural community on that Friday autumnal afternoon changed in a second, tragically and cruelly for so many.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> It was an unmerciful sight, locals and response services said. Emergency services and locals worked through the night to rescue survivors and recover the deceased. Tháinig an pobal le chéile chun cabhair agus tacaíocht a thabhairt dá chéile. The incredible community spirit and support on show in the most awful of circumstances must be commended. Yet it is difficult to imagine how the scale of these sudden devastating losses and trauma can possibly be absorbed or comprehended by the community in Creeslough. Such suffering has no debt left in numbness but still the community rally as the first of the ten funerals have been held today. Four men, three women, two teenagers and a five-year-old girl all lost their lives - little Shauna and her father Robert, Hugh, Catherine and her son James, Leona, Jessica, Martin, James and Martina. The mourning is only beginning. We must honour those precious lives and support that broken community. Those children and adults will be remembered through mourning and we mourn together as a nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Is minic in Éirinn agus fud fad Dhún na nGall go n-éistimid, le meas, le ceol an chaointe. Nach mór an cháil ar Chaoineadh na dTrí Mhuire?

          <p eId="para_18">When the Taoiseach and other political leaders stood together on Saturday night in Creeslough, with families and a community that had suffered a terrible loss, he was representing Irish people everywhere. There are no words that could properly express the heartbreak, pain and sorrow felt by so many. Ten precious lives are gone and a small community is devastated. The shock from this small village was felt across Ireland and beyond. Irish people everywhere are stunned. Many naturally feel that Creeslough could be their community, their place, their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Like many Deputies, I am very familiar with Creeslough. I have family living close by, and I have had the honour of representing the area as an MEP. Creeslough is well known to people from right across Ireland and further afield because many will have spent time there in what is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Until last Friday afternoon, our enduring memories of Creeslough were happy ones - thoughts of a welcoming, friendly community that made everybody who had the privilege of visiting the area feel at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> While the nation was shocked by the tragedy that has scarred that village forever, none of us was surprised by the instinctive reaction of those first on the scene. The response of the community in Creeslough has been immense. Minutes after the explosion, people came to help clear a path and secure the building in order that firefighters could get access. They did this without any thought for their own safety. Local nurses stayed on the scene all night, helping where they could. Neighbours opened their doors to locals and strangers alike and small businesses went well beyond the call of duty to support all those who came to help.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Fr. John Joe Duffy has been an incredible leader in his community. Our solidarity is with him as he leads his parish in the coming days. On behalf of Sinn Féin, I pay tribute to the emergency services, North and South - the gardaí, firefighters, Civil Defence, ambulance personnel, doctors and paramedics, some of whom put their own lives on the line throughout Friday night as the search continued. The pain was etched on their faces on Saturday evening as they talked about what had unfolded - the acts of bravery over so many long hours as the search went on, and the harrowing outcome. What they did in Creeslough will never be forgotten; not in that small community or anywhere else in the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Today, the families of Jessica Gallagher and Martin McGill have the awful task of burying their loved ones. The unspeakable grief will continue this week as the families of Leona Harper, Robert Garwe, little Shauna Flanagan Garwe, James O'Flaherty, Martina Martin, Hugh Kelly, Catherine O'Donnell and her son James Monaghan, will walk with their loved ones to their final resting place. Our thoughts and prayers are with them today and in the difficult days that lie ahead. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha.</p>

Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families and friends of all the ten people who lost their lives so tragically, as well as with their broader community in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> We pay tribute to the bravery and courage of the emergency services and all who helped in the rescue effort. We are all heartbroken at the loss of life caused by this awful tragedy. We honour the names of those who died - James O'Flaherty, Martin McGill, Hugh Kelly, Robert Garwe, Shauna Flanagan Garwe, Catherine O'Donnell, James Monaghan, Martina Martin, Leona Harper and Jessica Gallagher.

          <p eId="para_25">The tragic loss of so many lives in Creeslough has cast a long dark shadow across the country. The entire nation was impacted with a sense of shock and grief. On Friday, 7 October, an explosion tore through the heart of this little town. For a small and close knit community like Creeslough, the deaths of ten people in such a devastating and inexplicable incident is a terrible burden to bear. The sheer randomness of the event makes it even harder to process. Everybody in this small town knows those who died. Every family is in some way touched by this appalling tragedy. People across the country have also got to know the victims, whose lives were cruelly snatched away.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Jessica Gallagher was supposed to start a new job as a designer in Belfast yesterday. She was about to embark on an exciting stage in her career; instead, she is being buried today. The funeral of Martin McGill, who was such a devoted carer to his mother, is also taking place today. In the course of the coming week, the country will be enveloped in a dense fog of sorrow as all ten victims - seven adults and three children - are laid to rest.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> It is difficult at a time like this to find words that seem adequate to fully describe the intense heartbreak and incomprehension we all feel. There is no doubt the grief being experienced in Creeslough is immense, relentless and overpowering. In moments of deep despair, however, we can also see signs of hope, a chink of light to illuminate the darkness. That light came in the form of the many members of the community who worked tirelessly throughout the day and the night to save as many lives as possible and to retrieve the remains of those who had died. We also see a light in the response of the emergency services on both sides of the Border, who acted with such diligence, care and sensitivity at such an unspeakably awful time. We also hope those who were injured will recover from their wounds, and we think of the staff who are caring for them. My thoughts and sympathies and those of the wider Social Democrats are with the community of Creeslough and those who have worked and will work over the coming weeks and months to support them through this very dark time.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">On behalf of People Before Profit-Solidarity, I extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to all those who lost family members and friends and to the wider Creeslough community. What that community has suffered with the events on Friday is utterly unspeakable. No words we can say can possibly compensate for the shocking loss and tragedy they have experienced, but they deserve tribute for the incredible dignity and heroism they have demonstrated in the face of this horrendous, unspeakable tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> As others have done, I also pay tribute to all the emergency services, who have done such heroic work. I know our words cannot compensate, but I hope the solidarity, the wishes and the thoughts that are being sent not just from this House but from all over the country can play some very small part in trying to comfort the family members and friends who have lost loved ones, as well as the community of Creeslough, at this dark time for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">While I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Regional Group, I recognise how inadequate any words of mine must be in the face of such tragedy and loss. Nevertheless, I also want to pay tribute to the emergency services, both North and South of the Border, who rushed to the scene on Friday, once again answered for their courage and saved so many lives in so doing. I wish the injured, particularly those who are still in hospital, a full and speedy recovery and I commend the community in Creeslough on looking after one another, looking after the bereaved and helping in the rescue effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Most important, I pay tribute to the ten men, women and children who tragically lost their lives and convey the heartfelt sympathies of the Regional Group. I want also to highlight how difficult it is to pass on these sentiments from here in Dublin, so far from Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">To conclude, and I am sorry for getting a small bit emotional, if grief is indeed the price we pay for love, and if mourning is indeed the eventual cost of companionship, then it is absolutely clear from what we have seen over the last few days that these people were hugely respected and will be terribly lost in their community. May they all rest in peace.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">It was with great sadness that we learned ten people perished because of the tragic explosion last Friday, with eight still in the hospital. Our hearts go out to their families, loved ones and the entire local community who are reeling from this incredible loss. On my behalf and on behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I wish to express our sincerest condolences to the families and the people of Creeslough for those who died in this tragedy. We also send our prayers to God for a speedy recovery of the injured. For the families of the ten individuals lost, we cannot bear as they do the full impact of this tragedy, but we feel the loss they are feeling and we are thinking about them greatly. The light from the candles on the altar of St. Michael's Church, lit by Fr. John Joe Duffy and his community, remind us of those who have perished and also of the immortal words of St. Francis of Assisi, who said, "All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle."</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> As a country, we are also inspired by the capacity for love, care and courage of those who responded during the crossroads of tragedy and recovery, and who continue to offer care and support for others. At this very difficult moment, let us keep those affected by the event in our prayers. They started today with two funerals and face a tough week as they lay to rest the immortal remains of the ten who perished. Our prayers are with them and with Fr. Duffy.

          <p eId="para_35">On behalf of the Independent Group, I wish to begin by extending the apologies of Deputy Thomas Pringle, representative for the Donegal constituency, who cannot be here today to join in the condolences being offered to the people of Creeslough as he is in attendance at the Council of Europe. He asked me to say a few words.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> This morning, President Higgins spoke with Deputy Pringle and the other members of the delegation about the tragedy that has left the community and, indeed, the whole country stunned with sadness. As families, neighbours and friends gather in their grief to lay loved ones to rest, I know the support of the community will be vital to giving them the strength they need to begin healing from the void that will be left in their lives. Today, as we speak, Jessica Gallagher and Martin McGill are the first to be laid to rest and over the coming days, another eight casualties of this incomprehensible incident will be mourned similarly. They were mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, parents and grandparents, and friends and loved ones to so many. I offer my sincere and heartfelt sympathies and solidarity, and those of my colleagues, to all the families and people of Creeslough and County Donegal.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">Every political issue is put into perspective by our previous conversation and contributions. Focus Ireland has published its annual report on homelessness and it makes for alarming reading. The report states that rising homelessness in Ireland is not inevitable but rather it is the result of the wrong political decisions and that the crisis will only get worse this winter unless the Government acts now with urgency. The words of Focus Ireland founder, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, capture the heartbreaking reality of this crisis. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_39">Over 3,200 children who are homeless do not have the luxury of time. Their childhoods are being stolen as homelessness is causing young people to lose out on the safety... of a permanent home. This situation is unacceptable and must end. Much greater political leadership and commitment is urgently required... if we are to overcome the challenges our society faces in ending homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">For two months in a row we have had record levels of homelessness reported. Within a month or two, unless something drastic changes we will hit and exceed the shameful milestone of an official homelessness figure of 11,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The human stories behind this figure are ones of real hardship. These include: families living in tents; children growing up in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and not knowing the security of a place they can call home; and households transported and displaced out of their communities because there are no emergency accommodation places left in their counties. Approximately 60 families from Dublin are in emergency accommodation in Meath and Kildare and there are a further 60 individuals from Dublin in emergency accommodation in Kildare. The Government needs to act now and with real intent. Given the scale of the challenge that exists the budget was deeply disappointing. There is no increase in social housing targets and the insufficient targets that are in place will not be met this year. There was no funding for any new initiative to prevent the dramatic rise in homelessness. Even though the majority of those forced into homelessness are coming from the private rental sector there was no ban on evictions. The truth is that without a significant change of direction in these areas we will see more families pushed into homelessness and into the nightmare of a winter without a secure roof over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> In the last week, the media have reported that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has only started to liaise with the Attorney General about the feasibility of introducing a winter ban on evictions. We saw during the pandemic that the State responded with emergency protections that safeguarded tenants. We already know it is feasible because such an eviction ban was put in place as part of Covid measures. We see that the Scottish Government has already introduced an emergency winter ban on evictions from early September. A similar eviction ban is required here and it has to be accompanied by an increase in the tenant <i>in situ</i> scheme. Instead we hear that deliberations are at an early stage and that the Government has not yet agreed to introduce an eviction ban.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Homelessness is spiralling out of control. It is an emergency and the Government must deliver an emergency response. I urge the Taoiseach to act urgently, change direction and immediately introduce a winter ban on evictions. With better political choices the tide of homelessness and the crisis we are facing can be turned but the Government must start today.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_14">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_44">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because it is one that goes to the heart of the kind of society we are and want to be. The Government is very concerned with the increase in homelessness and it has a comprehensive suite of responses. We need to understand and assess the nature of homelessness in modern Ireland. It is different from what we might have traditionally perceived it to be and it is a changing dynamic all of the time in terms of the presentations on a monthly basis to the emergency accommodation sector, which adds pressure on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> On the rental protection side, very significant protections have been brought in already to delay any evictions or moving anyone out of homes. We have legislated to increase the notice-to-quit period for tenancies of three years' duration or less, from 28 days to three months. Where there is the risk of a tenant being evicted into homelessness as a result of a landlord selling a home, local authorities have been told by the Minister they can buy those houses to prevent anyone becoming homeless. The resources are there to do that. In addition, the discretionary rate of the housing assistance payment, HAP, has been increased substantially, which will enable tenants to meet any increases in rents. We also have the rent pressure zone caps and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> More fundamentally, in terms of the issue the Deputy raised regarding a winter eviction ban, it is not only today or yesterday that these issues are being considered by the Government. We considered that action during the Covid period because of the issues that existed at the time that justified such a winter eviction ban. The Government acted on that. It is just one potential option but it is not the solution. In fact, some of the homeless organisations would accept it is not the solution and, hence, they talk about a temporary winter eviction ban. There are other policy issues that have to be assessed in that context to ensure we have a significant supply into the rental market, which is a concern and a problem in terms of getting more houses back into the market to rent out to people. There has been a steady decline since 2017 in the number of houses that are available for rent. We have to draw conclusions from that in terms of why people are exiting the rental market as small landlords and not maintaining the position of keeping their houses available for rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> On the social housing front, we will have a record number of social houses built this year. We have to increase that. The target is about 10,000 builds between approved social housing bodies and local authorities on an annual basis. We will get over 8,000 this year, which is an increase, and we want to be consistently above that figure for the next ten years. Every year, we will be doing in and around 10,000 social houses. The Minister acted very quickly in the past two years to bring voids back into use, that is, empty houses that local authorities may have taken time to repair and so on. We all know about that in our different constituencies. The Minister moved very quickly to say we do not want any voids and to give local authorities the resources to bring such houses back into use as quickly as they are vacated for whatever reason. The cost-rental initiative he has undertaken is also proving to be very effective. It took the past 15 to 18 months to get that new scheme up and running and it is proving to be very effective and impactful.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Ultimately, it is about supply. We need to be building more housing and we are doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">The Taoiseach said the homelessness issue goes to the heart of the type of society we want to be. What does it say about our society under his Government that homelessness figures are rising month on month and are now reaching what would be the horrendous scandal of a figure of 11,000? These are real people. They are people's sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and neighbours. The Taoiseach indicated the conditions need to be right. What conditions precisely do we need to justify an eviction ban, considering those numbers? He indicated that during the Covid crisis, the conditions were right for an eviction ban. I contend the conditions now are such that it is absolutely essential for an eviction ban to be put in place. Of course an eviction ban is not the solution to the housing crisis. The solution is to build houses. However, in the here and now, I ask the Taoiseach again: will he ensure an eviction ban is put in place as a matter of absolute urgency?</p>

          <p eId="para_50">The conditions that existed in the Covid crisis were that we legally restricted people's movements, on public health grounds, to distances of 2 km early on and 5 km in some instances. There was a very clear legal underpinning for any decisions we took, given the restrictions the Government and public health interests put forward. In the context of the current crisis, there are arguments, of course, to do the same. That is the point and the matter is under consideration by the Minister in respect of that aspect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">More fundamentally, we need to build more houses. The Government has increased the allocation and we are getting more houses built. This year, we will reach our target-----</p>

The reality is that looking at the figures on home completions, commencements, permissions, home purchases, first-time buyers and mortgage draw downs, they are encouraging this year. They give us confidence that the Government's overall 2022 supply target will be met, but we need to go higher than that every other year. That means, and I have said it consistently to everybody in the House, that if we want to reach those targets into the future and we really want to provide the supply that will be needed to reduce homelessness, then we all need to put the shoulder to the wheel and ensure that in every local authority in the country we allow housing projects through and get them through.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I want to acknowledge, first, that the tragedy in Cresslough overshadows all other issues and matters that we are going to deal with in this House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> However, I would like to raise the plight of many thousands of people across this country, who work for independent non-State agencies in the care, community and voluntary sectors. I refer to section 39, section 10 and section 56 workers and all of those in the community sector who need a pay rise. They are among the heroes of Irish society, filling the gaps left where the State has been incapable of providing. It is no exaggeration to say that without their work, many of society's most vulnerable members would be left disconnected from communities. We know they provide vital services across the State, supporting those suffering from mental health crises and extending a helping hand to people who have lost their homes. Without a winter eviction ban, there may well be more of those people needing their help. Such workers give support and advice to those victimised by sexual and domestic violence. Yet, despite their immense value to society, care workers are not valued as they should be. Many have not seen a pay rise since 2008, nearly 15 years ago, and too often lip service is paid to them with no material improvement to their pay and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> Many of us stood in the streets and applauded vital health and care workers during the darkest days of the Covid pandemic, but we know that applause will not pay their bills. Indeed, they are among the 100,000 non-HSE staff who still have not been paid the Covid bonus promised to them in January, in recognition of their work on the front lines of Ireland's pandemic response. Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, handed in letters to the Department of Health at 12 noon today, looking for their payments. It is just not fair that they have still not received those payments. Their work is comparable to that of workers who are directly employed by they State, but unlike trade union members in the public or private sector, care workers in the voluntary sector have no way to negotiate a pay increase at present. Up and down the country, in recent months, they have taken to picket lines to highlight this inequality and disparity in treatment. Because their contracts are not made directly with the State, Government Ministers have been able to claim, repeatedly, that the dispute and the issue around pay and conditions has nothing to do with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> We, in Labour, want to address that inequality to ensure that there is redress for those workers who are providing such vital care and community services. Tomorrow, we will bring forward a motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, to reverse the policy which excludes these care workers from mechanisms like the public sector pay agreements. We are calling on the Taoiseach and his Government to support our initiative. We are asking for Government Deputies to back this important motion to see equality for those providing vital care and community services. Indeed, I raised the issue with the Tánaiste last Thursday and he said then that €100 million in once-off funding for section 39 organisations would cover the cost of pay rises. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that workers will get pay rises in accordance with that, and in line with their colleagues who are working directly for the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">First, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. At the outset, that Labour's motion is very broad. At times it is not clear who, specifically, it is targeting. At one leap, it is almost as if every voluntary and community organisation would be made a public sector organisation, if one were to follow the entirety of the motion through to its logical conclusion. As the Deputy knows, quite a number of these organisations are private, appreciate their autonomy and would not necessarily want to come under public sector ownership or remit. We need to think this through. I acknowledge that there is an issue here. That is the first point. There is certainly an issue in terms of section 39 organisations or those that have a direct relationship with the State. The section 39 organisations are privately owned and run and have terms and conditions of employment for staff and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Those arrangements would traditionally have been between the employer and the employee. However, we know that, in some instances, they are contracted with the State for the services they provide. Their employees are similar to those employed by State organisations, so that creates an issue in terms of the differential in pay. In acknowledgement of the particular difficulties they are facing this year with inflation, we have allocated up to €100 million to support section 39 organisations and nursing homes, as well as section 38 organisations, excluding acute hospitals. That is additional funding to help them cope until the end of the year with the crisis and cost-of-living issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> Section 10 organisations deal with homelessness and housing authorities. They are separate organisations, not State organisations. The money that the State provides through section 10 funding goes towards the cost of services provided by front-line NGOs. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provides the framework that governs how those housing authorities operate. Additional funding of €21 million has been allocated this year, bringing the total to approximately €215 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The Labour Party motion also covers Tusla-funded organisations. Section 56(2) of the Child and Family Agency Act requires that Tusla determines the maximum funding it proposes to make available during the course of each year under each arrangement and the level of contracted service it expects to receive in return for that funding. Tusla's funding allocation has been increased for 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The overall point is that we are talking about a vast number of people and organisations. The situation is not as simple as is being portrayed. That said, the Government will enter a process, as happened in 2019 at the Workplace Relations Commission. We anticipate getting into some process to try to sort this out once and for all.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I thank the Taoiseach for the response and for acknowledging there is an issue here, which there clearly is. As the Taoiseach has said, a large number of people are involved, including a large number of service users, people who are relying on the vital services provided by these care workers and community workers. The service users need to know that the services which enable them to live their lives will continue in the future. We need a Government commitment to multi-annual funding. We need to know what the €100 million is to be targeted at. Is it to be targeted at pay rises or the cost of living? Fundamentally, we need to know that the services provided will be capable of being continued because they are vital to our communities across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> I am glad to hear the Taoiseach say the Government will be entering a process. Will the Government support our motion tomorrow? Will it engage with the unions, those representing workers in the sector, to ensure these vital services are continued? SIPTU is holding a press conference as we speak in Buswells Hotel, calling for justice for those in the care and community sectors who are providing the same services as those provided directly by individuals employed by the HSE. They are providing the same services, albeit through contracts with different organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I thank the Deputy. In the health sector in recent years, for example, upward adjustments have been made in the pay of some eligible section 39 workers, following a process led by the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the Workplace Relations Commission in 2019. That resulted in funding being made available for pay increases for a pilot scheme involving 50 agencies. In 2021, there was further engagement by the Department of Health at the Workplace Relations Commission, which resulted in funding being made available for pay increases for cohorts of staff in the remaining 250 agencies identified in 2019. This decision was final in respect of the number of organisations that were to be funded. That is an illustration of an earlier process to deal with a earlier, parallel situation similar to the one we have now after Building Momentum and the recent public sector pay agreement, which was negotiated and voted for by the social partners. In my view, some process has to entered into.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> I caution that the Labour Party motion is of such a breadth as to almost be indeterminate as to which organisations would be covered. It is vast. However, we need to get into some process to get the issues resolved for these organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I visited the PrepayPower website this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The website states: "If you do not keep your PPP PAYG [PrepayPower pay-as-you-go] Meter topped up with credit, it will self-disconnect and your electricity supply will cut off." On vulnerable customers, it states that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_70">The CRU has put in place a rule whereby [registered] Vulnerable Customers cannot be disconnected for non-payment of [arrears] during winter months. [This applies to both gas and electricity.] It is important that all of our customers ... categorised as Vulnerable ... understand that this rule cannot apply to them whilst on our [pay-as-you-go] supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">This is five days after the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications met representatives of this company and hailed the exchanges as a result for prepay customers. Are there minutes of this meeting? Can we see them please?</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> While I am at it, if energy companies are being spoken to as stakeholders, why is the Minister not also speaking to pay-as-you-go customers? Are they not stakeholders too or are some stakeholders more important than others? The Minister might learn a thing or two if he bothered to speak to customers. He might hear about the households that never stock the freezer up full for fear of the electricity going off. He might hear about the housing estates where security alarms go off every Friday in homes that cannot afford to top up their electricity before payday. He might hear about the contempt people have for the phrase "self-disconnect", which trips so easily from the lips of energy bosses and some Government Deputies these days.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I am sure the Taoiseach has realised this but I will spell it out for him just in case he has not; the news is not good for him or his Government if the moratorium does not mean a moratorium for all and unless there are zero disconnections this winter. If that does not happen, the personal stories of people who have been disconnected will be read aloud every day in this Chamber and his promise that there will be no disconnections will come back to haunt him. Is this what he wants in the run-up to 15 December? Is this what the Tánaiste wants in the days following that date? It is now time to go harder with these energy companies. I await the Taoiseach's reply to the questions. </p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_25">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_74">The Government does not want disconnections this winter above all else. As the Deputy said, for winter 2022 the usual one-month pause on disconnections for non-payment has been extended to three months, from 1 December 2022 until 28 February 2023. For vulnerable customers, the pause on disconnections for non-payment has been extended to six months, from 1 October 2022 until 31 March 2023. I understand that work is now being progressed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to waive the fee to enable people to switch from pay-as-you-go to bill pay in order to avail of the protections for vulnerable customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> The Minister has met industry representatives. The understanding is that it is an industry standard not to disconnect at weekends. Emergency credit is available to get people through until they can again purchase credit. In respect of engagement, the entire objective is that no-one will be disconnected and emergency credits can be made available. The most recent additional protections that have been put in place by the CRU in respect of pay-as-you-go include debt repayment levels being reduced from 10% from a previous rate of 25% and the €20 top-up, for example. These are additional protections by the CRU but in terms of social protection, the additional needs payment is always there for anybody who is in difficulty in order for them to get additional funding to top up, as well as engaging with the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which also has a pattern of engagement with the energy companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> As part of their codes of practice, companies do not want to disconnect anybody and there is a way to prevent that. There are also the budget measures we introduced, which are quite significant, between now and the end of the year. The annual cost-of-living double payment will commence on 17 October from which approximately 1.4 million people will benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">A double child benefit payment will be made on 1 November to 639,000 families in respect of 1.2 million children. The fuel allowance lump sum of €400 will be paid the week commencing 14 November and 371,000 people will benefit from that. A payment of €200 will be made to people who are in receipt of the living alone allowance, commencing on 14 November. A €500 cost-of-living payment will be made to those in receipt of the working family payment. These payments will commence on 14 November and 44,000 people will benefit. A disability support grant of €500 will commence payment on 14 November. A further 216,000 people will benefit from that. There is also a €500 carer's support grant to be paid in the week commencing on 21 November. The entirety of the measures we provided for in the budget and which will be rolled out and paid out to people from now until the end of the year will provide strong capacity and back-up to people who are in difficulty in respect of income or anything else in topping up their payment mechanisms.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">Those measures will get many pay-as-you-go customers through this winter, no doubt, but will they get all pay-as-you-go customers through the winter? I do not believe that is the case nor do I believe the Taoiseach believes it to be the case either. He said that the fee has been waived for pay-as-you-go customers who want to transfer to bill-pay if they are vulnerable. That is very good but it is for medically vulnerable people. The fee has been waived for people who have sleep apnoea and need to use a CPAP machine at night but what about people who are financially vulnerable? What about people who are living in poverty? As of now, such people do not have the right to transfer from pay-as-you-go to bill-pay without paying penalties. These penalties are very considerable. Does the Taoiseach know what the penalty charge for pay-as-you-go customers who are financially vulnerable and living in poverty and who want to switch to bill-pay is? It is €199. The charges have been removed for those who are medically vulnerable. Will they be removed for those who are financially vulnerable? Will they be removed for all? This has to be a moratorium for all and not just for some.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">We have identified a whole range of measures that will be paid out from now until Christmas that will help the financially vulnerable. Substantial payments are being made which should help people not to get into difficulty with their pay-as-you-go bill. That said, the additional needs payment is there. Anybody who is financially vulnerable should engage with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and with the additional needs section to ensure they get the resources so they are not in a debt situation in respect of their pay-as-you-go service and to get it resolved. We will continue to engage with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to ensure there are protections over the winder period against anybody being disconnected. It is our view and the view of the industry that this is not standard practice. If the Deputy has material to bring to our attention in respect of vulnerable customers with whom he is contact, I will gladly receive it. We can use it to work on further solutions. However, across the board, from the CRU protections to the budgetary welfare announcements we have made and the various supports we are providing and the social protection additional needs scheme that is in place with MABS, we believe we can protect people from being disconnected.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">We all go to retirement presentations from time to time. They are really important because they allow us to acknowledge and recognise the contributions of particular workers to particular workplaces. What is perhaps even more important is that retirement presentations signal to the remaining workforce that their contributions are also appreciated and valued. I mention this because I will today raise the precarious employment contracts enlisted members of the Defence Forces are forced to accept, particularly those contracts for sergeants who are approaching their 50th birthday. Many people may not be aware of this but a 50-year-old sergeant must retire on his or her birthday. Under the circumstances, when you consider the retention crisis and the fact that our 50-year-old sergeants are the most experienced, respected and motivated people we have, this appears to be madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">That is a big issue that needs be addressed. We need to focus on how to improve things from a sergeant's perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I have two questions for the Taoiseach. Does he know anything about the terms and conditions upon which these new sergeants' contracts will be approved? In fairness to the Minister for Defence, he accepts that a sergeant's career should be extended to around 55 years of age. We have yet to see the terms and conditions they will be re-engaged on.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">That is correct. There are a lot of rumours going around and there are some proposals on the table that 50-year-old sergeants will be forced to retire and be rehired on their birthdays, with drastically reduced terms and conditions for pensions and pay. I find that unacceptable and the Taoiseach probably feels the same. I do not think anyone would try to chance that with a garda, a nurse or a teacher. Does the Taoiseach know when these terms and conditions will be available? Will he intercede with his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that military personnel who are 50 years of age will get a fair hearing when it comes to terms and conditions?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I thank the Deputy for raising this. It is an important issue given the overall situation and to the need to enhance retention and recruitment in the context of the Defence Forces. As the Deputy will know, a civil-military review of mandatory retirement ages and service limits of all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force has been conducted and the recommendations arising from the review and their impact on current pay and pensions are being considered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. That consideration is ongoing. In December 2021, the Ministers for Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform both agreed that arrangements would be made to facilitate the extension of service limits of sergeants recruited to the Permanent Defence Force since 1994. I will not go through the rest of the note because it refers to those wonderful layers of complexity involved in resolving these issues. I could read all sorts of things into that. In short, I will talk to both Ministers. We need to get this expedited.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> I have no doubt that there are some complexities because there are certain pension entitlements at the age of 50. Obviously, people going beyond that age has implications and there are relativities and all of that. I am told that the complexity surrounding any extension of service relates to the pension entitlements associated with the mandatory retirement age limits. What the Deputy is hearing may relate to that. We do not people to be disadvantaged by staying on beyond the age of 50. The Government certainly does not want that. I want to create incentives for people to stay beyond 50. In the modern era, it makes sense. We would then be in a position to retain their experience and expertise and reduce the brain drain from the Defence Forces. I will revert to the Deputy. I will talk to the Ministers about this.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">The reason I mention this is that it is the most pressing issue relating to the Defence Forces at the moment. It goes back to the comment I made about retirement functions at the start. This will only affect eight sergeants over the next 12 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">Yes. It is just eight troops but there are 8,000 troops watching very carefully to see how those eight people are treated. That is where the real downstream consequences are. We should be mindful that the Dublin Airport Authority tried something similar two years ago and we saw where that ended up. It was unable to fulfil its mandate and the public suffered accordingly. The take-home message is that the public service should be the employer of choice when it comes to employment rights. We should not just meet the standard; we should be the standard.</p>

It takes time to open beds, which is why 177 beds that are funded are still not open. Seventy two beds announced as part of last year's winter and national service plans are still not open. It takes time to hire staff and increase diagnostic and surgical theatre capacity. Is the Taoiseach confident that the winter plan will be enough for the sheer volume of patients we will see in our emergency departments this year.</p>

Experience across the world is showing that with a combination of influenza and Covid-19, or new waves and potential variants of Covid-19, it could be a very difficult winter. Covid numbers are increasing, which places real strains on our hospitals and nursing homes, results in delayed discharges from hospitals increasing, affects flows through hospitals, gives rise to things backing up and places people in emergency departments under real pressure. We started preparing for the winter in 2020 when we put €600 million into the winter initiative. This was to give full-time posts throughout 2021 and 2022. A further €160-odd million is going into this winter initiative to increase beds and get community and primary care services in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">I am concerned that many vulnerable renters may be excluded from the renter's tax credit announced by the Government in budget 2023. I have been approached by constituents who rent their homes by way of licence agreements rather than as tenants under leaseholds. We sought clarity from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who has appeared to dispel concerns by stating licensees would be entitled to claim a tax credit but who only referenced only those in the rent-a-room scheme or in student accommodation. Will the credit apply to people in standard licence agreements? We have been critical of the credit because it is simply not enough to protect people and keep them in their homes without the introduction of temporary eviction ban this winter. We believe that the latter should and could be introduced. As long as the renter's credit is in place, every renter should be entitled to it. Could the Taoiseach clarify if those renting under licence agreements- licensees rather than tenants under leaseholds - will all be entitled to the credit?</p>

I implore the Government to bring in an eviction ban for at least the winter, although I would argue that it should be beyond that, because we cannot contend with the rising levels of homelessness. Children's lives are being devastated. I had no response for the three families that contacted me earlier. I will be on Parkgate Street with one of them on Friday. We need a ban on evictions.

The HSE has been dealing with this and is anxious from an accountability point of view that anything done is above scrutiny and can be accounted for.

          <p eId="para_157">In the Government's Budget Statement, a lot of promises were made on tackling the electricity crisis. In it the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated that every household will be provided with electricity credit. I acknowledge this measure is a huge help for most households but I have a constituent who raised the issue of one electricity meter covering two dwellings: one home and one independent granny flat where the inhabitant is in receipt of palliative care which requires significant electricity use. Having one electricity meter covering two dwellings impacts both houses' entitlement to the electricity credit. It costs approximately €4,000 to install an additional meter, which is not feasible in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. These dwellings are inhabited and maintained independently, the only combined aspect being the single meter.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Will the Government bring in the necessary legislation to grant eligibility for electricity credits to independent dwellings or granny flats which currently share one meter? Parents are letting siblings and family move into their homes rather than go homeless and siblings are letting parents who have medical needs move into their home rather than into nursing homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">It is not that simple to get a totally universal system for the energy credit. That is why we have brought in other measures, in addition to that credit, to provide supports to others. There is, for example, the extension of the free fuel eligibility threshold which helps many people over 70 who would not have heretofore been entitled to it. We will talk to the Ministers concerned to see if we can do something. Anomalies like this are arising and we have dealt with some in different sectors. We have come up with a system to deal with those but we have to do it in a way that does not allow for obvious exploitation.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">There is huge angst over the LEADER programme going forward. Notwithstanding the increase in Exchequer funding for the overall CAP 2023-27, there is a significant cut in LEADER funding for rural areas, with the proposed allocation for the programme falling from €425 million for the 2007-13 programme to just €180 million for this programme. This is astonishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The co-funding element of 56.72% falls well short of the 80% permissible under the EU regulation. This reduction in funding will have a huge impact on rural projects, tourism projects and commercial projects across my county of Tipperary and every other county. LEADER has been bottoms-up one of the best programmes ever introduced. I think the then Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, introduced it. Many great projects have been supported, many volunteers have been on the boards and many volunteers in the community have got it going. Now they have been shot in the face like this.

The period was set before the Ukrainian war, which could not have been anticipated but which has caused a raft of difficulties for those businesses. Will the Government revisit the question of warehousing tax for those businesses? The Government has been forced to step in to assist them again in the budget and it seems contradictory to assist them on one hand, while on the other letting the Revenue Commissioners put them out of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">The debt warehousing scheme was very effective during Covid-19. About €2.9 billion of debt was warehoused during that period, as of the end of April 2022. Over 90,000 businesses availed of debt warehousing. However, it has not been considered yet in the context of the current energy crisis. There is a State aid temporary crisis framework put forward by the European Union that we have to be in line with. That is under review within Europe and we are also keeping our business reports under review, including on the issue of tax warehousing, but we have not made a decision on it. We are endeavouring to assess what the impact of measures will be on the viability of businesses. We want to protect jobs. That is the bottom line.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">Last night, the Mayor of Killarney, Councillor Niall Kelleher, and I met with a number of Ukrainian refugees and stakeholders from the community in Killarney on the outrageous proposal to relocate 135 Ukrainian refugees, mainly women and children, from Killarney to Westport, County Mayo, with 48 hours' notice. These people have been living in Killarney for the past seven months and have put down roots. The children have started school, while the women are working in local businesses and have been set up with their local GPs. Now, with 48 hours' notice, they are being uprooted and sent to Mayo. It is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> I call on the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to make the proper decision. This is not humane. If we are treating this emergency with a humanitarian response, there has to be humanity at the centre of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I recognise that moving these 112 Ukrainians will have an impact on families and individuals. The reason for the move is the pressure on the State's measures to meet the accommodation needs of Ukrainian displaced persons and international protection applicants. The number of Ukrainians arriving in the country has doubled in the past month as a consequence of renewed attacks on civilian targets. International protection applicant numbers remain high. We continue to have a real difficulty in sourcing accommodation for international protection applicants. Already, that lack of accommodation led to a situation where we had to turn international protection applicants away for a number of days. It is to try and avoid situations like that recurring that we have to take up all available accommodation for international protection where we can locate it. That is the case in Killarney. Asking people to move will have an impact on them, I absolutely accept that, but, fundamentally, my Department has to be in the position to provide accommodation and meals for all applicants, Ukrainians and international protection applicants alike. That is what we are seeking to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">A nine-year-old autistic boy called Harry who attended an autism class in his local primary school is now facing expulsion. An incident occurred last Thursday week which caused him to have a meltdown. He and his mother were waved off from school afterwards by the principal and his class teacher who said "We will see you tomorrow", only for his family to receive an email that night stating he was suspended pending a board of management meeting to consider expulsion. Harry had been progressing well in school. He is now crying several times a day because he wants to go to school and does not understand why he cannot do so. I ask the Taoiseach to address this issue with the Minister for Education and the Minister of State with responsibility for special education. Children with additional needs, in particular those attending special educational settings, should not be expelled. They have a right to an education in their local schools with their siblings. Principals can apply to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to provide additional resources where required. This is happening too often and it has to stop.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">I am always reluctant to deal with an individual case because I do not know the background to it and so forth, but no child with special needs should be expelled from school. Obviously, there could be circumstances that I am not aware of. However, what should happen immediately is that the various support services and special education needs organisers should be consulted first and measures taken to facilitate the child's placement in the school. The Department of Education will provide the resources for every situation. No child, particularly one with special needs, should be treated in that manner or identified in that way either. Again, I do not want to pass judgment without knowing the full details to be fair to all concerned. Ideally, this should be resolved on the ground, with the involvement of the family, the school community and the NCSE.</p>

Residents in Park West are facing bills of in the region of €30,000 per apartment for problems and defects that are not of their own making. A remedial scheme should have been provided in budget 2023 but was not. The Minister has a copy of the report of the working group. Will the Government announce details of and a timeline for a remedial scheme to support residents in order to give property owners clarity in respect of this matter? It is imperative that the owners have a clear timeline.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">As part of budget 2023, the temporary business energy support scheme was announced. I am sure the Taoiseach read the media coverage late last week like the rest of us. The scheme is limited to businesses that have profit from trade but excludes those that have profit from professions. There is already a shortage of dentists in my constituency. That will worsen if dentists are forced to close their doors permanently of to reduce their hours because of the rising cost of energy. They have no option but to absorb these energy costs because they have to use high-energy equipment, like the sterilising machines and suction machines. What engagement has the Government had with the GPs, dentists and other professions? Accountants will be working morning, noon and night in the context of the income tax deadline. What engagement has there been with the representative bodies of these professions in the context of amending this scheme to ensure that they are included in it?</p>

          <p eId="para_191">The Minister announced the scheme in the budget in respect of companies in trade. He did not deal directly with the professions. There has to be an approach to this that is proportionate and so on. We are open to engaging with various different sectors, but the funding has to be targeted at those most in need to protect as many jobs as possible. However, there are also implications for services as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">In the past week I was contacted about three bus services that are full by the time they get to Headford, Spiddal and Clannbridge on their way to Galway. When I made an inquiry, I was informed that this is a much more general positive result of the reduction in public transport fees. There is no point in bringing in a good scheme and then leaving people standing in cold, windy and wet weather at bus stops with no buses. I also understand that applications will be sent to the National Transport Authority, NTA - instead of the National Transport Authority, it should be referred to as the "Never-Make-A-Decision Authority" because it is eternally slow - to provide extra buses to meet the capacity needs. It would be much better if services were staggered because it would give people more choice during rush hour. Can the Taoiseach ensure that the NTA will make overnight decisions on simple applications to provide enough buses to meet demand on these routes?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">That is a fair point. Sometimes we make policy that is positive and popular and has the desired outcome in increasing the use of public transport. If we were to consider every eventuality, however, we would never make a decision in the first place. I make that as a general point. The NTA should make very quick decisions in terms of additionality. The capital is there to buy buses and to put additional services in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">The Taoiseach will be aware that there are many thousands of people with defects in their homes arising from the behaviour of the cowboy builders of the Celtic tiger era. The latter did even not deem it necessary to build proper houses. People are facing huge bills in the context of fire safety issues, water ingress and so on. There is one particular case that I would like the Taoiseach to look into, namely, that relating to Carrickmines Green. The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is control of that estate and is refusing to remedy building defects, even though it has done so elsewhere. I am told by residents that NAMA has sold units to people who do not know that there are serious building defects. This is despite the fact that the residents themselves cannot sell, get insurance and so on. The Minister for Finance should instruct NAMA and its liquidators to remediate those homes as it has done in other estates where it has been in control of the properties.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Does the Taoiseach share my concerns regarding the decision by RTÉ radio to drop a heavily sanitised interview it had recorded with the former Minister and former Deputy Shane Ross on his new book on Deputy McDonald? RTÉ has some very serious questions to answer. It is a publicly funded organisation, getting millions of euro of taxpayers' money in the recent budget. It has a duty of public service in its public broadcasting. I am not sure what or whom it is afraid of and what it is hiding. This is censorship of the highest order. I believe it has some very serious consequences for the national broadcaster. It is a very worrying development. Shane Ross was able to give interviews to Newstalk, Today FM and other independent radio stations. I believe RTÉ has questions to answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">I do not know the background to the entire case other than to say that such a development has a chilling effect on public debate and on democracy. Of that there is no doubt. When the national broadcaster is sued by any organisation of considerable clout and heft, obviously the national broadcaster is taking a cautious position here and because of the fear of being sued will not broadcast the interview. That is something that demands greater transparency and explanation.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I found it intriguing that apparently a political party got access to the interview to listen to it prior to it being known. I do not think I was ever afforded that opportunity as the Leader of the Opposition - I stand to be corrected. Someone may have said, "Listen, have a listen to that there. Do you think we have permission to publish it?" It may not have been exactly in those terms. I do not think RTÉ was saying, "Give us permission to report."

            <p eId="para_223">I propose to take questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_224"> My Department received the report of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, commission of investigation on the Siteserv transaction on 29 July 2022. I arranged for it to be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 7 September 2022, following consultation with the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_225"> The commission's report is more than 1,500 pages long and goes through all aspects of the Siteserv transaction in an extraordinary level of detail as well as making extensive findings of fact. The report shines a light on unacceptable practices by certain parties during the course of the transaction and the Government noted its findings with considerable concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_226"> Among the many findings made by the commission in its report, it determined that it could be concluded that the Bank made its decision to approve the sale of Siteserv in good faith, but based on misleading and incomplete information provided to it by the company. The commission also determined that it can be concluded that the Siteserv transaction was, from the perspective of the bank, so tainted by impropriety and wrongdoing, that the transaction was not commercially sound.</p>
            <p eId="para_227"> The commission also found that the procedures and controls that were operated by IBRC at the relevant relating to the Siteserv transaction were fit for purpose. It also found there is no evidence that any unusual trading in Siteserv shares occurred. The commission also established the approach taken by the IBRC concerning the setting of interest rates for individual loans and how those decisions were reached, and made no adverse findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_228"> The commission recommended that the report be brought to the attention of relevant authorities concerning a number of taxation, company law and bankruptcy issues. Accordingly, as per the commission's recommendations and on foot of advice from the Attorney General, I have brought the report to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, the special liquidators of the IBRC, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, the Central Bank and the official assignee in a bankruptcy case. These bodies are now responsible for conducting any appropriate investigations on foot of the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">I note that the Taoiseach said in the past that the report was worthwhile. I agree insofar as it has shone a light on how things really work, how the business elite can take themselves off to a Swiss resort for a bootcamp and then not discuss what they really went away to discuss. Seven years later and having spent millions of euro of public money, we end up with a report that states that this was not a solid or sound transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_230"> There are 37 additional transactions by IBRC with a net loss more than €10 million each to the State. The question is: what will happen now? I do not believe that anyone would want to see another seven years per investigation with more millions of euro per investigation. The Taoiseach said he has referred this to the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank, etc. Is it not high time that the State found a process by which to investigate alleged inappropriate carry-on with corporate dealings or the potential of white-collar crime? Is the Garda not interested this? Is corporate enforcement not the first place we should be going to? Can the DPP look at it? Rather than spending years and millions of euro on investigations of something which obviously stinks, can we not go and use the system of justice that actually exists to investigate particularly the 37 additional transactions which should be investigated?</p>

            <p eId="para_231">The findings of the IBRC Commission of Investigation report lift a veil on the reckless and elitist culture that infected certain echelons of Irish business and high finance during the Celtic tiger years. As we know, the commission is still preparing a report with its recommendations on the investigation of the other 37 transactions it has considered as part of its work.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">Does the Taoiseach expect that the commission's report on these transactions will be submitted by the end of this month? How soon after that can we expect the Government to decide on the future of the commission itself, as it has also indicated there were insurmountable difficulties in progressing the investigation into these transactions. How does the Government intend to proceed? The total cost of the investigation has yet to be finalised, but we know it will be millions of euro. What consideration has the Taoiseach given to a more timely and less expensive mechanism by which such matters can be addressed? Given that the report as published has now been passed to the Revenue Commissioners, the special liquidators of the IBRC, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, the Central Bank and the official assignee in the bankruptcy case for further investigations, obvious questions are being asked as to who, if anybody, is going to be held accountable for what has transpired.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_118">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_233">It was indeed a very substantial document. On reading it, enormous detail is evident. What does the Taoiseach expect from the various entities to which he refers? Does he expect Revenue, the Corporate Enforcement Authority or the special liquidator of IBRC to come back to him? Is there a response? It would be obscene if those who got bonuses and who so tainted the process were permitted to keep them. Is that something the special liquidator is looking at in regard to IBRC?</p>
            <p eId="para_234"> There is also another aspect I wish to raise, namely, the leaked document from the official in Davy, who dealt with this case - Mr. Carville, now works as a senior official in the Department of Finance. Does the Taoiseach have a comment to make on that, because it does not seem to be something we can just gloss over?</p>
            <p eId="para_235"> Does the Corporate Enforcement Authority have the ability and staff to do the job? It was to be set up in January of this year and there were to be 16 gardaí, but there are still only seven gardaí assigned to it, although it deals with some very important cases and gardaí are required to be part of the process. Does the Taoiseach consider the authority to have sufficient staff to be able to handle the kind of work that is required to be done when issues such as this are referred to it?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_236">During the debate on the IBRC commission report on Siteserv the Taoiseach indicated that the commission was due to submit a report before the end of October on the other 37 transactions. Could he update us on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_237"> As my colleague, Deputy Nash, pointed out during Dáil statements in September, there is a broader issue here where investigations under the Commissions of Investigations Act cannot serve a useful purpose if they cannot be completed within a reasonable timeframe and arrive at the truth in an effective and expeditious manner. Given that the evidence they gather is not admissible in similar criminal proceedings, they were supposed to be effective, efficient truth-finding mechanisms. Also, given how long the report has taken on just this one aspect, reading the report could be said to be like examining a long-buried time capsule with a story from long ago. If it is taking too long to get to the truth, and if we cannot use the commissions of investigation in an expeditious manner then we must ask if there is a case for a different sort of process to uncover or investigate the sort of issues the commission on Siteserv was set up to do. There is a genuine public concern about the length of time taken and the difficulty of getting to the truth through this mechanism, which we must recall was supposed to be an effective, efficient and expeditious version of the previous tribunals of inquiry mechanism. What is the preferred mechanism for such investigations in future?</p>

            <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_238">Who is going to be held to account for what happened in the sale of Siteserv? Most people feel at this stage that this report is going to end up on a dusty shelf somewhere and that nothing is going to happen when it comes to the actions that were not taken in regard to the sale of Siteserv. There is a major frustration out there that this particular crisis was politically shelved by a long-term commission of inquiry so that the heat was taken out of it at a time where it was causing a major challenge to the Government of the day, and that now nobody is going to be held to account.</p>
            <p eId="para_239"> My view is that the case should be with the Garda. There needs to be a situation where people are held to account for the actions that they have taken. What happened in Siteserv was extraordinary. There was a write-down of €119 million, much of which came from the pockets of taxpayers and citizens. Siteserv gave €5 million to shareholders at the time of the write-down, which was extraordinary. Arthur Cox acted for the two sides of the same transaction, which was also extraordinary. The job was to maximise the number of bidders to get the most for the taxpayer from the sale, yet the commission of inquiry shows that is not what happened. The number of bidders was minimised.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_123">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_242">In the first instance, the commission of inquiry is in itself a form of holding people to account. The background in Ireland is that we have a written Constitution. People have legal rights and there is the presumption of innocence and so forth, which creates a legal context, which it seems to me makes all forms of inquiry very difficult. I make that general point. Deputy Bacik is more versed in the law than most here. That is a fundamental problem we have. Going back over the years, sometimes we have managed fairly quick investigations, some of them even non statutory: for example, the Ferns inquiry into abuse in the diocese of Ferns, which I initiated. A very good senior counsel at the time, now a judge, George Birmingham, got through it in months, to such an extent that it was ready for a statutory inquiry. It happened much more quickly also because the church co-operated 100% and the new bishop who came in handed over all the documentation. I remember other inquiries took an age - five and six years. The commission of investigation model was brought in to speed up the process in comparison to the inquiries under the original tribunals of inquiry Act, because they were going on too long. There is a fundamental issue that the Oireachtas must return to at some stage and on which it must consult in respect of whether there are effective means to have inquiries that can be short, concise and get to the point in terms of finding out what happened and what actions should follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_243"> In this case, there are very clear recommendations as to where it should go. We have sent the report to those bodies. I am not of the view that the report will gather dust on a shelf because what is in the report is quite substantial. I do not want to prejudice anything that might happen, but considerable clarity has been brought to a lot of issues, in particular regarding taxation, people not being kept informed and so on. That is a matter for the Corporate Enforcement Authority but also Revenue and so on. They will not necessarily be coming back to me. They will now deal with the individuals concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> To be fair, it was the Opposition, of which I was a member at the time, that sought this inquiry from the Government of the day. We cannot accuse the Government of the day of politically shelving it. All the leaders met - Deputy Catherine Murphy will remember that - in the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny's room. We then agreed to develop new legislation. This legislation is bespoke legislation, above and beyond the original commissions of investigation legislation because the judge had come back and said he needed additional powers as he faced potential legal challenges all along the way in respect of the progression of this report.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> I believe we should go back to first principles. The existing investigatory and regulatory framework should be our first port of call in respect of investigating white-collar crime. I am speaking generally. My comments are not just in the context of Siteserv. The Garda must have stronger units. It is developing stronger teams in the area of fraud in conjunction with the Corporate Enforcement Authority. That needs to happen and is happening in terms of additional resources. Right across the board, all the various regulatory organisations should be far more proactive. What tends to happen is that the first port of call in the House is that we all just call for a commission. We are all guilty of that. It is the easiest thing to call for and to table a motion on. It can take seven years, which is too long. It is not satisfactory. This was previously examined by the Law Reform Commission in 2005. There was a report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_246">It listed some advantages of a permanent inquiries office if we were to establish one. Over time, it stated, the staff would become experienced in investigations and would be paid salaries rather than a daily rate, resulting in savings. The office would have easy access to precedents and guidance on procedural issues and would provide a one-stop shop for those seeking information. However, it also listed disadvantages, stating:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_247">Although a number of public inquiries may be in existence at present, there is no guarantee that there will be a need for similar bodies in the future ... [P]ublic inquiries ... are <i>ad hoc</i> bodies [by their nature] ... and their structure and personnel should reflect this.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">Certain situations demand certain types of inquiries. Of course, I have no doubt that if there was a permanent office of inquiries, it would be inundated in a short time by this House. That is not to make any judgments but that would happen. Everyone would want to make inquires. We would be in a kind of a Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, situation. I get the sense GSOC has hundreds of inquiries to go through and people do not seem to get satisfaction in terms of timely responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_249"> I am sorry for going on a bit there, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I was trying to get to the nub of what the Deputies were asking about.</p>

            <p eId="para_262"> The Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change oversees the implementation of the ambitious programme for Government commitments in respect of the environment and climate change. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 sets out Ireland's key climate change commitments. It sets challenging carbon reduction targets for the period to 2030 and a statutory commitment to achieving a climate-neutral economy by 2050.</p>
            <p eId="para_263"> Following the approval of the carbon budget programme by the Houses of the Oireachtas in April, sectoral emission ceilings determining the upper limits of greenhouse gas emissions for all sectors have been agreed by the Government, save for the land use sector, which requires further analytical work to be undertaken over the coming 15 months. Agreed policies and measures designed to ensure sectors quickly and significantly reduce their emissions have been set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021. The plan will be further revised this year to ensure the actions it contains are sufficient to meet the reduction targets made explicit through the setting of the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> The next meeting of the Cabinet committee is scheduled to take place on Thursday, 27 October, and it will continue to meet regularly to progress all aspects of the Government's ambitious climate action and environmental policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_265">In less than a month, COP27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It is hard to believe it has been almost one year since Greta Thunberg famously described COP26 as "blah, blah, blah". I have just read an article by Naomi Klein describing COP27 as "blood, blood, blood", because it is taking place in one of the most brutal and oppressive regimes in the world, in Egypt, where about 60,000 political prisoners face brutal torture daily by this oppressive regime. Many of them have been censored in silence from even writing letters to their families concerning the climate crisis. In one case of a famous political prisoner, a letter to his mother outlining his concerns about 30 million people being displaced in Pakistan by the recent floods was intercepted and censored.</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> Does the Taoiseach agree with Naomi Klein that this summit is going well beyond greenwashing a polluting state and is actually greenwashing a police state? When world leaders meet on Thursday, 27 October, will he raise this issue, along with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and ensure the Irish State will give no succour or solace to the COP27 cover-up of this most brutal, oppressive and anti-environmental regime in that part of the world?</p>

            <p eId="para_267">As the Taoiseach knows, solar is a renewable energy source that is quick to deploy, but it faces many of the same institutional barriers as wind. Changes in planning for rooftop panels on residential and other buildings will finally bring Ireland into line with the EU's solar rooftops initiative. However, issues remain for larger projects that are reliant on a decision by An Bord Pleanála. A solar project can take three months to construct but a year and a half to go through the planning process and even after all the delays, the Government has still managed to overpromise and underdeliver on microgeneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> Is the Taoiseach aware households will not receive payments for the excess energy they generate until the end of this year at the earliest and are being offered as little as 14 cent per kilowatt-hour, which is ridiculous? It has been promised all schools will get solar panels. Will the full cost of those projects be covered for those schools or will it be just partial costs, as in the case of the microgeneration installation scheme the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications announced yesterday?</p>

            <p eId="para_269">As the Taoiseach knows, we are in not only a climate emergency but also a biodiversity emergency, and often the latter is forgotten and neglected. That is particularly important when we think about our marine area and the protection of it. Not only is that sea an unparalleled store of biodiversity but it is also the most important carbon sink. If we destroy marine biodiversity or if we do not have a proper system for ensuring it is developed in a sustainable way, we will do double the damage to both biodiversity and the attempt to battle climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_270"> Against that background, I strongly urge the Taoiseach to study the identifying areas of interest for marine protected area, MPA, designation produced by the Fair Seas group. It castigates the Government for the fact that only 2% of our areas have been designated whereas we need to have a minimum of 30%, and points out that many of the self-selected sites for offshore industrial wind are on sites that would destroy potential marine protected areas. Will he look into that and ensure our marine is not destroyed by profit-driven companies?</p>

            <p eId="para_271">I ask that the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change take account of three matters, first the need for more transformational transport projects, such as the Labour Party's call for a €9 per month climate ticket for unlimited public transport journeys. We certainly welcome the plan to deliver 30 Pathfinder public transport projects, such as the phasing-out of cars from College Green in Dublin, but we need to see more radical policies introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> Second, I ask that the Government support my Dublin Bay Bill, which would transform the governance and oversight of the bay area of that wonderful natural amenity. I met the SOS Dublin Bay group earlier and I know there is a strong public view that we need to move on greater protection of the wonderful biodiversity habitat that is Dublin Bay.</p>
            <p eId="para_273"> Third, I raise the issue of energy security, specifically for those in apartments and complexes heated through a shared or district heating system. These people are being hit with extortionate price increases because the supplier is the purchaser of the fuel and is charged a commercial tariff. Tenants and homeowners have no choice of supplier in such complexes but are seeing price rises of nearly 600%, which is not sustainable. They need a gas price cap now. Will the Taoiseach urge the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to raise this at EU level, where there are ongoing discussions about a European-wide cap?</p>

            <p eId="para_274">I bring to the Taoiseach’s attention a headline in my local newspaper, the <i>Southern Star</i>, that states, "Forget the climate for now says TD". The newspaper attributes that comment to a public representative in my constituency. This is in the context of people drowning in floods across the globe, dying in forest fires that are out of control, sea levels rising and thousands of young Irish people having taken to the streets calling on us for action, yet there are public representatives in the House, climate change deniers, who are saying, let us do nothing; forget about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> I ask the Taoiseach to ramp up our climate actions, our offshore renewable energy and our retrofitting scheme so it is targeted at the people who need it most. I ask him to ramp up our renewable energy so we can silence these climate change deniers.</p>

            <p eId="para_276">Dawn Meats was given permission by Meath County Council to install a 7.2 km pipeline that would pump treated effluent in the Boyne river, a special area of conservation. The pipeline would dispose of 400,000 l of wastewater into that historic river daily.</p>
            <p eId="para_277"> The Save the Boyne campaign was founded to protect against this. Its spokesperson, Peter Whelan, has stated that the river is the source of drinking water for 70,000 households, and it is also home to wildlife including otters, salmon and lampreys.</p>
            <p eId="para_278">It is also the location of some the most important Neolithic monuments in Europe. Some 400 submission were made to the council. It has been given planning permission, however, and is now with An Bord Pleanála. This summer, especially, has seen exceptionally low water. I have lived by the River Boyne all my life and I have never seen the water this low. In parts of the River Boyne, there is no flow and no water at all. There is literally no water behind weirs and yet, this particular factory is going to be given a licence to put 400,000 l of wastewater into it. Will the Government come out against this particular project and make sure we protect our rivers for the wildlife and for people?</p>

            <p eId="para_279">Thanks to a parliamentary question submitted by my colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, we now know that data centres are to be included in the temporary business energy support scheme. Under the scheme, businesses can be compensated for increased electricity and gas bills up to a limit of €10,000 per month. The scheme is to be backdated to September and is expected to run until at least February of next year. There are currently approximately 70 data centres in this State. They are, in very significant measure, responsible for the energy grid crisis in this State and the threat of blackouts this winter. Yet, by my calculations, on the Government's scheme, 70 data centres at €10,000 for six months at a minimum means a potential subsidy of €4.2 million from this State to these companies. Can the Taoiseach tell me and the country that this is not so?</p>

            <p eId="para_280">Carlinn Hall in Dundalk is one of these communal district heating systems with in or around 200 homes. The fact is that at the minute, the prices have risen. We are now talking approximately 42 cent per kWh. Frontline Energy provides heat. I have dealt with the Ministers and the Department. It looks like the long-term fix is the possibility of biomass or geothermal energy. We need to ensure we have the grant schemes that can deliver on that. While I would like to see a cap, I definitely think we have to facilitate making available electricity credits to these people. We should also possibly look at the idea of a business energy support scheme. Were Frontline able to avail of it once delivered, the savings could be passed on to those people who are obviously under incredible pressure. The long-term fix is already under way but we need a short-term fix to get people through what will be a brutal winter.</p>

            <p eId="para_281">In response to Deputy Bríd Smith, there is a dilemma here. In the first instance, the response to climate change must be global. It has to involve all the states insofar as that is possible. That includes Egypt and many other states whose political systems or systems of governance are obviously not what we would be happy with. Through the European Union, we consistently raise issues of human rights in respect of what happens in Egypt and, indeed, other countries within the Middle East, as well as across Asia and Africa. I do not believe COP27 is about greenwashing a police state; I think it is a genuine attempt to follow COP26, which was far more effective than people would have anticipated given that a year or two earlier, President Trump, who did not agree with any of this, was in office. There was actually a degree of agreement between some of the major states at COP26. We need to continue to build on that. Each member state needs to play its role and part.</p>

I will talk to the Minister in respect of what people are getting per kW from the grid. We will follow up on that. Suffice to say, we want to get as much solar and renewable energy in place as we possibly can.

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_334">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 28, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy including sport, equality, arts and culture as well as children and youth affairs, and public services including matters relating to justice, policing reform and community safety. The Cabinet committee last met on 16 May and will meet again in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_336"> Recent public policy advancements in the area of social affairs includes publication of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The central aim of this strategy is to bring about zero tolerance towards domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Irish society, as well as the attitudes and assumptions that underpin it.</p>
            <p eId="para_337"> Another important goal of the strategy is to improve the co-ordination and delivery of services for those affected by these forms of violence. In this regard, a new statutory domestic, sexual and bender-based violence agency with political oversight of the strategy will be established, situated within the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, which I chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> In addition, a high-level oversight board, chaired by the Secretaries General to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Justice, will be established to ensure that actions are being implemented successfully and within the specified timelines. The high-level oversight board is expected to hold its first meeting in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> In addition to meetings of the Cabinet committee, I have regular engagements with Ministers, both at Cabinet and individually, to discuss priority issues relating to their Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_340">A number of meetings have also been held between my officials and officials from relevant Departments on a range of social policy issues since the establishment of the Cabinet committee in July 2020. That would have involved a number of meetings with a number of partnership groups in different parts of the city, including Ballyfermot, Ballymun and the north-east inner city. I am anxious to try to develop a new policy framework to govern how we deal with communities that require significant multidisciplinary supports on a partnership basis into the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_341">This Government and previous Governments have failed to grasp the winds of change in drug reform. When other states are changing course, I would argue that this State has stagnated in drug reform. In the past 20 years 10,000 people in this State have died of drug-related deaths, which is an incredible statistic. That is 500 people every year in the State. I would argue that if these people had different postal addresses and codes, the response from this Government and previous Governments would have been very different. We are in an unsustainable situation and the amount of resources that go into criminalising people for drug use does not work. Even US President Joe Biden made an announcement last week on reform in the US policy on cannabis use and so forth, and that is welcome, but in this State we criminalise people for using drugs. The majority of people in the prison population are there for drug offences. The resources that go into criminalising people simply do not work and we need to do something very different.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_174">
            <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_342">The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, announced last month that the Government had approved the domestic violence leave report. Recommendation 4 of that report states that employers should retain the right to request proof of abuse from a victim seeking leave. This recommendation reflects the disappointing and regressive position contained within IBEC's submission to the Department. Such a provision would be deeply inappropriate and totally unnecessary. When questioned at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Tánaiste stated that he did "not see how evidential proof could be a requirement of the legislation" and that such a provision would make the legislation effectively "unworkable". Does the Taoiseach agree with the Tánaiste on this and if so, will he give a commitment that there will be no requirement for proof of abuse included in this legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_343"> I also ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the Government’s decision to cut in half the existing entitlement. The standard leave entitlement provided for in the public and private sector is ten days, as is the statutory provision in the North. When Fianna Fáil first committed to the introduction of this leave in 2018 it committed to ten days of leave. Reducing this to five days also goes against existing Government policy. Last year, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, wrote to all the universities to ask that they introduce ten days of paid leave for victims and survivors of domestic abuse and the main universities have since agreed to do so. Surely the Government wants to make progress rather than row back on existing provisions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_344">I had asked the Taoiseach about the high level oversight board for the zero tolerance strategy but I know he is appearing before the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, that I chair, tomorrow so we can address that further then. I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his engagement with our committee and for his engagement on the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality. I know all of us on the committee look forward to our engagement tomorrow with the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_345"> I wish to raise a separate urgent matter regarding funding for Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, an organisation that provides vital supports to many survivors of brain injury. The current dormant accounts funding measures to support the employment of people with disabilities programme runs up to the end of 2022 but Acquired Brain Injury Ireland has received no formal update on what will happen to its service, particularly to the Step Ahead Plus programme, a specialist neuro service working nationwide with brain injury survivors in their return to work, education and training. Bodies like this need a commitment to multi-annual funding to ensure they can keep their highly skilled staff and crucially, to ensure brain injury survivors will retain access to vital services that enable them to return to work or access education. I am asking for a commitment that Acquired Brain Injury Ireland be guaranteed funding to continue to provide its vital service beyond the end of 2022.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_346">Many if not most organisations advocating for people with disabilities were extremely disappointed with the budget. One of the demands they all rallied behind was that there should be a cost-of-disability premium to bring minimum payments for people with disabilities up to €350 per week, as we deemed appropriate during Covid, and that people with disability should get at least that in recognition of the huge costs of living with disability. I was at a briefing with Inclusion Ireland where some shocking facts were relayed on our lack of provision for people with disabilities. I was informed that 2,500 people are unnecessarily living in institutions and that 1,300 people below the age of 65 are living in nursing homes. I was also informed that many young people are still living with parents who are their carers. However for 1,500 of those people, their carers are over the age of 70 and for 400 of them their carers are over the age of 80, begging the question of who will care for these people when their parents pass on. I will name a few of the issues as follows. There is also a lack of therapeutic resources and supports in schools for young people with special needs. The Government has failed to seriously address all these things and to ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Equality is a right for people with disabilities but the Government has not matched that with budgetary measures or with policy measures generally.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_347">I would like to again raise with the Taoiseach the issue of early childhood care and education, ECCE-only providers. I commend the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O’Gorman, and the Government on their interventions up to now and for the record levels of investment by the State. That said, there is still an anomaly in ECCE-only providers. Fees remain frozen, which is a good thing for parents, but capitation fees also remain frozen. More and more ECCE providers are closing or are signalling that they intend to close in the coming months. The childcare providers are broadly supportive of the State’s investment in childcare, which I previously mentioned, but the anomaly of ECCE-only providers needs to be addressed urgently.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_348">I met foster mothers in Carlow-Kilkenny yesterday and what I heard was worrying. Although these foster families do an incredible job on behalf of the State, I felt the State should do more for them. Foster care allowance has not increased since 2009 and if the same children were to be put into State care the weekly cost per child would be €6,000. I heard a foster parent was told to go out and get a job to pay for specialised equipment for a child with special needs and I also heard in their voices a fear that if they were to complain the child might be removed from them. Tusla tells us money is there but when these parents came looking for money for special food, beds or school assistance there was none. If they look for occupational therapists privately because the waiting lists are so long they are told to go and seek three quotes, even if this means hauling a child across county borders and many miles away. It is long past time that these children were made a priority.</p>

          <speech by="#MickBarry" eId="spk_179">
            <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_349">I note that the plans for paid domestic violence leave are being strongly opposed by IBEC. IBEC has argued that employers should be allowed to ask for proof to stop any "potential abuse" of paid leave to victims of domestic violence. This position is disgraceful. Why is the Government supporting five days of leave instead of the ten days that was its previous position? The zero tolerance strategy measures are minimal when set against the epidemic of gender violence in our society. It is beyond belief that the Government is proposing that in five years' time, Ireland's refuge provision will still be below the Istanbul Convention targets. Some eight women are turned away from refuges every day in this State. On the basis of the proposals the Government has brought forward, in five years' time that number may be reduced to four.</p>
            <p eId="para_350">When does zero tolerance not mean zero tolerance?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_180">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_351">First, in regard to drug reform, Deputy Gino Kenny outlined the appalling death toll in Ireland from drug abuse. There are a number of approaches to dealing with this. I think part of the issue we have is that there tend to be stop-start initiatives. We need a continuous perseverance in communities in regard to drug traffickers and all of that, as well as in terms of giving young people supports in order that they can deal with the pressures they come under. We also need stronger supports in terms of facilities and services to help people come off a particular addiction. In addition, consideration is being given to decriminalising some offences. The Government is open to reform in regard to drug policy. We believe in a health-oriented approach as opposed to a criminal justice-oriented approach in respect of those who use drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> The situation in the country is very serious in terms of the impact of addiction generally on people and the degree to which it ruins people's lives. We are allocating fairly significant resources to the issue across health, justice and education. That needs to continue and persevere and I also think an area-based response can yield results as well. As I referenced earlier, we are anxious to develop the drugs task forces, which worked well in an earlier era. The issue is that some of them were discontinued when they should have been persevered with. These are facilities and frameworks that are put in place for the long haul, not the short haul, with the need for multidisciplinary teams working locally with schools, childcare providers, parents, homes and families and all the agencies working together. Where that happens, you can get good outcomes and results.</p>
            <p eId="para_353"> Deputy O'Reilly raised the broader issue of proof in respect of domestic violence leave. That is not Government policy and, quite frankly, it is not comprehensible how it could be put into legislation. There is no way the Government will be doing that. As I said in the Dáil some weeks ago, we have to approach these issues in a sensitive, helpful way for any person who comes forward to say, "I am a victim of domestic violence".</p>

            <p eId="para_357">I will come back on that. Again, this is breaking new ground, to be fair to the Minister. It is a very good start but we will revisit it.</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> Deputy Bacik raised the issue of funding for Acquired Brain Injury Ireland. I will look at that. It does fantastic work and I think it needs multi-annual funding. I have visited the organisation on many occasions. I believe it should also benefit from the cost-of-living package the Minister has announced for voluntary and community organisations. My understanding is the HSE provides some funding to it on a continuous basis but I will come back to the Deputy on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_359"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of the cost of disability. We provided a once-off payment in the budget in terms of the cost of living but the wider issue is the need for a more sustainable multi-annual cost-of-disability premium.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan has been consistent in raising the point about the ECCE-only provision being a disadvantage to other childcare providers. It is a very fair point and I will pursue it with the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has engaged on the issue raised by Deputy Murnane O'Connor and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is open to further measures that might help. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, announced a once-off cost-of-living payment to foster parents from now until the end of the year but more needs to be done. I take the Deputy's point that there has been no increase since 2007.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_364">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_365">As we are only too well aware, energy prices have continued to rise to unprecedented levels. The Government is keenly aware of the impact this is having on consumers and the need to take action at scale. Therefore, I commend the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I will open the debate by setting the context for the action to be taken on foot of this Bill, which will establish an electricity costs emergency benefit scheme II, under which a total of €550 will be paid to domestic electricity accounts in three payments between November this year and March next year. The House will be familiar with these issues, particularly in light of the first electricity costs emergency benefit scheme, which was enacted earlier this year. It is important to take this opportunity to set out the complex situation we find ourselves in with regard to energy costs and wider pressures on the cost of living. I will also describe the sections of the Bill in detail, and, in regard to its main provisions, set out some background on why they are needed for the operation of the scheme. My overarching message today is that while the scheme this Bill will establish is just one of a suite of measures, it is critical that it be put in place in order that payments can begin from 1 November. I seek Deputies' support to achieve that. I will first outline the main factors affecting electricity prices in Ireland. Second, I will provide an overview of the domestic response to rising electricity and gas prices. As colleagues will be well aware, addressing the huge cost-of-living pressures on our citizens was the focus of budget 2023. Third, I will outline the provisions in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I now turn to the first point, namely, factors affecting Irish electricity prices. The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is sustained high international gas prices, with the unprecedented increases and volatility continuing as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This, in turn, has led to increases in energy bills, given the link between the wholesale price of gas and electricity prices. It is a matter of serious concern to the Government that rising electricity and gas prices caused by these international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, particularly those in a more vulnerable economic position and at risk of energy poverty. That is why the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been meeting with electricity and gas suppliers to convey a clear message as to the critical importance of doing everything possible to support financially vulnerable energy customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> It is important to say that all European markets are experiencing these price increases. While Ireland has its own specific circumstances, the rise in energy costs is not unique to us. In response to rising electricity and gas prices in the EU, the European Commission has put in place a number of measures available to member states to mitigate the impact of energy price rises on households and businesses. The Energy Council agreed a Council regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices at its meeting on 30 September this year. The new EU emergency market intervention regulation consists of three main measures. First is a mandatory 5% cut in electricity consumption during peak hours. This will require member states to identify the 10% of hours with the highest expected price and to take appropriate action to reduce demand during those hours. The overall target is a 10% cut in total electricity demand until 31 March 2023. Second is a temporary revenue cap on inframarginal electricity producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I will now turn to the Government's response and the part that this scheme plays within that response. In terms of the overall cost of living, it is vital to stress that a co-ordinated whole-of-government response is being followed and is essential in tackling this issue. The forthcoming energy poverty action plan will set out a range of measures to be implemented this winter, as well as key longer term measures to ensure that those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected. This work is being undertaken by a steering group consisting of relevant Departments and Government agencies. This area of work also includes interactions with the NGO sector. In response to rising energy prices, the Government has already taken action throughout 2022 and has introduced a suite of measures worth €2.4 billion to assist households with their energy costs. Budget 2023 provides a further €2.5 billion in once-off measures for households. Budget 2023 provides a number of targeted measures, including: a €400 lump-sum payment to fuel allowance recipients; a €200 lump sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability getting the living alone increase; a €500 cost-of-living lump sum payment to all families getting the working family payment; double payment of child benefit to support all families with children; a €500 cost-of-living payment for people in receipt of the carer's support grant, which will be paid in November; and a €500 lump-sum cost-of-living disability support grant, which will be paid to all people in receipt of long-term disability payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> It important to draw attention to the additional needs payment operated by the Department of Social Protection. This is a payment to help with expenses that a person cannot pay from his or her own weekly income, including increases in fuel and electricity costs. Furthermore, in light of current situation, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has announced enhanced consumer protection measures for this winter. These include an extension to moratoriums on disconnections. Under the new measures, the moratorium has been extended from 1 December until 28 February, and for vulnerable customers, it has been extended from 1 October to 31 March. Extended debt repayment periods of up to 24 months have been introduced, along with a reduced debt burden on pay-as-you-go top-ups. New measures mean that debt repayment levels will reduce to 10%, from 25% previously, on pay-as-you-go customers top-up payments. For example, on a €20 top-up only €2 will go towards debt repayment, instead of €5. There is better value for those on financial hardship meters. Customers with a financial hardship meter will be put on the cheapest tariff available from their supplier. There will also be promotion of a vulnerable customer register. Electricity suppliers must actively promote the vulnerable customer register and the protection it offers</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Solar photovoltaic, PV, panels convert energy from the sun into electricity, thereby reducing the amount of electricity a building draws from the national grid, and lowering electricity bills. Since 2018, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has supported the installation of domestic solar PV systems for over 12,000 homes. With demand for the domestic solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that grant applications will exceed 12,000 in 2022 alone. I also understand that approximately 40,000 micro and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and over 26,550 of this cohort have smart meters, which means they are already accruing the value of the clean export guarantee, CEG, tariff for their exported electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Government is acutely aware of the importance of protecting jobs, in order to protect families, during this energy crisis. This has been key in the design of the new temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which will provide up to €10,000 per business per month until spring 2023 to help meet rising energy costs. The scheme will support eligible companies, covering 40% of the increase in their energy bills. </p>
          <p eId="para_373"> A total of €244 million has been allocated for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, residential and community retrofit schemes and the solar PV scheme in 2022. Of this, €118 million has been allocated to energy poverty schemes. More than 4,500 homes will benefit from the free upgrades targeted at those in energy poverty this year. In addition, €85 million funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme for this year. This means that of the total Government retrofit budget allocation of €329 million, approximately 60%, or €203 million, has been allocated to dedicated energy poverty schemes and local authority retrofits this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Budget 2023 also provides €337 million for SEAI residential and community energy upgrade schemes, including the solar PV scheme, for medically vulnerable electricity customers. Some €291 million of this allocation will come from carbon tax revenue, which is the highest ever allocation for these schemes. This will facilitate the delivery of home upgrades to 37,000 homes, including 6,000 free upgrades to those in energy poverty. A further €87 million has also been allocated for the local authority retrofit programme for next year. Additionally, the review of the national development plan, NDP, resulted in an unprecedented level of investment earmarked for retrofit. Indeed, €5 billion of additional carbon tax revenues have been allocated to support residential retrofit to 2030. This means that the overall allocation for residential retrofit will be approximately €8 billion to 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> My remaining remarks will be on the subject matter of the Bill. Notwithstanding other measures, the Government is determined to act quickly to help people further with these higher energy prices. The Bill provides for the establishment of a scheme for the purpose of making the electricity cost emergency benefit payments of €183.49 to domestic electricity accounts to be paid in November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023. The moneys for the scheme will be allocated by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and reform, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. This amount will not exceed €1.211 billion. This figure makes provision for 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> The CRU will provide oversight of the scheme and it will be operated by the distribution system operator, ESB Networks, and electricity suppliers. The mechanism by which the scheme will operate is as follows. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications will provide, under regulations, for a date, to be known as the relevant date, on which the distribution system operator will calculate the total number of domestic electricity accounts in the State, on the basis of meter point registration numbers, MPRNs. The MPRN is the unique identifier for electricity meters and as such, must be used to ensure each €183.49 payment reaches each account. ESB Networks will notify the Minister of this number, and this will allow the estimation and necessary allocation of moneys for the scheme. On the effective dates for each payment period, which will also be set out in regulations, ESB Networks will notify each electricity supplier of the assigned MPRN for each domestic electricity account they supply. ESB Networks will also, on the effective dates, notify suppliers of the amount of money it will transfer to them for the purposes of the scheme. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications will set out in regulations the payment periods within which ESB Networks will transfer the funds to suppliers for the sole purpose of making payments under the scheme. Following receipt of these funds, suppliers will then, within the payment periods set out in the Act, credit each domestic electricity account held with them on the effective date with a payment of €183.49.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> The CRU, as independent regulator, will have oversight of the scheme. It will put in place administrative and operational arrangements to ensure that ESB Networks and suppliers perform their functions under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The CRU, on the basis of its existing powers to issue directions and secure compliance by licence holders with their obligations, will ensure that ESB Networks and suppliers perform their functions under the Bill. Suppliers and ESB Networks are required to repay any monies received by them which have not been used for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The Bill also amends the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 to provide for a reduction in the petroleum product levy, more commonly known as the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy. The NORA levy is a charge of 2 cent per litre applied to most petroleum products sold in the market for the purpose of funding the operations of NORA and the Climate Action Fund. The levy will now be reduced to a nominal amount, with the reduction to come into effect from 12 October and to remain in place until the end of February 2023. This levy reduction will offset the carbon tax increase on petrol and diesel road fuels, which will apply from 12 October. It should be noted that NORA has a significant financial reserve and that this temporary levy reduction will not impact its ability to carry out its functions in the event of the occurrence of an oil emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> Sections 10 and 11 are drafting amendments to section 34 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and section 35 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927. These amendments make it clear that relevant market participants can enter into an agreement for connection to, or use of, the transmission or distribution systems and sell electricity or supply electricity for sale. These amendments are necessary in light of EU directive requirements and to facilitate CRU further in its implementation of the registration framework for relevant market participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> I would now like to refer to some particular aspects of the scheme that will be of interest to Deputies more broadly. As Deputies may be aware already this scheme uses the same eligibility criteria as the electricity cost emergency benefit scheme enacted earlier this year. Under the previous electricity costs emergency benefit payment, a credit of €176.22, excluding VAT, was applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June 2022. Upon the scheme's conclusion on 30 June 2022, over 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts had received the payment with the value of these payments totalling almost €377 million. This means 99.36% of all eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied. The use of the meter point registration number, MPRN, as the unique identifier ensured a broad reach and no application or means testing.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The scheme will apply to domestic electricity accounts using their unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills automatically without the need for application or approval, including pay-as-you-go meters. Therefore, the payments will help both bill pay and pay-as-you-go customers with their electricity costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The Government is aware that the need to use the MPRN as the identifier resulted in a small number of certain households not being able to access the payment. A particular cohort, since identified, includes approximately 1,000 Traveller households in certain local authority accommodation where the MPRN is registered to the local authority and supplies multiple households. This issue has been raised by Traveller organisations with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, given its responsibility for Traveller accommodation. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how best to reach such households with this support. While the majority of household tenants who rent their homes have their own electricity account, in anticipation of a small minority for whom electricity costs are not separate from overall rental costs, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage worked closely with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, on a public information campaign to ensure that tenants were aware of the scheme and entitlements and of mediation services available to tenants in the event landlords did not pass on the payment to tenants in these situations. The RTB has reported that contacts with them on this matter have been extremely low. These mediation services remain in place for the forthcoming scheme under this Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> Furthermore, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is also engaged with the Department of Social Protection to examine how this group could be further supported using existing social protection measures. As there is no data set identifying this cohort, and arrangements could vary with bills being split in potentially different ways, increasing awareness of entitlements under the additional needs payment scheme, which includes provision for help with household bills, may be the best way to support people who need support but cannot be reached with this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> The scheme can only become operational following the passing of this underpinning legislation. As Deputies will appreciate, this emergency measures Bill aims to ensure that the credit can be made to domestic electricity accounts as soon as possible. The scheme will apply to domestic electricity accounts using the unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to bills. This does mean that premises, other than principal residences, such as holiday homes, with a domestic electricity account will be included in the scheme. The scheme uses the above single eligibility criteria to enable payments to be made next month. The scheme does not have additional eligibility criteria. For example, it is not means tested as the application of such criteria would override the automatic nature of the current scheme, require input from customers through formal applications and cross-checking by administrators, which would significantly delay the roll out of the payments. This scheme is not perfect but it does have a very wide reach and can be delivered quickly and, therefore, is firmly in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> I will provide a section-by-section summary of the Bill if I have time. There are 13 sections in the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision which provides for definitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Section 2 provides for the establishment of the scheme. It provides the basis for the estimation of the amount required, as well as for the allocation of the monies for the scheme up to €1.211 billion by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Section 3 provides the legislative basis for the transfer by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to the distribution system operator the moneys, up to €1.2111 billion, for the operation of the scheme. This will be paid to domestic accounts in three payments, each of €183.49, excluding VAT, in the November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023 billing periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Sections 4 and 5 provide for the functions of the distribution system operator and suppliers, respectively, for the purposes of the operation of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act to create functions for the CRU including for the purposes of oversight of the functions of the distribution system operator and suppliers and to ensure that the administrative and operational arrangements necessary for the functioning of the scheme are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Section 7 deals with an amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This amendment is to exempt the electricity costs emergency benefit payment from income tax. I would like to advise Deputies that a small drafting amendment will be required to this section on Committee Stage regarding the numbering of the section to be amended in the Taxes Consolidation Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Section 8 provides for the Minister of the Environment, Climate and Communications to make regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for the purposes of the Act.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_394">There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> with this Bill because we have been here before. In February this year, we debated an almost identical Bill. During those debates Sinn Féin submitted amendments to the original electricity credit Bill removing the references to it being a once-off measure as we said that was not reflective of the crisis we were facing into and more assistance would be needed down the line. At the time, I said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_395">A once-off discount is short-sighted and it is clear that more needs to be done. There are no indications that the energy price hikes are going to stop any time soon. With political instability in Ukraine and Russia, international gas prices could increase further this year. Our amendments would give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more primary legislation down the line and ensuring that it could be done quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Unfortunately, the Government ignored the constructive proposals from the Opposition, as is so often the case, and rejected all the amendments. As a result another piece of primary legislation has had to be drafted and rammed through the parliamentary process in an uncomfortably quick timeframe. I ask the Minister to take on board some of the Opposition’s amendments this time around. Those amendments cover a number of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> The broad, blunt nature of the original electricity credit Bill gave rise to a number of issues that we asked to be rectified. Those included people being excluded from the payment altogether, households with a shared meter not receiving the full amount and people with vacant holiday homes, empty houses or multiple properties receiving a number of payments. With almost 12 months to prepare and re-prepare this legislation, it is inexcusable that none of these issues seem to have been adequately addressed. People with holiday homes lying idle for most of the year will now get even more money to help keep the lights on. The most recent census identified 61,204 holiday homes in the State. It is outrageous that these vacant holiday homes have still not been excluded from this scheme. On top of the previous €200, they will now get another €600. That is a total of almost €50 million of taxpayers' money to keep the lights on in the second homes of predominantly well-off individuals. It is an atrocious waste of money. Yet again, those with the greatest means will benefit most while those in severe energy poverty will get the same support as a millionaire.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Similarly, people living in halting sites or in mobile homes were excluded from the original payment. We repeatedly asked for that to be addressed in recent months. The briefing note we received, which was reflected in the Minister's comments, states that approximately 1,000 Traveller households in local authority accommodation were excluded from the original payment. It goes on to say the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how best to reach these households with future support.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">That is simply not good enough. It is eight months since the original scheme was introduced. Some of these households are living in extreme energy poverty and need immediate assistance. Saying that we are working on it is not good enough. The Minister needs to commit to ensuring these families will receive the full €600 this winter on top of the €200 they did not get originally. If the Departments cannot find a way to do this, they should give the money to local authorities or groups like the National Traveller Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service and ask them to distribute cash payments to these households. It is essential that they get immediate support to help cover their electricity bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> A number of Sinn Féin amendments to this Bill seek to prevent disconnections of pay-as-you-go customers. The Government has been caught asleep at the wheel on this issue. Despite 346,000 households using prepay meters, the Government has no plan and seems to be making it up as it goes along. The Taoiseach went on national radio a couple of weeks ago and assured people they would not be disconnected this winter, but the Government did not have a plan for pay-as-you-go households. Last week, when my colleague an Teachta Doherty raised this on Leaders' Questions, the Tánaiste threw the ball back to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and said that the latter was meeting with energy companies to come up with a solution. Meanwhile, pay-as-you-go customers are none the wiser as they face into a dreadfully unaffordable winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> The Minister must commit to extending the moratorium on disconnections to all pay-as-you-go customers. They should not have any less protection than bill pay customers. It is simply a matter of fairness and equality. Whether this is achieved by increasing the emergency credit limit, removing the limit altogether, extending the so-called friendly credit period when disconnections do not take place or moving people to bill pay without financial penalties, the Minister can pursue a number of options. This should have been done already. In addition, we want to see the moratorium for all households extended from now to the end of March; December to February is not enough. We are in a time of extraordinary price increases, so much greater protections are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Sinn Féin has made its position clear . We believe an electricity price cap is needed this winter to give households certainty. We need to reduce electricity prices back to pre-crisis levels and cap them. Price caps have been introduced right across Europe but the Government has chosen a different path of giving three energy credits this winter. Although we disagree with this approach, we will support the Bill because the €550 in electricity credits will still help offset some costs for people this winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> EU energy reforms are badly needed. Last October, the Government opposed proposals at EU level to decouple electricity prices from the gas market. At that time, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications co-signed a statement to the effect that "we cannot support any measure that conflicts with the internal gas and electricity market". Currently, the price of gas is dictating the price of all electricity, which is pushing electricity prices to extortionate levels. The energy market is fundamentally broken and needs to be radically reformed. While I welcome the Minister’s recent change of heart and his newfound support for decoupling gas from electricity prices, his conversion came very late in the day and a lot of time has been wasted on this front. Can he provide an update on the proposals to decouple at a European level and provide some details on how much Ireland could expect from the windfall tax on non-gas-fuelled electricity generators? Why is the rate of €180 per megawatt hour being considered, given the much lower cost of producing electricity by wind and solar or other renewable sources? Will the Government look to introduce a lower rate? We accept that renewable energy companies still need to a make a profit to reinvest in renewables, but pegging electricity prices to another inflated price is not a good solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> Another matter that is pushing bills to unaffordable levels is the increase in standing charges utility companies are announcing. Some energy companies have increased their standing charges by €300 in the past year, thereby compounding the financial hardship people are facing. Suppliers are now charging up to €700 a year in standing charges, which is a massive cost before people even switch on a light. The CRU confirmed to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action a couple of weeks ago that no one is regulating the hikes in standing charges and that it lacks the legislative remit to deal with these charges. It seems that energy companies have free rein to hike standing charges by as much as they want without having to justify it to anyone, or prove a corresponding increase in their fixed costs. It is an absolutely crazy situation. Given the energy price crisis households are facing, every line of their bills must be tackled. Will the Minister commit to introducing legislation or regulations to give the CRU the power to regulate standing charges on energy bills?</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I will touch on the revelation last week that domestic electricity customers have been subsidising the energy bills of large energy users for the past decade without anyone seemingly knowing. The Minister, during his stint as the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2010, introduced the large energy user rebalancing subvention. Since then, ordinary households have paid €600 million to subsidise the bills of big companies. This is an extraordinary revelation. The subvention in question did not appear as a line item on people’s bills, so no one was aware they were paying this levy. Can the Minister explain why this charge was never removed on domestic bills, the companies that benefited and how long he intended it to be in place when he originally introduced it? These are important details that need to be known.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> We will support this Bill but hold the position that reducing electricity prices to pre-crisis levels, and capping them at that cost this winter, is a better solution and will give households much greater certainty. Reform of the energy market is needed. It was needed 12 months ago when this Government opposed it and it is still needed now. A windfall tax on non-gas electricity generators and a solidarity windfall tax on energy companies should also be introduced. I also encourage the Minister of State to look at the amendments tabled by the Opposition and commit to supporting them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_407">I am glad to see the Minister of State in the Chamber to take this debate. The Government was warned that the legislation it introduced previously was not going to be enough. It was warned by an Teachta O'Rourke and others in the Opposition and yet it persisted. It did not accept reasonable and decent amendments that were tabled at the time but chose to ignore them and press on. I hope that now we are again discussing this matter the Minister of State will see the value of the amendments tabled by an Teachta O'Rourke and supported by others in the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The simple fact is we are back here again because ordinary people are facing a crisis in their homes, because this winter will be cold and because people will need support. We are again debating legislation, however, that will provide subventions for holiday homes. If people are lucky enough to earn a good income and to have multiple properties - many people in this House are although I am not one of them - they will get multiple subventions. That is simply not tenable. The Minister of State did not need a crystal ball to see what would happen. Just in case he did, it was advised by an Teachta O'Rourke, yet we are again discussing this. I hope the Government will take this opportunity to listen to those amendments that are tabled and to ensure that, as the Minister of State indicated: "The Government is keenly aware of the impact this is having on consumers and the need to [take] action at scale."</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> There are still people, such as Travellers on halting sites, who have not had the full benefit of the €200 credit. Before we even start, the Government has already left a significant portion of the population behind. Failure to acknowledge that means the Government is doomed to repeat the mistakes it made previously. It is not fair that people with multiple properties and holiday homes, however big or small they are, will benefit multiple times from this scheme, while people who desperately need it will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> Some 346,000 households have prepay meters. We have been told by the Taoiseach that they will not be cut off but they want to know how this will happen. Amendments have been tabled by an Teachta O'Rourke. I urge the Government to take those on board and do right by the people on prepay meters in the same way it has seen fit to do by the people who own big holiday homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">The Minister of State referred to additional needs payments that can be accessed through the Department of Social Protection. Does he know what that involves? I raised with other Ministers the fact that it is impossible to get payments from that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">There is ten-week waiting list for exceptional needs payments, payments to meet critical needs when, for example, one's house burns down. Staff are overwhelmed. It is simply not working. Not only the Minister of State, but other Ministers have urged people to go to the Department of Social Protection for exceptional needs payments but they are simply not paid out. Ministers either need to stop saying that or to fund the offices, put in the staff and provide money for them to give out. Staff ring us after every debate in which this is raised because people are coming to their offices but they have nothing to give them. We have to stop pretending there is money for exceptional needs payments when there is not. I have replies to parliamentary questions from the Minister for Social Protection proving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> We will be supporting the Bill although we would have preferred that a different approach be taken to address the rising cost of energy for households. The approach we had proposed, freezing energy prices and capping them at summer 2021 rates, would have offered households certainty on their energy bills. That would have been a real break for many families. It is not an exaggeration to say that households are living in fear of their next energy bill. Along with the cost of rent or mortgage repayments, energy is the biggest cost for householders across the country. While we believe the proposals contained in this Bill do not go far enough, they offer some assistance to people over the coming winter. The €600 energy credit will have some positive impact on citizens' bills over these months and that is welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_414"> While supporting the Bill, we have submitted a number of amendments to ensure the electricity credit is delivered equally and to all customers regardless of their electricity set-up. To this end, we have submitted an amendment with the aim of identifying those households that did not receive the initial €200 such as those in multi-unit complexes that share a meter, many of whom are local authority tenants, and those members of the Travelling community whom the Minister of State referred to although he had no solution to the problem they face apart from talking to them. Deputy O'Reilly gave the Minister of State solutions. She suggested that the payment be made at local MABS or welfare offices. My time is up. We welcome the Bill although we have great problems with parts of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">The cost-of-living crisis is one of the main issues raised in my constituency office every day. The rising cost of energy and the fear that people will not be able to keep the lights on should be a priority for Government. I acknowledge the measures in the Bill in respect of the energy credits to be given over the coming months but my constituents are telling me that, despite these measures, they do not have certainty. What good is the credit if the bills continue to rise? For those on prepay meters, what good is the credit if they have no guarantee they will not be cut off? People want certainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> In our alternative budget, Sinn Féin gave certainty. We set out to cap the energy prices at pre-crisis 2021 levels. This is what a government that priorities the needs of hard-working people and families would do. As has already been said, Sinn Féin has tabled several amendments to the Bill, including one proposing the extension of the scheme to 2025 to allow the Government to react quickly if more payments are needed down the line. We also have proposed amendments to provide certainty that prepay users will not be disconnected. The arrears limit needs to be removed for this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> People with multiple properties should not receive multiple payments. The current scheme does not prioritise those who need the most support. For example, no one in this House should be receiving the same credit as ordinary workers and families. I did the maths on this and €132,000 worth of energy credits will be given to Deputies and Senators. That is not right. This money would be better spent on those who need it most, people who are really struggling. There are people in my area who are accessing food banks because they cannot afford their shopping bills. Again, that choice between eating and heating is coming up. If the Government is serious about giving certainty to people, it will accept and support our amendments, which prioritise those who need support the most. Everything must be done to ensure the lights stay on this winter. We are already facing a winter of discontent; we must not face a winter of disconnect.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">Households and businesses must be to the forefront of any debate on the energy crisis and payments. Families are struggling and, as has previously been said, households are having to decide whether to eat each day. Businesses are also under great pressure. However, it is also important not to forget that sports clubs around the country play an important role in improving our mental, emotional and physical health and that they are also under great pressure. I acknowledge the Government's allocation of €35 million for sports clubs. It is important and welcome but it was announced two weeks ago and clubs are still waiting for clarity on and communication about how that payment will be distributed. There is a concern that the €35 million will go to clubs that have a large number of professional members and that smaller and less well funded and resourced clubs will miss out. We have to ensure that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> With regard to swimming, a national swimming strategy is being formulated while, at the same time, swimming clubs are very concerned that they will have to close. It is not cheap to run a swimming pool. Clarity will be needed as to whether swimming pools will close over the winter months. Sports clubs are switching to training one day a week to ensure the cost of running the flood lights will not put them out of business and into massive debt. Swimming is one of the most popular physical activities across all ages. It is really important that swimming pools not be allowed to close. Pools like those in Rathmines and Markievicz Sports and Fitness Centre need to be funded. We need to ensure these facilities are supported throughout the winter months.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">We are in the midst of an unprecedented trilemma comprising three crises. There is the housing crisis that our President has rightly described as a housing disaster and which is hitting many families and households very hard. There is a cost-of-living, energy bills and energy security crisis that is affecting millions of people across the country, exacerbated by Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine and his escalation of the war in that country. Of course, there is also the climate crisis, the existential threat that destroyed towns and communities across Europe this summer and which threatens all of our existence. These emergencies demand bold leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I will start by discussing the matter at hand, the energy and cost-of-living crises of which people are so fearful as we face into the winter ahead with rising energy bills. We cannot divorce the crisis in people's ability to pay for energy from the wider economic model we have because the cost-of-living and energy bill crises expose the deep insecurity baked into our economy. Well before the onset of the awful war in Ukraine this spring, there was already a serious issue with our economy, a low-pay, high-cost economy in which many people were living from pay cheque to pay cheque without any savings or security with which to face any sort of crisis. I am not just talking about those on the lowest incomes. Many middle-income earners are seeing their economic security undercut by rising prices. Of course, that has increasingly been the case this year. I have spoken before about meeting couples and families in my own constituency who have told me that, a year ago, their incomes were perfectly adequate to meet the costs of childcare, rent or a mortgage, food and energy but that they are no longer enough as the inflation rate rises and energy and food bills spiral. Fixing the broken economic model of low wages is the fundamental challenge if we are to change our country for the better. An increase in take-home pay is the best way to help working people and families to keep up with rising costs. We need to see the power of employees to negotiate pay rates and salaries with their employers strengthened. As a lifelong trade unionist, I want to see stronger rights for unions to bargain collectively on behalf of their members in respect of employees' pay and conditions. </p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Along with ensuring that Ireland gets a pay rise and that we see pay rises for employees, we should also look at solutions being pursued by our European partners and must review policies that have already been implemented in this country with a view to supporting individuals through the crisis. That is why measures in the budget were disappointing to us in the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Increasing numbers of households are now facing stark choices between heating and eating, and up to half of all households may be in energy poverty in the months ahead. Ireland is just not working for far too many people, including individuals, families, households and businesses. Sadly, rather than providing a more sustainable pathway forward in the budget, it might have been better described as a treadmill budget, or a budget for standing still, without the sort of long-term sustainable measures we needed. Lots of money was put forward by the Government for once-off measures but ultimately there was no sense of forward momentum or progressive movement and no sense that the budget will do anything other than provide a short-term quick fix, which is likely to wear off very quickly, before the new year. The signs are grim that we may need another budget in the new year once the benefit of the short-term measures has faded away.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> In respect of the specific measure contained in this Bill, it will be welcome in easing the burden for many households and families. We in the Labour Party will certainly support this initiative but it bears repeating that it may not be in any way sufficient to meet the real hardship due to rising energy costs. Over the last 18 months, average household annual electricity bills have doubled to more than €2,000, with an additional €1,200 expected to be added on to the average Irish household bill. Coupled with wholesale natural gas price increases, we are looking at average bills of up to €4,000 per year. Businesses are facing astronomical increases in bills. I met today with business owners who told me about the sort of bills across hotels and the hospitality sector. In retail, small food businesses are facing massive hikes in their energy bills. </p>
          <p eId="para_425"> For households looking at the increases that are already in place and envisaged in the months ahead, a €600 energy credit, while welcome, will cover only a small portion of the higher cost of electricity. While any assistance is better than none, we would have preferred to see measures such as those included in our proposed alternative budget instead. For starters, we would have implemented a cap on energy prices. We want to see what the Government is going to about this at a European level. It appears that there will be some sort of EU-wide cap, and that will be very welcome, but we could have done that at a national level. We would have provided a €60 per pupil energy capitation grant winter payment for schools. We would have provided a once-off €400 refundable carbon tax credit for 500,000 of the hardest-pressed families. We would also have invested more in the fuel allowance in order to increase eligibility and provide lengthier payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> The Labour Party led the way in back in January in calling for a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies, when the Government wanted to adopt a wait-and-see policy within Europe. Action could have been taken then and a measure could have been adopted that would have provided real help through a tax on the windfall profits of energy companies. We need that to be done now. I listened with interest to the contribution of Pat Fenlon of the ESB to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. He said that increased profits in the power generation wing of the ESB could not be used to offset prices by Electric Ireland as the two sections must operate independently. I do not intend to use the ESB as a pariah but its profits soared in the first six months of this year. It is hard to accept that it is not within the Government’s gift to pass the benefit of those profits on to ordinary households and small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> We would also have liked to see a cap on energy prices. Such a measure is undoubtedly complex to design and cost and we acknowledge that. In our alternative budget, we allocated €2.1 billion to support such a measure for households and business, not just through this winter but into next year as well. A cap would have ensured that all sectors of society could benefit from lower energy prices. Many EU countries have already taken this approach at a national level while awaiting EU-wide initiatives. Indeed, Spain and Portugal have provided a model where they limited the price of gas in electricity production, effectively subsidising gas generators since June and reducing consumers’ bills by between 15% and 20%. This so-called Iberian model was the subject of some debate at an emergency meeting of energy ministers from EU member states last month.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Fundamentally, energy should be viewed as a common good, especially at this time. The central point to any political debate on energy price caps is that there is more the Government could be doing but there is an unwillingness to address the issue in a meaningful way. The Iberian model brought forward by our sister social democratic parties in Spain and Portugal has shown the type of proactive measures social democratic and left-wing governments can take to protect their citizens from the fallout of Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine. At the very least, domestic electricity credits should feature clawback mechanisms such as the withdrawal of income tax credits from those earning over €100,000. A levy equivalent to the electricity credit could be applied to holiday homes and vacant housing, modelled on the previous non-principal private residence charge, to avoid those with multiple properties benefiting to a disproportionate degree. </p>
          <p eId="para_429"> I also want to relay the concerns of constituents of mine who are tenants in the private rental sector. I represent a constituency in Dublin Bay South with more than double the national average of households in private rental accommodation. This is a serious issue for so many of the people I represent. A tenant in rented accommodation who pays the landlord directly for their electricity rather than paying the electricity provider should have the benefit of the credit passed on by the landlord. If the landlord pays the electricity bill, it will likely be up to them whether or not they pass on any of the money. This was the case for the previous electricity credit earlier this year. Has the Department gathered any data on the number of cases adjudicated by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, where a dispute arose as to who should receive the energy credit in a rental household, in respect of the earlier credit granted? This was a serious issue. It is merely anecdotal at this point but I have heard of cases where tenants have been threatened when they raised the matter of receiving the credit with the landlord. In recognition of the power imbalance that exists between tenants and their landlords, which is very marked during the housing crisis with so little supply of private rental accommodation available, I am asking the Government to examine how to ensure renters receive the full sum of the credit where it is owed to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> We have also been pressing for an eviction ban to be introduced by the Government over the winter. I believe it can be done in a constitutional way that is short term and limited, with necessary provisos. Without the introduction of such a ban, the reality is that many of the measures the Government is proposing in order to ease the burden on renters will fail to address their core concerns. For example, I raised earlier with the Taoiseach the issue of the €500 tax credit for renters. There is a serious concern that it will not apply to all renters. It will not apply to those renting under a licence, for example, or renting a room in a landlord’s home that does not fall within the rent-a-room scheme. I sought clarity on that from the Taoiseach and he was unable to give me that clarity. It is a minuscule amount compared to the levels of rent people are paying. Some are paying €2,000 per month in my constituency so a €500 annual credit is very little but it is essential that it be applicable to all renters, at the very least.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I also wish to highlight the call of the Irish Traveller Movement for the Government to ensure equitable treatment for Travellers under the credit scheme, just as I am looking for equitable treatment for renters. The Irish Traveller Movement has heard from a number of Travellers who did not receive the first €200 credit earlier this year. The group pointed out that on a site where 22 families share six meter point reference numbers, each family was credited with just €22. While the credits are not adequate to address the real hardship of rising energy bills, it is nonetheless important that they be applicable equitably to all people, particularly those in vulnerable communities such as those who are renting and those in the Traveller community.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I would like to acknowledge, as I am sure we all would, that yesterday marked the seventh anniversary of the Carrickmines fire disaster. That anniversary reminds us all of the need for the State to address the systemic inequalities faced by our Traveller community.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> On the matter of energy bills, there is a strong correlation between those who live in well-insulated homes and those who do not have the same struggles with energy costs. Clearly, the way of the future is to have a high BER-rated home, one that is powered in a sustainable way by renewables and where the issue of rising energy costs and reliance on fossil fuels no longer arises. Let us acknowledge that there is a small number of households across the country, in new homes built to appropriate standards with reliance on renewables, where energy bills do not induce the same fear as they do for so many households that are utterly reliant on fossil fuels. I would use this opportunity to reiterate the need to ramp up retrofitting supports and remove the red tape in the so-called one-stop shop initiatives to ensure retrofitting is made available and accessible to all households, rather than how it is at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Again, I hear from so many constituents who tell me about the difficulties, obstacles and bureaucracy involved in trying to access supports for retrofitting. Retrofitting is a fantastic initiative but it may be better described not as a one-stop-shop but as the several-steps and an upfront lump sum shop and a long delay shop when it comes to trying to access the grant subsequent to installing solar panels. It becomes unaffordable and inaccessible for many households and businesses. A number of issues regarding the accessing of retrofitting have been brought to my attention in recent times and I can engage separately with the Minister in written correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I would like to seek the Minister's views on something I have raised with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions in Leaders’ Questions. It relates to the management of household energy costs and those suffered by small businesses in Ireland. That is the prospect of nationalising - if even on a temporary basis - the Corrib gas field. Those who are reliant on fossil fuels are facing massive costs exacerbated by international factors, notably the war in Ukraine. High gas prices and indeed electricity prices have been driven by the spiralling cost of natural gas. In Ireland, we have significant levels of gas consumption coming from our own Corrib gas field on this island. We know that Vermilion's revenues last year increased by a massive 267%. The cost of production for that gas has not increased. It should not be subject directly to international price increases yet the price of gas supplies is now costing multiples of what it did one year ago. What is the Minister's view on nationalising the Corrib gas field and bringing it under State ownership - even on a temporary basis - to ensure that we can bring greater certainty to those struggling with fuel bills? The State has the power to do so under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts 1971 and 1982. Powers under this legislation were invoked during the oil shortages that followed the Middle East conflict of the 1970s so these powers exist, are available to Government and were used previously. However, the Taoiseach has dismissed that proposal. I ask the Minister and Department officials to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of this initiative to see if it can be carried out. It may sound a radical measure and it is a radical measure but it is also a sensible one. We are facing into this crisis exacerbated by international factors yet we have a domestic supply available. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Let us not lose sight of the real reason families are so vulnerable to the fluctuations of the free market. The energy bills crisis is caused by the fact we are exposed to the roller-coaster of fossil fuel prices. We must not allow the immediate need to reduce hardship while people struggle to pay their bills to serve as a distraction from the urgent need for action to tackle the climate emergency. We all know that it is only by addressing the climate crisis that we can give people that guarantee that their homes will be warm, the air they breathe will be clean, their roads will be safe, and they and their families will not suffer a massive increase in bills because of the State’s addiction to fossil fuels and an international addiction to fossil fuels that is not unique to Ireland. The Paris Agreement signed in 2015 at COP21 has been called the last beacon of hope for renewed multilateral co-operation and international convergence on the global climate emergency. Since then, we have seen a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avoid climate chaos. In its recent assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, warned that global warming is happening sooner and more quickly than earlier projections and that its effects are more profound. The World Meteorological Organization recently predicted that the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Agreement for the end of the century could soon be breached. Evidence of global warming multiplies in every part of the world on a daily basis. The exception has suddenly become the new normal. This must come as no surprise when we see that global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 6% in 2021. The Environmental Protection Agency stated that Ireland’s emissions increased by nearly 5% last year and rose above pre-Covid levels. </p>
          <p eId="para_437"> It was noted that the rise was largely due to the energy industries sector, which tripled its oil and gas use in electricity generation last year. While measures to support families, households and businesses through the winter are necessary, we also need to be mindful of learning the long-term lessons. We know that in the short and medium term, we must shift fundamentally how we consume and produce energy in this country. I welcome the long-anticipated announcement this week of the waiving of planning permission requirements for the installation of solar energy and recent indications from the Minister that our modes of transport will be changed drastically but we need more of that. Words must turn to action and we must address in the short as well as long term that elephant in the room of systemic change. It is time to reject the neoliberal doctrine of the free market when it comes to something as important as energy. It is time to take drastic action to combat the climate crisis and alongside that, the cost-of-living crisis. We must see no more missed targets, no more moving the goal posts and no more "whataboutery". The hour is too late and the moment is too serious. It is cheaper to save the planet than destroy it. In all our interests and those of future generations, we must be mindful of that as we debate these measures - urgent though they are - to address the real hardship being faced by so many through the cost of living crisis into this winter. </p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_438">I welcome the Bill. It is very progressive and is most welcome. I spoke to a woman in Killorglin at the weekend who told me that they really appreciated the credit received earlier in the year and that the three waves of further credits will be really important to her and her household as they get through the winter ahead. People have definitely noticed the increase in their bills despite huge efforts by householders to economise, turn off the lights, use fewer appliances and do all the things we should be doing anyway. Despite these huge efforts by everybody, the bills are still soaring so the credits are important. Almost €800 in the space of 12 months is a significant amount of money for a household and is something I would certainly welcome. You always have people saying it is not enough. I am tired of hearing this from the Opposition benches. This is unprecedented intervention. The package is significant and most welcome and from speaking to people in my constituency and meeting people in shops and on the streets, I can guarantee that they are very grateful and are looking forward to having one less chunk of a bill to pay throughout this winter and into the spring. We will have to reassess the situation when we come to February and March 2023. God knows where we will be. I suppose this time last year, we could not have comprehended that we would be in this situation but we are and we do not know whether matters will improve or disimprove. The Government needs to be ready to intervene should the situation deteriorate and should householders throughout the country face further financial crises but this is a big help to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> In conjunction with the other measures implemented, it is positive intervention from the State. I welcome the movement around Easter on excise. That is important. I come from a predominantly rural constituency and we were seeing the price of a litre of diesel or petrol heading towards the €2.50 mark had there not been State intervention. It is important and it is appreciated by people even through prices are still too high and it is very difficult for people. The fact that the price of a litre of petrol or diesel is quite a bit under €2 at the pump is some relief for people compared to where it might have been without the intervention so it is important that has been continued and I welcome that. I also welcome the extension of the 9% rate for energy bills because that is all money that people would otherwise be spending on energy and would mostly be exported from this economy. At least, it gives people money to spend on other things or at least allows them to not be as stretched as they would otherwise have been. We need to keep the supports for people. In my time as a Deputy, almost 12 years, the challenges householders are facing are quite reminiscent of 2011 and 2012 when we were in the depths of despair in terms of unemployment and emerging from the financial crisis. They are the types of scenarios people are facing. The prospect of increasing interest rates is creating an awful lot of worry for people. They are worried they will not be able to make ends meet so any bit of support that is there should be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Businesses have already seen a huge increase in the cost of raw materials, depending on what sector we are talking about. In construction, it is wood, concrete and other things. Energy bills on top of that were making many businesses unsustainable so the rebate scheme for businesses has been broadly welcomed by businesspeople throughout the country. Without businesspeople keeping their doors open, we would have huge unemployment. They create jobs, provide jobs for people and pay people to run their households. It is important that this intervention was made in the budget. It will not solve the problem and only gives back a little of the increase but is significant and, in many cases, will be the difference between people being able to keep the doors open and not being able to do so. I welcome that. </p>
          <p eId="para_441"> While we are on the topic of electricity, something that needs to be examined is that the system discriminates against rural people on the price of units of electricity, connection fees and standing charges. These things need to be looked at. As a rural dweller, if I compare my bill to someone living in an urban area, there is a significant difference. I do not think that is acceptable and ask the Minister of State to engage with the regulator on that because it needs to be examined further. It has been brought to my attention by a number of people in my constituency. There was a time when it cost much more to maintain rural lines but with investment in the system and new technologies, there are not the types of costs that were incurred years ago for the ordinary, routine, day-to-day running of electricity grids. That is a legacy of the past the making redundant of which is long overdue. I would like to see some fairness for people living in rural communities being introduced to the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I restate my support for the liquefied natural gas, LNG, project. I note the Minister of State is not the biggest supporter of that project, but for energy security on this island in the medium term, it is an important opportunity for us. There is an application being considered. I will not say too much more about it but I support the principle and I support the project going ahead in north Kerry to provide the State with some additional control over its energy security.</p>

          <from>Deputy Johnny Mythen<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_443">I welcome the Bill. We are all aware of the extent to which the cost of living has risen and we are witnessing the highest inflation rates seen in this country for over two decades. Therefore, any help in reducing high energy bills must be welcomed as a buffer against what we know will be a tough winter for many. The energy supply markets, the unknown factors surrounding Ukraine and the unpredictable duration of the war are not in our control. What is in our control is the capping of electricity units at the rate they were in June or July 2021. This would have given certainty, reassurance and stability to domestic customers and small SMEs, including our retail industry. It would have meant they could plan their budgets and turnover without fear of inevitable drastic increases that will possibly cause many of them to close. We also believe a scheme should ensure people with vacant holiday homes or owners of multiple properties should not benefit from the €600 credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I would like to see more flexibility in the Bill to allow for an extension of the date to 2025. This would give the Government more scope to introduce further emergency payments should they be urgently needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I ask the Minister of State to clarify the Government's position on MPRN accounts. The Bill states the credit will be paid directly to the holder or name of the MPRN account. What happens in the case where people living in multiple-unit complexes share a meter through a domestic connection, or for members of the Travelling community living in a halting site with shared meters? Will they receive their €200 credit? I had such a case in Wexford town, concerning old people living in a small, purpose-built estate with only one MPRN meter between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> We have been calling for a windfall tax all along. The recent announcement from the European Union to allow each state to fix up to 33% on the extra profits energy companies make is and will be an essential part of protecting workers and their families from being at the mercy of those companies now and in the near future, which are making opportunistic profits on the back of a war that threatens food and energy supplies across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Leaving the levy until next year must be questioned, along with the Government's refusal to support decoupling gas from electricity prices, considering that over 80% of Ireland's energy output was provided by wind in June, July and August of this year, yet companies charged each wind-produced unit at the top rate of a gas unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> We are supportive of this Bill and call on the Government to introduce the windfall levy as early as possible. As we have already seen, the first payment of €200 in credits will be gobbled up by the staggering further increases of 38% in electricity and 37% in gas prices which came into effect on 1 October.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_449">I have an incredible sense of <i>déjà vu </i>today as we talk about this Bill. In December 2021, the Government announced a €200 energy credit to deal with the energy price hikes people were seeing. That Bill was debated in March of this year. That was also called an electricity emergency Bill. I find it staggering that less than a year later we are debating essentially the same Bill, also termed an emergency Bill, without the Government having learned any of the lessons or taken on board any of the comments the Opposition made in March. To have to rush through a Bill once without proper oversight, debating and governance is unfortunate but to rush it through twice without proper debate is simply bad planning and poor governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> It is unfortunate that yet again this Bill is going through without pre-legislative scrutiny and after a truncated debate, particularly when we are talking about a €1.3 billion investment by the State. When added to the €400 million previously given out, it is €1.7 billion. It is an incredible amount of money to be giving out to assist in this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The majority of it is needed by households all over the country. We have spoken many times about how difficult people are finding these price hikes. However, it has been given out in a non-targeted fashion. The primary concern of the Social Democrats in respect of the previous Bill was that the Government was giving it out on a universal basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> When it was raised with the Minister of State in March that this was not a targeted measure, he said we had to do it this way because we did not have the systems in place to allow us to target the measure and this would get it out to people quickly. That was the rationale. That was announced in December. In April and May, the money hit people's electricity accounts. It still took five or six months for that to be felt by people. Most astounding was the fact that 62,000 holiday homes received that credit. I listened to the Minister of State's speech today and it is clear that will happen again. Some 62,000 people who have a holiday home, which by its nature uses very little energy, will receive another €600 essentially into their back pocket. These are people who have two homes. They are wealthy enough to have a holiday home and the Government is handing them €600 on top of the €200 they have already received.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> To look at exactly where this €1.7 billion, I will include it all altogether, is going, when you cost up how much these holiday homes will cost the State, it is €50 million. The Government is handing over €50 million this year to people who have holiday homes to help them with their energy bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Compare that with the LauraLynn Foundation which gets €1.5 million a year to help with its children's hospice services. This year's budget provided €9 million for Traveller mental health. Yet this is where the Government decided to spend the money because it was not prepared. It has not used the last year to actually work out a system whereby it could target this money. That is not acceptable. </p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Let us look again at the €1.7 billion total. Even setting aside the issue of holiday homes, 10% of households in this country earn over €120,000. We do not know how long this crisis will go on for or how deep it will get or how difficult it will get but one thing that has been made repeatedly clear to us, whether by the Central Bank, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council or the UN, is that any measures that are taken by governments to address this crisis need to be targeted and "targeted" means towards those who are at risk of energy poverty. Incredibly, 50% of households in this country are at risk of or are already in energy poverty. We do not know how long this will go on for. We do not know how much money the Government will have to put aside to help people but we need to make sure the Government is helping the people who need it most and by not targeting this money, the Government is actually giving €800 to people who do not need it. Granted, many of those people may find the coming winter difficult but they will manage. No Deputy or Senator in these Houses should be getting €800 from the Government to help with their electricity bills. There are many people who do not need this money. Ten percent of the households in this country earn more than €120,000. If you look at the Government's €1.7 billion, the Government is giving €170 million in subsidies to people who have a household income of over €120,000. Incredibly, it is giving €34 million to people who have a household income of €200,000. That is where the Government chooses to spend its money. It is incredible that this Government has not used the last year to learn and to make changes to the system in order that this is distributed fairly and is targeted to those who most need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> The other thing that this money is not doing is that it is not future-proofing. When I look at the €34 million that the Government is giving to households with an income of over €200,000, it is more than twice what it has allocated for solar rebates and supports this year. Surely what we should be doing with this money is helping on a short-term basis but also using this money to make sure that people are protected next year. When I talk about people, I mean those at risk of energy poverty. It absolutely has to keep those at the forefront of every single policy decision it makes when it comes to energy but it is not. It is just throwing the money around as though it is going to be available forever. It will not be. We in the Social Democrats wanted to see a targeted approach to this similar to the assistance during Covid because that was very successful. First, it should have been done on an income basis and then it could have been targeted. A credit could have been given to individuals in the same way that the supports were given throughout the Covid pandemic. That would allowed it to be targeted. Second, all the homes at risk of energy poverty that currently get zero money towards solar installations should be given free solar panels. That would cut their electricity costs by 40%. It would take a day to install a house with a solar panel. It is very quick and easy to do and that is where the Government should be focusing its money and efforts. For some bizarre reason it is not doing that. It would rather give people who have a holiday home €800 to spend. It is absolutely incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> The Government has not used the last year to prepare or to plan. From now on, I ask that it would bring some forward planning into its decision making and that it look to see what the risks are from this energy crisis and what is the potential for it to go on into the future. Many parties have called for an energy cap. At this time, the Social Democrats do not believe an energy cap is the way to go because it is not targeted. An energy cap would mean that the likes of Google's energy costs would be capped and that is not a good way to spend it. The principle of targeting supports must be there. However, we do not know where this is going. Therefore I ask the Government to use the next months to look at the concept of a cap and how it could be applied in a targeted fashion. Whether that would be through a clawback, I am not sure, but that examination must happen because we do not know where this is going to end. We cannot fail to prepare in the same manner that the Government has failed to prepare for the second emergency electricity rebate, particularly when all the problems with the first one were pointed out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_458">As Deputy Whitmore said, there is some merit in the proposals in the Bill before us. The €1.7 billion investment will do some good but that needs to be put in the context of the level of suffering and need in the country. The failure to target this will mean that people in this country will continue to have to choose between heating and eating. That is something that cannot and will not go unchallenged by the Social Democrats. Today, Focus Ireland said more people will become homeless if the Government does not act now. Last week SPARK, the one-parent family organisation said that this budget was the most regressive for one-parent families which are traditionally the most vulnerable group in this country. It is in that context we are speaking up. Deputy Whitmore highlighted what I call the holiday home dividend. We see where the Government's priorities are. We all know that inflation will wipe out the effects of these energy credits within several weeks at most, never mind six months, pushing thousands of families closer to the edge of poverty and, indeed, to survival. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul called its report published last March, "The Cost of Surviving". The money many families would have saved from these measures will already be gone by the time they come into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> The Government had a choice last month. It could have done more to prevent gas and electricity bills from crippling families or it could continue to ignore the needs of those on the margins. If it targeted energy credits properly, low- and middle-income households could have benefited from a more suitable amount of savings but as it stands, the relief the credits will provide will be gone as soon as they arrive, while 62,000 households will get a holiday home dividend of over €600.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> The Government faced criticism in February for not targeting energy credits. It has not learned from what my script here calls a mistake but is it a mistake or was it done on purpose? It is often said that when you show your budget, you show your priorities. We cannot side step the fact that one in five people is suffering from poverty but 62,000 holiday homeowners will get €600 extra.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan admitted in March that owners of holiday homes were given the same energy credits as those struggling to keep the lights and the heat on because the measure was rushed as an emergency. The crisis and the emergency continued. There was time to give consideration to concentrating on those on the margins but the Government chose not to. Over seven months later, millionaires who own several properties get tax breaks while a record number of people are without homes. Rates of homelessness and poverty continue to rise. The Government had a year to adjust and fix this measure and failed to do so. It is the worst off who will face the consequences of what I wrote in my script were mistakes but again, I ask whether it was a mistake or a choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> What has the Government been doing all this time? Did it choose to ignore the scheme’s flaws out of laziness or did it intend to make the rich richer while more and more people languish in poverty? Poverty is a word often used. Sometimes we use euphemisms in this country. We call it the cost-of-living crisis but poverty is very real. It attacks the senses of everyone who experiences it. It is corrosive to the human condition. One in five people in this country are experiencing that. It is hunger and inadequate access to basic provisions, such as a second jacket, and struggling to keep the lights on this winter. The Government chose that the budget would blindly give the same amount of help to those who do not need it and to those who need much more to keep their head above water. By doing so, it put money into the pockets of the well-off while the most vulnerable in our society face unimaginable struggle.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The Government has shown a lack of nuance, competence and compassion when drawing up its plans for what may prove to be one the most difficult winters in decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">We should have seen a pandemic-scale response in this budget, but we did not. As I stated earlier, I have received messages from several people in my constituency today, yesterday and last week, and I guarantee I will get them next week, who are going homeless, facing the ever-increasing cost of survival in this country. How on earth can the Government throw millions of euro at millionaires who have holiday homes while more and more children are without a home? It is unfathomable. Once again, those on high incomes will be most rewarded by the Government, with tax cuts and an array of universal lump-sum payments that disproportionately benefit the better-off. Temporary supports and lump sums will not help people in the medium to long term, not the people who need help the most and who are crying out most for assistance. They will not provide sustainable relief to those who can no longer afford the soaring prices of basic necessities like food, a warm coat, fuel and rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Those struggling are being left to suffer on all fronts. For example, in the midst of the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation, the Government only increased core social welfare rates by €12. The across-the-board failure of budget 2023 will have devastating consequences across the country, and the blame lies with the Government and its incompetence. Yet, it will be cheered on by 62,000 people who have holiday homes who will receive an extra €600.</p>

          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_466">I am being contacted by people who are at their wits' end. Rising energy prices are terrifying, especially for those experiencing poverty or on fixed incomes. One constituent on a prepaid system told of having literally seen her money run out and of having to choose between keeping the lights on or going into arrears. This has massive implications for individuals and families. Not only does it erode their quality of life but it has real and lasting health implications. It will worsen existing conditions and the sheer mental strain also has a profound impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> We are facing into a winter where one of the most common causes of people going to a doctor or an accident and emergency department is the individual inability to pay energy and heating bills. This legislation cannot come quick enough. While of course I welcome any action the Government is taking, this legislation has major flaws. These measures should be targeted to those who need them the most, those who are most at risk. It is unconscionable that Deputies, Ministers, senior civil servants, CEOs and banking executives are all getting the same payments as pensioners, carers and people on disability allowance, not to mention, as my colleagues have referenced, that somebody with a holiday home gets double what somebody on the disability allowance will get.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The Government is intentionally misspending money. Transferring vast amounts of public funds to wealthy individuals at the cost of older people scared to turn on their heating is truly disgusting. That this measure is coming for Green Party Minister makes it even worse. Any system that treats millionaires the same as people living below the poverty line is unjust. The Social Democrats are calling for a cash transfer to individuals that reflects their income levels in order that those who are at risk of poverty will be most protected. Deputy Whitmore has consistently articulated this position but unfortunately the Government will not listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> A fundamental principle for us is that we must ensure any financial supports or measures are targeted towards those who needed them most, which is something we have repeated frequently. This is much-needed emergency measure albeit deeply flawed, but what is the Government doing to address the underlying issues in the medium and long term? We need a robust energy system that takes advantage of renewable resources for the benefit of everyone. If previous Governments had moved away from fossil fuels, families would be somewhat insulated from some of the worst effects of this energy crisis. Today households across the country are witnessing the results of failure to invest in climate action. Unfortunately, the lack of ambition in the budget means that many families simply will not be able to afford solar panels, which continues to lock them into using fossil fuels. The Government is simultaneously failing to meet their current and future needs and even worse, is keeping those households vulnerable or in poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The Social Democrats proposed an ambitious roll-out of solar panels to ensure that 100,000 low-income homes received panels free of charge. These are homes in energy poverty which need Government support to make the climate changes we require of them. We focus on solar because it is quick, practical and cheaper to do. Most importantly it could reduce the annual energy costs for those in energy poverty by 40% in the first year. Our proposals involve the State bulk-buying panels at greatly reduced prices with teams of trained installers fitting out entire estates at one time. This is the most efficient, effective and lean way to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Although this Bill concerns payments to domestic users, I cannot fail to mention the drastic needs of our SME sector. I was contacted during the week by the manager of the Celtic Ross Hotel, Rosscarbery, whose energy bill in August 2021 was €8,833 plus VAT. The bill for the same month this year is €24,669. That is terrifying for small businesses. He and others have pointed out that the temporary business energy-support scheme will not apply to July and August. Local employers need to be prioritised and supported. Again, there is inequity in this scheme as larger more secure players, such as data centres, will benefit while many family-run shops, cafés, restaurants and takeaways are near closing.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> In both domestic and commercial sectors, the Government needs to radically change its priorities. Those most at risk need to be supported most.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this measure today. In recent weeks we have all started to notice a chill in the air, darker mornings and evenings closing in. For most people when it is colder and darker, we use more electricity. Those spikes in electricity usage are being compounded by the spikes in electricity prices as is being seen up and down the country. Lights are going on earlier, the heating is being switched on probably for the first time since summer in many households. However, it is also the first time since many of the price increases. It is fair to say that people have never been more conscious of the choices they are making, the appliances they are using and the switches they are flicking. While canvassing last weekend I met a lady who told me that boiling the kettle is costing her twice as much as it did this time last year. I was struck as to just how conscious people are of the direct impact that their choices are having on their pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> While limiting our energy consumption should be something that we all think about year-round especially given the climate crisis we are facing, in the colder autumn and winter months it is really important that people are not forced to choose not to turn on the heat or electricity because they are afraid of the cost of doing that. Unfortunately, that has become a real threat for people from a cost-implication perspective in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the rising energy costs being experienced across the globe. That is where the Government must intervene and has intervened.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Despite the challenges people are facing with the cost-of-living crisis, the feedback that I am getting on the doorsteps after the budget has been pretty positive overall. That is because people, from our children to our older people, are getting the help they need and deserve. The payment of three €200 electricity credits to every household in November, January and March is one of the really welcome measures. No one is arguing that €600 in energy credits will completely cushion households from rising costs, but they are a helping hand. Putting €600 back in people's pockets - €600 that would not otherwise be there - during the coldest and darkest winter months is a good move.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Targeting assistance to those on low incomes at the greatest risk of energy poverty with a major expansion of the fuel allowance scheme is also a good move. A lump-sum fuel allowance payment of €400 will be paid in November. We are increasing the fuel allowance threshold from €120 up to €200 above the State pension and extending the fuel allowance to give 80,000 people aged over 70 an increased means threshold of €500 per week or €1,000 for couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> We have also moved to extend the lower 9% VAT rate for gas and electricity until February and we are helping with fuel costs by extending excise cuts for petrol, diesel and marked gas oil also until February. The 20% reduction in train and bus fares will continue up to the end of next year. Those are all welcome measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> There has been much discussion on energy price caps at a European level. While it is important not to rule anything out, we need to be frank about this. Most energy companies in Ireland are price takers in the international energy markets and capping prices that energy companies can charge here could risk energy security.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Price caps have unintended and unforeseen consequences. We see that in places like Spain where a price cap has led to the country's highest ever gas consumption. Even countries that had price caps for several years before the pandemic or the Russian war have now had to change their approach. What we do not want to do is benefit energy companies; we must benefit people and that is what the electricity credit does.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLeddin" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Brian Leddin<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_481">Households across Ireland and Europe are under severe financial pressure this year because of the energy crisis created by the Russian tyrant, his occupation of an independent and sovereign state and his control of the natural resources we in Europe rely on so heavily to light and heat our homes and to run our industries. Nobody should be under any illusions about this. The reason energy costs are surging is because of Vladimir Putin. It is important to state that because speaker after speaker, with the exception of Deputies Bacik and Griffin, have ignored this fundamental point. I welcome the €600 electricity credit that will help people with the increased cost of living in the short term this winter but I am a bit confused by the Sinn Féin position. Deputy O'Rourke stated his party disagrees with the Government's approach. It seems Sinn Féin disagrees with it so much that its members will still vote for it. This makes no sense to me. If it disagree with the Bill, I suggest they should have the courage to vote against it. I say the same about the Social Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> In addition to the electricity credit, this Bill provides for a temporary elimination of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy, as a cost-of-living measure. The levy is being eliminated so that we can continue with the planned increase in carbon tax. The increase in the carbon tax is offset by the reduction in the NORA levy so that oil prices to consumers are not increased while revenues from the carbon tax are protected. The NORA levy is important for funding the climate action fund. I am very happy to hear that the fund will be replenished by the Exchequer to ensure that important climate projects such as the installation of solar panels on schools can go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> I mentioned the carbon tax and how this Bill is utilising the NORA levy to keep the agreed carbon taxation plan on track. The money collected through carbon tax is ring-fenced for retrofitting, extensive social welfare payments and for agriculture to transition from unsustainable practices to those that support and improve the viability of family farms and restore the damaged environment. It is vitally important to maintain the carbon tax fund at a national level so that we can keep funding the green transition in a just way. Almost €10 billion will be raised by the carbon tax and this will flow back to families and communities while also nudging society towards less carbon-intensive practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I commend the Bill. It is the right thing to do to pay energy consumers €600 to help them deal with the surge in energy costs caused by Vladimir Putin's war of aggression on Ukraine and on Europe. I especially welcome the Minister's efforts to address anomalies that surfaced the last time a payment like this was made, in particular that a payment will be made to those members of Traveller families who do not have a dedicated meter point reference number.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">The Taoiseach says that no one will face disconnections this winter. He says that people will not be left sitting in cold, dark houses. What he has not said is how this is going to be accomplished or how the 400,000 people with prepaid meters will be looked after. These are vulnerable people who are now terrified because of the lack of information and direction from the Government. This winter they will have to choose between heating their homes or what they can buy in the shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The Taoiseach made empty promises about people not having cold homes this winter. It is all very well and good for members of the Government to tell people to go to their social welfare office. What happens at 7 p.m. on a Saturday or Sunday evening when people run out of money and they have to make a choice between whether to put money into the prepaid meter or to go to the shop to try to get lunches for their children or if one of their kids is sick they have to get Calpol or other medication? What do people do? They are the questions people are asking me. I have never seen a social welfare office open at the weekend or at night. We all know what will happen. The likes of Penny Dinners, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other charities will step in like they always do, but they should not have to. People will then have to turn to moneylenders or other ways of getting money because at the end of the day they have to keep their homes warm in the wintertime and they have to put food on the table and pay their bills. It is going to force more and more people into borrowing money they do not have from people who can overcharge them. This is the Government's job. The Taoiseach has made his statement and he needs to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> We are supposed to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world with our GDP regularly ranked in the top five globally. The reality is that in rich countries like ours no child should have to go cold or hungry. No older person should be standing in their local shop trying to soak up the heat before they go back to a cold home and put on two or three coats to try to keep themselves warm. One older person spoke to me last week about the cost of boiling the kettle. Someone said earlier that it is double the price it was this time last year. Is it not shocking that an older person is worried about boiling the kettle, the one luxury a person might have, because of the cost of energy?</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> We welcome the €600 credit. For some people this will make a real difference, but for the majority of people it will not. People are being forced to pay off bills for their prepaid meters that they cannot afford. Unfortunately, the €600 is not enough. The energy companies need to figure this out. We need to stop disconnections this winter. We need to bring in a windfall tax for these companies that are making huge profits. I will leave the Minister of State with this point. Today on 96FM there was a gentleman from Youghal who said he had to close his café because he could not afford his energy bills. This is the start of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">We will speak in that order. I am first of course. I welcome the temporary respite these three tranches will give people. They are not tranches of €200, but €187 in three bundles. The way I describe them is as temporary life-saving devices for people who are drowning in debt. The underlying problem has still not gone away. These grants will help to cushion up to 20% of the price hikes people face, but that means they will still have to shoulder 80% of the massive hikes.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> I reject the idea that this is caused solely by the war in Ukraine any more than the impact of Covid cannot be blamed on one bat in Wuhan. The pandemic impacted and played out so badly for us across a social and health system riven by inequality. The dysfunctional health service and years of creeping privatisation worsened the outcomes of the pandemic. Similarly, the war in Ukraine is not the sole cause of the massive energy and fuel hikes. The crisis has simply laid bare the dysfunctional market system and the gross, obscene profiteering by the fossil fuel industry that goes on in ordinary circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> As a member of the Green Party, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will not disagree with me, or with António Guterres, who stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_494">The combined profits of the largest energy companies in the first quarter of this year are close to $100 billion. This grotesque greed of the fossil fuel industry and their financiers is punishing the poorest and most vulnerable people, while destroying our [planet].</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The Minister of State should hold on to that thought because I want to come back to it when we drill down into what is happening in this country. It is incredible that months into the crisis, we have a situation where generators of wind and solar energy, or indeed those who profiteer from Corrib or North Sea gas, can rake in massive profits because of fluctuations in gas prices across the world. This shows that the market in energy is not only totally inefficient, but it gives us a system determined by the profit needs of large corporations. It exposes as utter nonsense the pretence that we have choice and that we can shop around, get the best tariffs, change provider and use smart meters to get the best deal. It is all a way of pretending that markets and competition deliver something they do not, which is cheap prices and efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Up to 1991 we had a company, the ESB, that was fully owned and had a not-for-profit mandate. When we went to deregulate, the most efficient and cheapest energy company in Europe ended up in this present sorry mess. That is a story that could be echoed across other elements of services in this society such as health, broadband and housing provision where market mechanisms have been exposed for what they are: a shameless grab of public goods and services for private profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The notion of industry being in private hands must be reversed and we have to move beyond the liberal dogma that insists we cannot assert public control over key services. That is why People Before Profit will introduce a Bill to bring in measures to renationalise the energy industry, which will do over the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> Turning to the Bill, we will seek to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with one of the most egregious side effects of the deregulation of energy here, namely, the growth in prepay meter use. This is why I asked the Minister of State earlier to hold the thought. Prepay meter use is often presented as a measure to help people exert personal control over energy use but, in reality, it is a direct effect of private, for-profit companies seeking to shore up and increase their profit streams. In the prepay energy market in Ireland, the three big players are owned by multimillionaires. While I will not use their names here because I will be told to shut up, the net worth of one of them in the top company is €65 million. He hits the rich list every year. Shareholders in one of the prepay power companies received a €16 million windfall following an internal restructuring. The profits for 2020, before the war on Ukraine, had risen by 27% to €14.2 million in one of those companies. Our amendment will try to help the Government deal with what it has not been able to do, namely, to show us how it can say, whether it is the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, that no one will be cut off this winter. We are going to show the Government how it can do that by tabling an amendment to the Bill, which I hope it will not be reckless and reject. There are up to 400,000 customers on prepay meters and the bluff of Ministers in the past two weeks has not given any guarantee they will be able to prevent people from cutting themselves off simply because they cannot afford it. Moreover, it is bizarre that seven months after the first scheme, we still cannot guarantee, although perhaps the Minister of State can answer this, that those from the Travelling community who do not have a MPRN will not be cut off. It beggars belief that we have not learned this lesson.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> As COP27 approaches, it is worth pointing out that this crisis, and the misery it has inflicted on people in terms of energy processes, is not only highlighting the failure of the State to protect people during the energy crisis but also showing a greater failure of the market in dealing with and addressing the climate crisis. Last year, big corporations, namely, Shell and Equinor, withdrew from major offshore wind energy projects in Irish waters, while their cheerleaders complained and blamed the planning system and the State's failure to give these companies everything that they ask for. This again highlights that if we are to address the climate crisis, just like the energy crisis, we have to do it by State-run, not-for-profit means.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> If we had insisted that a bizarre market system like that which we now have be used to electrify this country in 1927, there is every chance large parts of Ireland would be still in the dark. If we are to address the climate and wider energy crisis, it means reversing those neoliberal policies of the 1990s that brought us to this sorry position. It is instructive to look back at the debates in this House in 1927 - my parliamentary assistant did some of this work - when the same ideological arguments were trotted out. The danger to the State was the idea that there would be a publicly owned, not-for-profit energy market. It was labelled as Bolshevism and Deputies were warned about creeping communism. Oddly enough, I want to quote the Minister who introduced the Bill and set up the ESB. He was no Bolshevik; rather, he was a member of Cumann na nGaedheal. The then Minister, Patrick McGilligan, explained that the State could not deliver the energy revolution it needed if it was to leave that to for-profit companies. He stated that “the dangers of handing over to anybody operating for gain such services as [energy], with all the attendant circumstances, were so great that it simply could not be attempted.” That was a Cumann na nGaedheal Minister in 1927. I echo what he said, and it is very odd for me to do that. Leaving such a key sector to those companies, which seek to gain massive profits from the disaster, poverty and misery of ordinary people in this energy crisis, would be an even worse disaster than that which faced us in 1927 because it also doubles and triples up with the climate crisis we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> I look forward to the debate on the Bill and to the Minister of State accepting, I hope, the amendment People Before Profit will put forward on Committee Stage to ensure that users of prepay meters will not fall through the cracks. Moreover, when we one day attempt to reverse the damage done in the 1990s and to renationalise the energy sector, I hope the Green Party will fully support us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">Last week in the House, we discussed the issue of disconnections for users of prepay meters. On Friday, after holding my weekly clinic, I went to meet senior citizens who live in council accommodation. While I was meeting these elderly residents, an emergency occurred. They informed me of a man who had just got out of hospital, having spent five or six months there following multiple strokes, and who needed a nebuliser to allow him to continue breathing and so on. He had been released from hospital earlier in the week and when he opened the door of his house, he discovered that the prepay electricity had been disconnected while he was in hospital. Unbeknown to him, while he was in hospital, he was being charged €1.50 a day, which had clocked up to a grand total of €365. Unless he had the money to pay that debt of €365, he would have no electricity. For the next three or four days, therefore, he had nowhere to plug in his nebuliser, no cooker, no lighting and no power in his house. When we walked into the house to meet him, he was bawling crying. This elderly man had been reduced to tears and was terrified as to how he would address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Luckily, we got him sorted that day, although it was extremely difficult and involved phoning PrepayPower and the council and, eventually, after much argument, getting a code from them because we stressed that this man's life was danger, that his health was at stake and that he had been left in this utterly unacceptable position for several days. Even we had difficulty putting in codes and so on to finally get his electricity turned back on. Quite honestly, that man is lucky to be alive, given he had nowhere to plug in his nebuliser. When the Government states that there should be no disconnections and commits to doing its best or endeavouring or whatever the expression is to ensure that people on prepay power will not be cut off, here is an example of what actually happened to a sick and vulnerable elderly man. We need certainty, and people like that man and many others who could find themselves in that situation this winter need cast-iron guarantees that they are not going to be disconnected. What is particularly shocking in this case is that people can be disconnected and find themselves with a €365 bill without even having used the electricity. It is beyond belief. We hear these somewhat abstract debates in the House or abstract assurances from the Government, but that is the reality of what goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I will now similarly set out the situation for people who use district heating systems. The Government, and in particular the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, should know this because Clúid, Tuath and Respond, all of which provide social housing to people on the lowest incomes, wrote to him earlier this year warning him of the dire situation facing many of their tenants in social housing who had experienced increases of up to 600% in their energy costs, with bills rising from average figures of about €50 a month to €150 a month.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">These massive increases are completely unsustainable. They appealed to the Minister in February or March to do something about this but, as of now, nothing has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> I have some bills in front of me from one of the district heating companies. Thousands of people are caught in these situations, but I want to underline the fact that many of them are social housing tenants. People are also affected by this more generally, however. The bills are quite extraordinary. People are paying unit rates that are approximately treble what most people pay. The energy hikes are affecting most people but this is far worse. The biggest component of the bill is a network heating charge. The latter is approximately 50% of every bill. Even if a person does not turn on the heating, he or she is paying this charge. A person pays a standing charge and a network heating charge, which is the biggest component of the bill. I am looking at a bill for €489 for 59 days. Some €91 of that is for user charges, €26 is for standing charges and €110 is for a network heating charge. In other words, a person pays it regardless of whether he or she uses any electricity. Something has to be done about the extortionate rates that are being charged to people on district heating systems.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">The three €200 energy credits will be refused by no one. However, many people see that they are of particular value to the for-profit energy companies that are increasing their prices while making massive profits and will end up with this money in their accounts boosting those profits. The Government argues that fixing prices at 2021 rates would be to write a blank cheque for the big energy companies. That is why socialists call for price controls, on the one hand, and the nationalisation of energy companies, on the other. Energy provision in this country used to be in the hands of the State-owned ESB. The people of Ireland were promised that deregulation and liberalisation, in other words, opening the energy market up to the private sector companies and big corporations, would result in cheaper electricity. What has been the experience? The three key EU directives relating to liberalisation where those of 1996, 2003 and 2007. What happened in that time? In the 20 years between 1994 and 2014, electricity prices rose by 267% in this State. That is more than three times the rate of inflation, which for those 20 years was 78%. In terms of household bills, if one excludes VAT and the extra public service obligation, PSO, levies. etc., this equals an increase of €758 per household. Essentially, what happened is that the ESB's prices increased sharply in order to facilitate the private companies coming into the market. The ESB would have been unable to compete with them if its prices had not increased. Households were forced to pay a heavy price to facilitate the entry of those companies into the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> The deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation of electricity has, therefore, been a disaster for ordinary people. It has, of course, been a bonanza for the big private energy providers. At the sharp end of this neoliberal drive has been the pay-as-you-go companies, which charge a higher tariff to generally lower-income households with the threat of disconnection at the very core of their business model. It is the refusal of the Government to stand on the toes of these companies that has got it into the tangle in which it finds itself in the context of the current pay-as-you-go controversy. The liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation process should be completely reversed. Energy provision, both pay-as-you-go and non-pay-as-you-go, should be renationalised and energy run for people, not profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> There needs to be a debate about the decommodification of electricity. If we strip out profit and VAT and other taxes, it costs €3.3 billion to provide electricity to every household in the State at wholesale prices. In other words, electricity could be provided free of charge to every household in the State for €3.3 billion, or a free electricity allowance could be provided to every household for half of the average household usage for €1.6 billion with an allowance of one quarter for €820 million. This is not 1927; electricity is a basic utility without which a decent life and participation in society are impossible. Like water, it is a basic need and a basic utility.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> For now, my focus is on fixing prices at 2021 levels and renationalising the sector. This point about a free allowance of electricity as a basic right is a point to which I will return in future, however. This is my final point. The deregulation and privatisation process has also been a disaster for climate. The switch to profit being the guide has set Ireland and Europe back a generation in terms of the transition to renewables. In 2011, $131.7 billion was invested in renewables in Europe. In 2019, the figure was €58 billion. The amount being invested has more than halved because of the lack of a short-term profit fix for this. We need investment in renewables. This is only going to happen on a consistent basis if it is not a quick fix, quick hit for profit. It will only be if there is public ownership, which means nationalisation of the energy industry throughout the whole of the European Union, and if the sector is run on the basis of workers' control and management for society's needs, not for the profits of the few.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">I thank the Minister of State. I know only too well the impact the energy crisis is having on families and businesses across the country. Families who have never asked for help before have been coming to my clinics. There is a fear, and that is something on which we need to try to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Schools and many section 39 organisations have contacted me about funding, particularly in terms of the upkeep and what it will cost. Many day care services have contacted me. St. Clare's Hospitality Kitchen and other such groups really just want to know what the funding is and how they can apply for it. That is important. Real and urgent measures are needed to support those who need them most and to give us all the chance of meeting this challenge together as we did in the pandemic. That is so important. That is what I have been saying to the people to whom I have spoken.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> A figure of €600 is to be paid in three instalments of €200. The first payment will be before Christmas. Again, communication is important. When we say Christmas, will that be early next month or mid-December? I know that we must wait for enactment. I urge the House not to delay the timeline for this. We need to get it through as soon as possible. There are also plans for two further instalments in the new year but again, I have been asked whether that will be January, February, March or late spring. Above all, people need to know what is happening. I emphasise to the Minister of State that communication to everyone will be absolutely critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I welcome the funding mechanism for Traveller families to receive a credit in addition to this amount, which is to be agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This was because using the MPRN as the identifier in the previous scheme resulted in a small number of households not being able to access the payment. A particular cohort since identified included approximately 1,000 Traveller households in a certain local authority's accommodation where the MPRN was registered to the local authority and supplied multiple households. Therefore, we need to make sure we get the information out there in order to best reach those who most need supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">That is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> It is important for tenants to know there is an RTB mediation service available to them. This is concerned with arrangements tenants may have with their landlords whereby the landlord may hold the MPRN. If the landlord does not pass on the payment then there is mediation with the RTB. I have spoken to a lot of people in my area of Carlow-Kilkenny about the rising costs. Some of them have gone to the social welfare services for support. I know the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, has addressed this several times, but it is so important when people go for help, which is not easy as the Minister of State will know, that there are supports in place. When people apply for support with an oil fill, an electricity bill they cannot afford or whatever it is, the money should be there for them. We are in a totally different time and we need to support the most vulnerable in our community and let them know we are there to help them and that there are supports in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> One lady rang my clinic yesterday - a lovely lady I have known for years - and she said she does not think she will put up any lights or have a tree for Christmas this year. She said she is too nervous to do so. I told her to wait and see and that there are supports in place. We do not want people going around at Christmas thinking they cannot turn on a few lights or turn on the light on a Christmas tree. Christmas is so important to all of us and it is a big family time for everyone. I told her to wait and see, that there are supports coming and that I would work to see how quickly we can get them through Government. It is crucial for people that information is there and that there is communication. In particular, when people go looking for supports they should be given as quickly as possible. Again, the €600 should be given out as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this. Families are facing an unprecedented challenge this winter to meet their electricity bills. Undoubtedly, international affairs will contribute and are contributing to that crisis but there are factors under our control.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Sinn Féin supports this proposal to provide households with an energy credit, which will help to offset some of the costs households face this winter. However, we have also called for a windfall tax to be introduced on the excessive profits of energy suppliers. We cannot just wait to see what the European Union does. We are a Legislature and we need to act now. Without the introduction of a windfall tax this Government is simply writing a blank cheque to these large energy suppliers. As called for by Sinn Féin and as implemented in other EU countries, energy price caps would also give certainty to householders over the winter period, when they have their highest usage of electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Sinn Féin will also be submitting amendments to remove the arrears limit on prepay meters and to prohibit disconnections for households with prepay meters for that period. Roughly 340,000 households use prepay meters and they are often charged a higher unit rate for electricity. I want the Minister of State to hear the following point. It is generally lower income households that use prepay meters. I know a lot of these people in that cohort, as will the Minister of State. The reason they have them is they cannot deal with bills every two months. They pay by the week and it is important that we protect them. We need to ensure that all households receive the €600 energy credit. This includes those living in mobile home parks and apartments that have shared meters with just one MPRN. This is important. In my constituency a number of people are resident in a mobile home park, some of them elderly. The owner of the park has an MPRN but the households, the people living permanently in these mobile homes, do not. They are caught in a situation where they simply have no way out and they need to be helped.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> In the medium to long term we need to address our energy security. Sinn Féin has consistently called for more direct involvement in energy provision by the ESB, Bord na Móna and Coillte. Why do we call for that? We do so because the State owns them. Each of these are semi-State bodies that are well-established with deep roots in our communities. We should be looking to build up their capacity so as to increase supply and security. We cannot be left subject to a whim at the end of a pipeline, hoping someone else does not turn it off. We should also be able to get a clawback on the dividend from their profits. After all the difficulties it has gone through, this year Bord na Móna paid a dividend to the State on its profits from last year. It has returned to profit, from a company that was nearly closed, which shows the power of the semi-State bodies. Those companies have huge potential and I am asking the Minister of State, as the Minister of State with responsibility for this, to take that on board. We should also be building up our biogas and biomass industries. We have the resources; we just need the political will. Sinn Féin wants to see long-term solutions to the energy crisis and that means becoming more self-sufficient so that we are not at the mercy of international affairs or price-gouging private energy companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">Irish households are facing into the biggest cost-of-living squeeze in nearly four decades in the middle of another significant jump in the official inflation rate. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, estimates that the share of households experiencing energy poverty increased from a level of 13% in 2015 and 2016 to 29% in mid-2022, with potentially more than 50% of all households considered to be at risk of energy poverty by the end of the winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> With regard to the electricity credit announced in the budget, I acknowledge that it will go some way towards helping families struggling to keep up with rocketing energy prices. However, without a price cap the average energy bills will continue to rise, with some families stating it is like paying a second mortgage or double rent. In December 2021, the Government approved the original electricity credit scheme to credit all domestic electricity accounts. Payments were made to more than 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June. They were made automatically and without the need for an application. The scheme was operated by ESB Networks, the electricity distribution system operator, and electricity suppliers, with the oversight of the CRU. Using MPRNs, ESB Networks calculated the number of domestic electricity accounts and notified the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, which subsequently transferred moneys for the scheme to ESB Networks. Suppliers then credited each domestic electricity account held with it on the effective date with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment over the following billing cycle. I acknowledge that this measure and existing infrastructure is a huge help for most households, but not all.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> The ESB and Electric Ireland told an Oireachtas committee last week that 125,000 customers are currently behind on their bills, up from 100,000 during the pandemic, and we are only in the autumn. What will happen when the cold weather really sets in and there is an essential need for heat in the home? This is catastrophic and causing major concern for most homes and businesses. The Government needs to engage further with the CRU and the energy companies on this to ensure that the most vulnerable will not be cut off this winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> On people on pay-as-you-go energy meters, how are emergency payments going to be paid to those vulnerable citizens when the metering system cannot provide the data to identify these people? What are they going to do? There are approximately 346,000 households with prepaid electricity meters but because you cannot see when a pay-as-you-go customer's meter is running out, getting payments to these people quickly is a challenge. Although I acknowledge there is a €3 million hardship fund to help households top up their energy meters, administered by the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and St. Vincent de Paul, this protective measure is insufficient. What protections are in place for customers on prepay meters? The Taoiseach affirmed that no vulnerable person will be disconnected this winter but there is evidently a mismatch between his definition of vulnerable, and that of the CRU, which characterises the vulnerable as having certain specific medical conditions. I would ask for clarity on this today.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> With the definition of vulnerability in mind, I have a constituent who raised the issue of one electricity meter covering two dwellings; one home and one independent granny flat, where the inhabitant is in receipt of palliative care. The inhabitant in receipt of palliative care is deemed vulnerable and requires significant electricity use. One electricity meter covering two dwellings impacts both houses' entitlements to the electricity credit respectively. However, it costs approximately €4,000 to install an additional meter, which is not feasible amid the cost-of-living crisis. These dwellings are inhabited and maintained independently and the only combining aspect is the single meter. The Government needs to bring in the necessary legislation to grant eligibility of electricity credits to independent dwellings or granny flats that share one meter.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Similarly, the requirement of the use of the MPRN as the identifier within the first electricity credit scheme resulted in certain cohorts not being able to access the payment. A particular cohort identified includes approximately 1,000 Traveller households in certain local authority accommodation, where the MPRN is registered to the local authority and supplies multiple households. Additionally, while the vast majority of people who rent their homes have their own individual MPRNs, there is a small cohort of people whose landlords hold the MPRNs and the energy costs are subsequently paid to the landlord by the tenant. I refer to the reality of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Those vulnerable groups need support, which was not provided for under the first electricity scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> Let us not forget the electricity businesses that are swiftly exiting the Irish market. I have had constituents calling me after being placed on the most expensive tariffs for electricity and gas as more and more suppliers flee the Irish market. When energy providers leave, their customers get transferred to other suppliers and are put on the most expensive standard tariffs. These are higher than the best rates that can be obtained from energy providers by locking into an annual discounted contract. For example, I had a local school principal in County Louth contact me regarding the school's spiralling electricity bills. On top of this, its electricity contract is due to expire and will revert to standard charges, which, as we know, have risen by 65%. This process is flawed.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> These are examples of existing challenges that need to be assessed and incorporated into this Bill and the new scheme to ensure help is provided to those who most need it. It is imperative we do not compromise on people's health and safety. Legislation should incorporate a ban on any threat to turn off electricity supply to domestic customers and any critical social infrastructure, such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> In June, the Government enacted legislation and approved capital funding to support EirGrid's role in expediting the delivery of temporary generation capacity. However, the national grid has come under increasing pressure since the start of the decade, with a spike in the number of amber alerts. This requires immediate attention from the Government. It is all well and good throwing money at people under this second electricity scheme but there is a heightened need for the immediate decoupling of the link between gas prices and electricity prices. Electricity prices are inflating, whether generated by natural gas or not. On those grounds, I request that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, continue to assert his efforts in securing EU-wide agreement on the decoupling of the link between gas prices and electricity prices. In addition, are there any updates on the EU energy plan figures with regard to using EU windfall levies on oil and gas companies, the profits of which have risen along with skyrocketing prices?</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> The Government had an opportunity in the budget to address the electricity crisis facing ordinary people in this period and in the future but it refused to put a cap on electricity prices. While that is disappointing in the long term, I acknowledge the new scheme will help people this winter. Let us be clear. Whatever needs to be done now to keep the lights on for families this winter must be done as a matter of urgency. If a family is forced to freeze as a result of mounting electricity bills, the Government has failed. It must be remembered that behind every MPRN or, in some cases, lack thereof, are people, many of whom are in a difficult place. We must look after them and ensure they have a proper Christmas. They have been forced to make very difficult decisions based on income and human needs. Quality of life means so much and people are struggling every week. I offer my full support to the many great constituents and businesses in Louth and east Meath that have made great sacrifices over the past three years. We must support them now and do so urgently.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">The next number of months will be some of the harshest many people will ever have experienced. For many families, utility bills are already out of reach before the winter starts. A large number of families are living from overdraft to overdraft, if they are lucky enough to have an overdraft, and many others will be reliant on moneylenders because that is the only way they have right now to pay for the necessities of life. There is a hierarchy of needs comprising food, shelter, heat and clothes. Incredibly, in Ireland in 2022, these necessities are out of reach for many working families. I have no doubt lives will be lost and health will be damaged this winter as a result of what is going to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> This generation is one of the first generations in which people will be worse off than their parents. It is likely to be the best educated and hardest-working generation in history and the people in this cohort commute further than those in any other generation. However, they will definitely have far less security than previous generations in terms of the necessities, including housing, health and being able to buy food and clothes. As a result of this, incredibly, emigration is now raising its shocking head, with a recent survey indicating one third of Irish families are considering moving abroad. The reversal of generations of economic progress and a return of the Irish curse of emigration is an incredible legacy for the Minister of State and the Government to leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> The electricity credits that are being provided by the State are an absolute scam and I will explain why that is. Today, citizens are paying more in fuel taxes than they did before the cost-of-living crisis happened. All of the €1.2 billion in electricity credits people will get from the Government in three instalments have already been paid for by the recipients in higher taxation charges, carbon tax increases and ESB price increases. All of that money is being given to people with one hand while the same money is being taken from them with the other hand. It is absolutely shocking that the Government has increased the carbon tax in this crisis. Aontú was the only political party in the Dáil to vote against that tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The most frustrating element of the debate on the cost of energy is that the Government has within its gift the levers it could pull to reduce the cost of electricity for people. It could reduce that cost in a large number of ways at no real cost to the State. I understand Ireland is the only country in the whole of Europe that does not have a gas storage supply. That is laid at the Minister of State's door. It is as a direct result of the Green Party's actions that we are the only country with no gas storage and we are the most exposed to price increases and threats to supply. The Government has also introduced restrictions on the use of turf in the middle of an energy crisis. Again, there is absolutely no logic at all to that but Aontú was the only party in the Dáil to oppose it unequivocally. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications spoke recently in measured, proud tones of how he brought together the energy ministers from all across Europe to a conference in Dublin on offshore wind. In 20 years, however, the State has built only seven offshore wind turbines. It is incredible and very frustrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Aontú has called on the Government to reduce the VAT on fuel, which it refused to do, citing Government rules. Spain has reduced its VAT on fuel. We in Aontú have called on the Government to decouple the price of non-gas-generated electricity from gas-generated electricity. The Government refused, claiming such a move is an EU competency. However, Spain and Portugal have taken that step. Aontú called on the Government to introduce a windfall tax on certain types of energy companies that are making supernormal profits. It refused to do so, again outsourcing any such decision to the EU. Italy, on the other hand, stood up for its citizens and implemented a tax. We called for the reopening of Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations, the closure of which was a ludicrous decision to make at a time of short supply of energy in the State. The country is now potentially facing blackouts as a result. The Minister of State must get rid of standing charges. It makes no sense that we are increasing charges on electricity that is not even being used. It is not environmentally friendly and it hurts people as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> There is a clear theme running through these Government actions and I would like the Minister of State to think about that. Time and again, we are deferring all the big decisions and all the levers we could use to the EU. This is not because the laws or regulations demand it but because of Government inertia. I believe there are a number of reasons for that inertia. First, we are ceding vast elements of Government responsibility to the EU due to a massive technical inability within the Government to do some of those jobs. Second, there is a bias towards EU subservience in the Government in that it honestly seems to believe the EU would do a better job on many of the issues I have raised. That is a major mistake. The EU has competencies in certain areas and surely does certain things well but it is also extremely cumbersome in taking such decisions. It is a slow-moving animal when it comes to fixing some of the issues we are discussing, such as the decoupling of gas-generated electricity from the rest of the system. We would be faster and more effective in doing that ourselves. Another factor is that, truth be told, the EU is not focused on Ireland; it is focused on the needs of the larger countries. If we keep deferring power to the Union on these issues, we will be waiting a long time and our citizens will hurt. I implore the Minister of State to use the levers that are in the hands of the Government to fix the electricity crisis. It must stop handing those levers over to the EU to work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_540">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. Its importance has been brought to the attention of all of us in our constituencies, with people telling us they find it harder to live because of the cost of energy, fuel and all the other things necessary for living. It is important that people are supported but I am not sure about supporting them by giving them energy credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In my opinion, that might only fuel inflation. The energy crisis affects every facet of our lives. It affects home life, public buildings, the cost of doing business publically, and business more generally. A businessman contacted me yesterday evening and told me that his energy costs have risen so much that his reserves in the business are depleting. He employs a huge number of people in his homegrown business. He is fearful that if we do not arrest this and provide proper supports for business over the next 12 months, he will have to close his doors. The negative effect of that will be passed on.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> There was a big emphasis over the summer on stopping people from displaying turf for sale. In the constituency where I live, turf is very important for keeping people warm during the winter. The arguments made were all about air quality, but if people end up with no heat in their houses, there will be a lot of flu, pneumonia and chest infections. I think it is important that if we are changing rules we do not change them until we actually have the alternatives in place. One of the big things that is talked about in heating is air to water and getting people to put in air to water heating systems. However, it takes electricity to run them. People who have done it and have tried to comply with the green agenda are left in a situation where they are paying more for their heating and they have no control over it, other than turning down the thermostat.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> In relation to the credits that have been proposed, I think the pay-as-you-go customers need to be sorted now. There can be no dilly-dallying with this. Every pay-as-you-go customer must get the benefit of this credit. The Government has announced that it is giving all of this money out, so it must ensure that everybody gets it and not just some people. I also believe that the standing charges on ESB bills are gross and unfair and should be abandoned at this particular time. We are in a crisis. The standing charges should be removed. People can refer this to the energy regulator. We are all in this House to make sure that we have good laws and good governance. The standing charges should be taken out as a matter of urgency, as should the PSO levies.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> It is very important that we talk about the smart meters that have been installed, the investment that has been put into them and what use they are to people who are trying to use them. I have heard some people say that one way of saving energy is to put on the tumble dryer at night. It is actually risky to do that, because the heat build-up in a tumble dryer could cause a house fire. We must be very careful about the advice that we are giving out on how appliances should be used. It is important that the Government steps up to the mark and issues proper guidance on how to conserve energy, rather than leaving it to other people. Energy providers are taking advantage of the current situation. They are making profits on the back of people who are suffering. It is important that they are challenged at every opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> I welcome the fact that last week there was an announcement that solar panels on roofs would be exempt from planning regulations in most cases. However, there are two things that I ask of the Government in connection with that. Whatever ministerial directive to local authorities is required, it must be given now and not in a month's time or two months' time. The announcement has been made. The Government must ensure that the local authorities know how to deal with the matter. For instance, if a person is putting solar panels on his or her roof, whether the property is a farm, a house or a business, will planning permission be required? If the answer is "No", will the person need to apply for a certificate of exemption from planning permission from the local authority before the work is carried out? We have to be upfront with people and tell them what they have to do, because they are anxious to get involved in this. The second point I wish to make on solar panels relates to experiences shared with me by a number of constituents in Galway East. They have told me that they invested in solar panels in the past and did everything to try to create green energy, but they were sold a pup in terms of the energy credit they would get for what they were feeding into the network. That was supposed to happen in July of last year and people still have not got their money. It is a failure of Government that we would lull people into a false sense of security and tell them that they would be getting a return on their investment. Likewise, the rate that they are getting for the energy that they are feeding back into the system is way too low and should be looked at seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Lastly, I wish to make the point that we are at a stage where we are facing a huge energy crisis. There are two parts to it. There is the issue of supply and the fact that we are putting all of our eggs into one basket when we do not know how we are going to deal with it. Offshore energy is a case in point. I will leave my thoughts with the Minister of State.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">There seems to be a broad consensus that something needs to be done. I am hearing from Sinn Féin that they will be supporting the passage of the Bill through the House. I understand that there is a difference in the approach that Sinn Féin would take over the Government parties. I happen to disagree with the Sinn Féin approach. I think it is too close to the Tory model. I think it would result in a huge wealth transfer to people who need it least, energy companies included.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">Putting that to one side, everybody in the House agrees on one thing, which is that people who are living through this energy crisis absolutely need help, and need help urgently. That is something that this Bill provides. The provisions of the Bill are reasonably straightforward. They were rehearsed when the previous energy credit was put in place. Deficiencies were identified in the previous iteration of the electricity credit, which I hope we will put right in this legislation, for example, in the specific case of members of the Travelling Community, where there might be one MPRN across a number of families. A basic equity test is failed if each of those families is not getting what they are entitled to in terms of the energy credit. Similarly, if the energy account is in the name of a landlord and the benefit is not being passed onto the tenant, it fails an equity test. It is not something that we should be standing over as a Government. I very much hope that we have put provisions in place that will prevent that happening again.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I think it was a good idea to make changes to the NORA levy. I support that notion. As the Minister of State said, there is sufficient energy supply already there in terms of the NORA levy. I think it is a wise decision. </p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I want to broaden out the scope of my contribution. I was thinking that there are four basic objectives, that as a consumer, a customer and a policymaker, I want to consider in respect of energy. First, I want to reduce my energy costs. Everybody wants to reduce their energy costs. Hand in hand with that, I want to reduce my energy use. I want to figure out when is the best time for me to use the energy that I am going to use in terms of price. There is also a third element, and I must say that I do think people want to play their part in mitigating the energy crisis, and particularly the issues with the supply of electricity. I want to know when to use energy in a way that is going to relieve the stress that is on the system that we all know is there. I think people have that broader sense of civic duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> The fourth element is that I want to promote the microgeneration of renewables so that energy is putting money back into people's pockets. However, I get the sense that my four priorities may not be priorities that are shared by our energy companies; in fact, we may be at cross purposes. It may be the case that what the energy companies want me to do is not to reduce my usage and bills and not to promote microgeneration. Presumably, they would like to see less pressure on the grid, however. What can I say in support of this assertion? First, I had a look at microgeneration tariffs and payments today, before making this speech. Bord Gáis has no published tariffs for microgeneration. If I make any errors here, I will be happy to correct the record afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">There is no published tariff and payment can be expected once per year. I could find no information online on rates or payment frequency for PrepayPower. SSE Airtricity's payments will be 14 cent per KWh, with two payments per year. I could go further with this but suffice to say there is a variation in the price being offered per kWh. I do not think paying somebody once or twice a year is acceptable. I do not think that is the carrot we need to promote microgeneration. From talking to constituents who have installed solar panels on their roofs, I can tell the House it is not easy to get that feed-in tariff. Obstacles and hurdles are being put in people's way and they are finding it difficult to access that payment. Energy companies are dragging their heels.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I had a smart meter installed in my house recently. I was expecting the world of information to open in front of me to allow me to figure out when I should use energy and how I am going to save my money. However, I have no access to that information. The only way I can access that information at present is if I sign up for a smart meter tariff. I do not currently have the information to know if I will do better on a smart meter tariff. Somebody has that information and one can be sure they are using it for their corporate benefit. I do not have access to that information. How am I to know what plan is going to benefit me most?</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I had a research note prepared, which states that the number of tariff options out there could be described as baffling. That is from a Green Party researcher. There was a similar discussion in my local membership WhatsApp group. Members of the Green Party were trying to compare, contrast and understand the different tariffs out there for people with smart meters. We could not make head nor tail of it. Those are people who are highly literate in respect of energy policy. If I cannot make head nor tail of it, how can I expect people of a low literacy level to be able to understand when they do not have access to information and the information they have is difficult to decipher?</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Deputy Whitmore rightly pointed out there is a €1.7 billion wealth transfer of taxpayer money. Deputy Barry was correct that consumers will benefit from it but eventually that wealth transfer will end up with the energy companies. Should be we be considering conditionality? Should these tariffs be easily comprehensible to people? Should we make sure that people have access to the information that their smart meters are generating? Should we ensure that energy companies are not putting hurdles in the way of people who want to benefit from microgeneration on their homes?</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Donnelly<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_557">I echo the concerns that have been expressed about the members of the Travelling community and some tenants who may not see this money. I say to Deputy Ó Cathasaigh that the Sinn Féin position is that a price cap, as we have clearly stated, must go hand in hand with a windfall tax on the profits of the energy companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> While this Bill will be welcomed by many ordinary workers and families who are struggling to keep food on the table and send kids to school and sports etc. and who are trying to make sure they have a warm home, this will be temporary. A cash payment sounds great at the moment but the energy costs will soon outstrip that payment. While the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is a stopgap on large bills, it will do nothing to stop the rise of energy costs and the crippling rise in the cost of living in general. What will stop the rise for citizens, as I said, is a price cap, as Sinn Féin has called for.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> I see and hear weekly that families are struggling to choose between food and heat. Why is the Government not hearing that and doing the right thing? In 2022, when children ask if the heating is on as they go to bed cold, the answer should not be to put a coat on the bed. In fact, what these energy credits do is to allow the cost of energy to rise to an unimaginable amount for most ordinary people. This is, in essence, the Government providing funds to keep energy costs at the <i>status quo</i>. A cap to pre-pandemic prices would mean more money in people's pockets and would alleviate some of the cost-of-living crisis in households across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> This initiative by the Government will cost up to €1.21 billion. It will enable prices to rise and profits to rise for providers. The Government is approaching this cost-of-living and energy crisis in a piecemeal way instead of taking the necessary steps to make an impact on people's lives. I will share one statistic that stopped me in my tracks. The ESB saw revenues increase to €3.7 billion, an increase of €1.5 billion on last year. Profits rose to €128 million for the first six months of this year. Where is this money coming from? It is coming from our pockets. It is coming from the pockets of families and individuals. It is coming from businesses. That is where that money is coming from. That needs to stop. I urge the Government to step up and listen to what all of us are hearing in our communities and constituency offices. Workers, families and businesses are all struggling. They need help. They need more help than is being provided at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 - Second Stage. What a mouthful. The Government does not intend to do anything for the hard-pressed people. Households are facing annual gas and electricity hikes of €6,000 from early next year. That is more than triple the €1,900 they were paying at the start of 2021. Figures have been quoted and I am not going to quote any more of them. What is going on is pure gouging.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> I have great respect for the ESB, its workers and outdoor staff and the work they do but the Government's inability to tackle the conglomerates and multibillion dollar companies is sickening. Why can the Minister not do something like he did during the Covid pandemic? Why not introduce emergency legislation to cap prices to bring some kind of respect on them? It is shocking that those companies can get away with those kinds of price hikes. There has been a range of price rises in recent weeks in other utility firms. SSE Airtricity, Community Power and PrepayPower have all hiked up their costs but the ESB showed the lead. If the Government had done something meaningful to deal with the ESB it would have sent the clear message to the other companies that they would not be allowed to gouge ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Why does the Government not do something about the standing charges? That would be quite simple. Those charges are exorbitant at the moment. Why does the Government not do something about pay-as-you-go schemes? How are people on those tariffs going to manage? I want something clarified. If there are 20 flats or units with only one MRPN, how are those tenants going to get this money, the so-called manna from heaven the Government is talking about?</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Smart meters are far too smart for us all. It is a con job. That is my honest belief about smart meters. I certainly will not be installing one or advising anyone else to do so. The Government is far too smart at taking money out of pócaí na ndaoine gach lá, gach uair.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The Minister of State might ask the senior Minister about the following. The Minister stood there seachtain ó shin and said there was a licence application in front of him. It was not a licence application but a continuation of a licence that a company already had for Ballyroe. He said he would have an answer in a few days but that was two and a half weeks ago. He is playing with these serious issues. They are sitting on his desk and he is refusing point blank to deal with them. He is kicking the can down the road and trying to hunt good investors we have in Ireland, which are bringing us in energy at no cost to the taxpayer. They are spending their own money.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I have ceist eile for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I met a group of people last week with my colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">They informed me that the Kinsale gas pipeline is not being used now. Tá sé folamh; it is empty but it is in great condition. I am shocked to hear this but we are told, and it is not dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi go raibh fear i dTiobraid Árann a bhfuil póca ina léine aige but pretty hot information, that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is waiting to sign a directive that is on his desk to carry out an act of national sabotage on that pipeline. I would go so far as to call it high treason to put ready mix concrete, which will probably have a 10% cost increase on it, into that pipeline to render it unusable ever again. I want the Minister of State to answer that question. If that happens, the Minister, and members of the Government with him, should be dragged out of the Government and people should rise up here and say enough is enough. What kind of thinking or mind would anybody have to damage a piece of infrastructure? If someone did it, we would send an Garda to arrest that person. The Minister will sign this order to send employees of ready mix concrete companies and others to pour concrete into a gas line that was laid and has served this country for decades. It is still intact and ready to be used again but the Minister wants to put ready mix into it so it can never be used again because of an ideology. The lunatics are definitely running the asylum if that happens.</p>

Could the Minister reach so far as to sign an order to instruct people to carry out that kind of State vandalism, national sabotage and cutting off our nose to spite our face? We might never be able to use that pipeline again but floating gas terminals will come in, treat the gas, and pump it back into the system to keep the lights on for the winter.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an mBille seo. Mar is eol dúinn, tá formhór na dteaghlach ar fud an Stáit seo ag fulaingt. Caithfidh an Rialtas seo a sheacht ndícheall a dhéanamh chun cabhair agus tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh chomh luath agus is féidir. It is vital that all the necessary steps are taken to prevent households from sinking under the weight of energy price debt this winter and into the new year. In that respect, I see that the Bill provides for a benefit payment in each of the periods, namely, November to December 2022, January to February 2023 and March to April 2023. I have a parliamentary reply pending on a specific issue that the Minister of State may be able to shed light on. It is whether churches and parish halls will also be eligible for support for their energy costs. They are doing their utmost and also have significant energy bills. They provide vital community services and are deserving of equal support and an equal response.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> In the wider sense, the issue of energy costs is front and centre for households, businesses and farms, which are the major users of energy throughout this State. A farmer I spoke to recently said his costs have risen by more than 400%. Can any level of State intervention rise to the challenge of offering support, when costs are at such an astronomical scale? The Bill does nothing in signalling a change in our fundamental approach to energy security, which is nothing other than a sham. Instead, the Government insists it is doubling down on renewables and refuses even to consider options such as LNG, gas or oil exploration. The power plants at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough need to be reopened. We need to have a sense of pragmatism and urgency. Those power plants could be powered and fuelled on biomass. I again call for that, as a Deputy in the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I have no doubt but that future generations will look at this self-imposed hostility towards our available energy resources as an act of utter lunacy and national self-harm. As important as it is to offer some financial support, it is difficult to avoid the impression that we are merely delaying the inevitable and that sooner or later Irish households, families, businesses and farms will be pushed over what I recently described as the energy price precipice. It will be no consolation to these people, as they plummet into cold and ruin, that it was all done to meet the demands of a nonsensical and borderline insane carbon reduction policy that is radical, extreme and is restricting us just when we need flexibility and common sense the most. It is like throwing a heavy weight to a drowning person instead of a rope.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Burden after burden is imposed on the Irish people. Regulations on the banning of heat and energy sources such as peat, and even wood, are being pursued with reckless vigour with little thought for people who are struggling to heat their homes this winter, despite a clear and obvious need for a change in approach or at least a pause. We also need certainty that prepay customers will be protected. In addition, I am calling for a full investigation of the roll-out of the so-called smart meters, which are far from smart, and the impact they are having on families. As Ms Caroline O'Doherty recently reported, only a tiny fraction of the almost 1 million electricity customers with smart meters are using them as intended. In fact, more than 930,000 smart meters have been installed in homes and small businesses under a €1.2 billion scheme over the past three years. Many people were under the distinct impression that these meters would assist with costs and were legally mandatory, yet we know that the tariff plans are being described as deeply confusing and unworkable. It is yet another example of people being railroaded into schemes that are not operating in their interests but in the interests of another agenda entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> I will conclude by referencing my question on the reopening of the power plants. It needs to happen. We are in an energy crisis and we need our power plants at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge reopened immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">I welcome the few payments that people will get as small as they are. They will help some people but many will be left behind. I, along with many others, could understand the cost of electricity going up, if the cost of producing it was going up. We now find, however, that the electricity companies are doubling, tripling and quadrupling their profits. Where is the regulator? Where is the Minister who is in charge of the regulator? What are they doing? Why are they allowing this to happen? Yes, the Taoiseach has said he will fight like a big man for a windfall tax in Europe but the problem is here. We have no regulator and no Minister who is responsible for the regulator. People are being robbed day after day for electricity that they should be paying far less for.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I am glad for all the people throughout the country who were able to cut turf for themselves because those people who have turf have surety that they will not be cold this winter. There is nothing more homely than to sit around a blazing turf fire. I thank the Minister, Deputy Ryan, for creating awareness when he said that people could not cut turf because that is when they got out to cut it in the fine weather and saved it. We are glad that happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> We are leaving 10,000 acres of bog behind us in Littleton. We have grand bogs in Barna, Foilbee, Reaboy, Rea na Colli and other locations. All these places could be utilised way more. Shannonbridge was closed down and every day since then the cost of electricity has gone up day after day. The Government will not allow us to open Shannon LNG or Barryroe. The Corrib gas field could be explored more deeply and the Kinsale gas field could be used as storage. We need to reverse the decision of the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, to cancel drilling services in 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The Taoiseach says every day that anyone in financial trouble should go to his or her community welfare office. I know of a man who is 80 years of age who is having financial trouble in accessing treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">He went to the community welfare officer to get financial help. He was in the office for an hour and a half. There was a group of refugees in front of him. When he proceeded to go up to the man at the counter - there was only one person there - he was told to go back to the queue and that all of the other 23 or 24 people were in front of him. If the Taoiseach is good enough to suggest that people should go to the community welfare officer, will he put more people on the counters to deal with and see after our own people, as well as the refugees? </p>
          <p eId="para_583"> Deputy Griffin created a hullabaloo here today about refugees being displaced from Killarney because other refugees came into the place they were in. I remind Deputy Griffin, who will be watching this debate from somewhere, that he is part of the Government that brought the 193 men into Killarney to upscuttle the refugees who were already there. Not only does he vote for everything the Government does, but he rounds up all of the backbenchers to vote for every notion Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Green Party think up.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_584">Households are facing annual gas and electricity bills of €6,000 from early next year if prices keep increasing at the current rate. The Government, which has a controlling shareholding of 95% in the ESB, fails to protect consumers by explicitly directing the ESB to either cap prices or not proceed with any price increases at this time. Such action by the Government is possible. It would also send a clear message to other price-gouging electricity providers, as the ESB is the benchmark price-setting organisation for the electricity market in Ireland. The latest Electric Ireland or ESB price rises mean that households now face paying an extra €446 a year for electricity and an extra €516 for gas. The reality is that the electricity bill for a three-bed semi-detached home in Ireland is now approaching €4,000 per year as we enter the winter 2022-2023 period. According to the price comparison website <i>bonkers.ie</i>, when all increases are considered, households are looking at paying a minimum of €1,100 more for their electricity and more than €1,100 more for their gas compared to January 2021. That price increase does not include the expected price increases that are due to emerge over the coming months. Last week, I mentioned schools in west Cork I know of that are going to the local parish priest for help paying the electricity bills. That is an astonishing situation. This Dáil criticises the church and its connections with schools but, were it not for the church, the lights in the school would be turned off.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> When the average price increases for electricity alone, totalling more than €1,100, are considered, the Government's €600 voucher scheme is shown to be completely insufficient. These colossal energy policy failures on the part of the Government are having a deep impact on the financial sustainability of every household, farm and small business and are exacerbating a winter of discontent. The best that can be hoped for is that it will be a mild winter. </p>
          <p eId="para_586"> The Irish Government has largely sat on its hands in comparison with those of other EU states. Since Gazprom's decision to shut down the flow of gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the EU has planned a significant emergency intervention in the European electricity market. The toolbox for rising energy prices was announced as the crisis was starting. The EU outlined a number of fiscal and regulatory measures that each individual member state could take against the crisis. These options included reducing taxation to zero, helping energy companies manage the high costs and providing support for vulnerable people. The Rural Independent Group drew attention to these measures in the Dáil on several occasions in 2021 including through the tabling of two Private Members' motions calling on the Government to reduce energy taxes. One each occasion, Government Deputies voted against easing the financial pain on the consumer and sided with keeping energy bills high while providing absolutely no alternative energy supply. </p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I listened to one Fianna Fáil Deputy from Cork South-West today who said that we are not doing enough as regards climate action. This Deputy is clueless when it comes to climate action, despite being his party's spokesperson on it. We need only look at the warmer homes scheme fiasco he and his Government have stood over. People are waiting for two years to get works done under the scheme. We should also look at the shocking grants for solar generation. They are so bad that west Cork hoteliers, shop owners and supermarkets have told me that they will not apply for a grant but will instead pay out of their own pockets to install solar panels. We can also look at the zero return on public transport in that Deputy's constituency while his constituents in west Cork are being robbed through the carbon tax thanks to him and his Green Party buddies. If I were that Deputy, I really would not point fingers while his constituents are waiting for him in the next general election. In the UK, there is a cap on electricity charges while the standing charge is capped at £169.21.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">I am grateful to my colleagues for allowing me some of their time. The Government, which has a controlling shareholding of 95% in the ESB, failed to protect consumers by explicitly directing the ESB to either cap prices or not proceed with any price increases at this time. Such action by the Government would have been possible and would have sent a clear message to other price-gouging electricity providers, as the ESB is the benchmark price-setting organisation for the electricity market in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> What the Minister of State and his Government are presiding over is absolute and total chaos. Never before have people been hit with such energy costs. While I welcome the money that is to be given in a couple of tranches, which will be needed and wanted, what the people really wanted was a cap on prices. Giving a subsidy like that being given is like spitting in the ocean. If the price keeps going the way it is going, people will not be able to heat their homes or work their electric products because they will be quite simply unable to pay the ESB bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> This country is full of small businesses. They are the backbone of Ireland, particularly rural Ireland. I am talking about the farmers who use electricity in milking cows along with pig farms, poultry farms and the horticultural industry. People are quite simply being forced out of business. I remind the Minister of State that many businesses in County Kerry got a final death blow of a letter in the post telling them that their rates are being reviewed. A business in Killarney is facing an increase of €30,000 in its rates. How could any government stand by and allow that to happen at this time? Surely the Government would have had the cop-on to realise that now is not the time to increase people's rates. I plead with the Minister of State and the people who thought it was a good idea to make it illegal to sell turf from service stations from the end of this month. Where is the sense in that? How can the Minister of State stand over it?</p>

          <p eId="para_598">The truth is that the Government has struck the right balance in this. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has said that the Government's measures in the recent budget will protect people who are at risk of going into energy poverty. They will be protected from that by the measures the Government has introduced. That is a fact and not something produced by the Government. Of course, we are facing huge surges. The wholesale costs for Electric Ireland have risen from €300 million to €2 billion, a sevenfold increase in the cost of the electricity it produces and has to sell. That is the reality of the world we are living in. That has been caused by the war in Ukraine and by very high dependence on gas from the Russian market. That is the reality we face.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">The Government is approaching this in a prudent way. We are making sure to protect people, while also pursuing companies that have been making excessive profits. When the Government is deciding on the appropriate tax for the so-called solidarity contribution, I suggest to the Minister of State that we should go to the high end of the permitted scale, rather than down around the 33%. The contracts for wind companies that are being underwritten by a price of €180 per megawatt-hour were at about €90 per megawatt-hour. There is too much fat being put into those charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Wind energy companies should be making a contribution to help people adapt to a lower carbon and lower energy cost world. They should be stepping up to the plate because in the long term we need people to support renewable energy and the projects that will switch us to becoming less dependent on fossil fuels. This is a golden opportunity for companies in that sector to show they are in tune with the needs of the communities they serve and that they are willing to help people make changes in their homes to make them warmer and more efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> I have said this to the Minister of State on a previous occasion. and I will say it again: the missing piece in this is a serious Government effort to help people to make those changes. We should be focusing on shallow retrofits. Today, the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action was told that there are 162,000 unfilled cavity walls that could be insulated. They should be the target of early intervention. We were also told that heat controls have the potential to reduce energy use by 36%. These groups should be eligible for 80% grants. We should be moving to help people to make the changes that would reduce energy dependence. There is not enough emphasis on the early wins that can be delivered by sharing, having more electric vehicle chargers and helping people make those low-cost changes. Now is the time to do that, when people are attending to the needs and vulnerability of what they are doing. Now is the time to capitalise on that. We need to do more in that sphere.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">Like many on both sides of the House, I have stated that the energy crisis and fuel costs in general comprise one of the biggest challenges facing citizens in this country, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Many households and businesses throughout the country are worried heading into the winter months. The cost of energy and that of doing business are also rising, food and shopping bills are increasing and interest rates are going up. The scale of the energy crisis has without doubt shifted the Government's approach and attitude to responding to this type of emergency by delivering a huge budget package of once-off measures. This second €1.2 billion electricity credit will support over 2.2 million electricity account holders, which is a hugely significant step, with the scheme for three €200 payment to become operational by 1 November. September's cost-of-living budget was about putting more money back into people's pockets and reducing the burden of rising bills that individuals and businesses have to pay. As we saw during the pandemic, this Government backs businesses, backs jobs and supports its citizens to ensure we have the strong economy required to improve the quality of life of our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> During the debate tonight, a few Opposition speakers were scaremongering by stating that these measures do not go far enough and are not sufficiently targeted. They failed to acknowledge that for financially vulnerable households at risk of energy poverty, the €600 electricity payment scheme is complemented by targeted measures in the budget, such as the fuel allowance, which includes an additional lump sum payment of €400 and expanded eligibility to up to 80,000 householders over 70 through an increased means threshold. This will comprise €500 per week for single persons and €1,000 per week for couples. We simply do not know how bad this European energy crisis could get this winter. Sinn Féin's price cap would certainly have unintended or unforeseen consequences. The cost of the price cap, a measure that does not dampen down demand, would be open-ended and would be economic suicide. In Britain, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the annual cost of the UK Government's price cap is more than £100 billion. Countries that have implemented price caps, like France and Denmark, have seen little change in demand. The electricity costs emergency measure and the measures within the recent budget strike the right balance between helping people in the short term and planning for the uncertain times ahead.</p>

          <from>Deputy Réada Cronin<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and, perhaps, to try to improve it. My Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has proposed several amendments that would improve the Bill and make it more socially inclusive. These would include a liaison with MABS and provision that those who do not need this energy credit could ask their provider to direct that money to agencies dealing with people who are most risk of energy poverty. The financially vulnerable are an ever-increasing cohort of people because people find they are being hammered by costs at every turn. I am thinking of my constituents in north Kildare, who tell me they are considering living by candlelight, not because they are old romantics but because they are older pensioners who are terrified of their bills, including the standing charges eating into their funds before they even turn the light on. In this decade of commemorations is hard to believe that we have gone from electricity back to candlelight. Amendments making low-usage properties, whether vacant houses or holiday homes, exempt from this energy grant would go some way towards addressing the huge and growing gap between the extremely privileged and those barely getting by.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I note especially our proposed amendments on prepay metering, stipulating that at the request of the Minister an electricity supplier would have to credit prepay meters with an electricity cost emergency benefit payment in advance of the prescribed payment period. That is critical. Equally critical is that the suppliers would remove any arrears or limits placed on prepay meters until the Minister directs otherwise. Also of vital importance is the provision that an electricity supplier would not disconnect a household using a prepay meter during a moratorium on disconnections. I am very worried about people who self disconnect. The prepay meter issue is vital because these are already the people who are most financially vulnerable. Most are on prepay meters as a means of budgeting their income and their outgoings. They already pay a higher tariff than those of us on a regular meter. We could call it a poverty tax if we were to be honest but we would never be that crude or honest in this House. These people should not be punished for being poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I hope the Minister of State will take the amendments on board and look at them. These are matters that we have discussed at length at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. We have been talking about this non-stop for the past four or five weeks, and even before the war in Ukraine. We need to be clear about what this Bill is meant to do. It is meant to protect vulnerable energy users. It has to protect those who are at the greatest risk and those on low to medium incomes, who get up the earliest in the morning and work the hardest. These are front-line workers in health, retail, transport, schools and carers. They are the workers who keep the show on the road and to whom we have a duty to keep going when it comes to one of the most basic aspects of life and living, which is energy and heat, hot water, hot food and light.</p>

        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_607">I heard the Minister of State outline some of the specific measures taken in the budget to help alleviate the cost of living and increased energy costs for some people and specific sectors. Those were very welcome but they were the targeted measures. Tonight we are looking at universal measures, or the safety net for the general public. All the payments we are speaking of tonight are welcome but they fall far short of what is needed. That is the case for those who are on low or middle incomes and for family carers, for example, 75% of whom do not get the carer's allowance. One of the things I was hugely disappointed about in the budget was the fact that the carer's allowance is still not a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance. However, that is for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> There has been a lot of discussion about a cap on electricity prices. I am not convinced that a cap on electricity prices at the amount of last year's bills is a good solution because it would do nothing to incentivise cutting back on energy usage. In fact, it might be a recipe for a greater threat of blackouts. Crucially, those on bigger incomes and with bigger homes would benefit on the double. Their bills would be static, which would be a big saving, but because they have larger homes, they could freely use more electricity and more energy and they would not pay an extra cent for it. It would also mean writing a blank cheque for large energy companies. All in all, I am not convinced that the best way to support those who really need help is by putting a cap on their electricity bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I am of the view that the Bill does not go far enough, but the Government still has time to amend it. People have already been hit with huge hikes in their electricity bills, yet the first payment under this legislation will not kick in until December. What about the massive bills people got in August, September and October? They will get similar bills in November also. How will those be paid by the carers about whom I spoke, those on low and middle incomes and those who do not have €10 left over at the end of the week? An extra €150 or €200 hike in their electricity bills is like a mountain to climb. Before they get their first payment to help cover the increase in the November-December bill, they will already be in debt. People who have always paid their bills on time are struggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> We should ensure a single €400 electricity credit before Christmas and the two €200 credits afterwards. This would mean that many families would not be facing into Christmas already saddled with bills they cannot pay in their entirety. We risk people running into arrears and going to moneylenders just to keep the lights on and their homes heated. A double payment before Christmas would be a big help. It would allow people to breathe and not be worn down by the worry of unpaid bills before Christmas without having to worry about what will come afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> People who do not need these payments will receive them because they are universal but is there any way the owners of holiday homes might not receive a €600 payment for each holiday home? There are over 60,000 such homes in Ireland. That saving alone would go a long way towards financing the proposed initial €400 electricity credit to which I am referring. Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify whether somebody who is renting a second home on Airbnb and charging well for it will receive these energy credits. If they do, the Government has had a long time to prepare this legislation and knew it was coming. It is not good enough that all of those people will be able to get the benefit about which we are speaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> Many Deputies have spoken about the standing charge. Could the Minister of State explain matters to me because I do not know what is happening? A standing charge is meant to reflect the actual or fixed cost of providing the electricity in the first place. We urgently need to refer the savage increases in standing charges to the energy regulator. Certain providers have pushed up the standing charges for residential customers by more than €300 in some instances. As a result, the Government's €200 electricity credit before Christmas will not even cover the increase in the standing charge for some people let alone help with the increased cost of their electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> I know that the Bill is not about support for businesses, but I want to add my voice to those who are calling for an immediate support package for businesses. So many small businesses and retailers and people in so many different sectors are really in a bad way. The Minister of State must know it because he must receive the same emails I receive. Costs for many of these smaller retailers, particularly small supermarkets with delicatessens and stocks of frozen food, cold drinks, etc., have gone through the roof and are eating into their working capital. Many of them have gone right through it. They have nothing left to pay their huge bills and their businesses are on a knife edge. They are not looking at investing in solar panels. They do not have the capital up front to install them and in truth, many do not have the heart to install them because they are concerned that they will not have a business after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> Domestic customers see their electricity bills skyrocketing and their standing charges increasing for no reason they can fathom. They have been given no reason as to why this is happening. They see the obscene profits of energy companies and what do they see for themselves? They see one €200 electricity credit before Christmas. It is just not enough. It will leave very many people in debt and some in despair before Christmas. I ask the Minister of State to double that credit to €400. It really would help.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_615">The Government had a number of options to alleviate the cost of electricity facing families, older people, people with disabilities, carers, small businesses, etc., but the option it chose was to pay the electricity credit. Other options mentioned included capping the prices charged by energy companies, nationalising those companies trading in Ireland, a windfall tax on energy companies or taking extra dividends from these companies to support people who need it most. These options were not seriously investigated. I hear what people are saying about blank cheques but a €600 blank cheque from every household is going to these electricity companies over the next four or five months anyway. Certainty is key here. If you talk to people in small businesses and corner shops, they are seeing their bills rise and do not know what their next one is going to be. They do not know how they are going to be able to cut down on their bills. They have fridges in their shops. Which ones do they switch off for the winter? All these questions are coming to mind. Certainty is really important for people so that they know it will be at that level for that period. I do not believe people would use electricity in an over-the-top fashion. This was the argument made in respect of water charges. It was argued that people were using water excessively. When the commission looked at the matter, it found that they were not. It found that we were actually more prudent than most European countries regarding the amount of water we used.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The cap was a really important policy to look regarding keeping them at 2021 prices. They have done this in other countries. It is expensive but what we are doing here is also expensive. Energy companies are benefiting from the credit. The Government will have to come back next year because while once-off payments will buffer for a period, despite the €5.6 billion in additional public spending and taxation measures, the majority of people will be poorer. The ESRI has stated that, as has the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. It is not just people in here who are saying it. People are number crunching the outcome of the budget. The reason this will happen is because workers are not getting pay increases. Increases in social welfare payments to pensioners and social welfare recipients were not enough to keep up with inflation. That is the case. People will be facing into next year with increases that do not meet inflation. Inflation this year has been about 8.2%. Next year, it is expected to be at 7% so that means that the money coming into people's pockets is not matching what they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Thousands of workers who have not received wage increases will have to start putting in demands for them. I met a young girl who works for a small book publisher. The company increased the price of all its schoolbooks by €2.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">When she looked for a pay increase because she is under pressure paying rent, she was told her employer could not afford it but would get a pilates instructor in at lunchtime to relax the workers and that might help their anxiety over rent, food prices and energy prices going up. For groups like lone parents, when the once-off energy payments are stripped away, this will entrench these households and their children deeper in poverty. Social welfare recipients will receive core welfare payments and this is a recipe for growing poverty and deprivation. A €15 minimum wage is a necessity, workers need to put in pay claims to at least match inflation and social welfare payments should be index-linked with a relevant economic indicator.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> There must be an unambiguous declaration that no one will be without electricity through arrears, inability to pay a bill or not having money to put into their pay-as-you-go meters. The majority of people with pay-as-you-go meters had them installed because they had difficulty paying their bills and these meters are supposed to be more financially manageable. This has not proven to be the case in many instances. The fees for switching from pay-as-you-go to bill pay must be eliminated for everybody. The universality the Minister of State mentioned regarding payment of credits must be matched by universality in not having one's electricity cut off or having to pay for switching from pay-as-you-go to bill pay. That is important and if the Government does not do it, many people will face serious situations in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I have been raising this issue for months. Earlier, a Sinn Féin Deputy made the point about the additional needs payment scheme waiting times. That is the case. People have to wait. They have to make the application, and payment is not immediate. I have been making the point that community welfare officers, as they were pre-austerity cuts, should be in the community permanently, or at least two or three days per week, so workers on low incomes, people on social welfare and people facing a crisis in buying food or heating their homes have immediate access to these officers. It has been taken up by the Minister, who says they are in the Intreo offices. They are, but they are behind closed doors or thick walls and it is hard for people to access them. The Minister did an advertising campaign. That campaign needs to be reactivated in order to let people know they can access community welfare officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> On the additional needs payment scheme, there was provision for bedding and clothing in circumstances of a fire or emergency. The clothing allowance should be brought back for people who need it, particularly older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> I support the amendments, particularly those relating to pay-as-you-go and on the functions of the commission in relation to prepay customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> The Government must ensure that holiday and vacant homes do not receive the electricity credit and that those in the Travelling community and on halting sites are not left behind. It must commit to universality of payment for those members of our community. I ask the Minister of State to go into detail on how the up to 1,000 travellers on halting sites will get the credits. He mentioned local authorities so I ask him to expand on how that will be done and communicate that to the Travelling community, whose members need to access that money.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The Minister of State mentioned a vulnerable customer register. How many people know of this register? I propose the Government produce an information leaflet on these issues, about what people can do, where they can go and what they are entitled to, and distribute that to every household in the country so people know what they can access and that pay-as-you-go customers will not be left without electricity.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Will people who apply for the fuel allowance in January 2023 be able to access the €400 extra provided for those on fuel allowance at the moment? People who apply in January and get the allowance will miss that €400 payment from November. Will that be given to them in January?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_626">Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí go léir. I acknowledge and am thankful that the Opposition is supporting the Bill, which, in general, will help everybody. However, there were plenty of questions, comments and criticisms. I will try to address all of the latter in so far as is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The general question at the start was why this Bill is so similar to another Bill we introduced recently and why we cannot just reuse that Bill. The reason is that this Bill grants a payment of €1.2 billion across more than 2 million families. The Attorney General's view is that no Minister should have the power, through executive order, to issue such payments to the public without the consent of the Oireachtas. In light of that advice, we are going through these steps again. Deputies will be familiar with the idea that there is a finance Bill every year, when large amounts of taxpayer money are spent and we need the consent of the Oireachtas in order that Ministers are not granted too much executive power. We were advised that it would be unconstitutional to give any Minister the power to hand out €1.2 billion as he or she saw fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> Another question from many Deputies concerned why the payment is not targeted, though a small number said that it is too targeted and that they would like to see more universal payments. This is a single universal measure, part of an overall package of €2.5 billion, most of which is targeted. This payment is universal. It goes to everybody. Even if you fall through the cracks or do not qualify for welfare, you can collect it. It is one of three parts to the universal payments. Last year, the PSO charge on people's bills was €51. This year there will be a credit for PSO levy of €89, so in that way there is €140 credit on everybody's bill this year. The VAT rate has been introduced on electricity from 13.5% to 9%. That is a universal measure that applies to everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> We have to make sure we are targeting expenditure at people who need it most, and it is for that reason we have a €400 lump sum payment to fuel allowance recipients, which Deputy Joan Collins referred to. That will be paid in the week commencing 14 November. The Deputy asked if this will be available to people who apply in January. I will have to ask the Minister for Social Protection that question. We can come back to that on Committee Stage. A number of Deputies have said they will table amendments on that Stage. I look forward to seeing them and they will all be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The €400 lump sum payment to fuel allowance recipients is not the only targeted measure. There is also a €200 lump sum payment for pensioners and people with disability getting the living alone allowance that will be payable in the week commencing 14 November. There is a €500 cost-of-living lump sum payment to all families getting working family payment. That will be payable also on the week commencing 14 November. There is a double payment of child benefit to support all 639,000 families with children. This will be paid on 1 November. There is a €500 cost-of-living payment for people receiving the carer's support grant, payable on the week commencing 21 November. There is a €500 lump sum cost-of-living disability support grant targeted to all people receiving a long-term disability payment, payable on the week commencing 14 November. There is an autumn cost-of-living double payment for all long-term welfare recipients, payable on the week commencing 17 October, and a Christmas bonus payable to all those receiving a long-term social welfare payment on the week commencing 5 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">That is to point out that this measure is one of many. It is one of three universal measures but one of a large collection of measures, both universal and targeted to help people get past this winter and to soften the hardest edges in the increase of the cost of gas and electricity which are the result of the war in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> A number of Deputies referred to the effects on pay-as-you-go meters. While many find that these meters work well for them, vulnerable customers should not be on these meters but on bill-pay meters. It is free for people to change from what are sometimes known as hardship meters to a bill-pay option. Consumers can contact their supplier to register as vulnerable and so avail of additional protections in recognition of their personal circumstances. Deputy Boyd Barrett told the story of his constituent who contacted him who had a medical need for an electricity connection but had been disconnected. I have been in that situation where I was contacted by a constituent and it was through that process that I discovered the register of vulnerable consumers. The CRU guidelines do no permit utility companies to disconnect customers who have a medical need for devices that run on electricity. It is very important that people get onto that register. Deputy Collins asked about that. There is an issue about communication and it is important that we communicate that well to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I welcome Deputy Whitmore's comments and those of Deputy Harkin on the drawbacks of an energy cap. They are quite right in pointing those out. It is essential we are aware of the negative impacts of such a measure as have happened in other jurisdictions. We have had the time to see how they are working out in other jurisdictions and have seen their outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Several Deputies asked about the Travellers who did not receive the payment and were left out on the last occasion or were only paid late and who were sharing a MRPN or meter through their local authority, perhaps in Traveller-specific accommodation of one form or another. Senator Flynn has raised that directly with me and in the Seanad. Around 1,000 families are affected. I assure Deputies that we will make sure that all correctly receive their money this time around and that any past underpayment will be corrected. It is 1,000 families out of 2 million but there is an issue of equity here. They absolutely deserve to be treated exactly the same as anyone else. Great efforts will be made to make sure that we reach all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Deputy Canney asked when we will bring in the planning changes that will allow people to put solar panels on their roofs without planning permission. I am happy to say they were signed last Friday. This means that people can put as many solar panels on their roof as they wish wherever they live in the country. Anyone with a farm, business or apartment block can put them on their roof unless they live near an airport or helipad in which case there is a limit to 300 sq. m. That is a measure that I originally asked for in 2015. I am happy that it has come in now. It is also now the case that everyone can sell their power back to the grid if they wish. Those are two really important measures. That was requested in the Citizens' Assembly on climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Deputy Murnane O'Connor asked for the dates when the three €200 payments will be made. The exact dates will be in regulation but they will be for the billing cycles of November-December this year, and January-February and March-April of next year. The Deputy stressed the importance of communications and particularly the case of tenants as well as the vulnerable register question and the case for Travellers. I absolutely take those points on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Deputy Stanley referred to security of supply. He said that it was important that we look to our own semi-state companies like Coillte, Bord na Móna and ESB and that we build up our capacity in renewable energy. I absolutely agree with that. All those companies are very active in the renewable energy field and I would like to see them invested in and continuing with the work they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Deputy Joan Collins said that we need to look at other options such as windfall tax. We are going to bring in a windfall tax. It will have two aspects: it will tax people who have deposits of gas, of whom there is only one in the country, and also bring in a tax on the profits of people who made unfair profits because they were selling electricity at the same cost because of the increased cost of gas. They will those with renewable energy or other sources of power. They will be taxed. Deputy Bruton asked that we tax them to the maximum extent that we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Deputy Nolan asked about churches and community halls and whether they will receive support for the increased cost of their electricity. I understand that separate funding of €25 million has been allocated to support such bodies as part of the budget. I expect a scheme to come out of that very soon. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said it was unfair that the cost of energy had gone up from suppliers whose cost of producing that energy had not gone up. That is exactly right. Those people have no right to overcharge for power and they will be faced with retrospective tax on the profits that they unfairly made. There are two aspects to the windfall taxes, with a windfall tax and a solidarity tax. They will be made in line with other European countries and will be done as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Smart meters were raised. Deputy Ó Cathasaigh mentioned that information is not available to people to see how they are using their power which was half the point of smart meters. Conor Molloy also wrote to me on this. ESB Networks has now confirmed that customers who have smart meters installed will be able to access their 30-minute interval consumption data directly starting from November through a new ESB Networks customer portal.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> I think that I have covered as many things as I can. I look forward to meeting the Deputies again on Committee Stage, looking at their amendments and seeing how we can progress this.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_647">— the transfer of specialist disability services from the Department of Health to the new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has still not taken place, over two years since the formation of the Government;</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_664">— ratify the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The current and previous Governments have continually under-invested in disability services. This is evidenced by the level of unmet need across disability services which was highlighted in the disability capacity review published in July 2021. The purpose of that review was to estimate the scale of current outstanding need for specialist disability services and how the scale and shape of need is likely to evolve over the years up to 2032. The review was a sensible and prudent undertaking as we need to know the challenges that are in front of us if we are to have a disability service that can deliver the social supports needed to enable people with disabilities live truly independent lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> The review's findings are stark. It says that to address unmet need, alongside demographic change, would require current disability spending in 2032 to rise by €550 million to €1 billion above its 2018 level to deliver the capacity required. As well as that, additional capital spending for housing to complete the closure of residential institutions would cost in the region of €500 million to €800 million over the period to 2032.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> With these figures in black and white the Government in budget 2023 has once again failed to resource and fund disability support services appropriately. This is the second budget since the capacity review was published so two opportunities have been missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The Government has not even published a plan to implement the recommendations of the capacity review although it initially committed to doing so by December 2021. This implementation plan must be published without delay. The Minister of State recently said it was already completed. Why was it not published before the budget so its recommendations could have been acted on? Sinn Féin has outlined a funded strategy to meet the needs of people with disabilities out to 2032 in our alternative budget this year. We would have invested an additional €153 million in disability services compared with the Government's dismal €29 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> Regarding CDNTs, my constituency office is contacted every week by parents whose children have been on a waiting list for an assessment of need for between two and four years. Approximately 17,000 children are awaiting initial contact with a disability network team and assessments of needs for 2,500 children are overdue. The total extent of waiting lists for disability services is currently unknown due to poor data systems. Underinvestment in IT infrastructure is holding back the entire health service, including the disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> The staff working in CDNTs are under immense pressure to deliver interventions and assessments while there is a vacancy rate of approximately 28% across these teams. That is almost one third of its workforce not in place. How are they expected to deliver interventions and assessments in this situation? The backfilling of therapists who are on maternity or paternity leave is not funded and this makes up a significant portion of the vacancy rates. Why has this not been addressed? The Government simply does not have a plan to deal with this. It has not dealt with the problem of professional progression within CDNTs and the staff are leaving to go to primary care or the private sector. There is a disparity between HSE and non-HSE workers who are working together and carrying out the exact same jobs. The Government needs to publish a costed multi-annual plan to deal with waiting lists and staffing problems in disability services without further delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> In response to a parliamentary question I submitted regarding the number of additional therapy courses being introduced for this academic year where the HSE has identified a significant skills shortage such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, I was informed that an additional 15 physiotherapy places were to be made available, nine at level 7 and six at level 6. There was no indication in response that any additional places were made available for speech and language therapy or occupational therapy even though the Minister in response said that "the matter of health workforce planning and ensuring an appropriate pipeline of qualified healthcare workers within Ireland is a major priority for my Department." Is that really true? Are 15 additional posts the extent of what the Government considers a priority? I am hoping the information in the parliamentary question is somehow incorrect.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> The Government urgently needs to address workforce challenges with a serious workforce planning group led by the Taoiseach, to include health and higher education. While I cautiously welcome the indication from the Tánaiste that there will be a new policy approach, it cannot be used to dilute the rights of people with disabilities in the Disability Act. We have already seen the Government try this approach and make the situation even worse. The Government must adopt a rights-based approach to disability services in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It needs to publish a costed multi-annual plan to deal with waiting lists and staffing problems in disability services. Crucially it needs to ratify the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_673">We have had several debates on disability services in this House in recent years and especially over the last 12 months. These have been particularly on the children's disability network teams but go across a whole range of areas impacting children and adults. We certainly have introduced a number of Private Members' motions and there has been very significant debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, visited many counties and spoke to parents of children with disabilities. I am sure she heard the same stories that we did of parents who simply cannot get access to services for their children. It is really frustrating for them when they see a review that was carried out, a ten-year plan that is not being resourced. There is no implementation plan and no annual budgeting. Based on the capacity review that was set up, the cost is between €600 million and €750 million over ten years. However, the recently announced budget contains just €29 million of new funding for measures across all the services for people with disabilities which is a drop in the ocean compared with what is needed. We proposed a package of measures costing €153 million because that is the scale of the investment which I believe is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Some 1,800 individuals are living in congregated settings and 1,300 individuals under 65 are inappropriately placed in nursing homes. There is no clarity on when they will be moved out. I do not see any multi-annual plan. Some 7,000 people are in need of personal assistance with no support for independent living in the coming years. This was also part of the capacity review but again I do not see any multi-annual plan. It certainly fails to give a break to parents and carers in need of respite services with at least 20,000 additional respite hours and 7,400 day-service places needed over the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> The capacity review was done to identify needs and it is up to politicians and a political system to provide the funding for it. I would imagine the Minister of State looked for more money. Ministers do that and there are tensions within governments. The Minister of State needs to fight her corner. We have met all the advocate groups in recent weeks. They have told us very clearly they are disappointed in the extreme. I am sure all the parents who are battling to get services for their children are equally disappointed. Organisations, including Independent Living Movement Ireland and many others, are concerned that even the figures in the capacity review are not accurate when demographic changes are considered. They would argue that there is even greater need in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> I finish by raising the issue of the children's disability network teams. I know we have raised this time and again. The Minister of State has come back to us and asked what solutions we have and we have talked about solutions. We need once and for all to put in place a workforce planning strategy that addresses the core problems in this sector. We know we need to train more graduates and obviously that needs to be done across the board in healthcare. We need at least double the number of graduate and undergraduate training places. We also need to deal with a range of retention and recruitment issues. Time and again we have raised this with the Minister of State. Deputy Tully and I visited a number of network teams that are providing these services. There are section 38 section and 39 workers who are on lower rates of pay and do not have pension entitlements doing exactly the same work in the same team as a HSE employee. How in God's name is that sustainable? How can it be right? That is causing some problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> We looked for a sponsorship programme to be rolled out. We looked for therapy assistant grade positions to be made available. We looked for an international recruitment campaign. I am pleased that some of these grades are now on the critical skills list which is important. However, not enough is being done. I am not confident that there is a plan in place. The bottom line is that the people who are failing are those children.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Almost a year ago, Deputy Tully arranged a briefing in the audiovisual room with parents of children with disabilities. As I have said to the Minister of State before, it was heartbreaking to hear their stories. I have travelled the length and breadth of the State and attended public meetings. Parents are sick and tired of hearing about plans, strategies and reviews. All they want are services for their children and some sense that we will get a grip on the waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The State was taken to court because it was taking shortcuts with assessments of need and they are now on hold. While that is an issue, the biggest issue is to have the capacity and the staff to provide services to those children, irrespective of whether they have an assessment. The short answer is that for far too many of those young people we do not. It is heartbreaking to look at a child or talk to the parent of a young adult where early intervention has passed them by. We know it will happen again, which is shameful.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">I commend my colleague Deputy Tully on all her work not only in introducing this motion but in general. She is our representative on disability matters and also sits on the Joint Committee on Autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> In my two and a half minutes, I want to raise the issue of day services in the south east, particularly in Carlow-Kilkenny. I was recently contacted by parents who have been given notice that their day service now needs to start charging for some additional activities. There has also been an increase in transport costs. I see both sides of this argument. I have also met with management in some of the day services, which are struggling. It is like the voluntary contributions in schools; they do not want to have to charge for it. The parents of people in a day service are unsure when this will end.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The reason I take the opportunity to raise it because a number of parents were hoping to meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. We had a very successful meeting, possibly two years ago, about another issue in the south east that got resolved. I take the opportunity to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, if she would be open to that. It would be a constructive meeting to try to find a resolution to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> Sometimes I am not sure what more we can say about the lack of services for children with additional needs, whether it is the case that they are waiting on an assessment or a therapy. I also wish to briefly mention housing as that part of it sometimes falls through the cracks. People with disabilities have difficulty getting housing. Recently, I met two people who must carry their severely disabled 15-year old son up the stairs and they cannot seem to get allocated a bungalow.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Another issue I wish to briefly raise relates to a woman who was recently told by the HSE to go to Argos to buy a particular stroller for her son who needs a wheelchair. That is not acceptable. I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise some of these issues. The clock is ticking, and I want to give my colleagues time. I commend the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">I also congratulate Deputy Tully on all her work in bringing this motion forward. I want to raise two issues. The first is an urgent matter regarding the lump-sum payments arising out of the budget. It is my understanding that those in receipt of the partial capacity benefit will not receive the lump sum of €500, which has been announced for carers, those with invalidity pensions and disability allowances. This is very unfair, given that the people in receipt of this benefit are in many cases, by definition, moderately, severely or profoundly restricted. It makes no sense given that people in receipt of carer's support grant or disability allowance are able to work and will get the lump sum, as will families on the working family payment, but it appears that those on partial capacity benefit will not be able to claim the working family payment. This is a very vulnerable cohort, and, according to contacts within the Department, they seem to be losing out. This matter must be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> The other issue I would like to raise is the case of Alexis O'Mahony from Killarney. I have raised it here previously. This is my third or fourth time raising it. Alexis O'Mahony is a six-year old girl who lives in Killarney. She has a number of conditions and injuries. She needs constant care from her family, which includes constant turning and daily washing to avoid bed sores. This takes a tremendous physical toll on her family. A ceiling hoist would be of great assistance to the family. They applied for the grant from the local authority. However, nothing has happened, other than the Department's fiddling. The Government's policy changed and while the structural works needed for the hoist are covered by the local authority, the equipment for the ceiling track hoist is not covered. It is a matter of dispute as to who exactly is responsible for the funding and providing the equipment between the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I do not care whose responsibility it is, but someone must sort this out as soon as possible. The budget has been given to those who need it the most, but it is not happening with Alexis O'Mahony. The family has been repeatedly in contact with the Department, yet no resolution is forthcoming. I have raised the matter four times. I ask the Minister to intervene and sort the matter out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mark Ward<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_687">I want to start by talking about the cost of disability. Enormous extra expenses are faced by people with disabilities that are not covered by social welfare payments. Not all people with disabilities are on social welfare. Many people with disabilities work. People with disabilities are often at a higher risk of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I can testify, as a person and a worker with a disability who has lived experience, that many of the barriers one faces as a person with a disability are really challenging. The marginal increases for disabled people introduced in budget 2022 were wiped out this year by inflation. Additional expenses for living with a disability are not recognised by the State, which means that people with disabilities are often caught in a poverty trap.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> The lack of public services for children with disabilities also pushes people into poverty. In my area in Dublin Mid-West, there are significant waiting lists for children trying to get occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology and dietetics. We heard from the Quarryvale Family Resource Centre at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which operates a food bank in my area. We were told about parents accessing the food bank because they are paying privately for services that the State should be providing for their children. That is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Budget 2023 failed to resource and fund disability support services. Sinn Féin outlined a funding strategy to meet the needs of people with disabilities in our alternative budget, not just for next year but right up to 2032. This would allow disability groups to plan ahead strategically and people with disabilities could feel assured of the services. We cannot put a price on that. Sinn Féin would have invested an additional €153 million in disability services compared with the Government's paltry €29 million. Early intervention is key. We have an unacceptable situation in Dublin Mid-West whereby there are not any public health nurses to carry out developmental checks on infants. We will see more children falling through the cracks if issues are not spotted earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> In the brief time remaining I also wish to mention the Clondalkin Autism Parents Support Network, which is campaigning and fighting for basic school supports for their children. These parents are exhausted from fighting a system that is betraying their children and preventing them reaching their full potential. They should not have to fight but fight they must. They must fight until there is a complete overhaul of the system and also of the current Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sorca Clarke<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">Along with my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening. I too congratulate and praise Deputy Tully on her tireless work in the area of disability services. The statistics and the lives behind the figures for disability services are truly stark. Some 17,000 children are waiting on initial contact with a children's disability network team. Some 2,500 are overdue for an assessment of needs. Accompanying that is an archaic IT system, which means none of us knows the true extent of the issue. When the parents, who are desperate, reach out, they are met with an endlessly ringing phone, one that is never answered. There is no engagement. There is not even any response to written correspondence. When the travel arrangements for adults with disabilities are simply no longer available, families and service users are left distraught.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Budget 2023 was the opportunity for the Government to prove that not only had it heard what those with disabilities and their supporters had said but that it had truly listened and taken it on board. That is a lost opportunity for which I fear those with disabilities will ultimately pay the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I will not go back over what my colleagues have said about the lack of investment, the failure to plan or the lack of multi-annual budgets, but I will make one ask of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, this evening. She previously engaged with a group called Lough Ree Access for All. It is a very good group and the Minister of State knows what it is capable of. It is a truly inspiring group. Deputy Kerrane and I visited it recently, along with others, and we saw the amazing work the group has done to ensure that those with disabilities have access to the waterway. The changing room is now open. However, I will ask the Minister of State to engage with the group again because Pobal has set the bar so high for one of its grant applications that it simply does not make sense. The group is also seeking additional funding in order to safely get wheelchair users onto the remarkable boat it has sourced. It is vital that this equipment is provided, as it opens up opportunities to people, many of whom have no day-to-day interaction with people outside of their family and carers. It is a unique opportunity. I urge the Minister of State to make contact with them, reach out to them and offer them support, as she has done previously. I give credit to her for that. The group is incredibly grateful for it, but it is in a very difficult position, in particular with the rising cost of energy and fuel.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneRabbitte" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Anne Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_695">I thank the Deputies for tabling this important motion this evening. I thank the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, for being present to receive it with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> The motion before the House tonight addresses many issues regarding people with disabilities. However, I want to be clear from the outset, as Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I am completely dedicated to improving the lives of people with disabilities in Ireland, and to strengthening vital specialist disability services, from the very young to the very old, regardless of location or disability, visible or invisible. I have had the privilege of being in this role for two years. I do not for a moment underestimate the challenges faced by people with disabilities in Ireland, or the pressures that our services can face. It is in recognition of these challenges that just two weeks ago the Government announced the largest ever budget allocation to specialist disability services of more than €2.4 billion. The increase in the disability budget for 2023 follows significant additional funding for disability services in 2021 and 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">It marks a real consolidation in the investment in the sector and is testament to the Government's commitment to boosting and sustaining funding to disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I will now share details of a combined package of €177 million in additional funding to specialist disability services for 2023. A total of €109 million is being provided to support existing levels of service, ELS, which takes into account demographics, changing need and pay awards, as well as some funding towards non-pay inflation factors, with additionalities for funding new developments including a progressing disability services, PDS, programme team for ChildVision, a new acute neurology unit, a community neurology unit, social farming and the Cappagh specialist children's team. Once-off funding is being provided for costs associated with activity earlier during Covid amounting to €39 million, of which €11.5 million will be spent specifically on assessments of needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> As part of budget 2023, an inflation support fund of €100 million will be made available to support community-based voluntary organisations, including those providing disability services, an essential pillar in the provision of health services that will receive €65 million. This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs. The fund will be administered by the HSE and the details of this will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> To respond to Deputy Funchion in regard to transport, there are 39 section 39 providers in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 5, where transport costs constitute a huge issue for it. They will receive a portion of their block grant, which they can dedicate directly to supporting transport. The cost is something in the region of €230,000 for the various organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Many of those in the disability sector will be aware the disability capacity review has identified a significant level of under-provision of residential care places, with changing demographics adding to the numbers requiring residential care. As of August, there were 8,192 residential places for people with a disability, with approximately 90 service providers nationwide. To the end of August 2022, 60 new emergency residential places had been developed together, with 17 new intensive support packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> The Government recognises how important respite can be for relieving pressure and improving quality of life for families. In 2020, the funding allocated amounted to approximately €70 million, representing around 3% of the total budget. In 2021, I secured €5 million and we built in an additional 10,400 respite nights. In 2022, in the three specialist centres, we have built in 4,032 nights, while for the nine remaining houses, there have been 9,408 nights.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The Government is committed to supporting people with disabilities to maximise their capacity to live independent lives. To that end, the HSE provides a range of assisted living services including personal assistant, PA, and home support services, with funding in place to enable the delivery of high-quality PA and home support services to circa 10,000 people with disabilities, including 1.7 million PA hours and more than 3.12 million home support hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> As was mentioned by other Deputies in regard to the children’s disability network teams, over recent years 475 new posts have been added, along with the 133 that will be added this year, to address the return of therapists to special schools. To respond to Deputy Cullinane, I reiterate that the comprehensive PDS national team development programme has been provided to the CDNTs and has cascaded to all team members. This programme was designed to support the establishment of the new CDNTs and to support the implementation of the new model of service, which will support staff retention. Options regarding the recruitment of staff such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, OTs, and physiotherapists include targeted national recruitment for the CDNTs, high-profile international campaigns, targeted international recruitment for the CDNTs with the possibility of a relocation allowance, a sponsorship programme, an apprenticeship programme for therapy grades, the employment of graduates as therapy assistants as they await their CORU registration and an expansion of therapy assistance in the system with the HSE supporting individuals to return to education to qualify as therapists. The HSE has approved an attractive and competitive relocation package for the international recruitment of all therapies. The relocation package includes allowances payable to candidates to meet the initial costs of relocating, such as accommodation and flight allowances for all EU and UK candidates and non-EU candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> It is important for anyone listening to this debate to understand what is happening with therapists going back into schools. The reassigning of existing HSE staff to fill one third of posts happened in September, while a further one third is to happen by the end of October. In parallel with the first two phases, a number of initiatives will be commenced immediately, including a high-profile international recruitment campaign, as I outlined. The implementation is being monitored, with regular communication between the relevant stakeholders at a local and national level. Regrettably, the Fórsa trade union, which represents personnel involved, has issued an instruction of non-co-operation to its members regarding the reinstatement process. In that regard, the union has advised its members not to co-operate with the reassignment of staff to provide on-site health and social care supports to special schools. This instruction has impacted significantly on the HSE's capacity to progress the phase as it intends. Representatives of the HSE met Fórsa on 23 September to discuss this matter, and during the meeting the Fórsa representatives raised a number of issues and concerns with regard to the programme and the impact it has having. What I do not understand is that last year, I was able to reinstate 65 therapists to special schools and Fórsa had no issue; now I am reinstating 133 and it has a huge issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, on 20 March 2018 and this marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities. The Government remains wholeheartedly committed to continually advancing the rights and obligations it has recognised and agreed to be bound by in ratifying the UNCRPD. My colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will be further in addressing this issue later in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> I believe I have addressed Deputy Funchion's questions. In regard to aids and appliances, which one of her party colleagues raised, if anybody is using an aid or appliance that is sitting on the resource allocation group, RAG, system, they should let me know. I should not know what a RAG system is, but it is where the aid or appliance has not been approved locally by the HSE. Deputy Cullinane will know what I am talking about. I say this to all my colleagues throughout the area. No child's aids or appliances should sit unapproved on a RAG system. If that is any Deputy's experience, I ask him or her to let me know. We just recently had the case of Eva in Cork and a car seat, which has now been approved. There was also the case of a child's bath. Those types of equipment should be approved. Let us be clear about this. These are aids and appliances needed by children and that support needs to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> I will take up the case of Alexis O'Mahony. In regard to Lough Ree Access for All, I was successful in funding the group €60,000 already but I will engage with it to ensure everyone will have the same access to leisure opportunities as the rest of us in being able to get into the water. I would be delighted to engage in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Not a month goes by in which I am not held to account in either House regarding the progress made, and not a day goes by in which I do not engage with all elements of the Opposition to ensure they are totally aware of where the funding is being spent and how it is being directed. I recognise the significant challenges, the stress and the strain and the frustration that parents and families are under but, as Minister of State within the Department, I am trying to be ambitious and think outside the box, looking at ChildVision, the neurology units and what we can do in Cappagh to ensure we have specialist teams to support families regardless of where they live.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I am sharing time with my party colleagues. One of the greatest challenges we face, as I am sure we would all agree, relates to the fact that children who need additional support are being neglected in the current system. Far too many of them are not getting the support they need when they need it and they are instead being passed from one waiting list to another. They wait for an assessment, for initial therapy and then for further therapy, and months and months pass by. It is those children and their parents who suffer. It is particularly heartbreaking for parents and we have all dealt with those who are affected. A child being left to wait on any list impacts on every part of their life, including their mental health, their well-being, their life at home and at school, their development at school, their education and their own friend groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The reconfiguration that has taken place in recent months has been really difficult for parents. I spoke to certain parents who were getting some therapy for their children. In County Roscommon, for example, they would have been getting it through the Brothers of Charity and now, since the reconfiguration, they are getting none at all. Just like anyone on a waiting list when it comes to health, the longer a person waits, the more he or she regresses and the greater impact it has on development, particularly when it is a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> As has been said this evening, vacancies remain in children's disability network teams across the State, including in counties Roscommon and Galway, meaning children will continue to wait. We know that across CHO 2, which includes counties Mayo, Roscommon and Galway, 1,675 children are waiting for initial contact from the disability network team. The majority of these children have been waiting between four and 12 months. As has been said, we have no data regarding the breakdown on the support these children are waiting for because the computer system in place is not fit for purpose. When we speak about the waiting lists for children with disabilities with regard to the new network teams, we must also remember that these are on top of huge waiting lists and long waiting times under primary care. To name a few, 715 children are waiting for psychology treatment in counties Roscommon and Galway, 507 are waiting for occupational therapy, 758 are waiting for assessment for physical therapy and 1,341 are waiting for an initial assessment for speech and language therapy. We have so much to do with regard to disability services. No-one is taking away from the work that is being done but we have a massive challenge to overcome with regard to children and their services.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">The Government continues to fail people with different abilities. The recent budget is the latest step along that road. The lack of respect shown for people seeking to access services or any kind of supports is very poor. I often say in this Chamber that some Deputies must have nobody belonging to them seeking to access services or get help for loved ones with different abilities because if they did, the system would have been fixed years ago. Instead, we have a regime of red tape and silly rules to make things more difficult for them and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The mother of a young chap came to my office last week. Her child has a rare genetic condition that requires around-the-clock care. It took months to transition the child from a buggy to a wheelchair due to the backlogs and bureaucracy. The child's condition has now evolved in the months since to include seizures, which means that the wheelchair is no longer ideal for this child. However, because the child is now over six years old, they have been told he cannot return to the buggy, which would obviously allow him to lie down, if necessary, when he has the seizures. Because of this rule in a book somewhere, the child is not receiving the right equipment. I have written to the Minister of State about this. I ask her now to commit to helping this child and his family. All they are looking for are fewer rigid rules and more of a caring attitude. This family has faced a constant battle since their child was born to get a diagnosis, assistance with his care, a school place and transport to that school, respite care and access to basic supports. I commend the family and thousands of others like them on the fight they endured to make the lives of their children better, which is all any of us want. I know the Minister of State is doing her best on that but it should not have to be this way. Can we please do something to help this family? Implementing the recommendations of the Disability Capacity Review to 2032 report would make a huge difference and show the families that we care. I commend Deputy Tully on all her hard work.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">One of the most prevailing issues regarding the provision of disability services is the extraordinarily long waiting lists for such services. In my constituency of Dublin North-West, a high number of children and young people with autism and other special needs and disabilities are on lengthy waiting lists for assessment and support services.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> I recently had a constituent in my clinic who was waiting to get a child assessed for disability. This person was told that the child will have to wait for another three years for assessment. Figures issued in August of this year also show that children are waiting for primary care psychology. CHO 9, which also includes my constituency of Dublin North-West, had a maximum wait of more than four years for such services. It is critical that children get the supports they need at an early age as this is the time that such supports will make the biggest difference for the child as he or she gets older</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> These long delays in assessment are not acceptable. They are frustrating for parents trying to access services. Parents are despairing and feel that they and their children are being neglected. Their despair is not helped by the fact that a huge number of staff positions remain unfilled. Many families also complain of a lack of clarity with regard to plans and timeframes for progressing disability services for children and the processes to access such services are often over-complex. Parents of children with disabilities must become advocates to secure the supports they need for their children in a system that is, at best, difficult to navigate. Many of these children have complex needs that require specialised and intensive supports. They are struggling to access them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which today launched a report on the participation of people with disabilities in political, cultural, community and public life. Ireland signed up to the United Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and it is time we implemented it. That requires real investment and a will to follow through on commitments. I hope the Minister of State will be able to see the shortfalls in the services that have been identified in this report. All the different advocates were there and I think it has been a very good exercise,</p>

          <p eId="para_719">In County Cork, 2,000 children are waiting for a first appointment with a CDNT. Children and adults with disabilities deserve better. Parents are being offered online courses and videos. These are not therapies nor are they a substitute for therapy. They can be important for parents when the therapies are given as a support, but not instead of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> CDNTs have a huge amount of staff shortages including nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, social workers and others. The shortage of professional staff is unbelievable. CDNTs are supposed to provide help and support for children with complex needs and their families. Children are struggling. I know the Minister of State knows this and I know she is trying. However, the problem is that we have had 11 years of underfunding and under-resourcing and now the Minister of State is trying to fix a decade of abandonment. It needs to be fixed, however. We have 1,584 children in County Cork waiting for more than a year. How can the Government think this is okay? How can it think this is acceptable?</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The Government talks about timely access. We hear phrases like "early intervention". However, if children do not get the early intervention, parents know their children are regressing and will not have the quality of life they could and should have because the State is failing them. I talk to parents who are heartbroken and who then get frustrated and angry. Why must parents fight for services for their children that every child should have access to? The Minister of State will be aware of Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS. I have heard parents tell stories of waiting years for services or supports. I listened to children speak at these rallies and protests about how they are being failed. Some parents and people are lucky enough to have the resources to go for these therapies privately. How heartbreaking it is if a parent cannot access these services because the State is failing his or her child and he or she does not have the money to get them. I implore the Minister of State. I know her heart is in the right place but we must deliver now.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">I thank Deputy Tully and Sinn Féin for bringing this motion forward this evening. I will probably jump around a bit based on the Minister of State's statement. One thing that leaped out for me, which I did not see early enough but I am glad to see now, is her ongoing negotiations with the Minister, Deputy Harris, about the training and long-term supply of staff for whatever grades are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">For a long time I have been asking that this should be one of the primary focuses of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, not just in disability services but across the health service in planning the training and delivery of all the staff and grades we need for the services we need. I could spend time saying it should have happened a year ago and all the rest, which I am doing, but I commend the fact that this is up and running. Hopefully that will start to bear real fruit and we can be communicated with on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> There are gaps in our knowledge as to where the recruitment and retention crisis is failing. We are hearing that workers in certain grades are departing our shores to go for higher paid jobs and we are hearing that they are moving out of the cities, including Dublin, to go down the country because they cannot afford to live in Dublin and there are varying degrees of truth in all of that. However, we do not know how many people we are training and then retaining in our services one, three, five or ten years later. That is vitally important because the CDNT issue is so big. The 28% figure we have for vacancies not filled feels like it is higher in respect of service delivery and in the lack of service delivery. In my experience, service users have been devolved from existing services - which may not have been amazing or all they needed - out to a community service that is non-existent. That is a reality and that is where the CDNT system is failing those families.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> I have had one family from the south of the country onto me who have a young boy with Down’s syndrome and who is non-verbal. They are looking for speech and language therapy and the child is on the cusp of having an autism diagnosis as well. To compound this, as he has a younger sibling who also has been diagnosed with autism, there are complex and multiple challenges in that family. The services that they are being offered are once-off, over the phone or online and then that is it. My concern is how is that being fed upward? Is it being fed upward in the system as if they have received the service and that family has had its box ticked? It probably has but we know they have not received a service and those parents are trying to hold down full-time jobs, run a household, pay for private care and be full-time activists on behalf of their children and that is just not good enough. That is the CDNT system failing. I have other similar examples, including in my constituency but we are talking about families with more than one child with complex needs that need the services and that are being let down, which is just not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Where is the action plan for the disability capacity review? The Minister of State looked at me there but we need to know where it is and when it will be delivered. The last time we debated this in the House was during another Private Members' motion from the Social Democrats on 6 July. We were hoping against hope that the action plan would be published before the recess. We then hoped that when we came back after the recess it would be published before the budget and it was not. We are into October now and things have gone unerringly quiet on that front. Will we see it before Christmas? Will we see it at all? Will we see the detail of it? That is what we need to be able to mark the Government's progress and to mark whether we will be able to tackle the need in the disability service. I have spoken about that at length before and I do not need to remake that case but we are 15 months on from the disability capacity review. The Government's disability capacity review was published and we still do not have the action plan for it. We have action plans for other things, including the climate action plan, and people and families with disabilities feel that in the overall scheme of things it is a modest thing to ask for an action plan for the disability capacity review.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> On the cost of living, while there were some one-off payments announced in the budget, the cost-of-living crisis that we have all been discussing for a year has been discussed as a new phenomenon in Ireland. There has been a permanent cost-of-living crisis for people with disabilities. Again, that is not just me or anyone else saying that; that is the independent cost of disability in Ireland report, which was published last year. It shows that on average there is an extra cost of €9,500 to €11,500 per year for people with disabilities. That extra cost goes on food, heat, transport and all the things we all need. This was proven before this cost-of-living crisis became a mainstream debate and before the war on Ukraine happened. This was already a chronic issue for people with disabilities at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> What that report highlights is that even in benign times, the cost-of-living crisis is real for people with disabilities. When it exists as it does now it becomes manifestly worse for people with disabilities. We are trying to manage our budgets to be able to afford a weekly shop for families or households that do not have complex nutritional needs, do not have to buy vitamins or medications, do not have extra transport needs in order to get to hospital or medical appointment or therapies if they have them and need not keep machinery or aids on 24-7 or for many hours during the day. The louder we talk about a cost-of-living crisis in the mainstream debate the more diminished the cost-of-living crisis for people with disabilities becomes because it gets pushed further down in the debate. It is always the Cinderella, not only of the health service, but of political debate. That is why I welcome this motion and the opportunity to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I have asked about the disability capacity plan. The Minister of State mentioned Fórsa in her contribution and what it has asked its members to do. That was not in the Minister of State's written statement or at least I could not see it. I will go back and check what was said but I would appreciate it if the Minister of State's office could circulate something on that so I could have a better understanding in order to be able to respond appropriately to it. As I was speaking I was trying to find reference to it in the copy of her speech and I could not find it. What the Minister of State was saying seemed serious and worthy of more investigation and study.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I will leave it at that. I have made my points clearly. The motion is strong and it is another motion on this issue. The Opposition is building on previous motions and the calls are consistent and clear. We become more and more disappointed as we reach Dáil recesses and budgets and we are not seeing what we need to see in the provision of services for people with disabilities.</p>

        <speech by="#HollyCairns" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_731">I want to start by thanking Deputy Tully for enabling this important discussion. Disabled people and their families only ever want what they are entitled to. In briefings by disabled persons' organisations, in meetings with distressed and frustrated parents and in all the reports from organisations, they say they just need proper services. They are not looking for anything exorbitant of for special treatment; they are just looking for what they deserve and are fighting for their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Disabled people have the right to live as independent a life as possible, to suitable housing, to accessible public transport and to employment. Children have the right to be seen by medical professionals and therapists in a timely manner and they have the right to education. These are all rights; the fundamental services people are entitled to. However, we all know that every day, these rights are breached. Obstacles to access work, delays in seeing a clinical therapist and inaccessible public transport are breaches. These breaches are so commonplace and everyday that they are not even noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> It is only after repeated failures and frustrations that individuals and families contact their public representatives and it is only egregious cases that make it into the newspapers. This is wrong on every level and people should not have to go these lengths. Disabled people and their families should not have to share intimate details to get services. Unfortunately the media has a particular role to play here as stories around disability services only make it to the headlines when someone is willing to, or is convinced, to tell their personal story. Recently, Catherine Gallagher shared her details nationally to retain and access supports for studying her PhD. She spoke at the Committee on Disability Matters about disabled people often not having the privilege of living with privacy, dignity and discretion. Until our systems are designed and operate off a rights-based approach, people like Catherine will continue to have to jump through hoops and go to the newspapers. The failure to provide people with services has knock-on effects impacting on: their quality of life; their potential throughout life; their family; and how society understands disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The key point underlying this motion is that disability services are a right. They are not optional services or some kind of charity; they are the basic support the State is obliged to provide to individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> The progressing disability services, PDS, programme is one of the key examples of this larger issue. It is currently a failure, with overwhelming evidence it is failing children and families, breaching their rights and not providing therapies when they are most needed and most effective. We are all aware of individual cases that represent the severe lack of services. Down Syndrome Ireland, AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland and others have produced comprehensive reports showing the overall situation, from glaring regional variations to no therapists for more than a year and a complete absence of any communication. Families Unite for Services and Support, FUSS, Ireland is doing incredible work highlighting how children and young adults with disabilities in Ireland face long waiting lists and, in many cases, a lack of supports. It holds regular protests and is active on social media, which it should not have to be. Each of its protests and meetings symbolises the failure of our current system.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> The lack of communication and accountability is a major concern. Family forums were supposed to be an important pillar of the PDS programme. As families wait for many of the forums to be established, they have formed their own networks and have tried to engage proactively with disability services management in community healthcare organisations, CHOs. They have had very little engagement. It is, in essence, impossible to meet with management in CHO 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Children's disability network teams are not fully staffed. This is a self-perpetuating issue as under-resourced teams lead to overstretched staff who feel they are not providing the care they want to and are being ethically compromised by the limited time they can give children. They then migrate to other countries or go into private practice just to be able to do the jobs they are supposed to do. Related to this is how student therapists are treated, with many receiving no remuneration for their internship or placement work. If we want to retain these professionals as graduates, they must be respected from day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Another group that demonstrates the desperate state of disability services is the more than 1,300 people aged under 65 forced into nursing homes because the State cannot support them in community settings. These are individuals with certain clinical needs who are capable, if supported, of living independently. Instead, they are being institutionalised in nursing homes, spending their days with people 30 or 40 years older and knowing that under current rates of decongregation, they will never leave those homes. The Ombudsman's report last year, entitled Wasted Lives: Time for a better future for younger people in nursing homes, charts the scale and impact of this issue. In his foreword, the then Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_739">Once you start unpicking the issues, it is clear that the systems are not in place to support people with disabilities. There is no system to ensure that every person has a key worker to enable them to access services. There is no consistent process for establishing people's needs and preferences. As a consequence, there is no way of identifying overall requirements, and no planning to address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Clinical evidence and findings from HIQA show life is better for people not living in larger settings. We need clear plans to move these 1,300-plus people out of nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Another vital service is personal assistance. Along with supported independent living, it is a major tool in helping individuals to realise their rights. There is a significant gap in demand versus supply in personal assistance services. This has knock-on effects as a lack of access is a barrier to independent living, education and employment. Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, describes how the process to apply for personal assistance can be daunting and complicated and many disabled people are told they cannot get the hours they need. Increased funding for personal assistance would be transformative for individuals and their families but it also would be an economic and social investment as it would enable whole cohorts of people to enter education and employment and live in their community. I recently attended the awards ceremony of the National Learning Network in Bantry, which demonstrated that providing the right supports, such as training, transport and work placements, results in incredible success. Last year, 92% of its students progressed either to part-time or full-time employment or further education and training. That is a remarkable rate that rivals those of our best universities.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, clearly outlines the importance of mechanisms for disabled people to shape policy that impacts on their lives. Our legislative and consultative processes are hostile to participation by the larger public, never mind individuals with additional needs or overstretched families. Improvements in services must be guided by the people directly affected. There is a glaring need for more investment in disabled people's organisations, DPOs, and advocacy services. We have a small network of DPOs that are helping to transform how we understand disability and policy. However, they have limited capacities and require proper funding streams from the Government that guarantee their operations and independence. The national advocacy service, NAS, for people with disabilities, funded through the citizens information network, is a vital service for helping to represent the rights and preferences of disabled people. It is vastly oversubscribed, however, which needs to be recognised by both the Government and the Citizens Information Board. We are obliged to provide individuals and groups with the tools to advocate for themselves and influence decision-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The motion rightly highlights the continued failure of the Government to publish the disability capacity review action plan. My motion on the cost of disability back in early July included a call for the publishing of that report. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, informed the Dáil at the time that she had signed off on the report and it was with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. She assured us we were "within weeks of having it published". Months later, after the budget, disabled people are still waiting for the action plan. The disability capacity review was published in July 2021. Now, in October 2022, there is still no sign of the action plan. How many more motions will it take for it to be published?</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_753">- increase the Carer's Support Grant (formerly Respite Care Grant) from €1,850 to €2,500".</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I am supposed to be sharing time with Deputy Barry but he is not in the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> I thank Deputy Tully for putting this motion before the House and giving us a chance to speak up yet again for people with disabilities. In the past few years, it has been the people living with disabilities who have been the most vocal and visible on these issues, much more so than politicians and others who claim to advocate for them. I watch with huge joy, interest and hope for the future as young people like Sophia Mulvany take control of their lives and advocate strongly for what needs to be done for people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> I refer to the press release issued last May by FUSS Ireland before a huge protest it held. It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_757">Every day, we watch our children regress. We watch them miss out on school places. They sit in pain in equipment that is too small or unsuitable. We watch them disappear from their communities and their families waiting for a lifeline that they are constantly told is coming.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Some people might think that is too stark but it is not. It certainly is not too stark for those who live with this reality. As FUSS Ireland noted, more than 100,000 children can languish on waiting lists across the country. Inclusion Ireland's report, Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, found 85% waited a year or more to access disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">This was echoed by Down Syndrome Ireland, in a report on the lack of services published in 2022, which found an average of 44% of children in all community healthcare organisations had no therapy of any kind in the previous 12 months. That figure rose to a staggering 95% when it came to psychological support services. I acknowledge that we were coming out of Covid in 2021 but, nevertheless, the statistics are staggering and will have a real impact on the lives of those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> The Sinn Féin motion is not just about children. Hopefully, all going well and with a bit more input from the State and improvement to these services, these children will live long enough to become adults and enjoy an independent life. That is why, in its motion, Sinn Féin has rightly tried to address how the budget has failed to resource support services to meet not just the current needs of children, but also the current and future needs of adults. I think a lot might go under the radar here. My local community care centre in Cherry Orchard, which is a fine centre that is well-resourced, gets referrals from the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. For example, one man that I am representing was referred for an electric wheelchair to be made available and the centre was to look after it. He was told last May that he would be waiting at least until next May to access that wheelchair because of a lack of staff. There is a serious lack of staffing across these services. It impacts not just children, but also adults who are trying to navigate life as they do their best to live with what can be terrible injuries and disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I note the Minister of State spoke about the day services that are a vital support for adults to help them participate in life in their communities. I have been in touch with the Minister of State about a particular case, and the situation has not changed. I refer to the case of a severely autistic young man, who needs support to be able to travel to a very good day centre that he attends. He gets no support from the State because he is over 18. He is unable to navigate public transport because of his epilepsy and the severity of his autism, so his mam, who is a fully trained nurse and a special needs assistant, cannot work because she drives him to access the services. She is isolated. She wants to participate fully in society, and we need her. We are short of workers like her, but she cannot work because the State will not provide any support - not a penny - to transport her son to the training services he needs daily. That is one example. What that tells me is that our services are too structured. When I tried to get to the bottom of the issue it was sent from the Department of Transport to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Health. It went all over the houses before someone finally came back and said "No can do". Why are we saying that to people, when it is not rocket science to give them a small bit of support to help them live a decent, full life and to use their talents in the health and education sectors where we need them?</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> I want to briefly talk about the optional protocol to the UNCRPD. I must ask why the UN made this protocol optional in the first place. However, it is optional. When UN representatives speak to it, as Mr. Markus Schefer did at a the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters held to discuss the rights of persons with disabilities in May 2021, they are quite hard on countries that have not signed up to the optional protocol. Mr. Schefer said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_763">The optional protocol and the convention together are one whole. That is why the [UN] committee continuously urges and recommends member states to ratify the optional protocol... It is important that, even from the international level, we give people who think their rights have been violated under the convention a recourse outside of their country...</p>
          <p eId="para_764">According to Mr. Schefer, not ratifying the protocol has "legal and political" impacts for those countries that take that decision. He stated: "If you do not ratify the optional protocol, you will leave out the Judiciary and, as in all areas of law, if you leave out the Judiciary something is lacking and implementation will suffer." He went on to talk about the symbolic consequence of not ratifying the protocol, which "tells the world community" that we, in this country, are "not comfortable enough" with what we are doing "to have an external body in a court-like procedure examine whether ... internal actions, as they transform to individuals, are in conformity with the CRPD." There is a problem here. I am aware that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is going to address the optional protocol later on. The UN should never have made the protocol optional, but now that it is optional, it is a very bad optic for Ireland in front of the world community, never mind the citizens of its own country, that it is failing on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Lastly, I will speak about the People Before Profit-Solidarity amendment to the motion. We have tabled the amendment because the first paragraph of the Sinn Féin motion, which, as I said, we strongly welcome, states that "Budget 2023 has failed to resource and fund disability support services and infrastructure that the Government itself has identified as essential to meet current and future unmet need for children and adults". We have put in this amendment to try to address that. Most of us have only been facing the cost-of-living crisis recently, whereas people with disabilities have been facing it for years. We want to add to the motion the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_766">— people with disabilities have faced a cost-of-living crisis for decades, and the 2021 Central Statistics Office Survey on Income and Living Conditions data shows increases in disability poverty across all indicators, at a time when the national averages decreased; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_767">— people with disabilities face poverty rates three to five times higher than the national average, and the at-risk of poverty rate for those not at work due to a long-standing health condition (disability) for 2021 was 39.1 per cent;</p>
          <p eId="para_768">We also call on the Minister for Health to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_769">— increase the Disability Allowance, the Blind Pension and the Invalidity Pension to €350 per week;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_770">— increase the Domiciliary Care Allowance to €350 per month; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_771">— increase the Carer's Support Grant (formerly Respite Care Grant) from €1,850 to €2,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> This is not about point-scoring; it is to point out that there are realities of poverty in this country. There are cost-of-living struggles that we all recognise, but people with disabilities face them to a much greater extent. We need to address that. We recognised it during the Covid lockdowns, when everyone was put on a payment of €350 a week. Now, all of a sudden, how come they can live on much less, particularly when they have to meet the challenges of paying more for transport, clothing, supports and care? That cannot be ignored.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCanney" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_773">I thank Deputy Tully for tabling this motion. It is important to state that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters has worked hard on many issues over the last two and a half years. Hopefully, we will bring forward some supports for people with disabilities, in conjunction with the Government, which is what it is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> When I meet parents in my constituency who have been told that their child has a disability, they end up trying to cope with that fact first of all, and then they try to come to terms with how they are going to get help for their child. One of the key elements that always seems to be missing is that they do not know where to start or how to progress from one place to another. There is no key worker assigned to them and no plan is set out detailing where the services are. There are gaps in the services and parents are left in a fog a lot of the time, when they are also trying to cope with the fact that they have a child with a disability. This can wear families down because they are fighting every inch of the way to try to get something which is a right for their child who has a disability. People often tell me they cannot access speech and language therapists. I do not know what has gone wrong there, but there is a huge void in that particular service.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> The other issue I worry about, when we talk about services, is that we are relying on section 39 organisations, such as Ability West, to provide them. We also rely heavily on the Irish Wheelchair Association. Yet we do not pay the people working in these section 39 organisations the same as we pay people working for the HSE. If we are going to provide equal opportunities and supports for people with disabilities, we need to ensure the people who are trying to help them are also paid accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Another issue I often come across is the fact there are young people in nursing homes long term because there is no other place to put them. It is an indictment of our society that we continue to allow that to happen in 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> Another issues that comes up, as the Minister and the Minister of State know, is that we have a broken transport support service for people with disabilities. The criteria for primary medical certificates are unfit for purpose. The members of the appeal board have resigned and, a year later, we are still talking about considering how to put a new appeal board in place. That is another matter about which we should hang our heads in shame. It is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> The Indecon report that was conducted and published in 2021 was based on living costs in 2019. It set out that a person living with a disability had additional costs that must be met by the State. There was a glimmer of recognition of those additional costs in this year's budget, apart from the cost-of-living agenda, and €500 was allocated for people with disabilities. However, that is a once-off payment. We must start by making that an annual payment and increasing it incrementally until we get to a level at which people are being supported properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> In the past three months, I have met a good number of parents who have struggled to get school transport for their children with disabilities. I know of one school where four children were left without a service for three weeks because of the mayhem around school services. The situation has been rectified in the past week but it has caused a considerable amount of stress to parents. It is stress they do not need and should not have. It is stress that should never have been there. One thing we can learn from what happened with the school transport service is that before we come up with a great public relations stunt in the future, we must ensure it can work. We must think it through before we announce it.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Many reports have been done, but at the end of the day, we must ensure we deal with people who have disabilities in a way that is fair and reasonable. We must give them every chance to live as normal a life as possible. We have many things to do yet. A parent of an autistic boy said that instead of assessing a child as having a disability, we should look at the child and say he or she has different abilities. If we think like that, we will be much better off.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_781">Many constituents who come to my office raise serious issues about their children who may be autistic or have a disability and need assistance. In fairness, the Government has done a good enough job, especially in introducing investment in special needs education in schools. I welcome the provision for the employment of additional special education teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, with the number of SNAs to go above 20,000 for the first time. It will definitely help families.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> However, I would like to address the inconsistency that exists throughout the State in respect of both the availability and type of services that are accessible to disabled children and adults. I must highlight that there are significant service delays in this area, especially in therapeutic intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Families of children with a dual diagnosis of autism and a moderate learning disability are in crisis in Louth and east Meath. I am aware of 15 families who have adolescent children with autism and a moderate learning disability who urgently require a psychiatric review but have been told by the HSE the service is unavailable as there are no psychiatrists on the HSE team. In addition to no psychiatrists being available, the only paediatrician available in Louth and east Meath is Dr. Maeve McCormack. Dr. McCormack only deals with children who are 16 years old or younger and there is currently a four- to five-month waiting list. Child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, will not see teenagers who have a dual diagnosis, and these adolescent children cannot be seen by the mental health team until they are 18 years old.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> A common trait for children with autism who are transitioning into adolescence is high anxiety levels and obsessive-compulsive disorder, OCD, behaviours. As many of these adolescents are non-verbal, they display their anxiety and OCD through self-injurious behaviour, including hitting themselves with force, property destruction, poor sleep patterns and assaulting others. Many of these families live in constant fear of attack from their adolescent child. They live in houses that have been significantly damaged by their adolescent child. I know of one situation where an adolescent child has flooded the house by pulling the radiators off the walls and architrave from around doors. The same family have no door on their bathroom due to this destruction. In addition, many of these adolescent children have younger siblings who are also in danger of being hurt. This situation cannot continue any longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> There are not enough home and respite services. In fact, respite services nearly ground to a halt during the pandemic. The same people are being affected repeatedly, and we wonder why people are struggling with their mental health. We must do everything we can to support them and their carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> A constituent recently visited in my office in Louth to complain that, in all of Dundalk, only one taxi is kitted out for wheelchair access. Are our disabled constituents to stay at home? Transport solutions and mobility supports for those with a disability must be targeted immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Grants of a maximum of €30,000 are available to assist people with a disability in carrying out necessary work to make a house more suitable for their needs, but there is not enough money to go around for all the applicants. I welcome these schemes but people with disabilities are vulnerable and we need to ensure this work is carried out as quickly as possible, especially coming into the winter. The criteria for these schemes need to be reassessed with a view to getting it done quicker. The grant is means tested and an assessment needs to be carried out by an occupational therapist. The issue is value for money, but trying to get an occupational therapist to examine many of these houses in my local authority in County Louth is nearly impossible, highlighting again the shortage in accessible intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> There are some cases in my constituency where people have acquired injuries and are now confined to a wheelchair. They are trying to adapt their homes to make them fit for independent living, and €30,000 will not cut the mustard in that situation. The number of people over the age of 65 is expected to reach 1.4 million by 2040. These grants are going to be increasingly important for the ageing population but also for families and carers of those with disabilities. We need to keep the pressure off the hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> This upper limit on the housing adaptation grant has remained the same for 13 years. It is important to say the upper limit certainly does not reflect the increases in the costs. The Government must allocate additional resources to local authorities to manage these schemes, to provide the investment required for local authority housing stock and to increase the budget allocation to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The Government should also ensure the grant scheme can meet the demand and reflect the increase in construction costs. More must be done to ensure grants are linked to the costs of the specific works as a percentage of costs and to allow discretion for people with disabilities to ensure the grants meet the individual needs of the disabled person to live independently.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The odds are stacked against those with a disability and our ageing population. The Government needs to enable local authorities to meet the costs involved, address inflation and ensure measures can be provided in a timely manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">The shortage of respite services for children and adults with disabilities in west Cork is having an impact on carers who have had no break in recent years since the onset of the pandemic. Carers go through hell a lot of the time. The budget has let carers down. In what world should it be acceptable that someone who works and cares for another person should be means tested? After all, these people are doing a job. Surely anyone who does a job should get paid for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Families are forced to watch key milestones in their children's development pass without appropriate interventions due to waiting lists. There is a lack of supports in the most distressing cases, including for children and young people moving into full-time care and on an unplanned basis. Older family members are trapped in unsustainable caring roles in the community due to the lack of investment in planned supports. Many parents are forced to provide significant support into their 70s, 80s and beyond, with no visibility or security in planning for the future of their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> In west Cork, there is a shortage of long-term residential care, especially for adults with disabilities but also in some cases for children. There are long waiting lists for children needing autism spectrum disorder, ASD, psychological services. Parents of children who have finally got into special needs schools and have finally been given funding for transport are now being told the Department cannot provide the services to take the children to school. The Department is asking the parents to take their children to school and will pay them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> Ireland's disability service providers are not fully funded for the services they provide. They were not even funded for the full cost of the reversal of the pay cuts imposed under the financial emergency measures in the public interest. Those same organisations are not funded for the cost of meeting HIQA standards. They are being hit by massive increases in insurance costs. Some service providers have had to cut services or lay people off. Others have had to decide not to go ahead with new much-needed services. This means people with disabilities are forced to wait longer for basic needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Most of these same charitable organisations are struggling to retain staff because they cannot compete with what the HSE pays its staff to do the same work. All these organisations are funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 and this is at the heart of the challenge they are meeting each day. It means that even though these charities are providing the same services as the HSE, they are not funded on a level of parity.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">The lack of access to basic services for children with a disability is shameful and inexcusable. I am particularly struck by a reference to the employment vacancy rate across the children's disability network teams, which now stands at more than 28%, as well as the fact there are more than 17,000 children waiting for initial contact with a children's disability network team and 2,500 children whose assessments of need are already overdue. HSE services that deliver high levels of complex care to children and young adults with a disability in Laois-Offaly are experiencing a significant staff vacancy crisis. In a reply I received from the HSE, it was pointed out that the children's disability network team at the Riverside Centre in Tullamore has four full-time vacancies, while the children's disability network team serving Edenderry and Mountmellick has seven full-time staff vacancies. The highest level, however, was found to be in the Spraoi Centre on St. Fintan's campus in Portlaoise.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> Many parents with children who require rapid disability interventions are in effect witnessing a collapse in services. In Laois-Offaly, this is on top of a crisis we have in respect of access to speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. It is simply appalling. We need urgent action in Laois-Offaly, which is one of the worst-affected regions in the State. The HSE has advised that there is a prioritisation and caseload management system in place that includes assessment and intervention pathways but my experience, and certainly the experience of the families I hear from in my constituency offices every day, is that this is not translating into practice. It shows that this system is not working. We need a fit-for-purpose system. That is why it is vital that we have a new primary care centre in Birr and that it becomes operational with the various therapies to ensure community access for all people with a disability, particularly children, where it is vital they are assessed in time and prevention measures put in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">I, too, thank Sinn Féin for tabling this motion. I will say my few words on it. Carers have been abandoned, especially during the Covid pandemic but also since then. They expected something meaningful this year in that they would be linked to other extra payments. They did not get that linkage. They got their once-off payment but that will not bring them very far. The Indecon report said enough. It stated that people with disabilities, as we all know and did not need an Indecon report to tell us, have many extra costs. That should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I do not know how the Minister can stand over this situation. I do not know how he can stand over an apartheid system within the HSE where section 39 workers are regarded as a different type of worker who can be treated any which way, when there is such money flowing around the HSE. When we have a person with a disability, that individual's capability, ability and what he or she is able to do should be looked at. A number of managers and assessors will come to meet them at significant cost, but a lot of it is pen-pushing. The caring places are so good, such as Scoil Aonghusa and Scoil Chormaic in Cashel. I salute the many national schools and secondary schools that have special rooms for children with autism and everything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> The CAMHS leave an awful lot to be desired. It is simply outrageous. I passed the Minister a letter this morning, through the usher, from Michael in Clonmel, whose 29-year-old daughter has profound disabilities, regarding the anguish he is going through and the caring he, his wife and their family are giving. There is no joined-up thinking within the services. His other daughter, Jenny, wants to get a housing transfer in order to be quite near him and to have a house in which she can accept and look after her sibling. Her present house has huge steps and is inaccessible. There must be joined-up thinking between the county council housing authority and families like this, who are saving the State an absolute fortune by keeping their loved one out of hospital. At 29 years of age, she is one of the oldest people living with the disability she has had since birth. I salute that family. I ask the Minister to act on it and try to get a sibling transferred to be near and to be able to help her father and mother who are getting old. It can be imagined that since their daughter with disabilities is 29, her father and mother are pushing on in years and have given work and dedication. There are many families like them throughout Tipperary and the country that save the HSE millions and are not treated with the respect they should be, let alone what the patient receives.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">I thank Deputy Tully for tabling this very important motion. Since I was elected in 2016, I believe that one cohort of people has been totally and utterly neglected; namely, elderly parents who are now in their 70s and 80s. They would be doing good enough to look after themselves without needing home helps and carers to do so, but they are also trying to mind older children who cannot mind themselves. These are strong boys and girls whose parents are not physically able to manage them anymore because they have to be lifted and may have to be restrained, etc. They are burdened with this and the biggest worry they have, when they go to their grave, is who will look after their son or daughter who is not well or has never been well since birth. These parents have gone through so much that you would think that when they reach 70 years of age the State and the HSE, which gets so much money to provide help to everyone, would look after them.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> St. Mary of the Angels is a wonderful facility for these kinds of people. This place is being closed by stealth because it is deemed to be a congregated setting that the health service wants to close down. I will say to the Minister that there is a place for facilities like St. Mary of the Angels, where there are all types of services, including a swimming pool, that can manage a number of people. Some 70 or 80 people were looked after there for years. Now, when someone dies, that bed is closed down. That is wrong because this place was donated to the health service by the Doyle family. It includes a significant amount of land where all kinds could be built on it, instead of trying to close it. I will give one example. One elderly resident in St. Mary of the Angels, who is not able to look after herself, has a mother who is alone. That resident is now being told that she will have to leave and go to one of the most northern counties in the Twenty-six Counties, not 10 miles away from the Border.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I thank Deputy Tully for tabling this motion. I understand she is deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which made a pre-budget submission. I will draw all our attention to that because in its short introduction the committee calls for - this is a cross-party committee with everybody represented - the urgent ratification of the optional protocol as Ireland is one of the last countries to do so. We are an outlier. The Government likes to use the word "outlier" in relation to many things and we are clearly an outlier. This cross-party committee's submission goes on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_807">... the delay in ratifying the OP [optional protocol] represents an instance of structural violence where the lack of implementation of a complaint's mechanism and subsequent accountability, harms people with disabilities by preventing them from meeting their basic rights under the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">This is a cross-party submission and includes 68 recommendations. It is about aligning the Government's programme with our obligations under that convention. </p>
          <p eId="para_809"> I call for the immediate publication of the disability action plan, as does this motion. I looked to see whether it had been published and I found another document. I am swimming in documentation and yet only have a small selection of what has been published on transforming the lives of people with disabilities. We are still waiting for that transformation but what has been transformed is language itself. We are no longer talking about the urgency of the provision of services but about gradually progressing. We are not talking about provision but about progression. We have certainly had a transformation but not in respect of services. </p>
          <p eId="para_810"> There is then insult upon insult. We have a report on the public consultation on the disability action plan. Can the Minister imagine more public consultation? This report mentions "a wide range of priorities" and "the need to root disability support services in the philosophy and rights set out in the" UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which we keep failing to do. In my few minutes, I will just go back through report after report. I will go back ten years. Back in 2012, we had a report entitled Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland. In 2014 we had the Transforming Lives programme, which is beautiful wording. This was described as "a national collaborative effort to build better services for people with disabilities". In the interest of not boring the Minister, I will skip a few and move to 2018 and a report on the future needs for disability services. In 2021, we had the Indecon review, which was absolutely damning in its findings, was it not? It was a disability capacity review. In the few minutes available, I will not go into everything but it states that the Health Service Executive "estimates there may be 600 people with no day service who need one" and that there is also "unmet need for those getting partial day services, which is estimated would be equivalent to an extra 600 full-time day places". There has been no action on that. It is another report. </p>
          <p eId="para_811"> To put this in context, people with a disability are more than twice as likely to experience poverty and deprivation, as has been said by everybody. One tires of saying this so I cannot imagine what it is like for people with disabilities who have been up in that Gallery listening to us talking about it. The Minister talked about us signing and ratifying the protocol. I will tell him how long that took. We signed it in 2007 but it took us to 2018 to ratify it. Unless the Minister is going to tell us tonight, God knows when we are going to sign the optional protocol so that it means something. In the meantime, we have failed to bring in a cost-of-living payment. Of course, I recognise there were good things in the budget including once-off payments but it gets to the point where that is insulting because it goes against the very core of what people are asking for. </p>
          <p eId="para_812"> There is a lot more I would like to say but I will finish, in my last 40 seconds, by mentioning someone who happens to be a neighbour of mine but who is also an author who has won many awards, Christian O'Reilly, author of <i>No Magic Pill</i>. At the centre of this play are people with disabilities. They are the main actors and actresses. They play to full houses and standing ovations in the Black Box Theatre in Galway and in the Civic Theatre in Tallaght. The play should be in the Abbey Theatre, our national theatre, because it puts people with disabilities exactly where they want to be. I recommend the play, <i>No Magic Pill</i>, in which people with disabilities are treated with respect and dignity. We should design our buildings to universal design standards.</p>

          <p eId="para_813">I am very happy to support this motion from Sinn Féin. It forensically looks at some of the major gaps in our system of supports for people with disabilities and it asks some of the hard questions. In many ways, the context is set by the failure to publish the capacity review action plan. It is already badly delayed. I listened to some of this debate in my office but I did not hear whether the Minister of State gave a commitment as to when this review will be published. If he did not, perhaps the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, might be able to say something about it afterwards. Many might ask what good a plan is and say that we need action now. In a way, both of those are right. We do need action now but that action must be underpinned, informed and directed by the recommendations in the capacity review action plan. As Inclusion Ireland said in its pre-budget submission, there needs to be a proper plan in place for disabled people's lives because only when there is can we move from crisis to confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The Minister of State spoke about the largest ever budgetary spend on disability. I have no doubt she and her colleagues played a significant role in ensuring that budget but surely any level of spending must be placed within a framework of action. I know her real commitment and her work. Crucially, I know individual needs and stories matter to her. In my view, empathy matters greatly in her work. However, the figures do not lie. More than 17,000 children are waiting for initial contact with the children's disability network teams. How is the Minister of State going to bring down those numbers when there is a 28% vacancy rate among posts in the network? Where is the workforce planning right now? Is there a high-level cross-departmental group addressing this issue? Are the colleges and technological universities on board? As we speak, can anybody tell me whether the intake of speech and language therapists has significantly increased this year or if there are 20% more health and social care professionals in our education system? Has the number of occupational therapists in training increased significantly? Unless this is happening now, that figure of 17,000 children will not fall. It certainly will not fall at the pace needed. What measures are being taken to retain staff or to attract staff from elsewhere? Are specific programmes under way to do this? If there are not, there will be another debate this time next year and we will be trotting out the same figures or similar. I know the Minister of State inherited an extremely difficult situation but none of us want to be here again next year or the year after and, unless we know that these plans are now in place, we know that is where will find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> I spoke earlier about the rights-based approach. In that context, I want to ask the Minister of State about the provision of personal assistance packages so that people with a disability can live independent lives. We know that is not possible for most people who have a disability unless they have personal assistance. It gives them dignity and a bit of choice as to how and where they live their lives and whether to go to work or social occasions. That is the only way to ensure an inclusive and accessible way of living for people with disabilities. However, that has to be supported financially. I may be wrong but I believe there are approximately 17,000 people who need personal assistance right now. Whatever the number is, can the Minister of State tell me it will decrease significantly at the end of this year?</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I will echo the words of my colleague, Deputy Connolly, and ask for the ratification of the optional protocol to the UNCRPD. How soon can we expect that? The Minister and I know that this underpins what is in the UNCRPD. It gives confidence to people with a disability and tells them we are taking responsibility and that they can vindicate their rights. We all know that really matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">On behalf of the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I thank all of the Deputies across the House for their contributions to this evening's debate. I also wish to acknowledge the points that have been raised about the significant and daily challenges faced by people with disabilities, their families and disability services. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, spoke about the significant funding provided by the Government for specialist disability services since 2020. As we know, budget 2023 had as its primary focus the urgent need to address the cost-of-living challenges currently facing the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">It is important to note that the overall increase in specialist disability funding compares favourably to previous years. There is an allocation of €177 million in additional funding for the delivery of disability services in 2023. That reflects the Government's commitment to strengthening the funding provided for the disability sector. We made a commitment to work to improve the lives of persons with disabilities in the programme for Government. The increased funding in budget 2023 will give people with disabilities greater choice, independence and control to live their lives and to participate in a meaningful way within their local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> I am pleased that section 39 organisations in disability services, as well as nursing homes, hospices and other section 39 organisations, will be eligible to receive once-off additional support from within the overall health sector fund. The once-off additional fund of €100 million has been allocated by the Government in budget 2023 to support section 39 organisations that provide essential health services in the context of the significant challenges they are facing currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> The additional year-on-year funding for disability services under this Government reflects a commitment to strengthening the funding provided for the disability sector and working to act to address the shortfalls identified in the disability capacity review. In July 2021, I was delighted to publish, alongside the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the disability capacity review to 2032. This report outlines how levels of service provision will have to increase to meet growing demand into the future, and the necessity of meeting levels of unmet demand. This reflects our obligations under the UNCRPD for progressive implementation of social, cultural and economic rights. This report contains invaluable data, which will allow us to plan to increase capacity in our services and ensure we meet the needs of those requiring specialist disability supports and services now and into the future. I was proud to have the report published as doing so shines a light on the level of need for disability services, which we as a country have a duty to address. I am totally committed to working towards the recommendations of the capacity review.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> A working group was set up to develop an action plan for disability services, taking a cross-government approach, to drive the process of implementing the review's recommendations. The cross-government approach to this work is central. Ensuring appropriate supports and services for our citizens with disabilities is not simply a health matter but one that reaches across all of the Government and will ensure the totality of each individual with a disability is fully taken into account. The disability capacity review set out an estimate of future service requirements to 2032 and it is intended to address the capacity deficits in a phased approach over this period. The forthcoming disability services action plan will be an implementation plan for the first phase of this and is currently being finalised for approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> The proposed transfer of specialist disability services functions from the Department of Health to my Department has been a complex process involving primary legislation, the development of administrative arrangements and a financial governance model. Officials in the Department of Health and my officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have been working intensively to give effect to the transfer of responsibility for specialist disability services to my Department. This has been a complex process involving significant moving parts. I understand the frustration about the delay but we are dealing with a range and scale in the transfer of policy for the oversight of part of the HSE’s work. It is important that this be done right and that we have full accountability around those funding mechanisms to have accountability for the delivery of services. </p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The Government is committed to ensuring that the rights of people with disabilities are upheld and safeguarded and to ensuring they are supported to live the lives they want to and are provided equal opportunities to do so across the State. Ireland ratified the UNCRPD on 20 March 2018. This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the convention in 2007. Ireland submitted its first state report under the UNCRPD in November 2021 and we had expected to engage with the UN committee this year in reviewing our implementation of the convention since 2018. However, due to delays at UN level, we understand that Ireland's appearance before the committee may now be delayed for some time. In light of that delay, both the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I have indicated that we are open to the earlier ratification of the optional protocol. Earlier ratification of the optional protocol is contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations under it. This is reflective of the State's long-standing approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> As part of the development of a UNCRPD implementation plan, the requirements for ratification of the optional protocol are being scoped out and considered. My Department has engaged with its internal legal advisers, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Foreign Affairs in examining the requirements for ratification. One of those key points is the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Its implementation will being us into full compliance on a range of UNCRPD measures. In order for that to happen, I am currently bringing legislation through both Houses. The Assisted Decision-making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 has cleared the Dáil and is going through the Seanad at the moment. We recently finished Committee Stage and I look forward to completing Report Stage and bringing it back to the Dáil to approve the Seanad amendments in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> A key commitment in the preamble of the UNCRPD commits state parties to recognise "the need to promote and protect the human rights of all persons with disabilities, including those who require more intensive support". Furthermore, this commitment is made through specific legislation, such as the Disability Act 2005, and through national disability policy frameworks of the national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities. Any review of the Disability Act and the development and review of policy will only be pursued with a view to ensuring the ongoing relevance of material on the Statute Book and in full cognisance of the constitutional and legislative rights of people with disabilities in Ireland, and of those rights and commitments set out in international law. The Government remains wholeheartedly committed to continually advancing the rights and obligations to which it has recognised and agreed to be bound by in ratifying the UNCRPD.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> Many Deputies have voiced criticism of progressing disability services and have highlighted the significant gaps in the delivery of therapies for children. The Minister of State and myself are acutely aware of that, both from our roles as Ministers and as constituency Deputies. I recognise that many parents have lost confidence in this policy. That is why our Departments are working with the HSE to bring forward a clear roadmap for how we can get more therapists working on the front line in the CDNTs, train more therapists every year, and get the voices of parents into this system through operational and effective parental forums. We look forward to bringing forward this document soon to begin that process of trying to rebuild confidence in progressing disability services. </p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I again thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate. I reiterate this Government's commitment to improving the lives of persons with disabilities. Deputies have raised real issues where the State must do better in meeting the rights of people with disabilities. The increased investment in budget 2023 allows us to do more but myself and the Minister of State are both acutely aware, as is the Government as a whole, of the need to do more.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_828">I commend Deputy Tully on bringing this motion forward. It is with a heavy heart that I have taken the opportunity to address the House on the motion. I will focus specifically on CDNTs and multidisciplinary teams, specifically in the area of autism and the eating disorder called avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, ARFID. This relates to a young boy called Riain in my town of Cashel, County Tipperary. People with autism spectrum conditions are much more likely to develop ARFID. As such, his anxiety towards food is having huge consequences on his health. He has lost weight to such an extent that his health is in severe decline, yet his family are unable to receive the treatment he needs. He ended up in South Tipperary General Hospital, which has been a godsend to the family. He was released with a feeding tube and was on compact protein administered by a food pump.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">He has seen community dieticians over the years and attended weight checks, and various ways have been tried to encourage him to eat. Unfortunately, none has had any luck. In 2019, CAMHS diagnosed him as having ARFID. In early 2020, he became gravely ill and the feeding tube was inserted again. He was seen by CAMHS, which again confirmed that it was ARFID. It could not offer a service as it had no psychiatrist trained in the area of eating disorders yet it wanted to administer a drug for anxiety.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> The family then turned to Éist Linn in Cork, which despite initially agreeing to take him on, subsequently refused him on the basis that it would be able to treat anorexia nervosa but because the linked condition of ASD is neither classed as a mental illness or a psychological disorder, ARFID must be managed differently and, therefore, does not fall under the remit of CAMHS. It also refused him on the basis that he is outside of its catchment area, which is incorrect. Instead, it threw the ball back into the court of the CDNT teams, which have already been shown to be unable to deal with it. Indeed, a recent letter to the local CDNT team in September from the medical social worker has gone unanswered. It will not take the lead. It is a vicious circle. CAMHS says the CDNT should deal with the case yet the CDNT does not have the experience to deal with ARFID. The boy's parents do not know where to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I have written to the Department of Health on this matter with little assistance forthcoming and that is why I am addressing the Minister regarding this matter today. The boy's parents are at their wits' end. If meaningful action to treat ARFID in this young boy is not taken soon, the family will have no choice but to go down a legal avenue. I appeal to the Minister here today to take this issue on board immediately, make contact with the family, whose name and address I have, and assist them in navigating the system to secure life-saving intervention. Every family has a different experience of services for their children with special or exceptional needs. I raised this case today as more than just an example but as an emergency case that needs to be dealt with.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_832">What we are talking about here are rights for citizens and be able to deliver a service. We are literally talking about a cradle-to-grave care. We all accept that this has been lacking. We could all reiterate some of the points made about psychology services, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and physiotherapy. We all know the waiting lists. Everyone has spoken about the 17,000 children waiting for initial contact with children's disability network teams. We all know this is not sustainable in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I welcome what has been said about dealing with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding delivering workforce planning and the throughput that will fill these spaces but many have already spoken about the difficulties that exist regarding people who fall between services - when they may be engaged by the CDNT teams but need support from CAMHS. However, then it is a case of the child has a diagnosis of autism so CAMHS cannot deal with the case and <i>vice versa</i> and over and back. We have all come across these issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_834"> If we are talking about the ambit of disability services, it crosses too many Departments. We would nearly need every Minister in here. We have dealt with a number of issues relating to housing. Hopefully, I think we may have got across the line regarding some of them and got around some corners. We probably need a wider route map regarding how we can deliver. Many have spoken about the difficulties around adaptation grants. Even beyond that, there are people whose children face serious issues who may be able to avail of an adaptation grant but perhaps the house does not suit it. They cannot afford to move to a new house and are caught. Unfortunately, I will have more such cases to bring to the Minister of State in the near future. I dealt specifically with the issue of education in the Joint Committee on Autism. It could take about six hours to deal with the issues. We just need to deliver for people. It is as simple as that. </p>

        <speech by="#PaulineTully" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_835">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this discussion of disability services and the Minister and Minister of State for remaining here for the two hours. That is appreciated. It is evident from the contributions that disability services are at an all-time low and there is need for immediate action to address the problems within the services and unmet need as outlined in the disability capacity review published last year. I again call for this disability capacity review action plan to be published without delay. We were told in here in July that it was within weeks of being published. It is now mid-October and we are more or less being told the same thing so it really needs to be published without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> Many contributors referred to children's disability services. I will address a few issues here. The problems identified within disability services involve the recruitment and retention of staff. The reason staff are leaving disability services are varied but some of them could and should be addressed without delay. The new Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People does not seem to have a dedicated clinical lead. As far as I can see, it was established without proper planning or foresight and is basically rudderless. It needs leadership. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> There needs to be pay parity for section 39 organisations. These organisations are haemorrhaging staff to the HSE because they are expected to deliver the same services for less money and that is not fair. The recruitment process is still very cumbersome, which has not been addressed. If any of these issues have been dealt with, I will welcome it but I believe the HSE has implemented the interim recommendations of the career pathway review in primary care only. Why has this not been extended to the CDNTs? Why are there no incentives to work in CDNTs - something similar to those offered to nurses working ICU?</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> I am led to believe that some teams do not have the adequate physical, clinical or office space they need; do not have access to some of the materials they require; and that access to HSE resources is limited to HSE employees and is not provided to section 39 organisations. If that is not true, that is great but that is what I am being told by some of the organisations. I also know administrative support is minimal or non-existent in some of the teams. That is something that could easily be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_839"> Health Services for Children in Ireland: A Guide to Workforce Planning set out the ratio of minimum staffing requirements for the different grades for CDNTs. The HSE is advising that this document is no longer applicable to the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People service. I do not know if this is true or not but it has not produced any replacement policy or methodology to determine how the CDNTs need to be staffed. There are also concerns about gaps emerging in the provision of clinical supervision that could lead to risks within the services. </p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Following the High Court decision in March 2022 regarding preliminary team assessments, I believe there was engagement around the development of a new standard operating procedure and that guidance was developed. I am not sure if that guidance has been delivered. I am led to believe that the process has been in limbo since March. </p>
          <p eId="para_841"> The Minister of State spoke about therapists going back into special school settings and that there was an issue with Fórsa in that regard. I am led to believe that the issue is that the therapists going back into the special school settings are being taken from the CDNTs. The Minister of State can clarify if this is the case. These teams are already savaged and under-resourced. They cannot afford to lose therapists. We need them in our special schools but we also need them in our disability network teams. </p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Regarding adult services, much more consideration needs to be given to personal budgets to give people more choice over decisions regarding their lives and to allow them to employ personal assistants or to meet more care needs. A number of speakers have mentioned ratifying the optional protocol. It is bad enough that it took us 11 years to ratify it after signing it but both should have been ratified together, which has not happened. </p>
          <p eId="para_843"> I commend DPOs and the many parents' groups, which are doing immense work in trying to get services for themselves and their children. They are constantly fighting a battle that they should not have to fight. I again thank all my colleagues for supporting the motion.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education (Deputy Norma Foley)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_846">I thank the Deputy. As he is aware, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, has statutory responsibility for the operation of the State exams. It has a responsibility to candidates to ensure their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity. I appreciate that many students are frustrated that they have not yet received their examination results, and I have been assured by the SEC that it is seeking to issue results in the earliest timeframe possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> This year is the first time since 2019 that all candidates sat the written examinations, which is a very welcome development. As in any year, priority this year was given to the leaving certificate and these results issued on 2 September. The next priority has been processing the leaving certificate appeals, and these results issued on Friday.</p>
            <p eId="para_848"> It was essential to prioritise the leaving certificate and leaving certificate appeals results, given that they have a direct impact on access to further and higher education as well as the world of work. Further to a 2019 court judgment on the matter of appeals results, the SEC has altered the sequence in which it issues results, with leaving certificate appeal results being issued to the Central Applications Office, CAO, in time for integration with the CAO offers season. It is also worth noting that this year overall there was an 11% increase in the number of appeals relative to 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_849"> The next priority is the junior cycle results and this process is well advanced but ongoing. Marking in almost all junior cycle subjects has been completed. However, in a small number of subjects in which examiner supply challenges were most severe during the summer months, the marking process is ongoing. For that reason the SEC has advised it is not possible to confirm a date at this point. These examiner supply challenges have been particularly acute for junior cycle, and in most subjects the number of examiners was significantly fewer than the number required to mark the subject during the normal summer window. At the same time, the number sitting State examinations, including junior cycle, continues to rise year on year.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> It is also important to recognise that the examiner challenge was one of a number of issues this year which meant results of the examinations are later than they would be in a normal year. A deferred leaving certificate sitting was held for candidates who may have suffered bereavement or illness, including Covid-19. </p>
            <p eId="para_851"> Every effort will be made by the SEC to issue junior cycle results as soon as possible.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_852">I fully accept the complexity of junior certificate results, particularly following Covid, which destabilised the leaving certificate, the appeals and everything else that came with that. Today I contacted a number of schools in my area and asked if there were any issues I could raise. What came back continually was the junior certificate results. This has implications, for example, for students deciding whether to go into the leaving certificate applied, LCA, programme while waiting on their results. It has particular consequences for students who have left and are looking for their junior certificate results to enter the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_853"> I hope the Minister agrees it would not be unreasonable to have a date and timeline for the results. I understand the SEC is responsible but all of us who engage in education have a responsibility to people contacting us to give a date. That is all that is being asked for at the minute. If the Minister could furnish some degree of a timeframe, that would be great.</p>

            <p eId="para_854">I hear and understand what the Deputy is saying and I understand the frustrations of students. I do not wish to be repetitive other than to say there were two sittings of the exams this year for leaving certificate. The appeals process had to come first. Those results issued last week. There were challenges in the recruitment of examiners.</p>
            <p eId="para_855"> I confirm there will be a full review of how we can best encourage more examiners to make themselves available, the question of dates being provided and certainty around dates. There will be a full review once the junior cycle results are complete. The appeals issued last Friday. The SEC has confirmed to me that it will take this week to do a further analysis on the limited number of subjects that remain outstanding and the time it will take and it will be in a position early next week to make a confirmation of the date available to the schools. I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this and thank him.</p>

            <p eId="para_856">I appreciate the response. In particular, the idea of a review is welcome. We could learn a lot from such a review. As has been suggested by a number of schools and people who take part in it, does it call into question the validity of the junior certificate moving forward? Is this still an examination we are committed to? This year's cohort of junior certificate students awaiting a result have had a completely upturned secondary school experience as a whole. They entered during Covid and all the way through that was their experience. Now their junior certificate results are late to the point where it may impact the type of course they take. Does this bring into consideration whether this is a relevant exam that we want to continue with? Will that be considered in the review?</p>

            <p eId="para_857">The value and importance of the exams at junior cycle level are not in question. Since 2019, the timeframe has changed. Many moons ago, we were looking at September but because of the legal proceedings and that, the issuing of results was around October, just this month. This year, it was right and proper that there were two sittings of the leaving certificate. My view and experience of junior cycle is that it is important that those exams be made available to student and that they have an opportunity to take a State examination at that point in their learning career, learning journey or school experience. It is a good and positive experience for students. There have been a variety of issues this year for the SEC. It is charged with responsibility and has indicated that early next week it will be in a position to give a final date.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">I thank the Deputy. The school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. In the last school year more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_861"> I recognise the importance of the school transport service for families and children. The review commenced in February 2021. It is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes to include an examination of eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the scheme's objectives. </p>
            <p eId="para_862"> The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting, where possible, initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>
            <p eId="para_863"> In June 2021, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report. Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school, had applied by the 29 April and registered for a ticket by the 29 July. Temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022-23 school year. </p>
            <p eId="para_864"> Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review. The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over the last number of months, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students, and has consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments. The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p>
            <p eId="para_865"> While work on the review is impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phase of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible. I will examine and consider the final recommendations once received.</p>

            <p eId="para_866">I thank the Minister. There are two issues, one of which is the ongoing review. Will it take into consideration the issues that arose this year in relation to concessionary tickets and making sure that as broad a school transport system as possible is in place?</p>
            <p eId="para_867">School transport ticks an awful lot of boxes in getting everyone who can get a bus to school to do so. </p>
            <p eId="para_868"> Where children have special and additional needs are travelling to different locations for their school activities or places, some parents opt for a taxi service and others for the grant. Sometimes during the year, which can be very early on, it turns out that what they looked for might not have worked out for every student, depending on their needs and challenges. The cases that come to me are often about taxis. Could there be greater flexibility in the Department so that there would be swift accommodation for people who change their minds on which scheme for kids with additional needs to travel to school they wish to use for genuine reasons?</p>

            <p eId="para_869">The purpose of the review is to look at all aspects of the current system and that includes examining eligibility criteria, trends, cost drivers and the overall effectiveness of the scheme in meeting the objectives as set out. The objective is to maximise the opportunities for young people to avail of the service. To answer the Deputy's first question, eligibility will most certainly be part of it, which is welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> He is correct that the value of the school transport system is incalculable, particularly in certain areas where it is a vital service. It is our objective that we will maximise the opportunity for people to avail of it. That is very much part of the review. </p>

            <p eId="para_873">I concur with what has been said. We have a scramble every year. We hope that our numbers are sorted for concessionaries on the basis of luck and then every local elected representative gets involved in these campaigns in areas. I have told the Minister previously that sometimes they almost welcome it as a chance to show themselves as busy, but I would be a hell of a lot happier if we could just get this issue off the agenda. We need to examine what constitutes a concessionary ticket and the eligibility criteria and that includes distance, particularly if a second school is being taken into account. We had particular issues in County Louth where there were, say, three schools that were equidistant from each other with very little in the difference. It ended up as a hames for a huge number of children as the Minister knows. We need a paradigm shift around moving people to the bus so we have to do what we are doing this year and more.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">I thank the Minister for the reply. I tabled Question No. 88 also on this matter. I refer in particular to the large number of children left without transport in a particular area such as Glenville in my constituency. My concern about that area was that these were children who wanted to go to school in Fermoy. The school authorities from Fermoy attended the primary school and advised that Glenville was a feeder school for them but now we find that more than 20 children have been left without school transport to Fermoy. Where there is a large number of students in particular places, that needs to be tackled in the fastest time possible because a large number of families are directly affected.</p>

To shorten the road ahead I suggest that the students that remain off-list and who cannot avail of transport and get a ticket be catered for by way of concessionary payment. At least it would remove the immediate problem. That is not to belittle in any way the tremendous work that the Minister has done but merely to continue it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Norma Foley<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_881">As the Deputy will be aware, I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined senior cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their senior cycle experience. There are three clear objective. It will empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century; enrich the student experience and build on what’s strong in our current system; and embed well-being and reduce student stress levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_882"> Considerable work has been ongoing regarding senior cycle redevelopment in the Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA and the SEC, in particular since the March announcement. Officials in the Department have engaged with key stakeholders on senior cycle redevelopment including providing a number of online information sessions to parents. Subject background papers have been prepared for the two new subjects of drama, film and theatre studies and climate action and sustainable development; as well as for business. The NCCA has a public consultation under way in respect of those subjects which closes at the end of October. The subject development groups within the NCCA, through which the new and revised curriculums will be developed, have been convened and the first meetings have been held. I have asked the SEC to undertake an evaluation of the 2022 experience of holding oral and music practical examinations at Easter so as to inform our approach in subsequent years. The NCCA and the SEC are in the process of commissioning research in relation to the weighting, composition and moderation of teacher-based assessment components. </p>
            <p eId="para_883"> Our next immediate steps include preparing to launch the process through which schools will be invited to become network schools. Those schools will support the introduction of the new and revised subjects in fifth year in September 2024. The planning necessary to hold paper 1 in Irish and English at the end of the fifth year from summer 2023 has also commenced. In addition, from the start of the current school year students pursuing the leaving certificate applied, LCA programme have been able to access maths from the established programme and those pursuing the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, programme are no longer required to satisfy subject specific criteria to be eligible for the programme. These are the first steps that will ultimately lead to a more integrated leaving certificate available to all students.</p>
            <p eId="para_884"> Work has also commenced within the NCCA’s structures in regard to the production of a revised transition year programme statement and the development of L1 and L2 learning programmes to provide for continuity from equivalent level programmes at junior cycle level.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">The Minister has given a broad outline of what the new senior cycle will look like but the detail is light. What subjects will be available? What will the curriculum consist of? What form will the exams take? What form will the continuous assessment take? There is little time available to give the answers to those questions. If we learned anything from the pandemic, it was that the leaving certificate needs to be reformed in its entirety.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">Sitting that exam is not the be-all and end-all for all students. The reform of senior cycle should reflect that. We clearly need to reflect on this and introduce those changes. Will the Minister give an indication of what subjects will be available and what the curriculum will consist of? What form will the exams take and what form will the continuous assessment take? </p>

            <p eId="para_887">I have been very clear about the need for the reform of senior cycle and I have outlined the aspects on which we have already moved. We have already made considerable changes on foot of the announcements for senior cycle. For example, the students availing of the LCA programme may now avail of maths from the established programme. There is a crossover between the different programmes available at leaving certificate. Equally, students who wish to study the LCV programme are no longer prohibited on the basis of the subjects they choose; it is open to everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> We have also said that there will be a revised transition year programme. We are currently developing a structure where the L1 and L2 programmes, which are available to children with special educational needs, will be also available at senior cycle. We have been very clear that there will be 40% teacher-based assessment. We have been also very clear that all this will be worked through in what we are calling our network schools so that the students and teachers are co-authors of the programme. We have been also very clear that students will not need to experience any single day in June where all their marks are dependent on their performance on that day. We have also made clear that as part of the syllabus, there will be various methods of adjudicating students' abilities, whether it is oral presentations-----</p>

I appeal to the Minister to do her utmost to engage with students and teachers to plan out what she has in mind for the senior cycle. That would be very welcome. I encourage her to be more forthcoming and to bring more clarity to the situation for students and teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">The Deputy is misconstruing what I said to him. I said there is absolute clarity on the broad thrust of what is to be achieved at senior cycle. I have been very clear about the new types of subjects that will be available. Two specific new subjects will be available: drama, film and theatre studies; and climate action and sustainable development. The work on that has already begun. The Deputy spoke about clarity for students and teachers. I have been also very clear that the entire process, particularly as it relates to assessment etc., will be worked through our network schools. That will involve teachers and students. There will be total engagement there. It will be a co-authoring of the process. We will shortly be commencing opportunities for schools to join that network schools programme. We have already begun the process of senior cycle reform. This year for the first time, students will be allowed to move between the leaving certificate established and leaving certificate applied. That reflects one of the broadest ambitions in ensuring there is a crossover. Another measure from senior cycle reform in our schools this year is ensuring that the LCV programme is open to all students. The process has begun and there will be ongoing consultation with students and staff.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Deputy Josepha Madigan)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_894">I thank the Deputy for the question. This is particularly important vis-à-vis my role as Minister of State with responsibility for special education. Many children have difficulty reaching their potential without access to digital technologies. We need to provide these to them so that they can overcome traditional barriers to learning, and to support inclusion across the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_895"> The assistive technology scheme is provided by the Department to supplement the overall approach. The overall approach is the digital strategy for schools to 2027, with €200 million committed over the period, €50 million of which has already been given to schools. The equipment provided under this scheme supports children with more complex disabilities who require essential specialist equipment in order to access the school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_896"> I am delighted that this year I was able to increase that funding by €2 million in budget 2023, which represents an increase of almost 60% on funding allocated to it previously. Last year it was €3.5 million and the additional €2 million brings it to €5.5 million, which will go a long way to helping children with additional needs avail of such technological assistance when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_897"> In 2021, a total of 3,766 students benefited from this scheme, 62 of whom are in the Deputy's constituency of Clare. The review is ongoing and we expect it to be completed by mid-2023. This process will have a consultative element and relevant stakeholders will be invited to participate. It is important for the entire digital strategy to be embedded in digital technologies across all learning for children with additional needs.</p>

I recognise the Minister of State's work in securing an additional €2 million for the programme, bringing it up to €5.5 million. The number of students throughout the country who benefit from the scheme is 3,766, including 62 students in County Clare. The Minister of State has given an indicative timeframe for the review to conclude by May 2023. What type of work will take place between now and when the Minister of State hopes to have the review published? When will the recommendations of the review be implemented?</p>

There will be consultation with relevant stakeholders and we will be inviting them to participate. It is really important that we stay on top of technological advances all the time and that we are forward thinking with the technological assistance we can give to children with additional educational needs. Examples include laptops with modified software and audiological support for students with hearing impairments. Braille is also available. Children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum. Schools not in a position to provide assistance to them through their normal resources may apply to the National Council for Special Education under the terms of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_900">Students with physical or communicative disabilities are among our most vulnerable students. It is imperative that we continue to adapt this important scheme to ensure we meet the needs of all those students. I accept what the Minister of State has just said. The addition of the €2 million is significant, representing a 60% increase. I very much look forward to the outcome of the review and I ask the Minister of State to keep me informed because this issue is very important to many families who have students who are vulnerable.</p>

            <p eId="para_901">I will, of course, keep the Deputy informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">In County Clare also, there are 47 special classes. Two were opened this September. There are also 15 special classes at post-primary level, two of which were opened this year. A number of the children in those special classes in County Clare and throughout the country probably will be looking for assistance. It is important to stress the school management authorities must apply and qualify for the assistive technology scheme. As Deputy Carey stated, a student must be diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must have a recommendation as part of a professional assessment that the equipment is essential to allow the student to access the curriculum. Overall, the fact we have extra funding of €2 million in the budget means extra supports will be available for the children. When we visit schools, it is incredible to see children with additional needs progressing and being able to learn through technological devices in a way they might not have been able to do in the absence of such support.</p>

            <p eId="para_905">As the Deputy is aware, in June of this year, I visited the Cork Life Centre and I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet some of the young people who attend the centre, together with their parents and guardians, as well as members of staff and the management of the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> During the meeting, the centre raised the issues of security of employment for its staff and their terms and conditions, including payment rates for the centre's teaching staff. Staff employed in Cork Life Centre, under the co-operation hours arrangements by Cork Education and Training Board, are employed under terms and conditions, including pay scales, in line with arrangements which apply to settings outside the recognised school system. It is not unusual that tutors may hold qualifications that entitle them to recognised teacher status or registration with the Teaching Council, but payment rates and terms and conditions are generally dependent on the setting or sector in which a person is employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> A commitment was given to examine the circumstances around the payment of teachers at Cork Life Centre. I am committed to honouring that agreement through the review of out-of-school education provision. With the report completed, work has now commenced on the next phase of this process. I am very keen to see progress made on the implementation of the recommendations of the report. In the interim, the level of funding currently provided to Cork Life Centre will continue until such time as the recommendations of the report are implemented. This funding will be in place and will provide ongoing support for the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> The Department of Education has provided funding to Cork Life Centre in recent years, with that support increasing significantly since 2018. In 2022, my Department will provide funding of €177,500. This is in addition to the 6,000 co-operation hours, funded by my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_909"> I also give a commitment that my Department will continue to engage with Cork Life Centre to work towards a framework for sustainability for the centre. Indeed, this is what the review of out-of-school education provision aims to provide for the sector as a whole, including Cork Life Centre. The body of work to advance the implementation of the recommendations is now under way and will be completed as soon as possible. It is envisioned that the implementation of the recommendations of the review will address all of the issues raised by Cork Life Centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">I accept that major progress has been made on the provision of funding to the centre. The centre lost eight teachers in June who had an average of six years' experience. At any one time there are 55 students in the centre. These are students who have dropped out of school.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> I worked with the Blackpool Glen Farranree Community Youth Training Centre where we had full funding. We had more than 50 young people who had dropped out of school, many of whom were referred to us by the Garda Síochána. When a research project was carried out on those children five years after they left the centre, 70% of them were in full-time employment. The Cork Life Centre has made great progress with children who have attended it who do not fit in to the formal educational structure. We must provide funding to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> I do not say that any of the children attending the centre are involved in any kind of illegal activity. It was interesting to hear from staff from the Children Detention Campus at Oberstown who were before the Committee of Public Accounts recently that the cost of running it is €24 million per annum, which is more than €500,000 per student.</p>

            <p eId="para_915">To be clear, the staff employed in the Cork Life Centre, under the co-operation hours arrangement with Cork ETB, are employed under terms and conditions, including the pay scale, in line with arrangements that apply to settings outside the recognised school system. However, as I have made very clear, I have met with the centre and I am very conscious of the work it does. The issues the centre has raised will be addressed via the review of the out-of-school education provision. In the interim, to be clear, the Department has provided significant funding to Cork Life Centre in recent years and, in 2022 alone, significant funding of €177,500 was provided. That is in addition to the 6,000 co-operation hours funded by the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. I am fully committed to driving on the review. It will support centres like Cork Life Centre and others in this sector. We will do that as speedily as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">I fully understand where the Minister is coming from. My colleague Deputy O'Sullivan has raised the matter with the Minister by way of a Topical Issue debate. Both of us are very concerned about this. We have 55 children there who are being looked after in a very caring way. They are getting education they might not otherwise get. Again, I go back to the facility of which I was chair of the board for some years in Blackpool, which has 50 children at any one time. We had full funding and support. The facility is still there and is a success. I know the structure in the Blackpool Glen Farranree training centre, but it has worked for children who have dropped out of the education system, who are going down the wrong road and who need that support. Don O'Leary, who runs the Cork Life Centre, is the person who did the research project for me as part of his masters degree for UCC. He showed that 70% of the cases coming through the centre were in full-time employment five years later. It is likewise with the Cork Life Centre. There are success stories there and it is important it gets support.</p>

            <p eId="para_917">I support Deputy Burke. As he outlined, I debated the issue with the Minister last week during a Topical Issue debate. We acknowledge all the good work that has been done to provide resources, co-operation hours and extra funding for the Cork Life Centre. That is greatly appreciated by all the staff, but again it is important to stress the urgency of the matter at hand. I understand the report is with the implementation team, as the Minister referenced again this evening. I reiterate that the staff in the Cork Life Centre are fully qualified, as I was in the past, but unfortunately they find it very difficult when they seek a bank loan, car loan or mortgage because they are not permanent. For example, many of them have to sign on in the summer. I acknowledge that once upon a time I was that part-time temporary teacher who struggled to get those types of loans, so I can empathise greatly with the staff in the centre.</p>

I do not for a moment underestimate the value and importance of the work that takes place in Cork Life Centre and in the other centres that make up this sector. I fully understand that no one setting suits the needs of students and we must provide a variety of settings for them. It is the desire of the Cork Life Centre, and all such centres, that it would have a sustainable future. It is for that reason we are determined to ensure via the review that we have a mechanism that will protect and sustain the sector as a whole, including the Cork Life Centre. I am very conscious of the issues the Deputies have addressed. They are part of this review and they will be worked through as speedily as we can for the benefit of all centres within the sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Norma Foley<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_921">On 1 January 2021, responsibility for education welfare functions, including the administration of the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme, SCP, transferred from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to me. The SCP forms part of the Tusla education support service, TESS. While the arrangements between Tusla and the SCP are not impacted by the change in ministerial responsibility, Tusla now reports to my Department in respect of the SCP, which is funded by my Department via Tusla.</p>
            <p eId="para_922"> TESS has three strands. These are the statutory educational welfare service, EWS, and the two school support services, namely, the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme and the SCP. The three TESS strands work together collaboratively with schools, families and other relevant services to achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_923"> The SCP was introduced in 2002 by my Department and the programme is now a central element of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, my Department’s main policy initiative to address educational disadvantage at school level. The SCP delivers a range of local interventions in disadvantaged communities that support the retention of young people in education. The programme enables local communities to develop tailored strategies to maximise the participation levels of those at risk of early school-leaving in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> There are currently 122 school completion projects with local management committees. The 2022 allocation for the programme is €26.9 million and additional funding will be provided later this year to allow new DEIS urban primary and post-primary schools to access the SCP service. At present, management of the school completion programme initiatives, including the employment of staff, occurs at local level. </p>
            <p eId="para_925"> Since I took over responsibility for the school completion programme in January 2021, I have secured additional funding to provide for an extension of SCP supports to 28 additional schools that were included in DEIS for the first time in September 2017 and a 5% overall increase in funding for the school completion programme, effective from September 2021. In addition, I negotiated a further increase of 5% for the SCP under budget 2023.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_926">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response, a copy of which I received earlier in the evening. I welcome the fact both she and the Taoiseach have taken a keen interest in this area. As recently as last Wednesday, during Questions on Policy or Legislation, he indicated he was still anxious that the full transition in regard to the logistics would be undertaken and that the full jurisdiction would return to the Department of Education. I also welcome the fact the Minister has negotiated through the budgetary process, as she mentioned, that 5% increase, which will cater well for the expanded DEIS programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_927"> The crux of the matter, however, is that, as she stated, the management of the school completion programme occurs at local level. That is the point at issue here. The Minister went on to say her Department would consider all aspects of the programme, including its management, in the future. Will she confirm whether this consideration will extend to staff reverting to employment under the Department of Education, for example?</p>

            <p eId="para_928">To be clear, I appreciate and acknowledge the value of the school completion programme and see the work it does on the ground. We are looking at an holistic approach between school completion, home school community liaison and so on to ensure students and young people at risk of early school-leaving will be supported insofar as possible to maintain their presence in school and to succeed.</p>
            <p eId="para_929"> I reiterate that the initial focus of the transfer of the school completion programme has been very much on the development of the legislative platform to support the transfer of functions from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the process in that respect was recently completed. My Department will, as the Deputy noted, consider all aspects of the development of the programme, including its management and all aspects involved therein. I will keep the Deputy updated on the matter. I am determined, now that we have completed the legislative framework, to consider all other aspects.</p>

            <p eId="para_930">I appreciate the Minister's sincerity on this and wished only to give her an outline of what the school completion programme model means on the ground in Cork. We have 11 projects, comprising six non-education and training board, ETB, based and five ETB based. I highlight that distinction because in the case of the five ETB-based school completion programmes, predominantly, the teachers involved keep their pay and conditions as employees of the ETB. They have the same pension entitlements as regular ETB staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_931"> Unfortunately, in the case of the six non-ETB school completion programmes, the teachers do not have the same luxury of pension entitlements or the same pay and conditions. That is a glaring disparity and I hope it will be addressed as the scheme is reviewed. It feeds into the bigger problem we have with regard to school completion, namely, the poor retention of staff in critical areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">I very much appreciate the Deputy's points and am conscious of the disparity that exists. I am also conscious of the value and importance of the work being done on school completion programmes. The jurisdiction of the SCP coming into my remit is a relatively recent move. I wanted to be fair and honest in saying there had to be considerable work in that respect from a legislative point of view but I am aware of the differences of approach and of impact in terms of staffing throughout the country. The next body of work, focusing on all other aspects of the management of the SCP now that we have jumped the first significant hurdle, will commence imminently.</p>

            <from>Deputy Josepha Madigan<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_936">The summer programme has been described by, for example, the Department inspectorate as life-changing, given how important it is for children with additional needs. Indeed, the report of the Department’s chief inspector referred to post-Covid regression and how that is likely to persist for a period, and we need to take that into account when we talk about the importance of the summer inclusion programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> This year, the Minister and I announced the summer programme for pupils and were in a position to secure an additional €20 million in the budget, which will mean schools will have more time to plan the summer programme for next year. Rather than announcing an additional €20 million in May, when the summer provision is due to start, they will now have time to do that in advance. We have built on the first inclusion summer programme, which I introduced in 2021, and now all primary and post-primary schools, as well as special schools, are able to offer at least one summer programme this year and next year. While we have not yet finalised figures, we think more than 1,000 schools ran a programme this year and it is expected more than 45,000 pupils will have participated in both the school-based and the home-based programmes this year, which amounts to an increase of more than 15% on the 2021 figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_938"> The Deputy asked specifically about the early years sector. Over the past two years, we have endeavoured to do everything we can to ensure all schools will participate in the summer programme, such as by allowing schools some flexibility in regard to staff who are not currently employed in their school, including those in the early years sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_939">I thank both the Minister and the Minister of State for making funding available at such an early date. It will allow for long-term planning and help to ensure the full programme for the summer will be planned out with people involved in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The issue with early years sector employees, however, is that they are paid for 38 weeks of the year and must sign on during the summer. It is important that we allow them to participate in this programme and that they are included. They have a huge contribution to make. It is also about widening the base of the people available with regard to providing the support in the schools and to the children. The summer programme is also very welcome, not only for children but also for parents. There is a benefit for both. It is, however, the early years sector about which I am very concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_941">I completely agree with the Deputy that these workers have an awful lot to offer. That is why we have allowed that flexibility for schools to hire staff from the early years sector. This year, for example, provision was made to include newly qualified teachers, undergraduate student teachers and final year students as well as those from the early years sector. We want to expand the potential of the workforce. I am working with the Ministers, Deputies Harris and O’Gorman, to make sure that is done.</p>
            <p eId="para_942"> For the Deputy's interest, 44 schools in County Cork ran 66 programmes for 1,449 children. They would have benefited from the summer programme this year. We also currently have the programme under review, which is really important. Together with consultation with the special education consultative forum, we are working very closely with stakeholders to make sure we can encourage all schools to participate in this programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_943">I presume there will be engagement with people who are working in the early years school sector in order that they will be made aware that they can become more involved in it. The other issue is whether the Minister of State's Department is setting targets for trying to increase the number of schools that are participating, while also increasing the number of young people, students and children who will benefit from it.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">Absolutely. One of the primary issues with which I have been tasked is to try to encourage and make it easier for schools to participate in the summer provision. One of the reasons we secured €20 million in the budget is so that €40 million is already set aside for next year. Staff will, therefore, have time to plan in each individual school, particularly special schools in which children have more complex needs. We have also undertaken other measures to improve the situation and the attractiveness of providing a summer programme to schools. There is flexibility around when they can participate or when they can host the summer programme. We have tried to ease the administrative burden. We have appointed an overseer role and introduced preparation hours, thereby allowing principals to delegate functions to other members of staff. We have also increased capitation funding, which is of huge assistance to the schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_947">I thank the Deputy. The provision of special classes throughout the country is another issue with which I have been extremely seized. I secured €2.6 billion in this budget to provide some of those places to children with additional needs. We have increased the budget by 10% from last year. In fact, the special education budget is 27% of the entire education budget, which is an acknowledgement of the significance of special education. That includes the setting up of special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_948"> In total, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has sanctioned 392 special classes this year and 370 for 2023, of which 260 are in primary schools and 132 are in post-primary schools. That will create 2,352 special class places. There will be more than 2,900 special classes in Ireland by the end of next year, which is the highest level ever. This is absolutely necessary in order that children can thrive in that environment. In each special class, we have two special needs assistants, SNAs, and a special education teacher to look after the children.</p>
            <p eId="para_949"> Across the special education sector in its entirety, we now have more than 19,000 special education teachers and more than 20,000 SNAs. Therefore, we have 40,000 dedicated staff enthusiastically looking after children with additional needs. For the Deputy's information, we have 62 special classes in County Clare comprising 47 classes at primary level, including two new classes that opened in September, and 15 classes at post-primary level, including two new classes that also opened in September. We also have 188 children in two special schools in County Clare.</p>

            <p eId="para_950">I thank the Minister of State for that response. Special classes play a significant role in the development of children with special education needs. I acknowledge the Minister of State's really welcome work in securing €2.6 billion in the recent budget, which is the biggest budget in the history of the State for special education. The priority of the Government and the Minister of State has been to ensure that every child in the country has access to a school place.</p>
            <p eId="para_951"> I had the pleasure of working with the Minister of State on the issue of Doonbeg National School together with the principal, Mr. Neil Crowley. After an in-depth review of the school's needs, a special class was sanctioned, which I had the honour of opening. I can see on the ground the impact that is having on the school community. It is really welcome. Could the Minister of State perhaps expand on future plans to expand it further?</p>

            <p eId="para_952">I thank the Deputy for his acknowledgement of Doonbeg National School. I commend his and Mr. Crowley's efforts to secure a sanction from the NCSE for the opening of a special class. It is wonderful to hear that the school has had a positive experience. There is not a school I have visited with a special class that has not had a positive experience. Some of them go on to open two or three special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_953"> One of the things we are doing, which is pertinent to the Deputy's question around forward planning, is that we now have a proper forecasting model whereby the Department and the NCSE can see data in real time. One thing I want to stress this evening is the extra €13 million I secured for the NCSE. Its CEO, Mr. John Carney, is doing incredible work, particularly on operational issues. He will now be in a position to hire 161 new staff who, through the special educational needs organisers, are the people who liaise with the school community about opening special classes. This will do an incredible amount to assist schools. Again, it is not just about opening the classes but also about adequately resourcing them.</p>

            <p eId="para_955"> I look forward to welcoming the Minister of State to County Clare in the next number of weeks when she will visit Scoil na Mainistreach in Quin to perform an official opening of its two new autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classrooms. This is an area to which the Minister of State has given real attention. I look forward to school communities right across the country benefitting from her work in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">The Minister of State recently visited Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk and the two ASD classes there. Many parents have come to me and their issue is ensuring that their kid coming from primary school has a space in an ASD unit, if that is what is suitable, in secondary school. We have insufficient places or classes. At the Joint Committee on Autism a number of stakeholders recently stated that they believe one the solutions is that the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 would be altered from a point of view of allowing special education kids a 24-month run-in. That would allow schools to do preparatory work and ensure resourcing was in place and ready for the kids. Then if it was the case that a school was a bit slow in putting an ASD class in operation, section 37A could be put into action.</p>

That is an important area that needed to be strengthened, especially the engagement with principals and educators in both primary and secondary schools.

            <p eId="para_959">I will answer Deputy Dillon's question first. Mr. John Kearney is the CEO of the NCSE. The budget provided €13 million for the NCSE to hire this staff. I know Mr. Kearney is actively pursuing that as quickly as possible because he badly needs the staff in order to make sure we can assist parents and families that have a child with an additional need who is looking for a special class. I know he will be doing that in early course.</p>
            <p eId="para_960"> I note Deputy Ó Murchú's remarks on Coláiste Chú Chulainn. I met the principal, Thomas Sharkey, there with Senator McGahon. They are to be commended for the incredible work they do in that school and it is a prime example of what inclusivity is in the school environment in terms of providing special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> I would be delighted to visit Scoil na Mainistreach in Quin, County Clare, and to open those special classes. I thank all the school community that open special classes. It is of huge significance to children with additional needs.</p>

          <speech by="#JosephaMadigan" eId="spk_333" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education">
            <from>Deputy Josepha Madigan<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T23:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_964">The Deputy will be aware that the DEIS programme is the Department of Education’s policy response to the issue of educational disadvantage. The home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme is an integral element of the DEIS programme. It is a school-based intervention provided to DEIS schools to address the needs of pupils at most risk of educational disadvantage. The role of the HSCL co-ordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child’s life, in order to empower them so they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning. Central to that initiative is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured.</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> While the Department of Education undertakes the provision of resources for this scheme, the Tusla education support service has the operational responsibility for the HSCL scheme, providing training and support for co-ordinators nationally. It comes under the DEIS programme and is only for schools within this programme. The Deputy will be aware that special schools receive significant funding and supports relative to their settings. I stress again that the allocation of €2.6 billion, which is over 27% of the entire Department of Education budget, is going towards children with additional needs and special education in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_966"> The upshot of the Deputy's question is the fact that the HSCL scheme is really only for DEIS schools, at least at present. I understand that the rationale for that is that special schools receive significant funding and supports relative to their settings.</p>

            <p eId="para_967">When I put down the question I knew that only DEIS schools were able to avail of home school community liaison officers. I am quite aware of that but I am asking that this would be looked at and reviewed over a period of time. I lifted the following information off the Tusla website earlier. The website states that part of the role of the home school community liaison officer is to enhance a child's educational experience, particularly through offering family supports, parent classes, courses and home visits etc. That goes to the nub of the issue; the parent is as much the focus here as the child. One is dealing with children in special school settings who have emotional and behavioural issues, might suffer from anxiety, and probably have an intellectual disability of some form, be it profound, mild or otherwise. Those parents are dealing with those children 24-7 and 365 days of the year and there should be scope here for home school community liaison officers.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">It is important that the Deputy raised this question because we have to consider these matters, which the Department does. The Deputy conceded that the scheme comes under the DEIS programme and that it is only for schools within that programme at present. It is also important to point out that special schools receive more in capitation than a DEIS school receives in combined funding of capitation and DEIS. The special schools have substantially more teaching and SNA staff than similarly sized DEIS schools, so even where some schools may potentially come under the DEIS banner their funding, due to their special school status, is better. Special schools may already have greater family or community interaction and support due to the student profile they have and they may also have other additional supports assigned to them, such as bus escorts, therapists and nurses.</p>

            <p eId="para_969">The simple truth is that there will never be enough resources for the kids in these special school settings with some of the needs I have described earlier. Let us be honest about that. Whether it is kids who need to be helped to feed; need PEG feeding, need help to go to the toilet, or whatever the case may be, the harsh reality is there will never be enough resources. The staff in those settings do a massive job and they are to be commended for it but at the end of the day the parents, who are the focus of the home school community liaison programme, are often forgotten about. As I said, they are at home with those children 24-7 and we lose sight of the fact that they are the most important people in those students' lives. Now that the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Foley, are here, I would ask that in time for next year's budget at least some analysis would be done on this issue. I understand that special schools get so many resources but it is comparing apples and oranges with mainstream schools and DEIS schools. There is merit in doing some kind of review and looking into the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_970">I want to reassure the Deputy that I know this is being looked at and that it has been looked at. I will bring the Deputy's contribution on further analysis back to the Department. The staffing ratios in special schools are significantly lower than in mainstream schools and that is intended to ensure the needs of their students can be met effectively. The Deputy is correct that they are our most vulnerable children, above and beyond mainstream education. These are special schools and we have about 8,500 children in special schools. Some families of students in special schools who have a sibling attending a DEIS school may already have access to a HSCL co-ordinator. I know that scheme is an integral part of the DEIS scheme and we will be considering all matters pertaining to it in relation to special schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">I did not think we would get to this question. The Minister has dealt somewhat with the issue I raise but the fact is we have a school transport fiasco every year. We must ensure that is not the case into the future. A review will need to deal with eligibility and distances, including allowing for circumstances where schools are equidistant, and facilitate as many concessionary tickets as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#NormaFoley" eId="spk_339" as="#Minister_for_Education">
            <from>Deputy Norma Foley<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T23:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_973">As the Deputy is aware, the school transport scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. It is important to look at the figures. In the most recent school year, more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The cost of the scheme in 2021 was €289 million. It is an important service for families and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_974"> The purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children who reside at a remote distance from their nearest school. In July 2022, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022-23 school year as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures. School transport ticket registration for the current school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applicants as well as rollovers from the previous school year. More than 125,000 tickets have already issued for the 2022-23 school year. At the start of the previous school year, approximately 103,600 children were carried on mainstream school transport services. This means in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, which is a 20% overall increase. Compared with the start of the 2021-22 school year, there has been an increase of 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of 27% in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_975"> Bus Éireann will continue to process applications and issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. Regrettably, however, the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the current school year have led to some delays in the issuing of tickets. The normal eligibility criteria for the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with those criteria. Pupils at primary level are eligible if they live no less than 3.2 km from, and are attending, their nearest primary school. At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from their nearest or next nearest school are eligible.</p>

            <p eId="para_976">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire. At this point, what we want to see is accommodation of all the pupils who previously got concessionary tickets, as well as those in receipt of what are now being called concessionary 3 tickets. For students who have no siblings who ever travelled on the school bus and are the first in the family to enter the fray, I would like to think the numbers will work out for them. The difficulty with all this is that we have been relying on an element of luck.</p>
            <p eId="para_977"> We definitely cannot go back. We must plan into the future for the delivery of the current provision and more. The best news I had today was in dealing with families in Annagassan whose children have got their tickets following severe disruption over the past while. I am still waiting for a number of results in other parts of County Louth, including north Louth and for several students travelling to The Bush. Their difficulty is they are not located more than 4.8 km from their nearest school, which is something that definitely needs to be revisited.</p>

            <p eId="para_978">I acknowledge the Deputy's ongoing commitment to this issue. The scheme for the waiving of school transport fees was very clear in that it applied to those students who met the eligibility criteria. We have outlined those criteria, which are that pupils must live more than 3.2 km from their nearest primary school or 4.8 km from their nearest post-primary school or, to include the temporary alleviation measures I introduced, their next nearest school. Those who have met those criteria are being catered for. The difficulties we have identified concern pupils who had concessionary tickets last year. We received additional funding in the budget to ensure those who were in receipt of concessionary tickets last year and had applied on time would, where capacity allows, be accommodated. However, I absolutely acknowledge the whole impetus behind the review of the school transport system is to look at the issue of eligibility and the criteria and, as I said earlier, to maximise the potential to have a greater number of students availing of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">Yes, the review needs to look at all the criteria and we must ensure this particular issue is not ongoing. I like to think all sensible politicians would welcome that, as will families. There is no point repeating myself other than to say we need to deliver for people as quickly as possible, accepting the capacity issues and making sure they do not arise next year.</p>

We have also seen a 27% increase in the number of concessionary tickets offered this year compared with last year. It is a substantial increase. Notwithstanding that, the entire root-and-branch review will give us an opportunity to look at new opportunities into the future for enhancing and increasing eligibility and meeting the demand that exists.</p>

            <p eId="para_986"> I do not have the full reply as I did not think we would get to these questions. I apologise to the Deputy for that and will provide her with the updated data. I take the opportunity to say the work NEPS does is absolutely invaluable, as the Deputy will appreciate. We have increased the number of staff in the service in recent years, including provision in the recent budget for the recruitment of an additional 54 psychologists. That recruitment process will begin in November. Even as late as the past few days and weeks, we have seen the importance of the work NEPS does locally and its value to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_987"> I will ensure the Deputy gets the specific data she has requested. I can give the positive message that we are consistently increasing the number of NEPS psychologists in post locally. I welcome the provision in the budget for an additional 54 to be provided. In recognition of the importance of their work, that recruitment process will begin as a matter of priority and it is my expectation it will happen next month, with a view to continuing to maximise the provision. Over the past two years, we have looked at consistently increasing the numbers. An additional 54 psychologists this year is what is provided for in the budget and recruitment will begin in the coming weeks. I will ensure the Deputy gets the outstanding data she is seeking.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">That would be great. The specific question I had relates to an issue that has been brought to my attention in my office, namely, that budget 2023 resulted in educational psychologist trainees being the only cohort of trainee psychologists who are not funded. They pay more than €30,000 in fees, leaving them financially burdened and feeling almost disregarded by the Minister's Department, albeit she is aware of the significance and value of the work of educational psychologists in the school context. Will she give consideration to funding this programme either in full or part, with a view to students giving State agencies such as NEPS three years' service when they graduate?</p>

            <p eId="para_989">I appreciate having the opportunity to confirm the Department has set up a high-level working group on this issue chaired by the Secretary General, which is a testament to the importance we are placing on how we advance the service provided by NEPS. The working group has agreed on a number of actions that will be taken. Following analysis of the various options that were laid out by the group, it has been decided the Department will use some available NEPS funding to sponsor a cohort of third-year students of the educational psychology doctoral programme in University College Dublin, UCD, and Mary Immaculate College, which is linked to the University of Limerick, for the academic year 2022-23 by providing a contribution towards their fees and associated expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The workforce planning group that I referenced previously, under the Secretary General, will be asked to make some interim recommendations in quarter 2 of next year regarding any other short-term measures required in advance of the final report.

It states: "Why fund us? Because we deserve equality. We are not funded and therefore financially burdened, carrying up to €30,000 in debt before we even start our careers. We work unpaid for children and families facing significant difficulties in relation to mental health, disabilities and education from birth to adulthood.

Among those is the decision that has been taken to sponsor a cohort of third year students for the 2022-2023 academic year by providing a contribution to their fees and associated expenses. Given the particular time pressures for students in the third year of the programme, interviews will be held in the coming months to provide financial support to those students currently on training placements in NEPS who are due to complete their doctoral training programme in 2023. Details will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_995">As the Deputy is aware, the single biggest expansion of the DEIS programme was announced by me recently, with an investment of €17 million, increasing to €32 million next year. We are very conscious of the benefit of the DEIS programme. All analysis and studies on the programme show that it makes a considerable impact in our schools. We have grown it to such an extent that one in four of our students benefits from the DEIS programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_996"> In terms of the review process, more than 300 schools were announced as benefiting from the DEIS programme. Schools that were not successful on this occasion were given the opportunity to appeal the findings of the programme. The schools have been notified of their status on foot of that. The entire funding allocation for the programme for 2023 will be in the region of €180 million. Consequently, because of the recent enhancement, schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage have now been identified for inclusion in the programme through the new refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics-based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school’s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on <i>gov.ie.</i></p>

            <p eId="para_997">I thank the Minister for her response. I welcome the recent major expansion of the DEIS programme, which demonstrates the Minister's commitment, and that of the Department, to inclusive education and supporting students facing disadvantage. However, I am concerned about the identification model, which the Minister has stated is objective and statistics-based. I regularly meet with many principals and boards of management of schools in the DEIS programme in my own constituency, including in my own town of Castlebar. Despite the area of deprivation, St. Gerald's DLS College in Castlebar is in close proximity to Davitt College, a school with similar enrolment data and risk of educational disadvantage, yet one school is included in the programme and the other is not. There was a similar issue with St. Patrick's Boys' National School, which has now amalgamated with another school. While I welcome the DEIS appeals process, will there be further expansion of the programme in the coming months? I ask the Minister to provide an update on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_998">I appreciate the point the Deputy has made. As I have outlined already, there is a detailed paper on the refined DEIS model, which is available on <i>gov.ie</i>. At its core, it is about identifying concentrated levels of disadvantage. That is the nub of it. I accept that schools may be in close proximity to one another, but they do not necessarily have the same cohort of students. Notwithstanding that, I think it is important to acknowledge that the expansion of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of the work that we seek to do. I absolutely accept that there are students who are attending schools that are not DEIS schools and would benefit from the DEIS supports. Therefore, we are looking at a whole range of supports being provided to schools. We have seen that in the additional supports that we are providing via budget 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">I welcome the expansion of the programme. Within County Mayo, an additional 15 schools were included in the expansion announced in March of this year, which was most welcome. However, I wish to highlight the inconsistency of there being no DEIS schools in west or south Mayo. All the schools allocated DEIS status are in north or east Mayo. Certainly, while I understand that the model is a statistics-based one, there are issues around trying to get clarifications for principals and boards of management who are in desperate need. It may be the case that in one family, one child attends one school and siblings attend another school, resulting in a huge disparity in terms of the levels of teaching, learning and supports being provided. It is important that we get some consistency around it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1000">I appreciate the Deputy's point that one school in an area may be awarded DEIS status and another may not. However, because it is about concentrated disadvantage, that will be the case unless the other school absolutely mirrors school that is awarded DEIS status in terms of the entire student population. Again, I reiterate that a detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie. I also recognise that there is a need to target resources at those schools that need them most. The next phase of work, which I am undertaking now, will explore the allocation of resources to all schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders. We will seek to build on many of the positive initiatives from budget 2023, including the €50 million investment providing free books to primary schools, the reduction in class sizes for all schools and all the other initiatives that have been made available in the budget.</p>

          <speech by="#EmerHiggins" eId="spk_357">
            <from>Deputy Emer Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T23:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1001">I thank the Minister for taking this Topical Issue at this late hour. It concerns the need to progress the delivery of new school buildings for schools in my constituency. Dublin Mid-West is a thriving and rapidly growing area that includes communities such as Lucan, Clondalkin and Palmerstown, and the communities and villages of Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart and Brittas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">The need for capacity in our schools has simply never been greater, in particular at post-primary level. Far too often I am contacted by panicked parents who cannot find somewhere for their children to go to secondary school or by exasperated principals who have been waiting decades for the promised extension for their school community. These are people who are fed up of waiting patiently. They are tired of being the bad guys and having to tell parents the school cannot accept their children as students. As a result, in many cases parents are having to send their children out of the county to schools in Kildare to find a school place. They are having to travel long distances to and from school every day, relying on bus services that are flawed at best and non-existent at worst.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003"> While the lack of capacity and the long delays in delivering school buildings is massively frustrating for both parents and students who cannot find school places, it is equally impactful on students and staff <i>in situ</i>, who are packed like sardines into cramped classrooms that are no longer fit for purpose. To be honest, it is shameful that in 2022 all of our students do not have equality when it comes to access to education. That is the reality. Some schools do not have a physical education, PE, hall, woodwork room or home economics room because, instead of being in a promised new building, they are left to languish on a waiting list in Marlborough Street or Tullamore.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> Let us talk about examples. Lucan Community College applied for a new school building in 2009. The project proceeded to tender but, 13 years later, those in the school are still waiting. Griffeen Community College had its planning application approved in February this year, but eight months later, the project still has not even gone to tender. Griffeen has been accommodated in Kishoge since it opened. Why do we even open schools when we do not have buildings for them? Should that not be the first step?</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> Holy Family Community School in Rathcoole has been trying to get a new building since I was a student there, which was neither today nor yesterday. The school has more than 900 pupils who are now mostly accommodated in temporary prefabs. In September last year, the school received 280 applications for enrolment but could only accept 180. Its outdated building cannot accommodate students with physical disabilities. That is another reason the school urgently needs a building.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006"> In the next village over, Saggart, is Coláiste Pobail Fóla. It is only a stone's throw from Citywest, where a large number of Ukrainians are being accommodated. That school is having to turn away a lot of those children because it does not have extra capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007"> We know housing is the biggest challenge facing this Government and areas such as mine are playing a role in resolving the crisis. More homes are being built and more estates are popping up, but they need to be met with amenities, infrastructure and adequate capacity for our schools. Across the board in my constituency, school building projects are languishing at tender stage with no sign of movement and no ground being broken. That must change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008"> I am asking the Minister to expedite the tender process to get boots on the ground in our schools and to start building across Dublin Mid-West. The delivery of a new school building is a welcome event for communities. It generates hope and excitement. The Minister saw that first-hand just last month at the opening of Stewarts School in Lucan. In Dublin Mid-West, we have many school communities in desperate need of the hope and excitement new school buildings would bring.</p>

          <speech by="#NormaFoley" as="#Minister_for_Education" eId="spk_358">
            <from>Minister for Education (Deputy Norma Foley)<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T23:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1009">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. It gives me the opportunity to set out for the House the position with regard to the delivery of school building projects under the national development plan in Dublin Mid-West. To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places throughout the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Where the demographic data indicate additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through using existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or the provision of a new school or schools. The requirement for additional school places is kept under ongoing review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010"> The Deputy will be aware that, following analysis of demographics and planned residential development, a new primary school was announced to serve the Clondalkin school planning area. My Department is monitoring the pace of residential development and population growth in that area with a view to determining the appropriate timing for the establishment of this new school. Under Project 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion in capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty in our ambitious plans and deliver high-quality building projects with a real focus on sustainability for school communities throughout Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made in adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. The investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011"> The Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements in this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department's large-scale and additional accommodation scheme. These projects are in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period to 2025. A list of all completed and ongoing capital projects under the large-scale and additional accommodation scheme in county order from 2010 to date may be viewed on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012"> As can be seen from the list on the website, a significant number of school building projects are underway or have been completed across the Dublin Mid-West area, with 30 large-scale and additional school accommodation scheme projects currently across various stages of planning and delivery. I note the Deputy referenced a school that has been waiting for additional accommodation since 2009. I have been Minister for two years. I will give the Deputy the update on my term as Minister. A large-scale project at the Clondalkin schools campus is currently at tender stage. This will provide new 16-classroom school buildings for Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin and Gaelscoil na Camóige, as well as enhanced facilities for Coláiste Chillian. While there have been some challenges, this joint major project is anticipated to be on site in quarter 2 of 2023, subject to planning and tendering processes, as is always the case. The Department is also delivering a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school building for Holy Family Community School, Rathcoole, which is expected to commence construction in quarter 1 of 2023. A project at Griffeen Community College, Lucan, which the Deputy mentioned, is expected to proceed to tender later this year. A project at Coláiste Pobail Fóla at Citywest is also expected to proceed to tender later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013"> The Citywest campus project also includes a new 16-classroom primary school for Gaelscoil Lir. New 24-classroom primary school buildings are being provided for Scoil Áine Naofa and St. Thomas's National School, Lucan, as part of my Department's ADAPT 3 building programme, and the programme's project manager will shortly be commencing the process to appoint a design team for the project. Large-scale extensions at Divine Mercy junior and senior schools, Lucan, are currently at detailed design stage. A significant extension at St. Joseph's College, Lucan, is at construction. An extension at Lucan Community College was recently authorised to proceed to tender for the appointment of a building contractor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014"> Recently completed projects include a new 28-classroom school for Stewarts Hospital Special School, as the Deputy referenced, and a new 16-classroom primary school for Citywest Educate Together National School and Citywest and Saggart Community National School.</p>

            <p eId="para_1015">I thank the Minister for that response and those helpful updates. Her commitment to delivering for students in Dublin Mid-West is welcome and we all hope those tenders and construction projects go according to plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016"> I will take the opportunity to put on the record the primary schools in my area that are also due new buildings. Those include Scoil Chrónáin in Rathcoole; St. Thomas's and Scoil Áine Naofa in Lucan, which are part of the ADAPT programme to accelerate delivery; Divine Mercy junior and senior in Balgaddy; the Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin and Gaelscoil na Camóige campus, which will also deliver a PE hall for Coláiste Chillian; and Rathcoole Educate Together, another school open without a permanent building.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017"> I cannot stress enough that speeding up the tender process would be transformative for many of the school building projects in my constituency. This seems to be the stage at which things grind to a halt. That needs to be addressed immediately if we are to turn things around for schools such as Holy Family Community School, Lucan Community College, Griffeen Community College and Coláiste Pobail Fóla.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> On a positive note, St. Joseph's College in Lucan broke ground on its new school building three weeks ago, as the Minister noted. It was a long time coming but I was delighted to be there to celebrate the occasion with the principal, Ms Fitzgerald, and the wider school community. I cannot wait to be there for the grand opening when construction is complete. Seeing that work finally start has given the school a new lease of life and an excitement and hope for the future. That sense of excitement and hope for the future is what I want for all of the schools in my constituency. I know the Minister wants that too. I ask her to do everything in her power to deliver our new school buildings as quickly as possible because schools in Dublin Mid-West cannot wait much longer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">I appreciate the Deputy's particular interest in all matters related to education. I acknowledge a fairly significant commitment in that there are more than 30 large-scale and additional school accommodation scheme projects currently at various stages of planning and delivery for the Dublin Mid-West area. That is a positive story to present this evening. I have taken the opportunity to reference so many of them, in particular, the Clondalkin school campus, which is at tender stage. Other projects are at various stages. The Deputy referenced many of them, including Holy Family Community School, which will be a 1,000 pupil post-primary school that is expected to commence construction in 2023. She also noted the positive news for St. Joseph's, for example, and the breaking of ground. I know how important that visual, on-the-ground progress is. We also specifically referenced the expectation of proceeding to tender for Griffeen Community College, which will take place later this year. Coláiste Pobail Fóla will also go to tender this year. The Citywest campus project the Deputy referred to is significant and is part of the ADAPT 3 building programme. The project manager has now proceeded to appoint a design team for that project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020"> This is a significant investment by the Department and a major acknowledgement of the facilities that are required in the area, notwithstanding that schools are doing tremendous work with the facilities they currently have. We have an ambition to support them in moving forward with the facilities they might require for the future. It is comprehensive and very much an acknowledgement of the excellent work that is ongoing in the delivery of education that we are matching it with the provision of appropriate school buildings.</p>

            <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T23:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1021">This Topical Issue matter deals specifically with the issue of the income limits in place for social housing applicants. Many people are surprised to learn that social housing income limits are a relatively new concept. They were introduced, to its shame, by a Labour Party Minister after the financial crash. In my view, and I have yet to be corrected on this, they were introduced with a single purpose, namely, to reduce the number of people on local authority housing lists without having to go to the bother of actually providing them with homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022"> Previously, in order to be allocated a council house, applicants were awarded points that considered pertinent facts, such as the length of time waiting and current living conditions, taking into account issues such as overcrowding or medical needs. Income was also a factor in determining how high on the list an applicant would be. Since the introduction of the limits, however, income has become not a consideration but a mechanism to prevent people from getting on the housing list at all. The limits have become symbolic of a cruel housing policy enthusiastically embraced by this Government. The fact that the limits have not been amended, apart from some minor exceptions, for more than a decade tells its own story.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023"> I have previously told the House of some of the outworkings of this policy, such as the young single parent working in a low-paid job. She is currently living in her parents' home sharing a boxroom with her child and was provisionally offered a house last month. Her joy can be imagined but after she completed the paperwork she was informed that she exceeded the income limit by €1,500 a year or €28 a week. The offer of housing was withdrawn and, worse than that, she has now been removed from the housing list entirely meaning that should she reapply if her income reduces, she will go to the back of the queue. I have also told of numerous couples who have been removed from the housing list because one of them got a job. It is essentially that. In the county in which I live, Monaghan, a couple with two children cannot apply for social housing support if their earnings are more than €27,500 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024"> Not satisfied with this cruel policy, the Department has changed its position and now dictates that it has to be implemented as harshly as possible. Income is considered across a 12-month period meaning a little summer overtime can result in removal from the housing list. The Minister committed to a review last autumn. He has received that review but rather than proceeding to change the income limits the issue has been kicked off to the Housing Agency, which has been asked to scope and develop options for a revised or new housing income eligibility model. It stands in stark contrast to the actions of the Government if it was told of a particular issue that was affecting an industry or a valued vested interest in the eyes of the Government. As this is affecting people at the coalface who are bearing the brunt of the Government's housing failures, it is delay after delay. I do not yet have any sense that anyone in the Government realises the absolute devastation these income limits are causing countless thousands of individuals and families. I hope the Minister of State can tell me that this scandal is about to end. </p>

            <p eId="para_1025">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as an gceist seo. The overarching principle of social housing support is to provide adequate housing support to those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources. Applications for such supports are assessed by local authorities in accordance with eligibility and need criteria as set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated social housing assessment regulations. The regulations introduced a standard system for assessing applicants for social housing support in 2011 and established a fairer, more consistent and transparent approach to determining eligibility for support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1026">We need to set some things out in order to avoid any confusion. Social housing tenants pay rent in direct proportion to their income. Despite the impression that is sometimes given of free houses, there is no incentive for wealthy people to apply for a council house because they will probably pay more rent than they would in the private sector and certainly more than they would for a mortgage. As they currently stand, income limits are simply preventing people who will never qualify for a mortgage from accessing the alternative means of securing a permanent home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> The Minister of State talked about the cost to the State of providing social housing. Therein lies a cultural issue that goes to the very heart of the Custom House, which is this notion that people are getting charity when they are allocated a council house.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">They pay rent in direct proportion to their income. When done right there is no cost to the State. There is a substantial saving to the State because this year the geniuses who wrote this reply for the Minister are standing over the expenditure of more than €1 billion in private subsidies to landlords in order to cover up the debacle that has led to the overall housing crisis we have. The income limits are a small part but they are a cruel, harsh aspect of this policy in action. They are part of an overall policy that has led to the ghettoisation and demonisation of those who find themselves in need of housing support. The Minister of State referred to a scoping exercise which is to be completed by the end of this year.

            <p eId="para_1029">I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Carthy in the sense that there is a cost to the Exchequer. It is an outlay and an investment by the Exchequer in the provision of social housing. The Government has committed to and is front-loading record investment in social, affordable and cost-rental housing, more than any Government has provided in the history of the State. The Minister is deeply committed to that through Housing for All.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030"> I fully agree that social housing is not charity. Families pay rent. It has been a very good model. The provision of social housing certainly declined in previous years and the State is playing catch-up and doing so at scale. It is critically important that this Government and Governments in the coming decades continue to invest in social and affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031"> The Minister has stated several times previously that he is committed to implementing these changes once the Housing Agency's scoping report and review have been completed. We recognise that the current models do not work and are not reflective of modern incomes and the modern needs of families. There is a commitment by the Minister and we will continue with the investment in social housing in particular. The State has done this very well through the decades. The phase we are implementing through Housing for All is a new one comparable with what happened in the 1940s and 1950s. We can do this at scale and it is critically important that we do. I give the Deputy a commitment, on behalf of the Minister, that this will be implemented.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T00:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1032">I thank the Minister for Education for attending but I am disappointed the Minister for Justice is not here. I know it is late but it is not good enough that she is not prepared to take this Topical Issue matter. I attended a meeting last Thursday night in Moyle Rovers GAA Club, Clonmel. I thank the caretaker, Mr. O'Connor. More than 500 people came from far and near in fear and trepidation. Many of these wonderful people provided a community centre and provide for their families and community in the excellent parish of Powerstown Lisronagh and the town of Clonmel and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033"> We have an appalling lack of gardaí in Clonmel. It is historic. To give a comparison with Kilkenny, on any given day or shift, there would be 12 or at least ten gardaí in Kilkenny whereas we have four, five or six in Clonmel. It is the same in Wexford town and Thurles up the road from us, which have plenty of gardaí. We do not have the numbers in Clonmel Garda station, which covers Carrick-on-Suir, Fethard, Mullinahone and other areas. Cahir is suffering badly as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034"> I will challenge one thing tonight. The meeting was attended by Superintendent Willie Leahy, Sergeant Kieran O'Regan and other gardaí who were off duty and live in the area. We heard loud and clear that many people are being intimidated by roving gangs under the auspices of lamping and hunting, both of which are illegal. They are doing awful damage, frightening livestock and householders, damaging wire, waterpipes, land and property and injuring cattle. People telephoning the Garda station last week were told that the incidents were not being reported. There is something badly wrong. This is the nub of my question tonight. I believe the figures for the numbers of complaints to An Garda Síochána both nationally and locally are being manicured. We have a joint policing committee, JPC, meeting on Friday at which I hope to explore this matter further with Chief Superintendent Derek Smart who is very amenable, in fairness. Superintendent Leahy will also be at the meeting. The crime statistics being rolled out show they are down here and there. The Garda numbers are appallingly low. I am shocked that there are only 20 - fiche - gardaí in Templemore. I am shocked that there were not enough applications to fill the last vacancy. This is a worrying situation. Why is that? It is because the Garda is not being resourced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035"> I put it to the Garda Commissioner, and lay it at his door again tonight, that he is putting Garda lives in danger by not giving them enough backup and support. I do not say that lightly. It is shocking to expect a single garda, male or female, to be out alone at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. in rural areas or in a town. We have huge problems in Clonmel, a fine midland town that used to be the biggest in the country with great people, but drugs and all kinds of anti-social behaviour are taking over in the middle of the day, not to mention at night. Gardaí are in danger of losing these areas. Carrick-on-Suir is the same way, with an appalling lack of numbers. People ring the Garda station and are not getting responses. I am not blaming the gardaí on duty; they are doing their best. They do not have the numbers, support or backup.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036"> We need an emergency task force to be set up to deal with the situation in the Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir district. It needs to be sent in from Dublin or wherever to deal with this problem and strike it out. We also have to deal with the legal eagles in the courts where free legal aid is provided 50, 60 or 100 times. It must be three strikes and you are out. Tagging legislation was passed by this House. I do not know if anybody has ever been tagged. Tagging is not likely for people with several convictions. They should be tagged to determine where they are and to be able to trace their whereabouts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037"> We see heinous crimes committed by people out on bail and not on remand. We see the revolving doors. It is totally unacceptable for decent people who pay their taxes and deserve the protection of the law. They pay for community and text alert schemes out of their own pockets. The people are willing. No police force in the world can police without the support of the people. The Garda has the support of the people or will have it, but there needs to be a <i>quid pro quo </i>and the Garda needs to have resources and the numbers to help when it is needed.</p>

          <speech by="#NormaFoley" eId="spk_366" as="#Minister_for_Education">
            <from>Deputy Norma Foley<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T00:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1038">I thank Deputy McGrath for raising the issue. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039"> The Deputy will appreciate that under section 26 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, which includes the allocation of Garda resources. The Minister for Justice has no statutory role in regard to these operational policing matters. The Minister is assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends to ensure their optimal use. I understand it is a matter for the divisional chief superintendent to determine the optimal distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the division.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040"> The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs to perform its critical role in the community. In budget 2023 an unprecedented €2.14 billion was allocated to An Garda Síochána, representing an increase of €78 million on 2022. This includes provision for the recruitment of 1,000 new gardaí and more than 400 Garda staff. I am informed that as of 31 August 2022, there were 399 Garda members assigned to the Tipperary division. Clonmel district is comprised of five stations with 76 Garda members assigned to it. This represents an increase of more than 4% since the end of December 2019. The district is supported by 17 Garda staff assigned to Clonmel station as of the end of August this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041"> The Government has committed to building a new Garda station in Clonmel as part of the justice sector private-public partnership. This is being done alongside a proposed new station in Macroom, County Cork, and a family law complex at Hammond Lane, Dublin 7. Planning permission was granted for the new station in 2021. The Department continues to engage with An Garda Síochána, the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency with a view to progressing the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042"> The construction of the new Garda station in Clonmel is an important development for policing in the area. Once completed the station will provide a modern, fit-for-purpose facility for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with gardaí. The Deputy may be aware that the Garda Commissioner is continuing the roll-out of the new Garda operating model. The operating model is designed to make each division the central unit of policing administration rather than the current smaller district model and will provide more front-line gardaí, increased Garda visibility and a wider range of policing services for local areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">In the period 2017 to 31 August 2022, 875.5 Garda members were reassigned to operational roles under the Garda reassignment initiative, and a further 306 posts were identified as suitable for civilianisation and redeployment in line with the programme for Government commitment to boost the redeployment of Garda members from non-core duties to front-line duties for the benefit of communities across the country, including that of Clonmel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044"> The Minister is conscious of the particular crime concerns facing rural communities. The publication just last month of Rural Safety Plan 2022–2024 by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, seeks to address these and provide support information to rural communities. The plan is available at <i>www.gov.ie/justice</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1045">That is a shocking reply. The Minister for Justice needs to take heed. She is accountable to this House. I am sick and tired of Ministers coming in here to refer to the Garda Commissioner, head of the HSE and all these people. They are not elected or accountable to the people. We are supposed to have a Government here. We are celebrating 100 years of our freedom, having set up our Republic. The response is shocking. The Minister for Education can read out all the figures she likes. What about retirements? What about people who are out sick? What about people on other duties? These are masked by the figures. Court duty takes up an enormous amount of time. The Judiciary here must be tackled as well. It should not be tackled, as such, but the laws must be changed so they will not be so lenient. The revolving door must stop and tagging should be introduced immediately. The public must be reassured that the Garda has the resources. It does not have them, despite the figures about lay people being appointed and all the rest of it. We have good lay staff in Clonmel and good reserve gardaí serving Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. We have good community police in Sergeant O'Regan, Sergeant Denis Ryan, Fiona, Clare and Diarmuid but they have not enough given the size of Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. We are talking about a community of 30,000-plus. Calls are going unanswered and are not being logged. A person told me this evening he got the first Garda victims-of-crime report after having made about 20 phone calls. It was the first one he got this week. Therefore, it is quite clear that the figures are being manicured and distorted to give a different situation. The Minister needs to cop on to that, deal with it and not hide behind this charade. Garda members are unable to deal with the phone calls. Somebody has to man the station all the time and then deal with calls. There are people waiting two, three or four hours, or maybe no one turns up. That is not the fault of the gardaí; it is the fault of the system. I am holding the Commissioner to account. He is entitled to protect his members and the citizens of this country. For the Minister for Education to read out waffle from the Minister for Justice of the kind she read out is simply unforgivable. It is despicable and disgraceful. I do not have words in my vocabulary to describe how bad it is. It is time we copped on, cut out the dead wood, dealt honestly with the hard-working people and protected them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1046">Again, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The Minister would like to reassure him that Garda numbers have increased substantially in recent years, from 12,943 Garda members and 1,999 Garda staff in 2016 to 14,283 Garda members and 3,117 Garda staff at the end of August this year. This is an increase in gardaí of more than 10%. There has been an almost 56% increase in Garda staff in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047"> The Government has made an ongoing and firm commitment to support An Garda Síochána financially and provide it with the resources it needs to support more visible policing. This method will ensure that communities such as Clonmel are safe and that the people in them feel safe. However, I emphasise that, as recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, responsibility for community safety does not rest solely with an Garda or the Department of Justice. It is a whole-of-government responsibility. This principle is the cornerstone of the Government's policy on community safety and, significantly, will be provided for in law by the new policing security and community safety Bill. Under the legislation, when drafted, new, broader local community-safety partnerships will bring all services in the community together at local authority level, replacing the existing joint policing committees to serve as a comprehensive forum for discussion and decisions on community priorities. Three partnerships are currently being piloted and their operational experiences will feed into nationwide policy roll-out following the conclusion of the pilot period at the end of 2023.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048"> I will relay to the Minister for Justice the points the Deputy has raised but I reiterate that, since 31 August 2022, there have been 399 Garda members assigned to County Tipperary. Clonmel district is comprised of five stations with 76 Garda members assigned to it. This represents an increase of more than 4% since end December 2019. The district has been supported by 17 Garda staff, assigned to Clonmel station at the end August this year. I will bring the points the Deputy has raised to the attention of the Minister for Justice. That is the update I have received.</p>

            <p eId="para_1049">In Carlow town, we are so very fortunate to have the VISUAL Centre for Contemporary Art &amp; The George Bernard Shaw Theatre, one of Ireland's leading contemporary arts spaces. It opened in 2009. With its beautiful gallery space and performance area, it is an incredible amenity to have. VISUAL houses a 335-seat theatre and the largest white-cube gallery space in the country. It produces a programme of both commissioned and existing high-quality national and international contemporary art, plus a host of performances, including dance, film, comedy literature and music. Its values have inclusion and collaboration at their core. The communities of Carlow and Ireland as a whole have been gifted so much by the centre. In its mission statement, VISUAL states it is committed to identifying and removing physical, social and economic barriers to support, foster and provide opportunities for arts participation in our communities. However, funding is a large barrier to completing this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050"> Just recently, the company operating the centre had to seek a subvention from Carlow County Council of nearly €90,000 because it needed to make up a shortfall in funding and meet operational costs for the year. Carlow arts centre, which is owned by the council, wrote to the council asking it for funding due to the increased energy and utility costs, a lack of audiences due to Covid and reductions in VAT recoupment. It is not the first time that the centre has gone to council looking for extra money. I am genuinely worried about the future of VISUAL. Giving money from local authority funds means something else gets cut. I have raised the issue of the theatre not being sufficiently accessible to community groups because of the cost of hiring the venue. This is not acceptable. The arts should be for all to enjoy. That is a huge issue for me when working with community groups that want to hire VISUAL. Owing to the cost, they cannot afford to do so. That is not right.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051"> Currently, all funding from the Arts Council goes to the gallery at the centre but the theatre does not receive Government funding. VISUAL was set up initially as a limited company to allow it to participate in the capital goods scheme and avail of VAT recoupment during the construction phase. Now is the time to address the problem. VISUAL, one of Ireland's leading contemporary arts spaces, needs funding. VISUAL was an €18 million development, a project jointly funded by the local authority and with a grant of €3.17 million from the Department under the access programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">Carlow County Council and the Arts Council have provided funding in the past; however, neither will have such resources following Covid-19. It will be like borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053"> The centre is regularly involved in making funding applications but we can support it and what it is trying to do if we just bring it under the Department and allocate funding from central government. I am seeking that today. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, several times and to every Minister I could to try to get funding for VISUAL. We have the most beautiful arts space and theatre that you ever came across. It is right in the centre of Carlow town. We are so proud of it but we do not get enough funding. We need to avail of the funding stream from the Government, but that is not happening at present. I ask the Minister to ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to provide funding from central government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NormaFoley" eId="spk_370" as="#Minister_for_Education">
            <from>Deputy Norma Foley<recordedTime time="2022-10-11T00:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1054">As the Deputy will be aware, I am presenting this information on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055"> Primary support for the arts is delivered by the Arts Council. In 2022, the Minister allocated a record €130 million to the Arts Council. She was pleased to retain the €130 million in funding for the council in 2023 in recognition of the transformational impact that funding has had on the development of the sector, enabling the council to support more artists and arts organisations than ever before.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003 and the Minister or officials in her Department cannot intervene in this decision-making.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057"> Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities. Current funding provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensure that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Local authorities are central to the support and development of the arts in Ireland through their own arts offices and through the resourcing and funding of arts centres. </p>
            <p eId="para_1058"> In the context outlined it is understood that the council has made a number of funding awards to the arts centre referred to by the Deputy. This includes €210,000 of arts centre funding as well as commissions awards under its programme for young people children and education. I also understand that Carlow County Council has been awarded €100,000 by the council under the long-standing local arts partnership funding scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059"> Under the Creative Communities initiative of the Creative Ireland programme, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, provides funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual cultural and creativity strategies from 2018 to 2022. Through Creative Communities, substantial funding has been provided to Carlow County Council for the period 2018 to 2022 and it has supported an extensive programme of engagement across the arts, culture and creativity in County Carlow. </p>
            <p eId="para_1060"> These centres are also supported through capital schemes operated by the Department. The funding is available under the national development plan for cultural and creativity investment programmes. These are closely aligned with Creative Ireland and include a range of investments in regional arts and cultural facilities. </p>
            <p eId="para_1061"> The cultural capital scheme from 2019 to 2022 is a €4.7 million capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres administered by the Department to enhance the existing stock of arts and culture centres across the country. In recent years, the arts centre in question was successful under a number of capital schemes. The centre was also awarded funding under the regional museum exhibition scheme and further details can be accessed on the Department’s website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062"> Capital funding for the outdoor public space scheme has been provided to local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities taking account of public health guidance and of the needs of the local arts community. The Minister awarded €250,000 to Carlow County Council in 2021 to provide an outer public space at the Carlow Exchange in Carlow town. I understand that this project has now been completed and was officially opened last month and will be a centre for a range of social, cultural and educational events in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063"> In summary, the Deputy will know that the arts centre along with the local authority is in receipt of funding from a wide range of public funding sources, including the Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1064">I thank the Minister for her reply and the Minister, Deputy Martin for her funding for the outdoor public space at the Carlow Exchange in Carlow town. This is beautiful for the community. I am aware of the €210,000 awarded by the Arts Council, which I welcome, but again I feel that this answer is not a good one in the sense that we have a fabulous building and a crisis with the cost of living and heating and electrical costs, and the different factors associated with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065"> We are now in a position, having gone through Covid-19, as the Minister will be aware, where one of the most significantly hit sectors was the arts sector when artists through their work could not entertain. In Carlow, groups that were to present visually could not do so because of Covid and this was through no fault of anyone. This brought something of a crisis to that sector. Why do we have a beautiful building? Unless we can sustain it and unless people can use it because they can afford to, such as community groups and artists, then we have a problem. While I welcome and am very thankful for this funding, we need a great deal more funding into the future. From talking to staff of Carlow County Council, I know they are thankful for the funding that has been given, but on the bigger picture and scale going into the future, we need central government funding because if we do not get it, I do not know whether the council can continue putting funding into the VISUAL centre to keep it going.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066"> We have the best volunteers in VISUAL who go in and spend hours of their time giving back to the people of Carlow and all around the country and to everyone who runs it. I am very proud of it but it is important with the cost of living and of everything now, that extra funding be provided. I thank the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_1067">I thank the Deputy. Again, this reply has been delivered by me on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. As outlined previously, primary support for the arts is delivered by the Arts Council. The topic raised by the Deputy asks that funding from the council for a gallery be extended to its in-house theatre. Under the Arts Act of 2003, the council is independent in its funding decisions and the Minister or officials in her Department cannot intervene in this decision-making. It would appear that this is a matter for the centre concerned, in consultation with the Arts Council, and may involve the local authority. The arts centre in question has been successful in sourcing capital funding from the Department under its capital schemes over a number of years. Under budget 2023, additional capital funding is proposed for the arts, which will include a new capital scheme, details of which will be announced in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068"> I acknowledge the passion and belief the Deputy has in the provision of this arts centre and I also acknowledge, as she has outlined herself, the tremendous work of volunteers who have lent so much to this particular centre. She spoke passionately of the importance the arts and I could not agree with her more in that respect. It is important that we do all that we can to seek to support that sector into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069"> I reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Martin stated in her reply where she has made it clear that a number funding streams have been made available to this particular arts centre, and that is as it should be. She specifically referred to the €210,000 and other streams of funding, which the Deputy has particularly welcomed. I will communicate to the Minister the passion with which the Deputy has spoken on this issue, the importance of this facility to all of Carlow and to the advancement and enhancement of the arts programme, the provision and sustainability of the arts into the future, and the Deputy's determination to secure that in the future.</p>
