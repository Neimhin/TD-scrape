            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Brendan Smith</b> asked the <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> if he will provide an update regarding the actions he has taken to progress the completion of the Haass talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">It is most disappointing that there has not been a successful conclusion to the Haass talks, which concern issues of the utmost importance to the people of Northern Ireland and of all of this island. We need a satisfactory means of dealing with the contentious issues of parades, flags and contending with the past. Time is not on our side to reach a successful conclusion. The lack of a successful outcome will give further momentum to the very disappointing spate of dissident activity and the increase in the number of bombings that have unfortunately occurred recently in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The Government welcomes that the political talks on parades, flags and identity issues and dealing with the past have resumed following a break over the St. Patrick’s Day period. As the Tánaiste has said previously in this House, it was disappointing that the party leaders had not made more progress in their discussions before St. Patrick’s Day, following the substantial work done under the chairmanship of Dr. Richard Haass and Dr. Meghan O'Sullivan before the new year. It is regrettable that the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, is not participating currently in these discussions which are focused on issues of genuine and great concern to so many people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The Tánaiste met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Monday of this week to discuss the talks and the support which both Governments are giving to the process. They are both firmly of the view that Northern Ireland urgently requires a new way forward on dealing with the past that can command public confidence. They agreed also that the early successful conclusion of the political talks represents the best opportunity to make progress across all three important areas of parades, flags and identity issues and dealing with the past. Maintaining the <i>status quo</i> in relation to these issues is not a feasible or satisfactory option for anyone. The Tánaiste has spoken recently with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and with the leaders of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and the Alliance Party. All have confirmed to him their commitment to reaching a deal. There is an expectation now that they will deliver. These are all difficult issues with the potential to destabilise political and civic life in Northern Ireland if left unresolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> As the Tánaiste said at the Alliance Party conference in Belfast last week, the Northern Ireland Executive parties can count on the full support of both Governments as they carry this work forward. Getting the frameworks for peace and reconciliation right and fully functioning is important for stability and security. It is vital also that greater priority be given to setting the right conditions for economic growth and job creation, especially for young people. We all have a common interest in that. The Government wants to see an early agreement as we believe it is in the best interests of Northern Ireland, and the Tánaiste will continue to engage closely with the British Government and the Northern Irish parties over the coming weeks towards that end.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Minister for his reply. I welcome the particular phraseology he used towards the end of his contribution when he said there is an expectation of delivery. We hope that can be achieved. My one concern, which I have reiterated in this House on numerous occasions, is that there does not seem to be the urgency attached to these talks that there needs to be. We missed the end of year deadline. St. Patrick's week should have been another milestone to try to reach conclusions. We are now into the European and local elections phase. After the end of May we will be into the parading season. None of those times is conducive to making progress on some contentious political issues. It is time for both Governments to take a more hands-on approach to these very important issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">We must remember that both sovereign Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement. We need to see progress on the issues concerning our entire island, be it the Downing Street Declaration, the Good Friday Agreement or the St. Andrews Agreement, all of which were driven very much by the leadership of both sovereign Governments. The issues to be concluded in the Haass talks are of extreme importance as well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I can categorically assure him of the urgency and priority that is being given to the successful conclusion of these talks and negotiations. We are aware of the very difficult and dangerous backdrop to these discussions, to which the Deputy referred. We all know that since 2009 dissident and terrorist groups have now been responsible for the deaths of two British Army personnel, two PSNI officers and a member of the Northern Ireland Prison Service. The ongoing threat posed by many of these groups is very dangerous. We are aware of the very positive backdrop that is to come from the State visit that is due to take place next week. I recounted in my earlier answer to the Deputy's question the level of engagement and contribution the Tánaiste has made to this issue in the past number of weeks alone through direct engagement with the leaders in Northern Ireland and direct engagement with the Government of the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p eId="para_10">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I want to reiterate my commendation of the work of the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Sinn Féin Party prior to the end of the year in making a genuine effort to reach agreement. It is most regrettable that the UUP has now withdrawn from those five-party talks. I believe that more urgency needs to be attached to this. If we have it in the back of our minds that progress cannot be made until after the European and local elections, then we will be into another season of marching with all its attendant problems. Could the minister of State give us a very clear commitment that the Government along with its co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government, will give these talks that extra momentum and give the process leadership to ensure that these contentious issues are dealt with? We do not want to have a weekend such as the one we had in Lurgan very recently or increased dissident activity. We had all hoped that this was gone from our island. That trouble caused by a very small minority in Northern Ireland cannot be allowed to fester.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">The key line in my earlier answer is that there is an expectation that all parties that are involved in this must and should deliver. It is crucial that momentum is maintained to deliver a prompt conclusion to these vital negotiations. I also want to acknowledge the role that all parties are playing in this and to articulate my regret that the UUP has withdrawn. I have already made clear the huge level of commitment and priority the Government places on a prompt conclusion of these negotiations. As I said, the Tánaiste has already engaged directly with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and with the leaders of the key parties in Northern Ireland and is maintaining his engagement with the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, in regard to these negotiations. It is vital we allow all those who were involved directly within the framework to continue their work to deliver a prompt conclusion to these negotiations while underpinning throughout all of this the very strong commitment of both Governments to seeing a prompt and successful conclusion to these negotiations to ensure the dangers of the past can be averted for the future and to ensure all communities in Northern Ireland have the safe and secure future that everyone in this House wants to see happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">3. <b>Deputy Mick Wallace</b> asked the <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> the basis for his assertion that the use of Shannon Airport by the US military is not in breach of Ireland's policy of neutrality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_14">The Tánaiste has previously stated that he strongly supports neutrality and that it is a central element of Ireland's foreign policy. Given this clear commitment to the idea of neutrality, why does the Government continue to allow Shannon Airport to be used by the US military?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, which has been pursued by successive Governments, is characterised by non-participation in military alliances. This policy has been underpinned by a set of complementary values which includes the protection of human rights, support for development and the promotion of disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Ireland’s policy of military neutrality has gone hand-in-hand with our belief that international engagement is critical to enhance co-operation and to reduce conflict in the world. Ireland has consistently sought to engage directly in the promotion of international peace and security through our bilateral contacts and multilateral efforts with the United Nations and the European Union. We have a long-standing and recognised record of participation in international crisis management, which is underpinned by our commitment to fulfil our obligation as members of the UN to provide assistance in any action which the Security Council takes in accordance with the United Nations Charter. This is founded on the basis that primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security rests with the UN Security Council. </p>
            <p eId="para_17"> Successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States for well over 50 years. These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with the United States and are governed by strict conditions. These include stipulations that the aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations. I therefore see no incompatibility between the use of Shannon Airport and our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p>

          <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">In 2006 the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said "not knowing is not good enough". He also said "Why has the Government not complied with the request from the Human Rights Commission to inspect the aircraft through Shannon?" I do not know how he can have that position when in opposition and have a different position when in power. Now we do not want to know if there is anything on the planes. It was interesting to hear what Shannonwatch said yesterday:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_19"> Recent disturbing revelations in relation to the behaviour of Garda management and the Minister for Justice give new significance to statements made by members of An Garda Síochána about instructions not to search suspected CIA rendition and US military aircraft at Shannon Airport.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_20"> Over the last eight years, Gardaí of various ranks have told members of Shannonwatch that an "instruction" or "policy decision" or "letter of advice" has existed in relation to the searching of these aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">Can the Government clarify whether the Garda has been strictly instructed that under no circumstances are gardaí to search these planes even if they suspect that there are arms on board? How are we to know about that? No one in his or her right mind would take America's word for anything given its history. Wikileaks has strongly brought this to the fore. If we want to know whether Shannon is being used for military purposes, the dogs on the street know that we need to look, otherwise how can we possibly know?</p>

            <p eId="para_22">I thank the Deputy for his question. I want to respond to two of the main questions he has put to me. On the first one regarding the allegations and claims that Irish airports have been used in some way for extraordinary rendition, I want to emphasise again to the House that the Government has on several occasions made it very clear to the United States Government that it would be illegal to transit prisoners for rendition purposes through Irish territory without the express permission of the Irish authorities, acting in accordance with Irish and international law. The United States authorities have made it very clear to this Government in response to that point that they have not done so and would not do so without seeking the permission of Irish authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">On the point the Deputy put to me regarding the inspection of airports, a system for dealing with requests for landing of military aircraft at Shannon Airport already is in place and already is fully implemented. It is kept under full review to make sure it is fully complied with. As already has been indicated to the Deputy, a practice is in place, which is in accordance with international practice, that foreign military aircraft passing through Ireland with the permission of the Government are not subject to routine searches or inspections. The principle of sovereign immunity applies automatically to foreign state or military aircraft, as it applies to our own.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">Were a boat to land in west Cork and were the Garda to suspect there were drugs on board, would gardaí ask the person who owns it whether he had drugs on the boat or might they search it to ascertain for themselves whether there were drugs on board? The same point applies to the aeroplanes. One will not know whether the law is being upheld and whether America is doing what it states it is doing unless one takes a look.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Will the Government consider holding a referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution? A recent Red C poll commissioned by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance last year shows overwhelming public support for neutrality, standing at 78%. Moreover, that figure rises to 85% for young people under the age of 34. The Government surely can agree that Ireland could demonstrate its commitment to neutrality by acceding to Chapter V of the Hague Convention of 1907. Members have discussed this matter a number of times but will the Government consider enshrining the aforementioned Hague Convention in order that Ireland is a signed-up member thereof? This would do away with a lot of the confusion. Ireland either will be a neutral country that takes a neutral position or it will not and will take sides. Sadly, it appears very much as though Ireland is taking sides.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I thank the Deputy for the question. In respect of neutrality, as the Deputy would expect I am a strong supporter of Ireland's neutrality. In my current role, I can discern the huge benefit it brings to Ireland to allow the Government to conduct its foreign policy in line with the values I believe Irish people to have. On the Deputy's point regarding a referendum, there are no such plans to hold a referendum. As the Deputy will be aware, the Hague Convention to which he referred includes a highly specific definition of what is a country's neutrality or what it should be. Ireland has a long-standing commitment to military neutrality and to the complementary values thereof, as I articulated in my earlier response to the Deputy. Moreover, the practice that is in place regarding the use of Ireland's airports by aircraft from other countries recognises this.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> As to the point made by the Deputy regarding the arrival of a ship that potentially has drugs on board and the question asked as to what would be the response, the key response is that as the Deputy will be aware, if concerned individuals have concerns that the law and policy are being broken, they should provide evidence of that to An Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">Russia's seizure and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region has caused the deepest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, thereby leading the United States and the European Union to impose sanctions on Moscow. They have stated they will strengthen these sanctions if Russia moves beyond Crimea into eastern Ukraine. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, had the opportunity to engage on different occasions with the ambassadors of both Ukraine and Russia. The joint committee held vigorous debates and a strong exchange of views in respect of particular issues that have arisen as a result of the illegal activity by Russia. What was the outcome of the discussions, if any, the Tánaiste or the Minister of State had with representatives of both countries?</p>

            <p eId="para_32">Ireland has strongly condemned Russian actions from the outset of this crisis. The annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol following the illegal referendum on 16 March is a flagrant violation of international law, including some of its most fundamental norms. For its part, the Ukrainian Government is to be commended on the measured response it has shown in the face of this provocation. There is an urgent need for Moscow to take steps to de-escalate the situation and this must include engaging in serious talks with the government in Kiev without further delay. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Tánaiste called in the Russian ambassador on 3 March to express his deep concern over Russia’s actions and asked him to convey this to his authorities in Moscow. The ambassador also met a senior official in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 19 March and again on 31 March and was informed of the Government's firm view that the referendum in Crimea was illegal and that it did not accept the outcome. Senior officials in the Department also continue to have regular contact with the ambassador of Ukraine, who has expressed his government’s appreciation for Ireland’s support and solidarity.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> At the EU level, the deepening crisis in Ukraine led to the convening of two extraordinary sessions of the Foreign Affairs Council. There also was an extraordinary Heads of State and Government meeting on 6 March, as well as the European Council meeting on 20 and 21 March, which had a comprehensive discussion on developments. At the latter meeting the member states and Ukraine signed the political provisions of the association agreement with Ukraine. In addition, the Union is providing financial assistance to the new government in Kiev worth up to €11 billion. At that meeting, the EU leaders also set out a three-stage framework, of which the Deputy is aware, on measures that have been taken or which could be taken, were the situation to destabilise further.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The first two phases, namely, suspension of talks on visa matters and a new agreement on trade, as well as travel restrictions and an asset freeze against Russian and Ukrainian officials, already have been implemented. </p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The conclusions adopted by the European Council on 20 and 21 March recalled that any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would entail far-reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas. In this respect, the European Council has tasked the Commission and the member states to prepare possible targeted measures. Ireland is engaged in the continuing discussions with our partners in Brussels on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The EU has a special responsibility for peace and stability in Europe. It will remain at the forefront of efforts to facilitate and engage in a meaningful dialogue involving Ukraine and Russia, including through the establishment of a multilateral mechanism, with a view to finding a political solution. </p>

            <p eId="para_39">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have stated in this House previously, as has my party leader, Deputy Martin, that Fianna Fáil fully supports the Government's position in condemning the illegal actions by Russia. We believe the decision by the European Council to extend the list of persons subject to sanctions was a reasonable reaction. It is welcome that at least the European Union is working together on this issue. Moreover, the propaganda that has been put out by the Russian authorities and the Russian Government on a constant basis must be counteracted. The message again must be put across clearly that the referendum that was held was completely illegitimate. Are there further proposals by the European Union to have further meetings or discussions at Council of Ministers or Heads of Government and State level or with other international blocs such as with the United States, NATO or with whatever international organisation with which it believes it should be engaged on the concerns about the Russian build-up, as well as the concerns about possible action being taken in eastern Ukraine?</p>

            <p eId="para_40">I thank the Deputy for his question. An informal meeting of foreign affairs Ministers will take place tomorrow and on Saturday morning. The main subject for discussion tomorrow is Ukraine and the situation that is taking place in the region. Shortly thereafter, within the next two weeks, there will be a meeting of the foreign affairs Ministers of the European Union at the Foreign Affairs Council, within which I again expect the situation in Ukraine, in Crimea and in the neighbouring region will be the subject and focus of discussion. All of this will take place within the framework that has already been identified. We are now in phase 2 of the framework, where measures against individuals have been put in place, as well as a broader set of measures pertaining to relations between Russia and individual member states and the European Union. I again emphasise it has been made clear that the situation will be reviewed were a further escalation of the situation to occur.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I thank the Minister of State. One of the most recent comments I have heard in this regard was that approximately 40,000 Russian soldiers were deployed on the Ukrainian border, which could pose a particular threat to southern and eastern Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">Further Russian intervention would be a historic mistake. We hope these difficult but important issues can be resolved without the need for further sanctions. We all know how trade sanctions will affect the tentative economic recovery worldwide. Decisions must be taken if someone rides roughshod over people's rights. We hope it will be possible to avoid moving to stage 3 sanctions. The EU must send a clear message that it will stand up for the rights of small states and of people to keep their territorial integrity without interference. </p>

            <p eId="para_43">States have the right to have their borders protected by international law and their people have the right to make decisions in accordance with domestic and international law. It is in Ireland's national interests that those international laws and values are upheld and articulated. We have argued, and the EU has recognised, that the response to what is already a historic mistake and crisis should be careful and deliberate. The Deputy referred to some of the other consequences that could arise. We are aware of the loss of human life, the violation of international law, of the huge difficulty the state of Ukraine is in. I emphasise it is important that the state of Ukraine put in place an inclusive government in accordance with domestic and international law that recognises the rights of all groups and minorities in their own territory.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">We will discuss this issue in more depth later. I, and other Deputies, want to challenge the one-sided presentation of the very serious conflict in Ukraine. Russia is acting in its own interests and flouting international law. A referendum held at gun point is not legitimate and military incursions into another territory are not acceptable but equally, there are very dangerous elements in the Ukrainian Government, some of which are taking over the armed forces. There are alarming indications of intimidation, violence and so on against minorities and political opponents of the Ukrainian regime. The Government must view this in a more balanced way and not line up with a NATO-EU-US manipulation of a crisis in Ukraine.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_50">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 14 and 18 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_51"> As we have previously stated, Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity has given rise to the worst crisis in Europe since the end of the Cold War. Ireland has strongly condemned Russian actions from the outset of the crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> The referendum held in Crimea on 16 March was illegal and its results are without legal effect. Ireland and the great majority of the international community do not recognise the legitimacy of the vote which only served to exacerbate an already dangerous situation. The heavy troop presence in Crimea meant that the so-called referendum was not conducted under what could be considered remotely acceptable conditions. Furthermore, any decision relating to Ukraine's sovereignty or sovereign choices can only be taken without undue external pressure. That 100 UN member states, including Ireland, voted in favour of the UN General Assembly resolution on Ukraine’s territorial integrity on 27 March, with only eleven votes against, is testament to the grave international concern which Russia’s actions have generated. For its part, the EU has commended the measured response shown by the government in Kiev in the face of this provocation. The crisis in Ukraine has dominated the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, over the past few months, leading to the convening of two extraordinary sessions of the FAC and further meetings of the European Council and Heads of State and Government. </p>
            <p eId="para_53"> As a small country, which relies on respect for the rule of law as the fundamental guarantor of stability in the international system, Ireland has taken a strong view on what has happened in Ukraine. At its meeting on 20 and 21 March, the European Council made clear that there is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders in Europe in the 21st century. The council also expressed the view that the Russian actions are in clear breach of the Helsinki process, which in the past 40 years has contributed to overcoming divisions in Europe and building a peaceful and united continent. As a country which had the honour to serve as the Chair in Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, as recently as 2012, I do not see how we could fail to take a strong view on such matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> In regard to the EU’s approach to Ukraine and its integration, it is worth recalling the strongly pro-European sentiments which were in evidence at the mass demonstrations which were held in Independence Square in Kiev following the then President Yanukovych’s decision on 21 November 2013 to suspend talks on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. While there were many factors behind the almost entirely peaceful demonstrations, such as anger with political corruption and economic hardship, the presence of the European flag was testament to the desire of a great number of ordinary Ukrainians to see their country adopt an orientation towards the West. Throughout the period when the protests were taking place, the EU had been clear on the need for a democratic solution achieved through negotiation that would meet the aspirations of the Ukrainian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> At their earlier informal meeting on 6 March, the EU Heads of State and Government set out a three-stage roadmap to which I have referred on several occasions. The European Council adopted conclusions recalling that any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would entail far-reaching consequences. In this respect, the European Council has tasked the Commission and the member states to prepare possible targeted measures. Ireland is engaged in the continuing discussions with our partners in Brussels on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> We strongly support the new interim government in Kiev which took up office on 27 February. The government’s Ministers are drawn from a range of different political groupings, including the Svoboda Party. The new government faces extraordinary challenges as a consequence of the Russian Federation’s flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The European Union has encouraged the new government to ensure that the presidential election on 25 May will be free and fair. </p>
            <p eId="para_57"> Meanwhile, the OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine is already on the ground and includes an Irish staff member on temporary deployment from other field presences.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">Ireland and EU member states want to see a peaceful solution to the current crisis and stand ready to support all talks to achieve this objective.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">Again, we are getting the completely one-sided take on this. It is absolutely true that the demonstrations in Kiev were partly motivated by the corruption of the Yanukovych regime. Unquestionably, it was a corrupt and rotten regime. It is unquestionable that many Ukrainians - in certain parts of the country at least - may look towards Europe as against Russia but that is not the end of the story.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The other side of the story is that Europe knows damn well that there are significant minorities which would look to Russia and that any expansion of the European Union or NATO would be seen as a direct provocation and threat to those minorities. Do not tell me the EU-NATO strategists do not understand these things and that they are stupid or blind to them. They know damn well that it represents a provocation and that Russia has traditionally seen states and places like Crimea as buffer states against rivalry from the West.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">That stuff is archaic but, nonetheless, Europe knew that. Crucially, now in the Kiev government, which the Minister of State said he fully supports, there are extreme right-wing and fascist elements which are dangerous. We have seen some pretty horrific examples of the sort of stuff they are doing. These people have hijacked what may be a legitimate desire for more democracy in Ukraine essentially to implement a dangerous far right and, in some cases, neo-fascist agenda but the Minister of State fully supports this gang.</p>

Any changes to the orientation of Ukraine must take those things into account if one does not want to spark the sort of disaster we saw in the Balkans. The unilateral recognition by Germany of Slovenia and Croatia sparked the civil war in Yugoslavia with disastrous consequences which were absolutely predictable because Yugoslavia was an ethnic patchwork. Everybody knew that if one started to unilaterally recognise certain states, it would be a provocation to others and the result would be ethnic cleansing. The EU is playing with fire in a very dangerous way and giving succour to extreme right-wing elements. The Minister of State should not tell me that EU-US-NATO did not know that. What the hell is NATO doing expanding into eastern Europe when it was supposed to be a Cold War entity? This is dangerous geopolitical expansionism by the EU-US-NATO and it could have very dangerous consequences.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I feel that the self-righteous stance taken by the US and the EU beggars belief. We listened to John Kerry tell us that this is a completely unacceptable breach of international law for which there will be costs. It was interesting to read Seamus Milne in <i>The Guardian</i> last week. He said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_71">That the states which launched the greatest act of unprovoked aggression in modern history on a trumped-up pretext – against Iraq, in an illegal war now estimated to have killed 500,000, along with the invasion of Afghanistan, bloody regime change in Libya, and the killing of thousands in drone attacks on Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, all without UN authorisation – should make such claims is beyond absurdity.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_72">It's not just that western aggression and lawless killing is on another scale entirely from anything Russia appears to have contemplated, let alone carried out – removing any credible basis for the US and its allies to rail against Russian transgressions. But the western powers have also played a central role in creating the Ukraine crisis in the first place.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_73">The US and European powers openly sponsored the protests to oust the corrupt but elected Viktor Yanukovych government, which were triggered by controversy over an all-or-nothing EU agreement which would have excluded economic association with Russia.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Interesting also was the leak from Victoria Nuland that they spent €5 billion investing in destabilising Ukraine for their own economic benefits.</p>

I visited parts of the Balkans in January and saw many of the difficulties still there and the current consequences of the bloodshed and pain that occurred in that region throughout the 1990s.

            <p eId="para_78">I find both of them have behaved abysmally. I remind the Minister of State that when Gorbachev agreed the deal on German unification, the cornerstone of which was that a united Germany would remain in NATO, US Secretary of State Baker assured him that there would be no extension of NATO's jurisdiction one inch to the east. Gorbachev repeated that any extension of the zone of NATO would be unacceptable and Baker's response was that he agreed. One reason Gorbachev has publicly backed Putin - he would not be a fan of his either - is that he has been completely betrayed. Washington believed Russian leaders would blindly do what was bidden, which Yeltsin usually did, and being drunk while he was at it.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> In Chechnya, the US, Britain and Blair gave their blessing to the Russians to go in - "that's different, that's okay". Tens of thousands of people were killed in Chechnya. The Russians raped and absolutely pillaged the place and the US and the EU had no problem with it. Can the Minister of State not see that they play games with this stuff and lives get destroyed? We are taking sides now. Why are we not neutral? I have no time for how Putin or Russia behaves nor do I have time for how the US behaves. We should not take sides with either of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">At least what we have attained, in what has been a debate here, is clarity on where the Deputy is coming from. While the Deputy has condemned what Russia has been doing, he also said that what the European Union has done recently is equivalent. The European Union is not the body which had troops in place when an illegal referendum was being held. It is not the body which has broken international law in regard to what has happened in Ukraine. I have been to Ukraine and, with respect, I feel the same way the Deputy does about the loss of life, about violence and about the misery inflicted on people. I have seen the strength of feeling in Ukraine in response to all of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> The point I want to put to the Deputy, which he seemingly failed to recognise in any of the points he made, is that what the European Union did in its response to what has happened in Ukraine, was in response to the desire of the government in place then, which reflected the views of the country and the communities in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">What the Minister of State calls the goodwill of the European Union is in fact open sponsorship of the protest movements that up-ended Yanukovych, as Deputy Wallace said. Although Yanukovych was corrupt, he was certainly elected. The bottom line concerns what is now in place. I find it quite shocking that the Minister of State said he fully supports the new regime, which contains fascists and anti-Semites and which is absolutely not very healthy. The Minister of State's analysis has failed to take into account the role of the European Union. It is the case that the external struggle to dominate Ukraine has played a key part in this set of circumstances. The point we are making is that the struggle is not confined to Russian interests because the European Union and United States have displayed their interest also at the expense of the Ukrainian people. The Minister of State said he was in Ukraine. Was he in Crimea? Did he talk to the people there? It is absolutely true that the conditions of the referendum there were not healthy and also that a majority in that state support the idea of linking in with Russia. The European Union and the United States are playing a very dangerous game here.</p>

            <p eId="para_96"> With regard to what Deputy Durkan stated, the difficulties and problems that can arise with democratically elected governments are the reason for the current focus of the European Union on creating a mechanism to allow for a fair, inclusive presidential election that will put in place in May a government that respects law and the rights of minorities and that does not allow some of the behaviour to occur that I condemn and which I have condemned on other occasions. We need to have a government in place in Ukraine that respects international law and the rights of minority groups within its borders. That is why the elections to take place in May are so important and why the European Union has placed such value on making them happen again. I reject again the contention that there is an equivalence between what the European Union has done to date and what the Russian Federation has done.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 12 and 23 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> Ireland is strongly opposed to capital punishment under all circumstances. Opposition to the death penalty is also a core principle of the European Union’s external relations policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> The verdict of the Minya court, which issued 529 death sentences on individuals convicted of a variety of offences, including the murder of a policeman, after a two-day trial, is extremely troubling and poses very serious questions for the conduct of the rule of law in Egypt. It is impossible to see how this trial could be regarded as in any real way meeting basic requirements of due process and the right to a fair trial, with most of those accused tried <i>in absentia </i>and many deprived of adequate legal representation. The swiftness of this extraordinary trial contrasts very sharply to the failure to date to ensure accountability in the many instances of security force responsibility for the killing of hundreds of protestors last summer. The verdicts issued by the court in Minya have yet to be confirmed. I hope that all possible appeal procedures will be employed to review urgently these appalling sentences.</p>
            <p eId="para_104"> There has been widespread international criticism of the verdicts issued in Minya, including by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. On behalf of the European Union, High Representative Ashton issued a statement on 25 March expressing utmost concern and reiterating that the Union opposes capital punishment under all circumstances. The High Representative also raised this issue directly with Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, when they met earlier this week. The Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, who was representing Ireland at the same meeting, also had a brief meeting with him and raised our concerns. Further diplomatic measures to convey the European Union's concern and support for the High Representative's representation remain under consideration. There have been extensive discussions by EU member states in Brussels and Cairo on how to deal most effectively with the court verdict and, in particular, how best to support the appeals process in Egypt. These discussions are ongoing and will continue while the legal appeals process remains under way in Egypt. This is expected to take some further weeks, but will remain an issue of high priority for Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I am very heartened to hear clear and unequivocal condemnation of the sentences. While this is positive, why is there such a contrast between the approaches to Ukraine and Egypt? Five hundred and twenty-nine people are to be executed by the military regime in Egypt based on trumped-up charges but there is no talk of sanctions or urgent action. If the Russians decided to execute 529 people in Ukraine tomorrow, what would the Minister of State be doing or saying now? There would be emergency sessions of the United Nations, immediate sanctions, sabre rattling and probably talk of military action. I would not be in favour of military action but of an emergency response and the imposition of hard sanctions to show the proposed action is unacceptable. It is a question of not trading with Egypt, breaking off diplomatic relations with it and using every bit of power at our disposal to stop it engaging in mass political executions that are essentially to reconsolidate the dictatorship of Mubarak under a new name.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">I thank the Deputy for raising this extremely worrying breach of human rights. I must emphasise two points in response to his questions. The events are exceptionally worrying and disturbing. I have already outlined the contact that has occurred at EU level and the further discussions that will take place on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">I want to clarify exactly where we stand in relation to the cases that have correctly been raised by the Deputy. It is important to say clearly that the sentences have yet to be fully confirmed by the court. The Grand Mufti, who is required to issue a judgment under Islamic law, is due to decide whether to confirm this judgment towards the end of this month. No executions have taken place. The most recent execution in Egypt took place three years ago. I would have condemned it then if I had the opportunity to do so that I have now. In light of the seriousness of this situation, it is worth emphasising for the purposes of clarity that these sentences have yet to be fully confirmed under Egyptian law. The EU and Ireland are exceptionally worried about the magnitude of the sentences and the penalty, the use of which we are fundamentally opposed to.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">Why are Government or all-party motions not being tabled on this matter? Why are we not having an emergency debate on this issue like the debate on the situation in Ukraine that will take place later today? I do not understand why we are not taking a hard line with a regime that is essentially trying to drown in blood, or repress by means of fear and intimidation, the democratic revolution of the Egyptian people. We should make no bones about the fact that this is what the regime is doing. The Egyptian embassy is still happily operating in this city. I suspect that we are doing big trade with Egypt, for example, by selling beef to that country. What does the Government intend to do if the Egyptian authorities do not immediately indicate that they intend to drop these trumped-up charges and end any talk of executing people? Given that the current regime in Egypt executed a load of members of the Muslim Brotherhood outside a mosque, it seems that this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. I am no fan of the Muslim Brotherhood, but it is clear to me in this instance that the regime is guilty and has blood all over its hands.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">I would like to emphasise what has already happened, and what has yet to happen, in this regard. When High Representative Ashton met the Egyptian Foreign Minister on behalf of the EU on Monday, she made it clear that there is a high level of worry at EU level about the possible imposition on a shocking number of people of a penalty to which we are fundamentally and irrevocably opposed. I reiterate that these sentences have yet to be confirmed under Egyptian law. I hope the Deputy recognises that. The sentences could be confirmed towards the end of this month. The Deputy referred earlier to executions as if they had happened.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">Over 1,000 people have been killed in Egypt since a military coup overthrew Morsi's elected Government. How many people have been killed in Crimea? When it was suggested that the United States might stop sending military hardware to Egypt because it was not being used in a very nice way, that proposal was blocked by the arms manufacturers. The manufacturers in question have a vested interest in ensuring military hardware is not prevented from being sent to Egypt because they are making money out of it. I did not hear the EU say anything when that happened. Perhaps it did not have a problem with it. Over 16,000 people are in jail in Egypt now. As a matter of interest, has the Tánaiste been to the Egyptian Embassy in Dublin? Maybe the Minister of State answered that question but I did not hear him. I do not know whether the Tánaiste has made such a visit, but if he has not, why is that the case? Has the Tánaiste said anything to the Egyptian authorities about the three Al Jazeera journalists who have spent over 100 days in jail since they were charged with spreading bad news and accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood?</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Deputy for his questions. I would like to remind him, in response to his comments about the export of arms, that a number of measures were agreed at an extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in August 2013. The measures in question, which relate to the violent suppression of the protests mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett, have since been implemented. I will explain what they involved. The EU decided to suspend military co-operation with Egypt and to deny export licences for any goods - including arms, obviously - that could be used in the violent suppression of democratic assembly, which is a fundamental human right. These EU measures are still in force. They will not be lifted until the EU's concerns have been dealt with. Reference has been made to the forthcoming elections in Egypt, which are vital if many of the difficulties in that country are to be dealt with. The EU will have a full-scale monitoring mission in place for the duration of the elections to ensure they are fair, peaceful and carried out in accordance with law. I want to emphasise again that our worries in this regard were articulated and communicated by the EU on Monday of this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The Minister of State has said that we are going to monitor the elections. It seems that we were okay with the military takeover. The head of the military is going to stand in those elections and will probably win. The EU will oversee that. When the majority of the people of Crimea voted to join Russia, the EU had a huge problem with that. The Minister of State mentioned that he was in the Baltic states recently. People forget that Crimea was part of Russia for over 700 years before Khrushchev foolishly decided to give it as a present to Ukraine in 1954 to buy favour there. It was a very poor political decision. Most of the people of Crimea want to be part of Russia. Similarly, the people of Egypt decided in an election to put the Muslim Brotherhood into power. I am not saying the Muslim Brotherhood are lovely fellows, but it is clear that the Egyptian people voted for them, only for them to be overthrown by the military. When Obama and Kerry were asked what was going on, and whether they intended to do anything about it, they said that the people had spoken. I do not know how anyone can defend that. While I am glad to hear that the EU has imposed some sanctions on Egypt, I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about the suggestion that the EU needs to reprimand the US for its continued support of an unelected military power in Egypt.</p>

They relate, for example, to the export of products that could be used for the kinds of behaviours and practices that we absolutely condemn. The Deputy drew an analogy between what is happening in Crimea and what is happening in Egypt. The key point I would make again with regard to Crimea is that international procedures and processes, which are recognised in international law-----</p>

That did not happen in Crimea. As I have made clear at all times, the EU has condemned what has happened in this case. The Deputy asked whether further steps have been taken by Ireland. Early last month, we sponsored a cross-regional statement on the human rights situation in Egypt at the UN Human Rights Council. Our ambassador to Cairo has attended meetings and spoken with the Egyptian authorities. These issues have been discussed in full. The discussions in question took place before the court issued the verdict that has been mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">That is why the meeting took place with High Representative Ashton on Monday at which we emphasised the concern over what we have here.

            <p eId="para_121">Is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade concerned about aspects of the trial of the Muslim Brotherhood members? Most of us would have concerns over the volume of the trials, the lack of fairness, reports that lawyers were not allowed in the court and that defence lawyers were not allowed to challenge witnesses. There is a litany of concern over the case. People have concerns over the Muslim Brotherhood and so on, but this is a fallacy. This smacks of the show trials in the former Soviet Union. It is not about fair play or justice. What are Government representatives saying privately to the Egyptian authorities and more importantly what will they do publicly on the matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_123"> The final stage of this judgment has yet to be fully confirmed under Egyptian law and through the Egyptian processes. We believe it is due to take place by the end of this month. In the interim, we and the European Union will continue to make clear our grave level of concern regarding what has happened here. Ultimately, issues such as this do not contribute to supporting the people of Egypt to achieve a safe and secure future in the midst of having to confront major challenges along the way. That is why an issue such as this is of such concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15 and 31 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> The Tánaiste has regular comprehensive discussions with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP, most recently on Monday, 31 March, about the overall situation in the North and the state of the peace process. They discussed the security situation, including attacks on the PSNI, attacks and threats of attack on prison officers and other criminal acts by so-called dissident republicans as well as attacks by loyalist paramilitaries and criminals on the PSNI and communities. The Secretary of State has in her recent statements restated that the national security threat level in Northern Ireland continues to be severe. I deplore recent attacks on the Police Service of Northern Ireland officers and on prison officers which have to be seen for what they are. They are unlawful criminal acts with no moral or political justification.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> The Tánaiste has raised a small number of prisoner cases which have arisen from the exercise by the Secretary of State of certain non-devolved powers regarding national security issues. Irish officials in the British-Irish intergovernmental secretariat in Belfast monitor such cases on an ongoing basis. </p>
            <p eId="para_132"> The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, meets regularly with the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, MLA, to discuss policing and criminal justice matters, as well as other matters of mutual concern. In that regard, I should note the high level of co-operation that exists on justice issues between the two jurisdictions, and in particular the excellent relationship and co-operation which exists between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI. </p>
            <p eId="para_133"> The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade also has regular and ongoing discussions about the situation in Northern Ireland with the Minister, Mr. Ford, MLA. Last October, he met the Minister, Mr. Ford, MLA, as part of a two-day programme in Derry and was briefed by the then PSNI district commander in Derry, Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin, about its policing work on the ground there. More recently, the Tánaiste attended the Alliance Party conference in Belfast on 22 March, where he met the Minister, Mr. Ford, MLA, and where he spoke of the Government’s commitment to ensuring that the devolution of policing and justice works to protect communities all over the island of Ireland from criminal elements. </p>
            <p eId="para_134"> The Government will continue to work with the British Government and with the elected leaders of Northern Ireland to ensure that political progress and peace continues to advance in Northern Ireland in line with the principles, values and institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_135">I also deplore attacks on PSNI officers and prison officers. We should avoid giving oxygen to dissident IRA groups, which is what is happening. Treating the prisoners badly aids the more extreme elements and gives them oxygen.</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> Certain prisoners, including Mr. Paul Duffy and his brother, Shane, have been released only on condition that they do not live with their families or even in the same county. Where is the logic of that? If the Northern Ireland authorities want a guy to be rehabilitated into the community, do they not believe that it would be a good idea for him to be with his wife and kids? It beggars belief and I do not see the logic in it. The Minister of State should address that with the Northern Ireland authorities because it does not make any sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_137"> Strip searches of prisoners going into and out of court are continuing. Even though prisoners never leave the sight or hand of security officials, the authorities still insist on strip-searching them when they come back. It is only about degrading them and it has nothing to do with security. We are very keen that there be no more trouble and that the people who would like to cause trouble are not given oxygen. To see that happen we must challenge the irrational approach to some of these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_138">I fully appreciate the Deputy's objective in raising this question, which is to ensure that peace in Northern Ireland is not destabilised in any way. I certainly would not mean to infer that the Deputies' questions are motivated by anything other than that objective. I share that objective and I understand the context for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> I make two points in response. I absolutely deplore the threats that have been made to prison officers by so-called dissident republicans, as does the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">Any negotiation or resolution of the situation in that prison can only come about when that threat is lifted. The Tánaiste discussed this matter with Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, at the start of this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> In regard to the Deputy's other question on the operation of policy within that prison and elsewhere, as she knows, issues in regard to policing and many aspects of justice have been devolved to Northern Ireland, including to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and there are bodies in place to deal with some of the issues to which she has referred. There is the Northern Ireland Prison Service, which implements policy in that area, and also the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman, which operates independently of the prison service and which has the legal capacity to investigate fully complaints in regard to the treatment of prisoners and the alleged violation of human rights.</p>

            <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_142">We have also discussed prisoner issues with Theresa Villiers and David Ford through the <i>ad hoc</i> group mentioned by Deputy Wallace. The point we want to emphasise is that it does not seem to us that there is sufficient awareness of the serious potential of this issue to destabilise the situation. The Minister of State is aware there was a dirty protest for a year and a half which ended on an understanding that certain improvements would be made. Tragically, the ending of that protest coincided with the appalling murder of David Black. Our information is that the situation inside that prison at the moment is very unstable because the conditions of the ending of that protest have not been seen to be met in terms of strip searching and agreements on movement on landings, where there was an understanding this would be freed up. These have not been dealt with and there is a serious problem which I believe our Government must emphasise.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> The last point is the condition of prisoners on release. People like Martin Corey and Marian Price are old enough and both are quite sick. Some others were asked to wear an electronic tag, which is completely inappropriate, in my opinion. There is a list of people with whom they cannot associate. In one ridiculous scenario, Marian Price was in a supermarket and an old associate came up, and she had to say: "Get away. If I am seen talking to you, I am in breach of the conditions of my release." Our Government must stress the importance of these issues, including for human rights reasons.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">In regard to the two points the Deputy makes, I have already made clear that the Tánaiste earlier this week discussed the situation of the threat that is in place in regard to officers and members of staff working in this prison. That must be lifted to ensure those prison officers have the ability to do their very difficult work safely. When that threat is lifted, it will create the environment within which other and further issues can be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> I understand the point the Deputy is making. As I said earlier, we understand the ability of issues like this to destabilise what is a difficult and fraught environment and the consequences that could have within the prison and across Northern Ireland. That is why the Tánaiste raised the general issue of the threat with the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers. However, I must emphasise that very important powers were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and for the right reasons, namely, to ensure leaders of communities in Northern Ireland have the ability to make decisions that matter to their communities. We respect that and believe it is essential to the future stability and security of the North. It is within this framework that those decisions are made.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> As I said to Deputy Wallace, there is an ombudsman in place to deal with concerns people have and there is a Northern Ireland Prison Service in place to deal with what are very difficult and challenging circumstances. We are all united, as noted on the earlier question put to me by Deputy Smith, in our desire to see the Haass negotiations reach a strong and successful conclusion and ensure the kind of threats we are referring to are lifted, and that members of the PSNI and the Northern Ireland Prison Service, as Deputy Daly herself has said, are not subject to the kind of appalling murder and threats they have been subject to in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I am glad to come back in on this issue. In recent weeks the Government launched a €68 million local authority home building initiative. I welcome this, but as I said previously, this needs to be looked at again because there is a serious housing crisis, particularly in terms of social housing. Other new schemes under way with the support of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government include a €35 million investment in housing for people with a disability, a €30 million investment to improve the energy efficiency of local authority housing, and a €10 million kick-start fund to complete remaining unfinished housing developments. I fully appreciate these developments. I am aware, however, that for some council tenants there is up to a two year waiting list for simple jobs, including the case of one elderly woman who is waiting to have a shower unit installed. This needs to be addressed. I welcome the fact some National Asset Management Agency units are being returned to the housing stock. For example, in my area of Inchicore, 36 units, known as Tyrone Court, will shortly come into the ownership of Circle Housing Voluntary Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> I want to raise the serious issue of rent arrears with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan. While this is perhaps not her area, she may be able to intervene with the city council. There are huge rent arrears at present and, in some cases, people are being transferred into new units despite having arrears. There is €42 million currently outstanding for Dublin City Council housing alone, and this would go a long way towards refurbishing flat complexes and houses. Given the Minister of State's interaction with the council, she may be able to raise this issue at a higher level.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> In 2012, the voluntary and co-operative housing sector managed approximately 27,000 homes. Many organisations, such as Circle Voluntary Housing Association, Napco Housing and Clúid Housing Association have developed a real rapport with their tenants and provided a good example of tenancy behaviour. In regard to negotiations around rent in particular, their work has really improved how people are living and how they treat the property in which they live. I welcome the new development at Thornton Heights, on the former St. Michael's estate lands, which will have tenants going in within the next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> While the social housing situation is improving slowly with these new measures introduced by the Government, the problem of homelessness appears to be getting worse. I do not need to state the figures and I will cut to the chase. Housing is key to resolving the homelessness problem, but we also need to examine the reasons behind why people become homeless, such as poverty, unemployment and family disputes. We also need to put names and faces on the people entering into homelessness in our society to find out who they are, where they come from and their needs. Homelessness is a huge issue, not only in this city but throughout the country, and it needs to be addressed urgently. I know the Minister of State will do her utmost, but I believe many of the agencies need to be re-examined to see what resources they are providing to the many homeless people. I believe a number of agencies are duplicating services and, if that could be looked at, it would go a long way to reducing the number of homeless.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I welcome this debate. I have been raising matters in regard to housing and homelessness for some time. I believe we would all agree there is an emergency in the area of housing when we are told there are 100,000 households on the social housing waiting lists. We will certainly have more families on the waiting lists if we do not have a house construction programme and if we continue to have social welfare cuts and increased rents, which are a particular problem in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I welcome the €68 million announced by the Minister of State to be spent over two years to build new social homes for families in need of housing. The Minister has estimated that this will provide 442 new homes. It is a start, but obviously we have a long way to go given the number of people on waiting lists. Funding of €15 million is available for retrofitting of boarded up local authority houses. This must also be welcomed because we see people waiting for houses in every town, yet these houses are vacant and boarded up when they should be brought into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> In the past, I raised the slow pace of NAMA property transfers with the Minister of State. I have been told that only 10% of homes earmarked by NAMA for social housing have been transferred to local authorities. I hope this figure can be increased. I would like to see a specialist unit in the housing office in every local authority to speed up transfers. We had a debate yesterday in the House on housing, social housing and homelessness. An issue that certainly comes up when we have this debate is the fact the Minister of State has many groups looking at this situation. There is a monitoring group and an oversight group, but what we now need is action. Of course, I agree with the overall policy statement of the Government in February 2013 which said that the Government's aim was to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. That is certainly a welcome objective, but we must work strongly in the meantime to ensure we will work towards that deadline for 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I have seen statements by various people involved in housing. Some of the comments they have made are very worrying. The chief executive of the Simon Community said last year that homelessness and what he called the rough sleeping crisis is worse than ever. He said the Government must decide on a policy on housing because no one is building houses. That is certainly the case in areas where we need housing, particularly the larger towns and cities. He made the point that a homeless person cannot afford private rented accommodation when rents are going up, rent allowance caps are coming down all the time and no extra accommodation is being provided. He said it is a complete logjam. One has the combination of social welfare cuts and not enough units.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> According to a figure given at the end of last year, the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin has increased by 88% in the past year. I know legislation looking at the question of housing assistance has been promised. I hope this will be brought in. Perhaps the Minister of State could tell us what legislation she has in mind in respect of this matter. I know the Minister of State has met NAMA and I hope she will continue to try to get those extra units. I have met representatives from the Simon Community, the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland and they have all stressed the serious issues facing their organisations and the people on the street. In particular, they raised the issue of youth homelessness. I understand the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is reviewing a youth homelessness strategy, which should be looked at by the two committees the Minister of State has set up in her Department. There is a need to monitor what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I spoke to an organisation in Galway, known as COPE, which told me very clearly that homelessness in Galway is not as serious as it is in Dublin. However, it is an area about which COPE is worried. It is especially worried about the way street counts are conducted. I am not too sure who does the weekly street counts of the number of people sleeping rough but there seem to be different figures made available regarding the number of people who are sleeping on the streets. The Simon Community made the point that the figures could be higher than the figures reported in the media because the count apparently does not include what we call the hidden homeless - those squatting in Internet cafés and people in hospitals. The figure is probably higher than the official figures we have seen. That is something that is of great concern to the various housing organisations and the people who work at the coalface with homeless people.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> One suggestion I made to the Minister of State by way of questions and in a recent Topical Issue debate was using housing organisations. I know there is a proposal with the Minister of State from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in Ballinasloe. The branch is seeking €400,000 to provide housing in Ballinasloe in partnership with Clúid Housing Association, which is a very well-known organisation in housing that has done very good work in many towns. The proposal for Ballinasloe is very interesting. They have a free site thanks to the diocese and are involved with the Maureen O'Connell Fund, which is a fund where money has been left to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to provide housing in Ballinasloe. There is a need for this type of housing, which would be sheltered housing, and it is a very good proposal at which I hope the Minister of State will look. I hope Galway County Council will support that. It has told me it will support it. Voluntary organisations represent just one area that could be used more.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I have been approached lately by some people who are very concerned they might lose their houses. People who were interested in the mortgage-to-rent scheme were told to register with a voluntary housing organisation. I know they will try to do that. The next part of the proposal was that they would surrender their houses and make an application to Galway County Council in the case of constituents of mine in Galway. Perhaps there is too much paperwork involved and it is too complicated to go down this route. I presume they will deal with their financial institution first, but I think many local authorities do not even know this scheme exists and many local authorities are wondering why they are involved in this. Could the Minister of State simplify things? Of course, people want to hold on to their homes. It is the natural wish of families to do that. I hope we could simplify that scheme if one is going to involve local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I understand that about 8,000 units were completed last year. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, estimates that Ireland requires approximately 25,000 housing units per annum to meet the shifting demographic changes and the demand for housing, so we have a big task ahead of us. Rents in urban parts of the country are increasing, particularly in Dublin. There is a big deficit in the provision of housing in Dublin. I hope those areas can be looked at and that the Minister of State might be able to respond to some of the issues I raised in my short contribution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_161">I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. The debate is very timely. I am sure I am no different from other Deputies who probably find that housing is not just the single biggest issue coming to them in representations but larger than all other issues combined.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The Dublin market has always been different from the rest of the country but it is diverging even more now. Indeed, the housing situation is very different from what it was even a few years ago. This is a timely debate because we need to find innovative solutions for both the private and public housing sectors. Every area of housing in Dublin now needs attention because they all feed into one another.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> One issue on which I wish to focus is affordable housing. I think I heard the Minister of State mention that affordable housing was an area in which the State would not get involved in future. The Part V provision used to cater for affordable housing but that is dead in the water now. We must not forget about that cohort of people who do not qualify for housing assistance, who will never get on housing lists, who cannot raise a deposit but who may be capable of sustaining a mortgage over the longer term. We cannot forget about those people. We have to find ways of helping them, whether that be through longer-term mortgages or some other mechanism. I do not know what the solution is but they cannot just be written off. It is so difficult for people to get into the housing market in Dublin now and there is absolutely no social housing available.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I worry a little about the possibility of pushing up the price of houses through, for instance, the new land zoning tax. I understand the thinking behind it in terms of the perceived need for a social dividend from rezoning. I do not think the tax has been payable on much land to date, but the danger is that it will do exactly what the Part V provisions did. The latter were seen as a way of getting a social dividend from builders, but what the provisions actually did was push up the price of houses for ordinary people. In that way, the State contributed to the housing bubble. We blamed everyone for the housing bubble but the State piggybacked on it. We must be careful not to do that again. Much as we might like to get something from builders, when we rezone land, we must be careful to ensure it does not negatively impact on people trying to buy houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> I note that the Minister of State has placed a lot of trust and hope in the voluntary housing sector. I know that voluntary housing bodies are used widely in Ireland and elsewhere, including Britain. Such bodies have developed a lot of expertise, but I have a small reservation about the huge taxpayer investment in properties that neither the State nor tenants will ever own. I would strike a note of caution in that regard. I do not know why the State has stood back to the extent that it has in terms of the provision of housing. I understand that bodies dealing exclusively with housing develop expertise and have off-balance sheet borrowing capabilities, but I would suggest to the Minister of State that in solving a short-term problem in this way, we may be creating a longer-term problem for ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> I wish to highlight the fact that Dublin is a special case, and my own area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown particularly so, because there simply is not one single house that meets the criteria for rent supplement. That means there is no social housing for people living in my area. If one wants to go on the housing list in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, one is told that the minimum waiting period is ten years, and at the same time, one cannot rent in the area either. Despite this, when one looks around the rest of the country, one sees there are many houses available, including some owned by NAMA. There is no housing shortage in the country as a whole, but in Dublin there is simply no house that meets the criteria. It is not just the shortage of houses; it is also the disproportionately high property tax that people in Dublin pay. The burden on the householders of Dublin is high and obviously landlords are trying to pass that on to their tenants. The push from the property tax as well as the fact there is an absolute housing shortage in Dublin means that rents continue to rise. When people contacted me in the past because they could not rent a house and receive rent supplement in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I used to advise them to go to South Dublin County Council or Fingal County Council. Now, however, there is no point in telling them to do that because rents are escalating in those areas too. There are virtually no houses available in the Dublin area. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, has plans to change the rent supplement scheme to a rent assistance scheme, under which people will be allowed to work and draw housing assistance, which I welcome. However, it does not really solve the underlying problems of rising rents and a housing shortage in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> In other parts of the country there is no shortage of housing and rents are far more affordable. In that context, it may be time to consider some kind of resettlement programme, even on a temporary basis, until we get to grips with the housing shortage in Dublin. I know that eventually it will dawn on people that if they want housing, they will have to get out of Dublin and there will be a drift to the cities and towns outside Dublin. I also know that resettlement is not for everyone and that family ties and so forth connect people to where they were born, but for those who want it, it can provide not only a housing solution but also access to schools and other facilities because the demand for these is not as great as it is in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I do not think the drift out of Dublin should be left to market forces, however. It is time for the Government to get actively involved in a planned programme of resettlement, helping families to relocate. If it is left to people to decide themselves to go, we will get a scatter gun type relocation throughout the country which, from a planning perspective, is not a good idea. It would be better to direct people who elect to move out of Dublin to the gateways and hub towns identified in the national spatial strategy. Although the latter has fallen into disuse, it is better than nothing in terms of relocating people out of Dublin. In such towns, of course, there is a better chance of getting employment. I am not suggesting that relocation is the solution to the entire housing problem, but for those who express an interest, it is worth pursuing. I know there is a voluntary organisation called Rural Resettlement Ireland, but I think it should be something that is much more structured than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> At the moment, not only are we not helping people to relocate or suggesting they consider it, we are actually putting barriers in their way. For instance, if one is on the housing list in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, one cannot go to Bray and get housing assistance because one is not on the housing list there. I do not think the legislation requires that but that is how the scheme is being implemented. That should be dealt with by letting local authorities know they should be as flexible as possible. It is ridiculous that people who are on a housing list and for whom a housing need has been established cannot go and rent a house in an area that is cheaper and get a lesser subsidy. As I said, relocation is not for everyone but it is a possibility for some.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The Minister of State will shortly announce a stimulus package for the construction sector, which I very much welcome. It is something that is badly needed for the thousands of people who will remain jobless unless there is a recovery in the construction industry. I presume the stimulus package will form part of a solution to the housing shortage but I would stress the need to address the issue of affordable housing too. I would also caution against looking for contributions that are so high as to push up the price of houses for everyone.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelColreavy" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_171">There is a crisis in the provision of social housing in Ireland. It seems to stem from an ideological debate that is going on at the moment concerning what care must government provide to citizens. Sinn Féin believes that everyone has the right to a roof over their head regardless of their financial situation. We believe that this is a right that should be enshrined in law. A safe and warm home should be a fundamental right and not a concession that can be granted or withheld at the whim of government or local authority managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> There are roughly 90,000 households on the housing waiting list across the State. In a country of our size this is a terrible indictment of the way we do business. There have been reports of people waiting on the housing list for 15 years or longer as they wait to be placed in social housing that is just not being built by this Government and was not built by previous Governments either.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> There are 95,000 people on rent supplement and around 30,000 on the residential accommodation scheme, RAS. I call it the residential accommodation scam. While successive Governments have failed to embark on any form of housing projects, private landlords have been benefiting from rent supplements paid from State coffers. It seems more than bizarre that a Government would hand over finances in the form of rent supplement and RAS to private landlords instead of building our own social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Local authorities are constrained in what they can do to upgrade social housing. Conditions in existing social housing as well as private rental accommodation are deteriorating, and problems have already been highlighted in Dublin after a raft of inspections in the city centre. A shocking result was that 90% of flats failed the basic standards test. Local authorities cannot adequately restore and upgrade housing to make it suitable for social housing unless they are given funding from central Government to do so. Without funding, the hands of local authorities are tied when it comes to making more social housing available.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> The Celtic tiger left us with a legacy of ghost estates and empty houses across the country. Without proper Government investment and regulation these buildings will remain empty for the foreseeable future. I know that there are legal and cost complexities involved but it is shameful that we have thousands of NAMA-controlled homes, paid for by Irish taxpayers, which remain empty and unused while 90,000 people are on the housing waiting list. </p>
          <p eId="para_176"> NAMA promised 2000 homes for social leasing at the end of 2012. This scheme is not the answer to Ireland's social housing crisis. Very few homes were put in place and in 2013 the Government announced a special purpose vehicle to speed up the delivery of these properties. In addition, these properties would be rented through local authorities and voluntary bodies, and returned to the developer when the lease ran out.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Homelessness is also an issue that has to be addressed. Every day, when we walk the streets of Dublin, we can see homeless people around us. It is a sad fact that within a few metres of this building, our national parliament, people are sleeping rough. This should not happen in a country that has wealth resources such as ours. According to Focus Ireland there are about 5,000 homeless people in the State. The number of people sleeping rough increased by 88% in 2013. Ireland is not a densely populated country and we are not at risk from over-population. Why is it that we find it so hard to house so many people in this country? This is a question the Government must ask itself. It must commit itself to tackling the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The rent supplement threshold is totally unrealistic. It has the effect of causing people, including landlords and their agents, to tell lies. We should not be encouraging people to tell lies through a State-supported mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> I receive many complaints about the complexity and bureaucracy of the housing application process. It seems to be designed to get people to give up half way through. Therefore, the housing application process should be re-examined.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_180">The first thing we need to agree on is that there is a crisis. One may call it a problem or a difficulty but in my area it is a crisis. Rather than trying to resolve it or take measures to relieve the crisis, it seems to be getting worse. Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke earlier about the situation in Dublin and I am more familiar with that region. She referred to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area and I can talk about similar difficulties in south Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I am the only Deputy who has a full-time advice centre in my own area. I get cases from Fianna Fáil, Labour Party and Fine Gael supporters, the majority of which are housing related. There was a time when one could try to come up with solutions for people who were in unsafe, overcrowded and difficult circumstances. In some cases now, however, they are homeless. Homelessness is not just affecting young people, including couples, it also concerns elderly people. In addition, there are individuals whose marriages have broken down and they are forced to sell the family home. Those are the sort of cases that are coming into my advice centre. People are coming to us seeking solutions to their difficulties. We can get them on the housing list but that list is getting longer so we are talking about seven years. In Dublin City Council's area it is longer than that. If an individual is not working or on a low income, the other option is rental supplement. </p>
          <p eId="para_182"> I recently carried out a survey in my own area because people in such difficult circumstances are constantly being told to look elsewhere. If someone comes to Tallaght and there is no housing available there, they will look in Rathcoole, Rathfarnham or other localities. According to my survey, 96% of the rented accommodation advertised in the local area was above the social welfare threshold for rent supplement. Consequently, there is a difficulty in that regard. Some 77 properties were available in the hinterland including Rathcoole, Rathfarnham, Saggart, Tallaght, Templeogue, Greenhills and Walkinstown. If one goes to Kildare one is going out of County Dublin. Meanwhile, if one goes into the city centre the rents are going up, so where can people go to find accommodation? Of those 77 properties, a large amount would not accept rental supplement. Of the three houses whose landlords said they would take rental supplement, the rent was so high that it meant the option was meaningless. That option was therefore out for those individuals. </p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Some people say that the thousands of NAMA properties are a magic wand but, according to the local housing manager, in south Dublin there are only a handful of such properties. The remaining options are to stay where one is, even if it is unsafe. A woman who attended my advice centre last week is living in a refuge; she does not have the option of obtaining rented accommodation. It is also difficult to obtain rent supplement, as was the case recently concerning a woman with a large family. It is hard to get four-bedroom accommodation for such a person. That woman is not allowed to rent three-bedroom accommodation, so her options are a hostel or one bedroom in a local hotel. There is no flexibility in that respect. </p>
          <p eId="para_184"> While there is a crisis, I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's housing-led approach, including the provision of emergency accommodation. However, the Dundalk women's refuge has been subject to 75% cuts. The options are shrinking and thus the problems are becoming worse. We do not have options to offer people who are experiencing housing difficulties. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I welcome the Minister of State's plan to refurbish housing stock but it is a drop in the ocean.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">We must adopt a much more radical approach to a problem which is getting worse. We heard on the radio this morning about 183,000 people in mortgage distress while three insolvency cases have been dealt with. Where are those people going to go if they lose their homes? They will be looking to the safety net that used to be there in terms of housing. They will approach their local authorities for housing or rented accommodation which is not there. We are not doing anything to help those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I am sorry for being so negative in my contribution but there are options we can explore. That involves building new houses and a radical approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_188">I welcome the debate, the contributions to which from all sides have been extremely positive. Some of the contributions are in stark contrast to the fiasco which took place here over the past couple of days. The Dáil should have been concentrating in that time on bread and butter issues for the people who sent us here. There is no greater bread and butter issue than the need for the State to provide shelter and accommodation for vulnerable people in difficult circumstances. My experience is no different from the experience set out by previous speakers. I acknowledge the work my county colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is doing in this area. It is another legacy issue that has been handed on and is being dealt with proactively. As the previous speaker said, there is no silver bullet, magic wand or easy solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> This morning, I looked at my own constituency. In County Limerick currently, 1,543 people are on the housing list with a further 2,274 on the list for the city, which is a total of 3,817 for the new local authority. These are not just numbers. They represent people and their families, many of whom have been on the lists for a considerable period. I know from my time as a county councillor that some people on the housing lists spend huge amounts of time on them. There has been the safety valve of the rental market but matters were really brought home to me over Christmas. I met people from my own area who work in Dublin in good jobs yet find that they are being priced out of the property market. They find that the aspiration to buy an apartment or house in Dublin is out. In some instances, it is the case that even with a good job, being able to rent an apartment or house in Dublin is out. We are slowly but surely reverting to the situation which destroyed the country. We must take it very seriously. We cannot allow a situation to re-emerge where people must commute to Dublin from Kilkenny, Mullingar, Longford and places like that due to a bubble that is about to be inflated in the city once again. We cannot realistically say that rising property prices, rental demand and rents are a good thing. They are not. They will lead to further wage demands by those at work, which will lead to inflation and in turn to the competitiveness cycle we found ourselves swirling around in during the good old days of the last Administration. The housing situation is critical to ensuring that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> There are a number of aspects to the issue including a planning element. We continue to have a situation whereby even when adequately zoned land is available on which there is a willingness to construct, an application may wind up in An Bord Pleanála where it can be stuck forever. There is no legislative timeframe by which an appeal must be determined. We have a land-use policy issue regarding how and where we build houses and the quality of them. We have a further issue which relates to the local authority sector itself. We must ensure that the local authority is protected and enshrined as the housing authority. I have a concern in this regard, which my colleague, Deputy Bernard Durkan, has been enunciating for a long time. It one removes responsibility for housing from local authorities or dilutes their role, one loses local knowledge, connectivity and the essential element the Minister of State will know well from her work as a public representative on Limerick City Council and in the House; the relationship between local representatives and housing authorities. That relationship is critical to ensure that people are housed appropriately and adequately. It is something which has been lost sight of recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The Minister of State's Department has inherited a number of problems including huge waiting lists and the legacy of unfinished estates. I welcome the money which has been allocated to unfinished estates. While it is a relatively small amount, it is a start. Previous speakers gave examples of different initiatives in their own areas. The Minister of State was in my native town, Newcastlewest, to turn the sod on a St. Vincent de Paul-led voluntary housing initiative. Up to now, we might not have seen these issues in rural Limerick, but we see it now. We see it in every county. The response is welcome. An example of a legacy issue with which the Minister of State is dealing is an unfinished housing estate in a very small village in my own area, Carrigkerry. It is symptomatic of the problems local authorities are confronted with and the bills which will have to be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I was listening to the radio on my way to Dublin the other day and a cohort that I am very concerned about is generation Y, which represents those born since the 1980s. Other Members, including Deputy Olivia Mitchell, spoke about them. For many of them, the aspiration to buy a house is fast becoming just that, an aspiration. Listening to the radio, I heard about how more and more of them are staying at home with their elderly parents. It is having an impact on their capacity to start families and stand on their own feet. It also has an impact on their families' lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Access to credit, properly zoned land and good quality housing is something with which we will have to grapple. The net contribution of the construction industry to the economy is at an unsustainably low level. It was unsustainably high previously when we built houses in the wrong locations where there is now no demand. Nevertheless, we could double our output of private and public sector housing in the morning and would still be running to stand still. I encourage the Minister of State to consider the credit union movement. Access to finance is a very significant issue. Consideration should be given to local authority engagement in public-private partnership arrangements with credit unions, which have approximately €14 billion on deposit currently. There is no better borrower to lend to than a local authority or the State as one knows one will get the money back. We may be able to leverage some of the savings on deposit in credit unions to do valuable infrastructure work in our communities, including the provision of sewerage and water works, housing and amenities. The local authority sector could adopt a partnership model whereby a credit union or local community owns the houses and leases them to the local authority over a period in return for an annual dividend and option to purchase after ten or 20 years. The State cannot do this on its own. If credit union members are being stymied, there is an opportunity to obtain finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> I implore the Minister of State to consider a particular labour activation measure by way of housing aid for older people and persons with disabilities, which is an issue affecting every community. There is a significant backlog of work across the State to deal with,<i> inter alia</i>, roofing, showers, handrails, footpaths and disabled toilets. There is a great deal of work that can be done. Given the credit union movement and access to low-interest loans, we must start to think about these things differently to access finance to carry out this work. We have shown what can be done with the home renovation incentive scheme for private individuals. A similar initiative should be considered for local authorities. What are local authorities doing but using the State's money to solve a housing or disability problem for an individual? If that can be done without the burden of VAT, etc., it would be really welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">We all know them as they are on every street in the country. Elderly people have doors and windows that need to be replaced and ramps put in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_196"> This debate is hugely important. I would like it broadened out to an Oireachtas committee where ideas can be thrashed out. An issue about which I am concerned is that a person from Abbeyfeale, County Limerick, who is in a good job in the Dublin docklands, and on a good salary, returns home at the weekend and says he will never be able to own a house in Dublin and will have to start commuting from places such as Kildare. That is the slippery slope that this country went down from 2004 to 2008 and for which we will be paying for a long time. I implore the Government to do whatever needs to be done, be it the imposition of stamp duty on second properties or some other measure, to ensure we do not go down the road from which we are still trying to recover and from which we will be recovering for a very long line.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I wish the Minister of State well. I know her heart is in this work. She has displayed great commitment in regard to local authority housing in Limerick in her native city. I am sure the experience she has gained as a Limerick City councillor and a Deputy for Limerick East for many years will bear fruit in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the supply of housing and the Government's homelessness policy in the State. There is no doubt, as stated by other speakers, that there is a crisis in the provision of housing and dealing with homelessness in the State. The two are intrinsically linked. Dealing with the housing policy and the housing crisis will feed into helping to resolve the issue of homelessness. While specific actions may be needed to complete dealing with homelessness they should all be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> There is no escaping the fact that there is no political will to deal with the housing issue. I do not believe in the way housing has been treated in recent years. The usual excuses that have been trotted out are that we have been in a very difficult financial situation, that we have been reliant on others to keep us going, and we blame Fianna Fáil for putting us in that situation. The Government talked about stimulating the economy and encouraging people to get back to work by having activity. Dealing with the housing issue would have been a way to do that and continuing on with house completions would have stimulated local employment and would have paid dividends in returns to the State. Clearly, the figures for social housing completions have declined from 6,600 in 2007 to 1,000 at the end of 2012 and have declined even further now as no new units are being built. Housing purchases decreased from 2,000 in 2007 to 56 at the end of September 2013 and local authority housing progression went from 7,700 in 2007 to zero in 2010. That shows the extent of the crisis because of the factors that have been outlined by other Deputies including the mortgage crisis, spiralling rents and people's inability to provide for themselves. </p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The number of people dependent on and seeking social housing has mushroomed and increased significantly. In Donegal, there are 2,600 people on the housing waiting list. It is estimated that with the number of people in receipt of rent allowance for more than 18 months and who are prioritised under the housing policy it brings the number up to approximately 4,300. That is a huge issue with which to deal. In Donegal, under a leasing programme, 78 houses have been approved and under the NAMA scheme 59 houses have been deemed acceptable for social housing, yet none of those houses has been completed and none of the transfers have been completed. There is a huge crisis in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> We are aware there is a housing crisis in Dublin and the surrounding counties because of the improvement in the economy and the increased demand and rising rents. There is a crisis also in rural areas because of the decline in housing provision by local authorities which makes it very difficult for people to meet their accommodation needs. It appears to me that the main pitch of Government policy is to rely on the private sector through the rental accommodation scheme, through rent allowance and long-term leasing. That approach will not deal with the issues and the problems. In Donegal, three houses have been built in the past three years. The only reason we were able to get those houses built was that they had already been tendered and contractors appointed when the Government slashed the programme. We had to fight to get those three approvals to go to construction; one per year for 2012, 2013 and 2014, for 4,300 people in need of housing assistance. That is telling. </p>
          <p eId="para_202"> It is time the position improved and it is time to start rolling out a building programme which deals with people's housing needs. Such a programme could also help stimulate the local economy and local employment if the Government was creative and ensured that social clauses were included in the tendering contracts and ensured that the successful tenderers were compliant with all the labour law and the requirements for operating in the Twenty-six Counties which, unfortunately, Donegal County Council has neglected over the years. Local contracts in County Donegal have not been able to compete with contracts from the Six Counties because Donegal County Council simply ignored the requirements for operating in the South where contractors could not tender on a level playing field. If the Government was creative and did those things, we could start to deal with the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I mentioned the rent allowance although it is not yet the direct responsibility of the Minister of State; it may be her responsibility in the future and then she will have to deal with it. The responses of the Minister for Social Protection and the Department around the issue of rent allowance are disgraceful. I hope when it comes under the housing sections of the local authorities that it will be dealt with more properly. The idea that the rental subsidy cannot be increased because it would increase the rent is completely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> About eight months ago the Department of Social Protection gave a presentation in the AV room on the new rent allowance limits that were being introduced, how it was operating, how it was a great system and would provide for everybody who needed it. That morning I went on <i>daft.ie </i>and searched for properties in Donegal for a single person under the cap that had been placed by the Department. In the entire county there were four flats available for rent under the cap for a single person. All the Department of Social Protection has done is develop a black market for landlords because tenants have no choice but to put in the rent under the cap otherwise they will be refused rent allowance straight away and they have to pay, in cash, the difference to the landlords. That is what has happened right across the country. Every Deputy in the country would say that. At the presentation, every Deputy told the Department of Social Protection this and its response was to accuse people seeking rent allowance of fraud. That is a bizarre situation. It shows the Department must be working in a vacuum if it thinks the rent allowance deals with the issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_205"> The rent allowance also shows the complete failure of the private sector to deal with any of the housing issues because landlords will capitalise on it and use rent allowance. Many landlords will refuse to take rent allowance from clients, which is another unfair outcome of the operation of the system. That happens particularly in the cities but also in rural areas where landlords will refuse to accept rent allowance clients as tenants. Some of this may be due to the fact that their properties are not known about or registered but it is a huge problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_206"> The Government will have to get a building programme up and running. I understand money is available from the European Investment Bank for capital programmes. Currently it is pitched only towards the voluntary housing sector and it is not capable of gearing up to avail of that money. That issue needs to be looked at and can only be dealt with through public investment with a major housing programme being rolled out across the country to provide for people. That will have the knock on effects of being beneficial to the economy and also provide people with a basic right and a basic necessity, a roof over their head.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">There is also a crisis within the local authority housing sections in terms of their being unable to afford to refurbish houses in order to re-let them. Approximately 40 houses in Donegal have been vacant for a substantial length of time, in some cases for many years, because to re-let them the local authority is required to bring them up to a set standard. It is right that this should be the case, but it cannot afford to do so. The cost per house in terms of refurbishment is approximately €50,000. This means the entire maintenance budget for the housing section within that local authority would be spent on refurbishing only one house, leaving the remaining houses undone. This issue also needs to be addressed. The local authorities must be provided with the resources to roll over their stock, thus housing people and ensuring some inroad is made in this area. It appears that even during the boom times the policy was to not provide housing for everybody who needed it in order to maintain demand within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I am often struck as I come into Leinster House each morning by the number of people sleeping rough between here and the hotel across the road. During the five minute walk from here to the hotel one would pass at least five people sleeping rough, which in this society is a disgrace. Given the number of vacant NAMA properties throughout the city there is no reason this should continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">There are queues forming. These are not queues of people waiting to attend concerts, rather they are of young families waiting for houses which they can turn into homes. This is heartbreaking because the queues are not moving. As someone who has been interested in the issue of social housing for a long time it is important to put in context why this is happening. The context can only be understood by looking back to the so-called Celtic tiger era. It was at that time that people were enveloped by the sense that everybody could buy their own home. This sense was sweetened by seductive offers of finance from banks to purchase not only one house but, perhaps, an apartment in Spain or somewhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Amid the fever of buy, buy, buy the Government turned off the funding tap for social housing. The funding streams for construction, buy-backs, regeneration and refurbishment were all switched off resulting in a dwindling of the housing stock. The funding ceased and the queues increased and have continued to grow. This could be seen as a bleak scenario. I once heard a child on a bus from Ballyfermot point out an empty house to his mother as we passed it. People have been taken over by their need for housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> While the outlook may appear somewhat bleak I no longer hold to that. I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, and of her work in Limerick on a whole range of social issues over the past 30 to 35 years, which has been difficult work that required dedication and vision. I am heartened by some of the announcements made by the Minister of State, including the recent announcement of an additional €68 million for construction and €15 million in respect of voids. I welcome that regeneration of areas such as St. Theresa's Gardens and Darndale are to recommence. St. Theresa's Gardens has waited many years for regeneration. One of the first questions the Minister of State asked me on her appointment was if I knew of St. Theresa's Gardens. The Minister of State visited the area and met with the residents and saw at first-hand the conditions in which they were living. This prompted her to acknowledge that social housing, as she inherited it, was an emergency. I welcome the additional funding to secure a substantial number of NAMA units, the €35 million in respect of appropriate housing and accommodation for people with disabilities and €50 million for the improvement of energy efficiency in local authoring houses. </p>
          <p eId="para_212"> There is hope. What has been announced is only the beginning in a new pattern and trend in the supply of social housing. There is much more to come. It is badly needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I recently had an opportunity to speak briefly on television about the housing crisis. At that time I mentioned that, in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s, when we were really poor, 50,000 to 60,000 social housing units were constructed. At a time when this country had no money we had a major social housing programme. Despite what happened to this country in 2008-09, and the policies which have been supported by the Minister if State, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Conaghan since 2011, we do have the resources to mount a major social housing programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The disgraceful Fianna Fáil Government and MacSharry and Haughey cuts of the late 1980s and early 1990s began the total abandonment of a social housing programme. This was continued by Fine Gael-led governments and another lengthy Fianna Fáil-led government. All of those governments abandoned the social housing programme, thereby abandoning the achievements of their forebears in the 1930s. As a result, we now face a serious housing crisis, with housing lists of 90,000 to 100,000 people. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, recently told me that 78,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement. We are faced with an astonishing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I have previously suggested that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, should be elevated to a full Cabinet Minister with responsibility for a Department of Housing. Whatever one's view about housing, it is one of the most important social and personal economic goods of any family or person. We need this Government, and in particular those who would call themselves Labour Ministers, to take vigorous action to respond to this crisis with which every Deputy in this House is dealing on a daily and weekly basis. That is the type of response we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> It appears the strategy of this Government in terms of social housing provision is to again rely on Part V of the planning and development Acts.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">On entering office in 2011, the centrepiece of the Government's health policy was the introduction of universal health insurance. It has taken three years for the Government to publish a White Paper on the matter, which it did yesterday. Unfortunately, however, that White Paper has given rise to more questions than it has answers in respect of universal health insurance. It does not, for example, indicate what will be the cost of universal health insurance for individual families and the State or what health services will be covered. Neither does it outline the income threshold that will determine whether someone will pay his or her own health insurance or whether the State will pay it for him or her. It is becoming increasingly clear that universal health insurance is going to be another tax on middle Ireland. It will be a further tax on working families which have already been put to the pin of their collar to get by financially. In essence, it will be a tax on the people who already pay for everything in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Reading between the lines of what is contained in the White Paper and parsing what the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said yesterday, it seems quite clear that the current tax relief on health insurance policies from which people benefit is going to be cut and will probably be phased out altogether by the Government. When one considers that this will be in addition to the complete abolition of mortgage interest relief by 2017, it is clear middle income families are looking at a double whammy of tax hikes. The elimination of tax relief on health insurance policies and the abolition of mortgage interest relief will give rise to an increase of approximately €700 million in the amount of tax paid by middle income families during the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The Minister for Health has stated that no one will be obliged to pay anything extra under the new system of universal health insurance. There is no basis whatsoever for that assertion, which has been contradicted by the assessment carried out by the Department run by his colleague in government, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in respect of universal health insurance. When will families be presented with a clear picture of what universal health insurance is going to cost them and when will we be made aware of what will be the exact role played by health insurers in the context of their control of the health service in the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_224"> Labour was the first political party in Ireland to propose universal health insurance - based on multiple insurers - as long ago as 2001. At that stage, the Deputy's party ridiculed the concept in its entirety. Our spur then - as now - was the inequity and inefficiency of Ireland's two-tier health system. The Labour and Fine Gael parties believe that a person's access to medical care should be determined by his or her medical needs, not the money in his or her pocket. Quite frankly, that is the difference between the Deputy's party and the current Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">Yes, it does. The unfair two-tier system that has determined the course - and many of the problems - of our health service for many years is simply not working. It does not work for people who cannot afford private health insurance or who find themselves at the back of the queue for consultants' appointments. It does not even work for those hard-pressed families which struggle to pay for private health insurance, only to find - as every Member of this House who pays into the group scheme knows - that their premiums are increasing each year while their benefits are going down.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> When the Labour Party first proposed universal health insurance as a means of reforming both access to the health services, and how those services are funded, public health spending stood at €7.2 billion. Six years later, in 2007, it had grown by €6.5 billion. It is, therefore, the most expensive in our entire domestic budget. As the Deputy is aware, reform is never easy and it has been made harder by the fiscal crisis which we have all been obliged to endure and which continues. The boom demonstrated that one can keep investing money in a broken system but that if one does not fix the root of the problem, very little will change. This is the first Government to face up to fixing the root of the problem and to agree to develop a universal, single-tier health service. It is also the first Government committed to a system that will guarantee access to care based on need, not income. Furthermore, it is the first Government to commit to universal general practitioner care because that will incentivise the delivery of care early and, therefore, more efficiently. In the coming weeks the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, will bring forward the legislation necessary to allow for GP care, without fees, for those under six years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The publication of the comprehensive White Paper on universal health care is an essential step in this direction. There are many questions which, by definition, cannot be answered in an optimum way until we have completed the consultation process. As a result, it is not possible to provide answers to the questions the Deputy posed with regard to what might be the cost of universal health insurance to different categories of people three or four years from now. There must be clarity. The purpose of publishing the White Paper is to facilitate an informed consultation process. People in this House and throughout the country are concerned about the quality of care available, on the one hand, and the crisis affecting the health service, on the other.</p>

What I do not support is handing over the future of the Irish health service to private, for-profit health insurers, which is precisely what lies at the heart of the policy in this regard. I would have thought this is the complete opposite to what the Labour Party stands for. The fundamental question which arises relates to circumstances where a person will - under the proposed system - require access to the Irish health service. Who will determine the nature of and terms relating to that access? Will it be a doctor or will it be a private health insurance company? All the indications point to the fact that those in the private health insurance industry will make the decisions to which I refer.</p>

The Government is driving people out of the market. Thousands of individuals are dropping their health insurance as a result of the Government's policy and the decisions it is making. I refer in this regard to the change relating to the tax relief on health insurance premiums which was announced in the most recent budget.

Fully 40% of people already have voluntary health insurance. It is not an option to eradicate an insurance model and go back to the British national health system as if we had a clear landscape. We are looking for a system whereby there will be multiple choice within a not-for-profit insurance system to enable us to get the right kind of care and not the kind of high-cost insurance model that exists in the United States.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_248">Yesterday, the Minister for Education and Skills, his party and the Government voted full confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is clear that they all believe the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to be a reforming, progressive and just Minister despite the series of debacles over which he has presided. The issues around the administration of justice and An Garda Síochána have not gone away but that is not what I wish the Minister for Education and Skills to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> I call on the Minister to explain how it is that this reforming Minister for Justice and Equality refuses to acknowledge the survivors of the Bethany Home, those who went through the mother-and-baby homes or those citizens of the State who were illegally adopted. Yesterday, the 222 infants and children who died of neglect at the Bethany Home were, for the first time, officially recognised and mourned at a sobering ceremony in the cemetery at Harold's Cross. The State failed in its duty of care to these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> In opposition, the Minister's party, the Labour Party, and Fine Gael acknowledged this grave injustice and promised to address it. However, it took a determined campaign on the part of the Bethany survivors to end the appalling indignity of the burial of these children in an unmarked grave. The Minister, the Government and the reforming Minister for Justice and Equality have flatly and coldly refused the Bethany survivors the dignity of recognition, the justice of a State apology or the decency of access to a redress scheme. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> When the Government assumed office amid a fanfare of promises of reform, transparency and a new way of doing politics it had an opportunity to end this injustice. However, this Government, like the last, has turned its back on the Bethany survivors. Will the Government now finally face up to its responsibility to these citizens? Will it make an official State apology to the survivors? Will the Minister ensure that they have access to a State redress scheme?</p>

          <p eId="para_252">I, personally, along with everyone in this House who has the benefit of living in a more enlightened time than that of our grandparents, automatically and instinctively empathise and sympathise with the people who had the experience of being abandoned, for whatever reason, and placed into child care homes, which were cold places for any child who could have expected to be brought up in a loving environment. The State looked back on the record of our predecessors, our forebears in this Chamber and those responsible for placing, with the authority of the State, people into institutions which subsequently turned out to be places of extraordinarily abuse. We are all familiar with that. I have had some experience in this regard and I have to say that the Government has not been satisfied that in the case of the people who were placed in the Bethany Home and who had a very difficult and harsh experience, which no one can excuse, agents of the State were responsible for placing those people into those homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">I do not accept as an excuse the fact that Ireland back in the day was a harsh and cold place, although that is absolutely true. As the Minister is aware, the Bethany Home was a maternity home, a children's home and a place of detention for women. The Minister knows, as I know, that the Bethany Home on Orwell Road in Rathgar, was subject to inspection under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act 1934. The Minister knows, as I know, that the State, under the Department with responsibility for local government as well as public health inspectors, has records cataloguing the deficiencies, defects and neglect in that home. There is a State record of the neglect and abuse. It exists and it is evident for the Minister. The Minister knows - he knew it on the Opposition benches as did all Members there - that the State failed these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> It is not simply a matter of who placed the children in these homes. The issue is the failure of the State to oversee adequate and proper standards and to secure the safety of those citizens in that home.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">The Minister knows this and the evidence is there; it has been presented to the Government. I call on the Minister in a spirit of justice for these survivors to quickly address the issue, to recognise their experience, having viewed the evidence, to acknowledge it, to apologise on behalf of the State for it and to allow them access to a redress scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> The Minister will also be aware of my final point. As it happens, the Bethany Home in Rathgar catered, for the most part, for children from the Protestant tradition. There is a deep hurt among survivors because they believe that they have been ignored by the State. This is doubly the case because they believe in some measure that they have been set aside because they came from a minority faith. It is essential that we do the right thing for these survivors, that we recognise their experience and put to rest any concern they may have that whatever about the old Ireland, in the new Ireland there is any form of discrimination against any citizen on the basis of religious beliefs.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Along with most people in the House, if not everyone, we share many of the sentiments she has expressed. I am prepared to request that the Department of Justice and Equality would look again at the information to see if something analogous or comparable with that of victims of institutional residential abuse or the Magdalen laundries can provide the basis for some reaching out and redress. That is all I can say at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">There are still many questions to answer in respect of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, the letters and the resignation or retirement of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Callinan. I take issue with the double standards of the Labour Party in government. Last night, Frank McBrearty and Sarah Bland were in the Visitors Gallery. These two individuals have raised serious questions about the justice and Garda system in this country. Their response, not mine, was that it was a mirror image of previous debates they have seen when the Labour Party and Fine Gael were on this side of the House and Fianna Fáil was on that side of the House. The silence of the Labour Party when the penalty points and whistleblower issues were being raised was woeful and the belated intervention of Labour Party Ministers after that of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, was glaring.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I take issue with what I see as the heart of what we are dealing with. There have been many instances of Garda malpractice, alleged malpractice and injustice in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">These include the high-profile and continuing case of Mr. Ian Bailey. When the Minister was on this side of the House, he railed about how badly the Fr.

Why is the case of the Traveller family whose two and three year olds are on the PULSE system not being dealt with immediately? Why does the Minister not agree that these matters should be dealt with very quickly and that a commission of inquiry should be established? Is he afraid to take up these issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_328"> Second, the special liquidator of IBRC, KPMG, has sold approximately two thirds of the mortgage book to two separate US hedge funds, both of which are unregulated in Ireland. Those consumers have lost the binding statutory protections that every other mortgage holder in the country has. Two items of legislation are relevant. One is a Government Bill, the heads of which are yet to be approved. It is due some time next year. Are there plans to accelerate that process in light of the fact that more than 8,000 mortgage holders are exposed and vulnerable? Alternatively, a Fianna Fáil Private Member's Bill passed Second Stage in the Dáil a number of weeks ago. The Government could progress it to Committee Stage for further debate.</p>

The purpose of the directive is to make better use of the procurement procedure to support wider social goals. The Government has 24 months to introduce the legislation to implement the directive. Many small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are effectively locked out of procurement because the current rules are so restrictive, so this directive is a good advance.

          <p eId="para_346">In the event of the Government being disposed to move a writ for a by-election in the coming weeks to coincide with the local and European elections, does the absence of a permanently appointed Clerk of the Dáil present a difficulty for moving such a writ? If so, will the Minister clarify the matter and when a permanent Clerk of the Dáil might be appointed to alleviate that problem?</p>

The Irish people watched as the demonstrators were met with repressive and ultimately lethal force, and subsequently as Russian forces in a matter of weeks seized a part of Ukrainian territory, installed a compliant local regime, orchestrated an invalid referendum under a heavy military presence and finally announced the illegal annexation of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol by the Russian Federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> Our greatest concern must relate to what these developments mean for the future of all countries, particularly small countries like Ireland, that support an international system where respect for the rule of law is fundamental to stability and the well-being and prosperity of all nations. It is necessary to be clear that this is not a debate about cultural affinities, the language that is spoken or the flag that is flown. We must debate the sorts of values that we want to see embedded in our societies and institutions and how we want public life and international order to be structured. We want democratic values to underpin a global international system that is based on co-operation, rather than confrontation, and allows each country to determine its own future free of external pressure, or the threat or use of force. That is why our message has been consistent from the outset. We have spoken clearly about the need for inclusive dialogue, full respect for global norms and laws, including fundamental rights and freedoms, the exercise of restraint from all sides and a total rejection of intimidation and violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> As it has developed over recent months, the crisis in Ukraine has presented the most significant and dangerous political crisis in Europe for several decades. We must take a strong view on what has happened in Ukraine because of our respect for the rule of international law and the values and the culture that underpin this. We must recognise the scale and gravity of the events that have unfolded in Ukraine and Crimea. We have strongly condemned Russian actions from the outset of this crisis. The Tánaiste called in the Russian ambassador on 3 March to express his deep concern and asked him to convey this to his authorities in Moscow. The Russian ambassador has been advised repeatedly by senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of our continued concern. He has been told that Ireland does not recognise the outcome of the illegal referendum in Crimea. We are not alone in our actions. The European Council has expressed the firm view that there is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders in Europe in the 21st century. On 6 March last, in response to Russian actions, the Heads of State and Government set out a three-stage roadmap to target measures against the Russian Federation in the absence of steps to de-escalate the situation. They also endorsed an earlier decision to suspend talks with Russia on visa matters and on a new agreement, both of which are priorities of the Russian Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Following the referendum in Crimea, the Foreign Affairs Council implemented a second phase of measures, including the imposition of travel restrictions. On 20 and 21 March, the European Council added a further 12 names to this list. The council clarified any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would have far-reaching consequences for the federation's relations with the EU and its member states in a broad range of economic areas. In preparation for such a contingency, the Commission and member states were tasked to prepare possible targeted measures. This work is ongoing in Brussels. It is right that we prepare these decisions carefully. We continue to hope that further steps will not prove necessary and that a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the current crisis can be found, but there is a need to be prepared. I emphasise to Deputies that at each stage, the EU has taken a very careful and meditated approach to the actions that could be taken. It has been clearly acknowledged that the three-stage framework, which I have already mentioned, sets out clearly what the EU will do and will consider doing in response to each set of actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> Ireland, together with its EU partners, strongly supports the new interim Government in Ukraine. The EU Heads of State and Government and the acting Ukrainian Prime Minister signed the political provisions of the association agreement in Brussels on 21 March last. This was an important symbol of our support. It was also a clear signal that the EU is ready to offer significant assistance to Ukraine on its path to closer co-operation. It is estimated that the total international support to be provided by the EU and the IMF will amount to approximately $27 billion over the next two years. While the new Government in Ukraine faces extraordinary challenges, it has shown admirable restraint. The EU has encouraged it to ensure the presidential elections to be held on 25 May will be free and fair. We welcome the Ukrainian Government’s commitment to ensure full protection of the rights of people belonging to national minorities, undertake constitutional reform, investigate all human rights violations and acts of violence and fight extremism. I emphasise that those issues are given some prominence in the text of the motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> We have also been active at the UN in New York. Following a Russian veto of a Security Council resolution on 15 March, Ireland co-sponsored a General Assembly resolution which underscored that the referendum had no validity and could not form the basis for any alteration of the status of Crimea or the city of Sevastopol. A UN human rights monitoring mission has been deployed to Ukraine. Similarly, Ireland has been strongly supportive of the many efforts by the Council of Europe and the OSCE to establish a presence on the ground that can assist in providing an accurate and independent assessment of developments in Ukraine. On 21 March, the OSCE permanent council adopted a decision to deploy an OSCE special monitoring mission to Ukraine. This decision sanctions an initial deployment of 100 civilian monitors and provides for an increase in this number to 400. A number of Irish experts with experience of OSCE field operations have volunteered for the mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I will conclude by addressing some of the questions and issues that have been raised by Deputies during previous debates on this issue. It has been suggested that the situation in Crimea is in some way comparable with events in Kosovo. There can be no such comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">In view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo constituted a <i>sui generis</i> case which did not call into question the principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act. This point was specifically stated by the European Council in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Furthermore, the declaration on friendly relations confirms that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force by one state against another shall be recognised as legal. Amid the complexity in the debate, that is a core point I commend to the House. The acquisition by one country of another country's territory cannot be recognised as legal if it takes place through the use of force.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Throughout this crisis, the European Union has been united and strong in its response while ensuring, above all else, that co-operation with the Ukrainian Government has been maintained in respect of its decisions and in full compliance with international law. While it is not unusual to have different perceptions among member states on global issues, all member states have been and are united in their view that what has happened in Ukraine is completely unacceptable and that it will have consequences for Russia. </p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I wish to end where I began with the issue of why this should be of concern to the people that we are all privileged to represent. Why should Ireland be concerned about developments many thousands of miles away from here with all the other challenges and needs that our people have? Why is the motion worthy of support by this House? We stand here as representatives of a country with a very clear history in areas such as this and obviously a clear history of our own. We have a track record of absolute insistence that the rule of law is the fundamental bedrock and guarantor of stability in the international system. As a country which has always defended the values on which the very foundation of peace and stability in Europe is based, we must reject the validity of the referendum in Crimea, condemn its illegal annexation and pledge our support for Ukraine. </p>
          <p eId="para_415"> I commend the motion to the House and I urge Deputies to do the same. </p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_416">I join you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister of State in welcoming the Ukrainian ambassador. In the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade we had the opportunity to engage with the ambassador on these very important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I very much welcome your initiative, a Cheann Comhairle, in suggesting a common motion on the crisis developing in Ukraine and we welcome that the motion before us today is one which evidently has very strong support in this House. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I am glad to welcome the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> The situation in Ukraine is a stark reminder of a more troubling past when Europe was divided by walls, border checks and two very diverging political ideologies. The reunification of East and West can only truly be said to have come about on 1 May 2004 when the European Union welcomed ten new member states from eastern and central Europe. This day was a homecoming of sorts for those countries who had suffered so much under previous totalitarian regimes of both left and right. On that historic day many Members of this House attended ceremonies to mark the accession of those ten new member states to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> What we have seen in Ukraine in recent weeks is an unfortunate return to Cold War politics. The gradual collapse of the previous Ukrainian regime was inevitable once it resorted to attacking its own citizens. Fianna Fáil has raised the Ukrainian crisis in the Dáil on a number of occasions since January through numerous parliamentary questions and a number of Topical Issue debates. We were not afraid to be an independent voice for what was right then and we are certainly not afraid of being an independent voice now.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> In January and February we criticised the Ukrainian authorities for their fatal attacks on their own citizens which left the world in shock. We did not hesitate in calling on the European Union to impose sanctions on the Ukrainian rulers who were responsible for these reprehensible attacks. We are now calling on the European Union to respond in an appropriate manner to the Russian policy of aggression which threatens to destabilise the whole region if not confronted properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The European Council meeting on 20 and 21 of March focused on the Ukrainian crisis and issued a number of welcome conclusions. EU member states signed the political provisions of the association agreement with Ukraine. The rejection of this association agreement by the previous Ukrainian Administration was central in beginning the protests which have resulted in a dramatic change in the political landscape in that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Fianna Fáil also welcomes the European Council's strong condemnation of the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol to the Russian Federation and supports the decision not to recognise that annexation.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> In the absence of any steps towards de-escalation, the European Council has correctly decided on an extension of the visa ban and assets freeze and cancelled the next EU-Russia summit. While we agree that we must always ensure that the EU remains open for dialogue, we welcome the European Council's decision not to exclude additional and far-reaching consequences for relations with Russia in case of any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> In fact, we would support US style sanctions on Russia to show that Europe is not afraid to stand up for what is right despite the impact these sanctions might have on European trade. If there is any update on the Council's request to the Commission and the member states to prepare possible targeted measures, the Minister of State might update the House in this regard. The decision to advance the signature of the association agreements with Georgia and Moldova must also be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> It is Fianna Fáil's position that the results of the one-sided and clearly illegitimate referendum about Crimea becoming a part of the Russian Federation have far-reaching consequences for the concepts of national territory and sovereignty which must concern us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> It is obvious to everyone here that there has been an ongoing attempt by Russia to muddy the waters and create distractions about Ukraine in the past three months, but it is clear that what we believe we are dealing with is a former imperial power that is acting with aggression against a sovereign state. This crisis has been directly created by the mindset that Russia has the right to control the destiny of a state that used to be a part of the Soviet Union. Russia hopes that the strength of its verbal and commercial counterattacks will prevent the democratic world from standing up to it. We should ensure that its contention is incorrect in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> It appears to be the wish of the strong majority of Ukrainian people to be part of the European democratic mainstream. If that is their wish, then our belief in the supremacy of democratic principles must ensure that their wish be respected. Russia's reaction thus far has been anti-democratic and aggressive. The Russian authorities began by threatening to crush the Ukrainian economy if an association agreement was signed with the European Union. They have now succeeded in undermining the sovereign territory of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> It is our contention that every single element of Russia's story for the annexation of Crimea is illegitimate. We have already outlined our thinking on this matter in the Dáil and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade but it is important to re-emphasise that again here today. Along with colleagues from all parties we engaged in strong and vigorous debate with the ambassador of the Russian Federation to Ireland at that time. My party's leader, Deputy Martin, referred to the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in discussing and having the opportunity to bring in the Ukrainian and Russian ambassadors to hear at first hand our concerns and also give them the opportunity to put forward their points of view. At that committee Members of all political parties and none were very vigorous in their condemnation of the Russian actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Russia had begun its efforts to undermine the sovereign territory of Ukraine by stating that its actions were to defend Russian civilians from being suppressed by Kiev. The facts remain that, at that time, the only people who had been beaten off the street were Russians protesting against their Government in Moscow and Ukrainians supporting their Government in Sevastopol. No evidence whatsoever of the mistreatment of the Russian minority has been produced. Of course, we would not stand for any minority being denied their basic rights in any country. The initial claims of more than 500,000 people fleeing to Russia lacked any credibility and, as a result, Moscow dropped these claims from its narrative. The only fleeing populations have been Ukrainians and Tartars fleeing from the Crimea.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Second, there is the falsehood that no Russian troops were involved in actions on Ukrainian territory. The Russian authorities seem to believe that by taking markings off uniforms, they will convince the rest of the world they are not involved. The evidence in this regard is clear. All of the vehicles being used at that time to control Crimea had Russian military number plates and these vehicles included light and heavy armour. The weapons available to the annexation troops are standard issue for Russian troops. Most conclusively, the warships blockading the Ukrainian fleet were Russian. Unless Moscow expects us to accept that replica warships to ones in its fleets appeared and were under the control of local militias, the evidence is conclusive, namely, Russian troops invaded and took control of Ukrainian territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> Third, the legitimacy of Viktor Yanukovych as Head of State in Kiev is still being supported by Russia, he having fled to Russia seeking help. What is lost in this argument is the fact that Mr. Yanukovych is responsible for killing demonstrators on the streets of Kiev. It was he who refused to implement agreements to resolve the crisis and he who fled the country. No one is asking for his restoration to office given the evidence of the kleptocracy he ran, and that evidence is now overwhelming.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Finally, Russia claims there is nothing to hide. Yet, extraordinary steps are being taken to prevent any external agency from gaining a presence on the ground in Ukraine. The Minister of State referred to the importance and potential of the work of the OSCE, which is directly charged with being able to monitor these situations. It has groups on constant standby, ready to go into areas of unrest or conflict and create the basis for a unified international reaction. However, the OSCE monitoring team has repeatedly been refused access to Crimea by Russian forces. This has included an incident where an OSCE monitoring team, including a senior officer of the Irish Army, had warning shots fired at it. In addition, a United Nations representative was subjected to mob intimidation while Russian troops looked on. That is not acceptable to the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> In order to engage with Russia on this issue, we need to ensure that the facts do not get lost in the spin over substance approach of the Russian authorities. We need to ensure that the European Union and the United States do not engage in a fanciful debate which gives any credit to false accusations which suit one agenda alone. We need the facts from both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> The actions taken by Russia over the past few weeks have been very disturbing in their likeness to similar actions and tactics used by Germany in the 1930s. We all hope that the confiscation of Crimea and the undermining of other nations' national sovereignty is the end of the similarities between the German authoritarian regime in the 1930s and the actions of the Russian authorities today. We are all well aware that Russia is not Nazi Germany but it is an increasingly authoritarian state and a consistent opponent of basic democratic norms and the right of the international community to promote those norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> Russia's support of the Assad regime in Syria has helped the latter to survive and create a humanitarian catastrophe. That much is clear. The non-working of the United Nations and its failure to achieve a resolution to assist in the catastrophe and major humanitarian disaster in Syria, due to this being blocked by China and Russia, is most disappointing. The United Nations Organisation, which we depend upon to promote harmony, to deal with international issues and to deal with issues concerning poverty, hunger and famine, has not been working, unfortunately. To some extent, Syria has gone off our screens and it does not get the coverage it did in the past, but the horrors of Syria remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Some have asserted that Ireland should not take a position on this matter, that we are a neutral country and that taking a position undermines that claim. Some state that we should only be concerned with business and trade when dealing with these issues. I fundamentally disagree with this point of view. The fact is that if we are a country which believes in the rule of law in the international community, if we are a country that believes democracy matters and that basic human rights should be respected, we must speak up about what has happened and what is happening in the Ukraine at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> We brought motions before this House in January and February in regard to the disturbances and loss of life in Kiev under the previous Administration. We outlined at that time our concerns and, I believe, the concerns of the Irish people in regard to that situation. Equally, today, we will express the views and concerns of our own people when there is so much at issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> I note the very recent comments attributed to a senior NATO officer, who referred to Russia's placing of its forces on Ukraine's border. He said that if it decided to carry out an incursion into the country, it could achieve its objective in three to five days. That commentary, if valid, is very worrying. It is estimated in the same commentary that a 40,000 strong force of Russian soldiers is on the Ukrainian border. Reference has also been made to the Russian forces having aircraft and helicopter support as well as field hospitals and electronic warfare capabilities. As part of the international community, we should hope there will be no further Russian intervention in Ukraine, which would be a mistake of monumental and historic proportions.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> As I said to the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, on Question Time earlier today, we must have a strong voice at the EU Council of Foreign Ministers in regard to this very important issue. We want the issue dealt with as quickly as possible to make clear that we stand up for the rule of international law and that we will not accept, where possible, encroachment on people's sovereignty and interference with territorial integrity by a foreign power. What has been happening over the past few weeks is not acceptable. I am glad to have the opportunity to support the motion put before us by the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_440">It is important that we all stand united with the Ukrainian people at this very worrying and extremely difficult time. If any message goes out from here today, it should be that while there may be differences in regard to our analysis of the way forward, the most important thing is that this House stands united in wanting what is best for Ukraine and its people. There are many similarities between both our countries. I would argue that our peoples are warm, friendly and educated and we both have young populations. There is a love of life, of music and of culture. The two countries have had a difficult relationship with their nearest neighbour. They have suffered occupation, intimidation, repression, division, censorship, war and famine, which is a particular similarity of Ukraine and Ireland. The natural resources were stripped from the two countries for the benefit of others rather than themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The Ukrainian people have suffered under corrupt and ineffective governments for too long. The result has been a deterioration in socioeconomic conditions and the effective bankruptcy of the state. The recent problems in Ukraine stem from the EU, US and Russia playing a zero-sum geopolitical game with the country. Ukraine basically got an offer to throw all its eggs into the EU basket on the off-chance that, down the line, it might get EU membership in a few years' time and an offer to throw all its eggs into Russia's basket and continue to be under its thumb while surrounded by countries who took the EU route. Meanwhile, the country was slowly becoming bankrupt, regressing in socioeconomic terms and was rife with corruption. Rather than trying to railroad Ukraine down one particular political route, the EU and Russia should have been working together to create mutually beneficial and non-exclusive economic, political and social relationships with Ukraine. This policy direction would have been of real and genuine benefit to ordinary Ukrainians.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> There is an urgent need for restraint from all sides within Ukraine and from foreign powers at this crucial time. We have not seen that from the EU, the US or Russia. The interim government in Kiev has very little legitimacy, particularly for people living in the east. The country continues to be divided, and attempts by the EU, the US and Russia to increase their influence merely exacerbate tensions and make complex problems worse. I am under no illusion regarding Russia's self-interest in this region and its reasons for its recent behaviour, but the EU’s actions have been just as disastrous for the Ukrainian people.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The EU has ploughed ahead with its association agreement with Ukraine, one of the primary causes of the escalation in the first place. Surely the EU should not be forcing through such an important document with an interim government that was not democratically elected. It is basically locking future elected governments into a straitjacket in respect of the EU's political and economic structures. That is unacceptable. It has been suggested that one of the first effects of this agreement will be a 50% increase in domestic gas prices on 1 May 2014. The EU and IMF are demanding this to provide financial support to Ukraine. This is a sample of what is coming down the track for the people of Ukraine. Before this, domestic gas prices were heavily subsidised by the Ukrainian Government, which literally ensured people did not starve or freeze to death during the winter. We all know the unique conditions of a Ukrainian winter. Despite this, the IMF, in its wisdom, believes that to give an aid package to Kiev, it must cut this subsidy. Let us think about the impact this will have on the people of Ukraine. It will certainly lead to deaths and extreme hardship. This is the prospect facing Ukraine indefinitely with no chance of opting out or going down a different road.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Threats of other enormous spending cuts while so many people are in poverty and lack future prospects are enormously unpopular throughout Ukraine, but especially in the east. So far, these neoliberal, austerity measures have been spectacularly unsuccessful elsewhere in Europe, including in Ireland. They have increased unemployment, emigration, the sale of state assets and the destruction of social services and social protection schemes, and the same will happen in Ukraine. While some people will think that this is fantastic and that we have a way out of this crisis, if one looks at what is happening in many countries across Europe, including this country, one can see the options are not fairly rosy given what is happening to ordinary people in their communities and family homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Sinn Féin tried its best to get all-party support for a motion on the current situation in Ukraine and Crimea. It was and is important that a joint message is sent out in support of the ordinary people in this region. Again, I apologise for the confusion, some of which is down to my lack of experience in this area. We have difficulties in respect of the motion. I note that it is down on the Order Paper and is signed by our party leader, Deputy Adams. I originally thought the motion was a Government motion and that the Government was looking for input from parties. I did think it was looking for a cross-party motion on this issue. We put forward some amendments to the Government's motion and are willing to compromise on others, but we have difficulties in respect of this motion as it stands. I welcome the fact there was movement from the Government and that many of the concerns are addressed in the motion. I want to express solidarity with the Ukrainian people. It is not a case of people changing their minds mid-stream. We have consistently spoken in this House and outside it about what we see as the best way forward for the people of Ukraine. We have a difficulty with the inclusion of a line welcoming the signing of the association agreement. I recognise it is a compromise motion but that was a major difficulty we had with it. I apologise for the confusion. The agenda of those un-elected EU bureaucrats who are wedded to neoliberal policies and who seek to extend their influence eastwards by spreading a destructive austerity is not something we welcome. We have a difficulty with this agreement and I have explained the background to this difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Another major issue of concern, which is shared by practically everyone in this House, is the make-up of the interim government in Kiev. Three members of the current interim government are from the far-right, neo-Nazi Svoboda party, including the Deputy Prime Minister, the environment Minister and the agriculture Minister. Until his resignation last week, the defence Minister was also from Svoboda. We are concerned about the inclusion of these far-right, neo-Nazi, anti-semitic politicians as ministers in the government. The Ceann Comhairle will come in and tell me I cannot mention people but if one looks at the history of the policies of the party, I am very concerned about some of its public utterances. The rabbi of Kiev has spoken about them and even suggested that people of the Jewish faith leave Kiev because of the lack of safety. Any of us who are conscious of history and events that happened in the past in other countries in that region have huge concerns about what is happening. We feel that the inclusion of these far-right, neo-Nazi, anti-semitic politicians as ministers in the government, coupled with the attempts by the government to impose controversial laws such as removing Russian as an official language, sends an extremely worrying signal to linguistic, religious and ethnic minorities in Ukraine. The fact that the EU sees this government as a natural ally and has not spoken out against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in an unelected interim government is extremely worrying. I know there are concerns across Europe about the composition of this new opposition-led coalition, which have been expressed publicly and privately. The new opposition-led coalition has so far failed to persuade right wing militia groups to disarm. Is it any wonder that minorities are living in real insecurity and fear?</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> The referendum which took place in Crimea on 16 March 2014 is another factor in this escalating crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The referendum was held under the worst possible conditions with a poor security situation and tense atmosphere, international pressure, a short run-in, a lack of open and democratic debate, press restrictions and a lack of dialogue preceding the referendum. The referendum was not in line with good democratic practice in my opinion, an opinion shared by most Members of this House. I am not opposed to referendums to decide self-determination but they must be conducted in line with good democratic practice. It is clear that there is a great deal of support in Crimea for separating from Ukraine and joining Russia. However, there should first be dialogue and negotiation within Ukraine, free from outside interference, with a view to finding an overall agreement on the future of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Sinn Féin condemns the political, economic and military interference in Ukraine and Crimea by the US, EU and Russia. There must be open dialogue between all sides in Ukraine and respect for human rights. There is a need for foreign powers to end hostilities and rising tensions by stating they will not militarily intervene and will stop meddling in Ukraine's internal affairs. Ukrainians are the only people who should ultimately decide their own future with self-determination through democratic means.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> The make-up of the interim government is extremely worrying due to the inclusion of extreme right-wing neo-Nazis in key ministerial positions. We reject the signing of the association agreement with the interim government which is un-elected and, therefore, has no mandate to sign such an agreement. That feeds into the Russian arguments and creates more difficulties rather than resolving the problem. It also ties the Ukrainian people into austerity. The austerity measures that the EU is imposing as a condition for providing aid will slash pensions and public services and will increase unemployment and further impoverish the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> All efforts need to be directed at de-escalating the crisis and allowing the people of Ukraine to discuss and seek agreement on their future. The more Ukraine improves it socio-economic development, the less likely it will be that the country can be used as a geo-political football, as it has been for so long. This should be the focus of all efforts and support in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">One second please. I ask the Deputy to resume his seat for a moment. Three amendments have been tabled. Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputies Mick Wallace, Clare Daly and Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy Joe Higgins and amendment No. 3 is in the name of Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett. I am not interfering and whatever way the Deputies want to divide their time is their business. In fairness, though, I must call the people as they are on the Order Paper, in so far as there are amendments tabled in a certain order unless the Deputies all agree otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">We are opposing the Government's motion because it is adding dangerous fuel to a very dangerous fire that is engulfing Ukraine. We have put forward an alternative motion which is absolutely clear in saying that we oppose the Russian military incursion into Ukraine and that we do not accept the legitimacy of a referendum which took place at gunpoint. We agree with the Government on that but we do not agree with the entirely one-sided approach it has taken in this matter, which could and will fuel the conflict. The approach is giving succour on the one hand to the expansionist agenda of NATO, the EU and the US into eastern Europe and, on the other, to a dangerous coalition of the far right, neo-fascists and billionaire oligarchs who have been busy plundering the resources and the wealth of Ukraine since the break up of the former Soviet Union. Some of those oligarchs, including Rinat Akhmetov and Dmitry Firtash, initially supported Yanukovych but have now opportunistically switched to the other side in order to further their own interests and garner favour from this dangerous, right-wing mob which is trying to manipulate the economic, social and political crisis in Ukraine. This has led, as others have said, to the Chief Rabbi in Kiev telling Jewish people that they had better leave the country for their own safety. It has also led to attacks on journalists who were critical of the Government line and so on. This is a dangerous situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Ukraine has long been at the crossroads of competing imperial interests and has suffered desperately as a result. It suffered at the hands of the Romanovs and became part of what was known as the prison house of nations in the interplay between the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires. It was partitioned after the Russian revolution, suffered under the Hitler-Stalin pact with forced collectivisation under Stalin and 4 million Ukrainians were killed under the Nazis. It is worth remembering just how that history has polarised Ukrainian society. One hero for some in the east of Ukraine is a man called Bandera. He collaborated with the Nazis who were involved in the vicious killing of Ukrainians. The same man would be seen as a mortal threat to Russian speakers in other parts of Ukraine, most notably in Crimea. NATO and the EU are well aware of these dangers. Even Kissinger, of whom I am not a fan, has said that what is going on is dangerous and that NATO and the EU knew what they were doing in manipulating this situation, with the response from Russia being inevitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> We are saying that the Government should be even-handed and neutral in this - say "Yes" to the right to self-determination of the Ukrainian people but "No" to the interference by NATO, the EU, the US or Russia in the internal affairs of the Ukrainian people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_462">We must be honest here. The only reason we are discussing this issue in the House is that a number of Deputies on the Independent benches refused to sign what the Government had hoped would be a cross-party motion. We objected and tabled an amendment because of the absolutely unprecedented partisan and one-sided nature of the motion proposed by the Government. We object to the Government's total failure to recognise that the recent conflict and instability in Ukraine owes its origins, in large part, to the external struggle to dominate that country. That is not just being fought by the Russians, but also by the US and the EU. The Minister of State said this morning that the EU's actions were taken in good faith but there has been a conscious strategy on the part of the EU and the US to openly sponsor the protest movement against Yanukovych and to pump in billions to destabilise the area not because Yanukovych was corrupt - which he undoubtedly was - but to further the economic interests of the US and the EU. The replacement for Yanukovych is even more corrupt. The pushing of the all-or-nothing EU agreement, which would have excluded any economic association with Russia, was a contributing factor in the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> It is incredibly ironic that the Government's motion makes no mention of the role of NATO, which has been key in this situation. Contrary to the claims of the US and its allies, NATO has relentlessly expanded to the Russian border, taking in many former countries of the Warsaw Pact and the former USSR. In effect, what is happening is the build up of an anti-Russian military alliance across Europe and little wonder that the Russians are worried. The <i>Guardian</i> described it as a desire of the Pentagon to have the US navy replace the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimean ports. The majority of people in Ukraine are against NATO membership but the oligarchs have a different view. Yanukovych actually indicated that he was also against it. </p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The paw prints of NATO have not been mentioned in the Government's motion and the fact that fascistic and anti-Semitic elements are in the new Government in Ukraine has not been mentioned either.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Frighteningly, the Minister of State told us he fully supports that government. </p>
          <p eId="para_466"> It is quite clear that referendum was held in very poor conditions, but it is also clear that the majority of people living in Crimea do support the alliance with Russia. A key part of that is the reactionary nature of the regime in Kiev which offers no way out on the policies of economic austerity. The problems in that area will not be solved by Moscow, Washington or Brussels but by the people in the region.</p>

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_467">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_468">To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_469">“calls on the European Union and the United States to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Ukraine”.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> I too am surprised that the Minister of State is giving such wholehearted support to the new, unelected government of Ukraine. Is the Government concerned by NATO's plans to bolster defences in eastern Europe at the moment? Media reports state that a leaked NATO paper proposes opening a NATO liaison office in Moldova, military training for Armenia, and projects in Azerbaijan aimed at securing its Caspian oil and gas fields. </p>
          <p eId="para_471"> There is no doubt that Russia and the United States are finding it difficult to agree on how to deal with their respective ambitions in the area. Looking at the long-term perspective, the crisis in Ukraine is a product of the disastrous break-up of the Soviet Union, which was not well done. It somewhat mirrored the Versailles treaty many years ago and, more recently, the break-up of Yugoslavia. People who were content to be a national minority in an internal administrative unit of a multinational state - Russians in the Soviet Ukraine and south Ossetians in Soviet Georgia - felt very differently when those units became states to which they felt little loyalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> In the case of Crimea, which was only transferred to Ukraine by Khrushchev in the 1950s, that is clearly true for the Russian majority. Contrary to undertakings given at the time, the US and its allies have relentlessly sought to expand NATO up to Russia's borders, incorporating nine former Warsaw Pact states and three former Soviet republics into what is effectively an anti-Russian military alliance in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> The European association agreement, which provoked the Ukrainian crisis, also included clauses to integrate Ukraine into the EU defence structure. It appears that as long as Washington believed the Russian leaders would do its bidding then everything was grand. Yeltsin's attack on the Russian parliament in 1993 was justified in the western media. The wholesale assaults on Chechnya by Yeltsin and later by Putin were treated as a little local problem with support from George Bush and Tony Blair. After his meeting with Putin in 2000, Blair said: "Chechnya isn't Kosovo".</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Rape, torture, homeless refugees and tens of thousands dead was the fate of the Chechnyans. No problem there for Washington and its EU allies. In the calculus of western interests there is no suffering, whatever its scale, which cannot be justified. Chechnyans, Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghans and Pakistanis are of little importance. Nonetheless, the contrast between the west's attitude to the Chechen war and Crimea is startling.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The Crimean affair led to barely any loss of life and the population clearly wanted to be part of Russia. The White House's reaction has been the opposite of its reaction to Chechnya. Why? Because Putin, unlike Yeltsin, is no longer prepared to play ball. He has become "Evil man No. 1".</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> We need a negotiated settlement for Ukraine, including a broad-based government in Kiev shorn of fascists. We also require a federal constitution that guarantees regional autonomy, economic support that does not pauperise the majority in the form of austerity, an end to the terrible abuse of women's rights in Ukraine, and a chance for people in Crimea to choose their own future. Anything else risks spreading the conflict and we will be adding to the problems rather than helping to solve them.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">I refer to my amendment No. 2 to the Government motion. The hypocrisy of the Government and of the European Union in its Machiavellian manoeuvring in the Ukraine is breathtaking. The misfortune of the people of the Ukraine was to be trapped for decades in a Stalinist dictatorship. It was a very brutal regime dominated by Russia. When Stalinism collapsed control passed to robber barons and oligarchs who robbed the publicly-owned economy blind, and to right-wing regimes based on capitalism. Now again the people of the Ukraine have been caught in a ruthless pincer movement between two major capitalist, imperial powers: the EU and the US on the one hand and Russia on the other. Each is pushing its own selfish economic and political agenda, which is exactly the train of events that led to the First World War, although thankfully that is not in prospect now.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The EU is guilty of nauseating hypocrisy on these issues. For two years, I was a member of the international trade committee of the European Parliament. I saw the EU, in its economic dealings with outside countries, to be absolutely brutal and ruthless, pushing the interests of European big business. Kazakhstan is a case in point; it is a brutal dictatorship that represses workers and massacres those on strike. However, for its fabulous wealth its president is feted by the leadership of the EU. They are now jockeying with Russia. The Yanukovych regime was absolutely brutal and corrupt, and was hated by a majority of the people. However, the EU then backed the most right-wing reactionary forces in response to that in order to represent their interests which are now in the government.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Neither Russian capitalism nor EU neoliberalism has anything to offer the working class and poor of the Ukraine. We have the spectacle of billionaire oligarchs in the Ukraine now being placed in charge of regions by the government. </p>
          <p eId="para_482"> All military interference should be ended. NATO, US and Russian forces should be moved out of the region so that the people can shape their own future. Neither the Russian nor the EU's economic systems has anything for the poor or working people. The country's wealth should be placed under the democratic control and ownership of the working class in the Ukraine, and not that of EU big business or Russian oligarchs. On that basis it would be entirely possible to build a new society based on democratic socialism where only the interests of the people are predominant. In such a society all rights, including linguistic, national and religious ones, could be guaranteed.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_483">I am deeply disturbed by the tenor of the motion which is completely unbalanced. While one might reject the validity of the referendum in the Crimea, it should be recalled the Crimea was given to the Ukrainians in the 1950s without the consent of the people of the Crimea. Many of the latter still consider themselves to be Russian.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> My problem with the motion is that it is completely unbalanced. It says nothing about the illegal power grab by Ukraine's far right which has swept into power and is part of the Ukraine's interim government. For instance, the role of Ukraine's national security adviser was given to Andriy Parubiy. He is a founder member of the Social-National party in Ukraine, which is a fascist party that he styled on Hitler's Nazi party. I do not know if the Minister of State was aware of that but if so, he might not have considered moving this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The post of vice-minister has been given to Oleksandr Sych who is a member of the Svoboda party. Last year, the World Jewish Congress called on this party to be banned along with Greece's Golden Dawn party. The Svoboda party has close connections with the British National Party and Hungary's Jobbik party which are completely racist and homophobic. </p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The chief rabbi in Kiev has advised all Jews to leave that city. Is this the government that we are supporting? What about the deputy prime minister? He has spoken on abortion rights and has commented on rape. He provoked an international outcry when he said that "women would not be raped if they lived the kind of lifestyle where they did not drink or did not associate and keep controversial company". That is outrageous. I am shocked and appalled but I do not know if the Government has done its research on this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The interim government of the Ukraine has outlawed two of the largest and most influential political parties - the Ukraine communist party and Yanukovych's party, which I do not subscribe to.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I do not have much time left, although I would like to go into a lot more detail on what has happened, including the fact that they have disenfranchised large sections of the population in the Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> The solution must be about territorial integrity and regional autonomy. It is not going to work without the latter. Hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine consider themselves Russian and hundreds of thousands consider themselves disenfranchised. We will have left a great deal to be desired if we do not include some criticism of the make-up of the Ukrainian Government before the motion is put to the House. It is a matter which will come back to haunt us in the weeks, months or years to come.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_684">As stated, there is an over-reliance by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, and her Department on the private sector to plug the incredible gap in the lack of supply of social housing. This problem is particularly acute in the context of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. For example, as the Minister of State will be aware, in Dublin city the RAS has collapsed. I have been informed by the housing manager, Dick Brady, that 101 landlords exited the scheme in 2013 and that a further 54 had requested withdrawal from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I have been approached by numerous constituents who are on RAS and whose landlords are now selling the properties in which they are living. They will effectively be left homeless, with nowhere to go. To date in 2014, perhaps only five or six new RAS properties have become available.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Rent supplement is a vital support but it is only a short to medium-term measure. The 78,000 people in receipt of it do not have security of tenure. It is proposed to introduce a housing assistance payment and to give responsibility for the administration of this to the Department of Social Protection. However, I understand that the scheme in this regard is only being operated on a small pilot basis in the city of Limerick where the Minister of State resides.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> The housing policy statement issued by the Minister of State in February 2013 refers to a housing-led approach. That is incredible in circumstances where it is proposed to bring only 4,500 or 5,000 social housing units on stream this year. In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, the Minister of State indicated that 2,500 of the 4,725 units that are due to become available will emanate from the rental accommodation scheme. That is unbelievable, particularly in view of the fact that over 4,200 people and families are on the housing waiting list in my constituency of Dublin Bay North.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> The Government has also referred to ending homelessness by 2016. The rough sleeper count carried out in November showed that 94 people were homeless on the streets of Dublin. I know of families that have been living in homeless accommodation for over a year and that are desperately waiting for the Government to take action in order that they might obtain homes. Research carried out by the Simon Community and other organisations indicates that up to 4,000 people in the State may be homeless. There are ongoing difficulties with the shared ownership scheme as a result of the fact that some people's homes are in negative equity. Essentially, families have become trapped. Local authorities in Dublin recently moved to a time-on-the-list system and it was a shock to discover that some families have been on the waiting list for ten, 12, 14 or 15 years and have still not been either housed or rehoused by Dublin City Council or Fingal County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I agree with Focus Ireland that it will be necessary to provide a minimum of 9,000 to 10,000 social housing units per annum if we are to begin reducing our very lengthy housing waiting lists. We may require some 25,000 to 30,000 units in order to work our way back to the position which obtained previously. In 2013 a total of 8,000 units were provided, as was the case in the Government's first year in office. We need to create - at all costs - a stable and sustainable housing market, without any further bubbles or severe shortages. The latter only enrich the developer and landlord classes. Unfortunately, the Fine Gael-Labour Government's record on housing is deplorable. The Minister of State must take urgent action in respect of this matter in whatever time she has left in office.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_690">The housing situation has become particularly acute in the Dublin area in the past 18 months. In previous years, those who experienced the greatest difficulties in finding accommodation would mainly have been single or separated people or those with addiction problems. In my constituency - I believe this to be the position across the entire greater Dublin area - there has been a noticeable increase in the number of families that were long-term renters, that can no longer afford to rent and that are being obliged to register as homeless and face up to all of the difficulties relating to the difficult position in which they find themselves. There is no question but that the rent allowance scheme is failing to meet the needs of those to whom I refer. Landlords are capitalising on a booming rental market by hiking up rents when leases come up for renewal. This is a common problem and my constituency office is dealing with those affected quite frequently. I am sure the position is similar for other Deputies who represent Dublin constituencies. Rent allowance has simply not kept pace with rent increases in recent times. There has always been a large cohort of landlords who have refused to accept rent supplement. In recent times, the size of that cohort has steadily increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Some long-term renters have never previously been in a position whereby they literally cannot find accommodation they can afford. Even if they eventually find something, it can lead to their being obliged to move to a completely different area and can have a devastating impact on family stability and school attendance. By failing to address this problem now, the Government is storing up huge social difficulties for the future. At the heart of the problem lies the issue of the supply of both private and public housing. It beggars belief that when we have such large numbers of unemployed people with construction skills, those in the councils and voluntary housing associations with planning and project expertise and such a huge shortage of social housing, the Government has found it impossible to arrive at a way of building more housing units which reflect the scale of the existing need.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> It is also frustrating that some schemes which could deliver better supply have either been closed down or are not being developed further. One of these is the financial contribution scheme for older persons. This scheme used to operate very successfully in the Dublin City Council area. However, it is currently suspended. The scheme worked by allowing older people whose homes had become too large for their needs or perhaps too expensive to maintain to sell them to the council at a discounted price. In turn, they were accommodated in newly-built, good-quality sheltered housing units. This worked for both the council and tenants. It also worked very well for homeowners who wanted to sell and move to more secure and better-quality accommodation that was more suitable to their needs. It also increased the supply of social housing, allowed young families to be accommodated and assisted in achieving greater population density and diversity of housing, without the need to built vast new housing estates or the type of apartment developments which are often problematic. The scheme gave rise to a win-win situation for everyone involved. It was the lynch-pin of the housing strategy in my part of the city for many years and it worked very well. Older people who were living in insecure accommodation which needed to be upgraded by means of the provision of downstairs bathrooms etc., were able to move into good-quality sheltered housing. The scheme met their needs and helped to free up housing units for families on the waiting list. As a result of the fact that the housing which became available was dotted throughout communities, the scheme was also successful in creating the type of diversity to which we refer as being so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> There is no reason the scheme could not be re-established and the Minister of State should work closely with the HSE to ensure this happens. There is also no reason a similar scheme could not be put in place in the private sector, particularly as there is an undoubted demand for it. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government could do a great deal in terms of encouraging local authorities to designate areas that would be specifically intended for the use of older people who want to live in accommodation that is smaller, easier to maintain and more secure. In turn, this would help to free up more private sector houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The other issue that arises relates to apartment dwelling. There are very few parents who would desire to see their children growing up in an apartment as a result of all of the shortcomings of such accommodation, including size, type and design. Children can be raised in apartment complexes in other countries but this is because the accommodation in which they live is of a decent size and is suitable to the needs of families. In addition, recreational and storage areas are provided. It is time the Minister of State put down a clear marker in the context of improving the standards relating to and increasing the size of apartments in order to ensure that apartment dwelling might become acceptable for families and might suit their needs. It will not be possible to deal with the housing problem in Dublin without apartments forming part of the solution. As matters stand and in view of the very low specifications which apply, apartment dwelling is simply not acceptable to people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_695">I cannot disagree with any of the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. The only qualification I make is that no blame whatever attaches to the Minister of State in respect of the situation in which she finds herself. This is a problem she inherited, which arose as a result of the neglect of public authority housing for a period of at least ten years. The latter used to be the bedrock of housing policy in this country. In the past we could rely on a certain number of people in a particular income group to acquire local authority housing or, alternatively, to buy private houses by using local authority loans. The second option to which I refer has not been available for at least ten years or more. During the so-called boom, the provision of local authority housing was gradually phased out and there was a move to what we have come to know as voluntary housing. As a result, we now find ourselves in a situation where there are no houses available and where we cannot accommodate people.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> In the 1980s the local authority in my county, Kildare, was in a position to approve 400 loans per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">That was in addition to building 350 houses per annum. That is the guts of 1,000 houses in a year. We have been unable to achieve that in the past 15 years or get within the shadow of it. Sadly, all of those people are now back up on the housing list.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Great emphasis was placed on the fact that apartments would be the order of the day in future, that we would become like Europeans and live in apartments from now on and that we would not need houses. That did not work out but that is another story. Sin scéal eile. It certainly did not work out in my area and I imagine it did not work out in the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle either. Irish people, by tradition, tend to want to have a fixed abode that they own or that they have a right to aspire to own at some stage. They then take ownership of it in the manner to which they have become accustomed. It is their investment in life and they rely upon it. The sad part about it is that during the so-called boom we went away from that model and started this transient housing policy, which has been remarkably costly in an administrative sense. It is unsuitable to meet the needs of the people and it is certainly anti-family because that type of situation does not accommodate families in any way. Sadly, we now have a serious issue in this regard. In County Kildare there are 8,500 families on the local authority housing list. I believe a further 500, 600 or perhaps 1,000 will go on that list by the time all the information is collated and all the people have been adequately registered. The problem is being exacerbated by virtue of a housing shortage in the eastern region.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Landlords of buy-to-let properties have been pressurised by the lending institutions to get tenants on board who are capable of paying a higher rent. The result is that a large number or cohort of people have become homeless. These are people who, in years gone by, would never have dreamed of being homeless, but that is the position now and it is getting worse. The problem is simply this: we can do nothing to help them because we have no houses. We have no houses because for the past 15 years we did not have a policy of building adequate local authority houses or providing adequate numbers of local authority loans. As a result, some of these people have been on the list for ten years or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> One of the problems I have seen in my time in public life has been the lack of serious forward planning to meet housing needs. It is not rocket science and it is simple to do. It was possible to do it in times gone by. In times gone by the local authorities were able to identify precisely the housing requirements in a particular area, whether public or private. They were able to adjudicate in respect of the county development plans on what was most appropriate at any given time. The cause of the problem is that there was no forward planning and we are in the current situation as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> There was another reason as well. There was an emphasis on apartments and one-bed accommodation. Naturally, that is not suitable accommodation for families. It simply does not work and it is not possible to bring up children in that kind of an environment. What about the unfortunate families who have children with special needs and who are trying to exist in that kind of environment? None of that was thought out. Some people did what was termed a "desktop assessment" as a result of which we got what we got, which is totally inadequate and unsuitable. It is an appalling thing to have to say to the people we represent that we are sorry but that someone did not plan properly in the past and as a result they will have to wait now. A number of families are homeless. The terms "homeless" and "homelessness" have been bandied around a good deal but this is serious stuff. This is something like we have never had before. There is a degree of homelessness which is affecting people through no fault of their own and these people are prepared to do what they have to in terms of paying rent or whatever is required within reason. They now find themselves in a position whereby they cannot afford to pay rent. As it stands, the rent supplement in the eastern region is far short of what is required. Rents have increased by up to 40% in the past six months in the part of the country I represent. I have listened to some of the pundits explaining that housing rents and house prices have gone up by 1%. I am unsure what the 1% refers to but I assure the House that this has been my experience and that of many other people in the areas with which we are all familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> I wish to raise the issue of supply and demand. Ironically, we have heard on numerous occasions in the past five years people stating that many houses which had been built would have to be demolished, because we did not need them and they were unnecessary. Now, we know that we do not have enough houses to meet the needs of the people in a large part of the country. Furthermore, in other places we have houses that we do not have people for, but they are so far away from family support and the settlements of the applicants that there are of no benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> At this stage there must be a solution and I believe we must approach it in two ways. In the short term we should try to acquire existing houses where we can. That can be done in a variety of ways, including by way of Government bond to support such developments specifically. We all recognise that the balance sheet cannot afford to be skewed in any way. In particular in the aftermath of the bailout we cannot afford to allow our borrowing to increase. If that arises in a meaningful or serious way then our interest rates will go up because we are in the open market, we have exited the bailout and everything we do in the economy is reflected in the interest rates that we are charged. One possible way around this would be a government bond. This has been done before in this jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions for different purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The magnitude and scale of the problem is such that if we had 2,000 local authority houses in my constituency ready tomorrow morning we could fill them without a problem, yet we would not have made any significant impact on the numbers on the list, although it would have been a major help. We need such action now because there was no action whatsoever for several years. This is the position without taking into account all the problems that have arisen in respect of shared ownership loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> I was one of those who had serious reservations about shared ownership loans from the beginning. I had reservations simply because these loans allowed people to buy a property which ordinarily they would have been unable to afford. Why was that situation presenting? It was because there were no local authority houses being built and, therefore, they had no option. Those unfortunate people had no option except to dive in and do the best they could. What really killed them was the fact that the interest rates or repayments on the rental part of the equity of the house went up by 4.3% per annum. That was never the original intention. Someone in some vital position at some stage decided to put the screws on the unfortunate people on the housing list. It was altogether wrong to do so because what has resulted is that those people are being penalised for being on a housing list or for being available to seek a local authority loan or shared ownership loan or whatever the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> We need to approach the situation at that level and reintroduce the old local authority loan system and try to introduce a system that is fair, equitable and available. We should not have a situation whereby those in the Irish Credit Bureau are the people who approve the loans. What does it have to do with them, in heaven's name? I know what people will tell me. They will say that we must credit-check and ensure that people are capable of paying. What should we do with them? Should we leave them homeless? We are supposed to address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> I support the Minister of State in her efforts to deal with the situation. It is a crisis situation now. It is not a situation she created. I do not intend to look at the people on the other side of the House because I know we cannot blame anyone on that side of the House now. It would be very bad for the psyche of the people over there if we were to blame anyone on that side of the House. The memory does not extend that far back and therefore we will absolve them from all guilt in that area. I appeal to the Minister of State to do whatever can be done in the short term, the medium term and the long term. Let us put in place the necessary forward planning and emergency measures to deal with the situation that presents.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">I welcome this opportunity to speak on this singularly important topic. As the previous speaker has outlined, the provision of social housing in Ireland is in a crisis at the moment. We have an unprecedented number of people on the social housing list.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Despite that, the Government, which has been in power for the past three years, has slashed investment in capital expenditure for social housing. Consider Westmeath, the county I represent, where capital expenditure in 2008 was €14.7 million. In 2013, it was €2.1 million.</p>

I had the pleasure of listening to Fr. McVerry last Sunday night in the Church of Ireland church in Mullingar. He outlined the awful consequences that some of the Government's policies were having. Thanks to the reduction in the rent allowance, some people - even those who have not lost their jobs - do not have enough money to pay deposits for private rented accommodation.</p>

While I compliment that sector on the good work it is doing, ultimate responsibility for the provision of social housing should remain with local authorities. I asked a parliamentary question recently to which I did not receive a definitive reply. I wanted a comparison between the amount of funding provided to local authorities and the amount provided to the voluntary sector. I will resubmit my question, as the answer was inconclusive.</p>

I know of a woman who needed to leave her family home because of domestic abuse. She could not get rent allowance because the legislation would not allow her to be approved for social housing.

These grants are critical, as they allow the elderly and people with disabilities to continue living in their family homes for longer than would ordinarily be the case. Saving people from entering long-term nursing home or institutional care saves the State money in the long run. Not only has the Minister of State slashed the budget allocation to these grants, she has also amended the eligibility criteria. No longer can anyone over 60 years of age qualify for a grant to repair a door or window or to do a bit of rewiring - people must be at least 66 years of age.</p>

Every application requires an occupational therapist, OT, report, placing further costs on the applicant. The people availing of these grants do not have discretionary funds. They do not have the €200 or €300 needed to pay for OT reports. What was wrong with a family doctor writing a medical report to the effect that a person whose leg had been amputated needed a level access shower? That should be black and white. Why would an OT report be necessary in that case?

          <p eId="para_775">Anyway, I am delighted to speak in this debate. I was anxious to correct some mistakes made by Deputy Troy.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> We are here to discuss social housing and homelessness. The issue is that there is a housing crisis across the board. It is a crisis for people who have put money by to get a mortgage because they cannot get a house. No houses are being built at present in the State. When one considers the number of houses that have been built in the past number of years one can see there has been a total collapse of the construction industry. As a result, pressure is being put on the rental market, and that is also putting pressure on people who are on social welfare and seeking rent allowance because they cannot compete with the people who are in employment and seeking a mortgage to buy their own house. It is not just a social housing crisis or a homelessness crisis but a national housing crisis across all sectors. It therefore requires a holistic rather than a sectoral approach within the housing sector. It is important that we tackle this with that approach so we can try to find solutions across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> From my perspective, and I have consistently said this in the House, Part V has been the downfall of the housing market in this country. I voted against it in Kildare County Council and have strong views on it. It allowed for the building of houses but did not create communities, and I have said as much to the Minister previously. It is important that we build communities and that people have a sense of ownership of the area in which they are living. Part V destroyed that. In 1997 and 1998 we worked on a development plan for Kildare. We were seeking a 20% contribution from people who were asking for lands to be zoned. The 20% was a land contribution. The council could then decide what to do with that contribution, whether to build houses or allocate it for recreational facilities, sports fields or a school. These are the things that build communities. Instead, Part V came into operation and it built houses. It was the be-all and end-all solution for people on social welfare and people who could not get accommodation. When housing construction collapsed, no houses were being built. As a consequence, the implications of Part V were that the local authorities were not getting any houses to house people. As I said earlier, we must take a holistic view of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I wish to make a few suggestions to the Minister. An 80% windfall tax was introduced under the NAMA legislation. We must take a serious look at that and change it. As regards land prices, approximately two years ago I saw an area of land for sale that was zoned for development. The advertisement stated that it was zoned land with the potential to be zoned agricultural. When one sees that one can appreciate the collapse in the price of zoned land. An 80% windfall tax will discourage people in certain areas from having agricultural land changed to zoned land. That is something we should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> We must also examine the Supreme Court judgment in the McHugh case. Mr. McHugh is from my area in Naas, County Kildare. He was responsible for the fact that Kildare County Council could no longer continue its practice of acquiring land through the 20% contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Another matter which I have mentioned previously to the Minister is having shovel-ready projects in counties. The Minister should write to county councils and ask them to be more progressive on that. Instead of waiting for the money to be allocated and then starting work on a project, the Minister should let them have most of the planning process carried out beforehand so that as soon as the money is allocated they can start building. I would encourage local authorities to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Finally, local authorities say there is only a small number of houses within their areas that are not available for rent because they must be renewed. There is probably more than that. We must have a stronger renewal policy so we can get these houses back into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> There are 6,104 people on the housing list in Kildare as of this morning. We are in a crisis but it is a holistic crisis rather than a sectoral one. If we take a holistic approach, we will find a solution to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_322">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_783">I wish to contribute to this discussion because it is of such critical importance. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for coming up with some money for the funding of social housing projects across the State. The sum for my constituency is €4.75 million and 39 homes are to be constructed. However, it is a drop in the ocean compared with what is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> I concur with what Deputy Lawlor said with regard to adopting a holistic approach to the crisis. One can look at my constituency and the rent allowance levels versus the rents being demanded for private rental accommodation at present, if one can get it. Most private rental property clients cannot avail of the private rental market because their rent allowance is so low that they are being priced out of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> We must do something drastic, and do it very quickly because I am very concerned with the second part of the subject of this debate, which is homelessness. We may be failing families who are unable to find accommodation for a variety of reasons. In the private rented sector landlords might give them notice to vacate or a property might be sold, as has been the case for a couple of constituents who were in touch with me recently. Unfortunately, we might not be able to respond in a timely fashion to such families if they cannot find private rented accommodation. That is a huge concern because we might end up with an increase in homelessness rather than achieve the aspiration of eradicating it in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> I do not blame the Minister for the inability of the Department to provide more money in terms of capital spend. Clearly, we are in the midst of a very difficult financial period and although things are improving slightly, there is still a huge capital investment requirement over the next number of years not only to keep up with current demand but also to cater for the enormous backlogs on the social housing waiting lists in local authorities. If there are 7,000 or 8,000 people on the housing list in Fingal and the national figure is just under 100,000, it is clear we will have to do something drastic to meet the demands of both the backlog of the past number of years and those into the future as our population continues to grow.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_787">The Irish State has never really embraced a full role in the area of housing. Instead, we have seen successive governments allow the private sector have free reign in this area, even to the extent of selling off social housing schemes to occupiers in some instances, rather than introducing longer term rental schemes and so on as they did in Europe. We have the examples of other European countries which heavily invested in social housing over decades, such as Britain and Holland, and as a result these countries have quite a high level of standardised socialised housing stock, although that too is currently being eroded in the neoliberal march across Europe that we see everywhere. However, Ireland always had a low level and a poor approach to social housing, and that is why we are now paying a higher price than some of the countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> We have to call this what it is - a crisis. It is a crisis because we do not have a sufficient stock of social housing. The attempts by the Minister of State to address that are minuscule given the extent of the overall problem. Other Deputies have referred to the huge numbers who are on the waiting lists, with figures having tripled over the past few years. We should note that those waiting lists occurred at the same time as the housing boom. We should remember that RTE used to dedicate whole programmes to encourage young people to buy property, get on the housing ladder, scrimp and save, or take out 100% mortgages. Now we have the irony that some of the people who purchased properties in a massive panic, thinking that they would never get a roof over their head if they did not, have found that they bought a two bed or a one bed apartment in an area which they wanted to be a starter home, got married and had children and they are now stuck where they are and cannot get rid of it. In many instances, they have had to rent somewhere else themselves while they rented out their own property, and they have only become landlords because they cannot live in the house they bought as their home as it does not meet their needs. We have a complicated situation arising out of that mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Other Deputies have spoken about some of the tragic cases that come to our doorsteps but we must recognise that there has been a huge change in recent times. What was initially a trickle has become something of an avalanche at this stage. Not a day goes by without some horrendous case landing on every Deputy's doorstep, and we must respond swiftly, but that is not being done. I will not give all my time over to this, but Deputies know that there is a great number of people on waiting lists for years. The fact that we have to tell people who are on the list for five years that they must wait another five years tells its own story. It is not that the State is not spending money on housing; the State is spending a massive amount of money on housing but again it is going into the private sector. That is not good and it is not sufficiently regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> We carried out a search on <i>www.daft.ie</i> yesterday, which examined properties for rent in Swords, which is where I live. There were 37 properties for rent, and 31 of those offers stipulated "no rent supplement accepted". This is becoming a hallmark of our housing situation. It is not good enough because the Government, like its predecessors, has been prepared to abdicate responsibility for housing to private landlords, who are then free to discriminate as they see fit. That is unacceptable in a modern society, as if being in receipt of a social welfare payment is some sort of a character flaw when it reality it is a flaw of our economic system which needs to be addressed. It is not good enough that this situation is being allowed to prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Threshold carried out a survey which showed that more than 50% of people receiving rent supplement from the State are topping up those payments. Threshold is a great organisation and does good research. We all know its findings are true. I am surprised it is that low, because nearly everybody with whom I deal is paying over the odds and is topping up their rent as the rent supplement being allowed by the State is not anywhere near enough for the market rents that landlords are getting. I appreciate what has been said before and that we do not want to be contributing to driving up rents but the only consequence of the way in which the Government is dealing with this is that it is driving people into homelessness and into hostels, which is a nightmare for families. We met a couple who were on the council housing list for five years and there was a change in the ownership of the property in which they were staying. The couple, one of whom was working, and their three children had nowhere else to go. They were moved from north County Dublin into a hostel on the south side of the city. Every morning they had to bring the children to school in Swords. On the weekend of St. Patrick's Day, the hotel was booked out, as it would be for tourists, so the family had to go somewhere else. These stories are being replicated all over the place and the State is spending a huge amount of money on this. Driving people into a scenario like that, which is expensive for the State and not good for those families, is madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> People are being driven out of the areas in which they live and in which their children are in school and they are told to move somewhere else where the rents are cheaper. We must deal with this issue. The Minister of State said recently that the rental market in Ireland should be regulated along the lines of what happened in other European countries, and suggested that the price of rented accommodation should be capped in line with the cost of living, which would be of some benefit in the short term. However, we need a much more longer term solution which must involve providing more housing stock. That means construction, which is not in the right places where there is a need, is essential. There is a pool of properties, which are currently owned by reluctant landlords, which are those who bought their property as a home and are only keeping it as a rented property in order to be able to pay the bank back some contribution for it. They would happily give back the keys if they thought they were not being left with a debt. The State needs to evaluate the number of such properties and whether a collective scheme can be undertaken where they are taken into the ownership of the State. Let us remember that many of the banks are in our ownership and much of the rent that is being paid on those properties is being paid through rent supplement to people who do not want to be landlords in the first place. We need to be creative and we need to look at that whole area as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The issue of rent controls must be considered in this scenario, so that at least rents are affordable for everybody. Many examples have been given about the experience in other countries, such as Germany, where rents have been regulated since the early 1970s. The German rent index takes in a lot of different and very good factors, such as the age and condition of the building and the quality of the facilities and the locality. The tenant has much better rights than they would have here. As a result, rents in Germany increased slower than anywhere else in Europe. They have a rent oriented real estate market, which makes it very easy for people to get rented properties. Only 43% of Germans own their own homes, which is the lowest rate in Europe because the rental market is so attractive, so secure in terms of its tenure, and the rents regulated and controlled. We must move in that direction if we are to deal with the horrific cases of which we are all aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> It is unacceptable in this day and age that families are being driven out of the communities in which they live, that they have been put in inadequate, temporary accommodation and are dealing with the stress and heartache that this has caused. It is the cause of so many problems now and it is not good enough for the Government to state that it was a crisis caused by Fianna Fáil. That is old news. Things have deteriorated substantially within the past three years in the lifetime of this Government, and while some measures are welcome, they are way too little, far too late and not in any way substantial enough to address the housing crisis. We need new start-up builds, we need rent controls and regulation, but we also need to deal with the mortgage crisis which is driving people into the social housing need bracket without the housing stock being there to address it.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">While I do not doubt that there has been some welcome news in this area in recent weeks, it has been quite small in scope because of the difficult financial times we are continuing to endure. We often talk about the financial crisis, but it is clear from what has been said during this debate by Deputies on all sides of the House that we are facing a housing crisis as well. I welcome the funding that has been made available for 15 units in County Waterford. This significant development in the centre of Dungarvan, which will provide accommodation for older people, might free up larger properties that are much needed by families that have been on the waiting list for a long time. Some moneys have also been made available in Waterford city, but the number of units to be developed there is quite small and more are needed. This development of social housing in Waterford is positive, but it is just a drop in the ocean.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I would like to illustrate my point by referring to the small town of Dungarvan, which had a population of just under 10,000 people at the last census. I have alluded to the development that has been sanctioned on the site of the old Ormonde cinema. We often hear about housing problems in cities, but the fact that there are over 400 names on the Dungarvan Town Council housing waiting list is an illustration of the extent of the housing crisis. Single people and families are waiting on the council to provide them with accommodation. The level of funding being provided is just not enough to make inroads into the lengthy lists. Not enough houses are available to meet the needs of individuals and families. Housing is at the top of the agenda when people call into my constituency office every day of the week. It is a huge issue for the people I meet at my clinics. As other Deputies have said, people are not considered for housing unless they have been on the list for more than five years. This problem is not confined to large urban areas and cities. It is important to point out that it affects every town around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> I have found during my work on this issue that there is a particular shortage of three-bedroom family accommodation. I understand that internal research which has been carried out by the Labour Party shows that there is also a shortage of accommodation for single people. For many years, policy has understandably favoured certain groups while failing to meet the needs of people who are not married and do not have dependants. As a result, many single people have had to live in bedsits and other unsatisfactory forms of housing. We know that living in poor accommodation can lead to poor health outcomes. It is important that we try to meet the needs of all groups of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> The Minister of State will agree that the most frustrating aspect of the housing issue for public representatives and their constituents who are looking for housing is to have to walk past houses that are boarded up. While I welcome the moneys the Minister of State has made available to local authorities to deal with the issue of void units, it is up to the local authorities to spend those funds in a way that provides homes for people. We have all heard about bathrooms and kitchens that are perfectly fine being torn out of houses, thereby delaying families from accessing those homes and increasing significantly the cost to the Exchequer of providing housing. A common-sense policy needs to apply as we deal with this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> An estate renewal programme is vital because there are ongoing problems in large residential areas with empty houses. When a house that may be unattractive but is potentially tenantable and inhabitable is allowed to stay empty, the local area can unfortunately become affected by anti-social behaviour and crime. The projects and initiatives that are being pursued in Limerick, with which the Minister of State is very familiar, need to be extended across the country. A great deal of investment has been made in the regeneration of the Ballybeg area of Waterford. The aesthetic improvements that have been made to that housing estate have lifted the whole area. The benefits of that initiative in areas like social capital, community potential and how people live their lives provide first-hand evidence of the positive effects of regeneration. It is a good investment because it prevents the degeneration of a community, which is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> I would like to mention some other issues before I run out of time. Many families are trapped in the rental accommodation scheme. If they accept a contract under the scheme, they have to come off the housing list. If their family circumstances change for some reason, or if their landlord no longer wants to rent the property after the five years have elapsed, they have to go back to square one because they are not on the housing list. I know the rental accommodation scheme provides a solution in the short term, but it is not suitable for families or communities in the long term. Essentially, we are asking people to uproot and move every five years. I do not think that is a good social policy. I do not think it is good for families, children or communities. While I commend the Minister of State on the work she is doing in this regard, I think we need to do more. The Minister of State needs the help of her colleagues, including the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, as she tries to secure the finances required to tackle this crisis. I hope they are listening to this debate.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_802">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue. At the risk of sounding flippant, I am tempted to say in response to Deputy Troy, who got very excited when he spoke earlier, that this is another fine mess the Deputy's Fianna Fáil colleagues got us into. I said in this House a few weeks ago that the Government needs to place a greater focus on social housing and homelessness. After all the house-building of the boom era, it is incredible that we are having to deal with a housing crisis again. It beggars belief that we built so many houses but now we do not have enough properties to cater for those on the local authority lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> I trace all our difficulties in this area back to the decision of a Fianna Fáil Minister, Martin Cullen, to water down the 2004 legislation in a way that ensured our response to housing supply difficulties was led by developers, rather than being based on housing need. I believe our problems in this regard have arisen from that amendment. It is unbelievable after a building boom that we are now facing a housing crisis of great proportions, but that is what the Minister of State has inherited. My constituency is considerably affected by this issue. I thank the Minister of State for investing capital funding in six housing units in the Borris area of County Carlow. I know it is not a huge development, but it will have a huge impact on an area that has faced a chronic housing problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> I am a member of the Labour Party sub-committee on housing, which has been actively identifying specific areas that require precedence and focus from the Department. The developing crisis in this sector can be attributed to a shortage of supply. Demand for social housing units exceeds supply to such an extent that it is proving impossible for local authorities to meet the needs of those who are most in need and most vulnerable. My office, like that of every other Deputy who has spoken, is inundated on a daily basis with housing representations, the volume of which has increased significantly over the past nine months. In December 2013, some 72% of those classed as eligible for social housing were dependent on social welfare, 15% of them were in some sort of employment and 2% of them were being incentivised under the back to work scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> I cannot stress enough the importance of accurate data in the area of housing need. I believe we have achieved that now. Deputy Durkan referred to a desktop study of how housing needs are responded to. I believe we must have accurate data. In 2014, an assessment of social housing need revealed that over 89,000 people were in need of housing. This level of need is further amplified by the current cap on rent allowance and the high rental rates, which have resulted in a substantial reduction in the availability of private rented accommodation. Rental rates in Kilkenny have reached €850 a month. The rental accommodation scheme has played a pivotal role in recent years in delivering units in the private rented sector to those most in need of housing who cannot be accommodated by means of social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> Unfortunately, rental rates are now rising rapidly and landlords are refusing to accept rent-supplement tenants over private tenants. Some 27 landlords in Kilkenny left the RA scheme in 2012, which compares with only 12 in 2012. Rising house prices in Counties Kilkenny and Carlow are linked with February's CSO figures indicating that property prices have increased by more than 8%. This demonstrates how in the absence of an increase in the supply of social housing, the introduction of rental caps in the short term will merely aid the further deterioration of the social housing sector as the economy continues to improve. </p>
          <p eId="para_807"> In February, five out of seven residents in the Amber women's refuge were referred to it owing to homelessness while the Good Shepherd centre had 22 residents, which was its highest number of residents in years. There has also been an increased use of bed and breakfasts and hotels by the local authority to provide emergency accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> I welcome the Minister of State' decision to renew the State's house building scheme. I also welcome the money allocated for voids. I also welcome the Minister of State's very proactive approach to address the issue of unfinished housing estates. Urgent action is required in the interim, as the crisis is getting worse. I would also like to see the introduction of rent moderation and rent regulation in the Irish market. As has been mentioned, these measures are used across Europe and I do not see why we cannot introduce it here. We should introduce a professional level of landlordism in Ireland, which might help in dealing with the crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_810">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate on the issue of housing, homelessness and social housing. The issue is very complex as well as being a shortage of homes and houses. We need to focus on the neediest in our society. I would put the focus on those who have no home, flat or apartment. We need to get these people into a stable environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> As a former full-time voluntary worker and soup runner with Simon, I saw at first hand the complexities of people who were homeless. Some had mental health issues, some had drugs and alcohol problems and some were on the margins of society. I commend the voluntary organisations that are doing a magnificent job in providing heat and shelter for these priority cases. These are the people we see sleeping in the doorways. Many of them are afraid to go into a hostel. I would describe many of them as very gentle, soft human beings but they are afraid they will be mugged or robbed in some hostel situations and they would rather sleep out in the cold and wet than be attacked or assaulted. That is something we need to deal with. There are also the people with major alcohol and drugs problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> Deputies from all parties, and particularly those from the Technical Group, have been inundated with people on the housing list unable to get a home. We have also seen people with tears in their eyes because they either have not got a home or they are being evicted by a landlord as they are getting the rent allowance or because they are very poor families. We need to address this very serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> I accept it is important to build up our social housing stock, but we also need to consider the negative costs if we do not act on this issue. The lack of housing and homelessness are having a damaging social impact on families. I know that from my previous job when I worked as a primary school teacher in the north inner city. The children, who were living in hostels or other such accommodation and did not have a stable home, were the ones who suffered most from educational disadvantage, which was a major issue. Families were going from Billy to Jack, and to different places and different types of accommodation. How can we expect four or five-year olds to focus on whether they have their English, Irish or maths exercises completed? It was not an option.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> As well as talking about dealing with the issue of houses, we have to address the negative impacts on these people who have been excluded from society and do not have a warm home. This also forms part of the educational disadvantage debate. In order to break the cycle of educational disadvantage, people need to have a warm and stable home. These children need to be able to get up every morning, have a decent breakfast and go to school. While we are talking about figures, let us talk about these young people as well. Long-term damage is being caused to thousands of young children as we speak in this debate today.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> The Minister of State recently visited Darndale in my constituency regarding the building of 35 social housing units. I welcome that positive development. The cynics would say it was a small one, but it will have a major positive impact in a small community such as Darndale. As well as dealing with the open spaces where some people are being tormented by anti-social behaviour, some families will get accommodation, which is positive. I welcome that aspect. The Minister of State should note that we are not always having a go at people. If somebody does something right in any Department, I will always commend and thank him or her for it. That is part of the solution and represents a major start.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> The hard-nosed statistics in terms of what is going on are frightening. In 2013, the Housing Agency published a summary document, which revealed that 89,872 households were in need of housing. Some 44% of these were single-person households; 30% comprised single persons with children; 72% sourced their income solely from social welfare payments; and 11% sourced their income solely from employment. Some statistics jump out immediately and I will develop them further later. In 62% of households the main applicant was unemployed; 52% of households had their main need categorised as "dependent on rent supplement"; and 23% of households had their main need categorised as "unsuitable accommodation due to particular circumstances". The assessment notes that "it is likely that this category is populated by households ... with a difficulty in affording private accommodation".</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> Given that of people in those 89,872 households, some 72% are on social welfare, it is immediately linked to the jobs issue. As part of the solution to the housing issue we need to focus on job creation and bring forward sensible ideas to bring these people out of welfare and back into jobs in order to help them to buy a home or rent a proper home which will bring some stability and warmth to their lives and those of their families. In 62% of households the main applicant was unemployed, which is a very important figure in dealing with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> Some 52% of households had their main need categorised as "dependent on rent supplement". In my clinics in recent weeks I have met people who have been threatened with eviction by landlords who are refusing to accept the rent allowance, which is unacceptable in any society. Some of these people caused the economic crash with some of their mad investments and the banking crisis at the time. It is not justified for families to be tormented. Families in rented accommodation getting rent supplement or rent allowance are being told they have to move on so that the landlord can get a higher rent from other people. This must be addressed because it is blatant discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">A number of homeless people have asked me to raise this issue. They asked me how many politicians in Dáil Éireann are landlords, how many of them are renting out lots of accommodation and how many are discriminating against people on rent supplement. I would guess there are a substantial number here. I want to raise that today on behalf of the people who are crying out for housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> By the way, I want to get away from the mentality which seems to be part of the Government view about some people on welfare being scroungers or depending too much on social welfare, and some of the comments I have heard from some backbenchers have not been constructive or helpful. Let me say that the vast majority of the people I know want to pay their way and they would love to have a job and their own house, and if they are in rented accommodation, they would love to have enough to pay a proper rent. That is part of the debate. If we do not do anything about this issue of social housing and homelessness, we are going to destroy another generation. Again, I emphasise the most recent figure of 89,000 households.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> I accept the point that the Government cannot do it overnight but I do not accept the criticisms from some Government backbenchers. They are in power for three years and they won the last election. They should get on with it, stop blaming Fianna Fáil for the bad weather and everything that went on in recent years, and deal with the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">This mantra comes out every now and again, and I listened to it again last night. What I am saying is that the Government is in power for three years now. It has a chance to do something and it should do it. There are not that many people involved and it is possible to subdivide the homeless and housing crises into priority issues. We have to prioritise the people who have no homes and then assess the people who are in rented accommodation and who would love to have a stable, warm home. The Minister of State is helping those families but she is also preventing major social problems in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_824">I welcome the opportunity to speak. The fact we are having this discussion at all means there is at last some recognition of the need to address the whole issue of not just homelessness but housing supply and the dearth of housing. It is incredible to think a previous environment Minister, Mr. Dick Roche, from my constituency, went on the television one day to say, "Hopefully, we will build 80,000 houses this year". The problem was we were building them poorly, in the wrong places and they were costing too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> It beggars belief that we should have a discussion about homelessness or a shortage of housing, but we do. In 2010, that much maligned organisation, the Construction Industry Federation, conducted a survey which showed that Limerick city, followed by Wicklow, Kildare, Limerick county, Cork city and Waterford, had the least amount of reserve housing stock available outside Dublin, and it flagged there was going to be a problem. It was okay when the letting market was depressed but, as it has risen and new family formations have come on board, it is apparent that, while we have spent the past two or three weeks talking about one particular matter, we should be focusing on this issue. This is the big crisis that is coming and we need to address it urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> I welcome the initiatives the Government has taken. I understand that nothing can happen immediately, with the exception of a few measures such as turning around vacant stock that needs to be put back into the system, for which €15 million has been made available. In addition, there is the possibility for local authorities to lease or purchase property and there is the option of allowing voluntary housing agencies to provide some housing. However, the big problem, which I see in Wicklow and know is the same in the areas around the greater urban settlements, is that there are not enough houses becoming available. It is a banking issue, a confidence issue and a matter of getting the whole system cranked up again. Unless we do that, we are going to be firefighting for the next four or five years and we will not sort out the dearth of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> On homelessness itself, the fact the Minister of State will have a co-ordinated approach to this is very welcome. It is estimated that somewhere between €75 million and €80 million is spent each year on homelessness initiatives and supports between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan's office, and the HSE. That is a huge amount of money spent every year for a comparatively small cohort of people in the national context. It would seem a lot more sensible if we were to try to divert 10% of that. I acknowledge that, as the Minister of State said in opening the discussion, some 1,500 people have moved from the homeless services in Dublin in the past two years, with all the necessary supports, which is to be welcomed. However, it would be best if a percentage of that €75 million-odd was diverted into targeted initiatives to provide long-term housing supports to get people out of homelessness and to move away from high-cost sheltered accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> The Minister of State is aware of the grave concerns I have had about an initiative Dublin Simon has put into Wicklow, where it seems there was no consultation with the local drugs task force and no proper tender process. It is very precious about giving out information about consulting with the local community and seems to be using it as some sort of means of drawing down State funding, although I hate to use those terms. While I could be wrong, I certainly have grave concerns about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> This issue needs a multi-agency approach. To be fair, the Minister of State has started in the right vein by creating the homelessness oversight group, but it will need other Departments involved, in particular the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Finance and Social Protection. There is a situation in Wicklow, which also affects other areas, where rent supplement has gone down in a situation of diminishing availability of stock, and where there is a natural prejudice against rent supplement clients because landlords can get more in the open market. I know of one case of a single parent with two children aged 11 and five, one of whom has severe autism. She has always paid but because the rent supplement is going down, the landlord has no choice but to ask her to leave. It is very heart-rending to see this case. In the very short term, just restoring the rent supplement would sort out that person's problem. In another case involving three children, one with special needs, the owner of the property is in NAMA and the property is being sold. It is very difficult to get alternative accommodation because there is no housing stock available, and for the housing that is available, as <i>daft.ie</i> will prove, the rents are far higher than the rent supplement. In that case, it is the father who is the carer of the young child with special needs. These are the human stories that all of us come across every day in our constituency clinics.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I welcome the fact we have the discussion but we need actions. I know the Government is saying targeted construction initiatives will be announced in the coming weeks. Nonetheless, they will take a year to 18 months to roll out any significant number of stock. When one looks at the numbers, probably 5,000 families in Wicklow alone, and 2,500 outside of Arklow, Wicklow and Bray, are on the housing list. To get even half of the housing for those people built in the next 12 to 18 months is virtually impossible. We have to concentrate on the short-term, the medium-term and the long-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> There are now people who are not of the classic profile who are presenting as homeless. There are those who cannot afford to pay their mortgage, although the initiatives with the banks in the area of mortgage resolution are helping in this regard. There are those who become homeless where rent supplement has gone down, when they would never normally have done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The classic case is somebody with either an alcohol or mental health problem, social limitations or a disability. The numbers of such people are being added to by others who should not and might not be homeless but for a lack of housing over the years. I know Deputy Finian McGrath told us to get on with it. We are getting on with it but it is, unfortunately, a legacy issue. Something is drastically wrong when 80,000 homes were being built in a year, yet we have a homeless crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I thank the Minister of State for sitting through the discussion and for listening to what we all have to say. Across the House there is agreement that this is something that needs to be tackled. I hope that any initiatives that are taken are welcomed and that they are incremental and built on. It is expected that 5,000 new units will be built nationally in 2014. It is a small amount but it is a start and we need to ramp that up as quickly as possibly. The units need to be placed strategically. There are ghost estates without the same level of housing need while areas with the greatest need have no ghost estates or vacant stock. This is the key factor on which we need to focus.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">I wish to share time with Deputy Mathews. I will take six minutes and Deputy Mathews will take four minutes. I also welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate on the supply of social housing and the Government's homelessness policy. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is here to listen to the various contributions because, as Deputy Doyle stated, it is a cross-party issue and every Member of this House deals with multiple issues regarding the lack of supply of social housing on a weekly basis. We are all interested in trying to get this issue resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> There are substantial concerns regarding homelessness and the increase in the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin. There was an increase of almost 50% in the number of people sleeping rough between April 2013 and December 2013. Recent figures show that six additional people are becoming homeless in the Dublin region every day, which is worrying. In the news this morning, it was stated that 98 people were sleeping rough on streets at 3 a.m. this morning so there is a lot of work to be done here. The system is broken. It is definitely not working when 98 people have no roof over their heads. No doubt the Minister of State is working hard to resolve this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_836"> We know from the homeless accommodation services that over 4,600 people presented themselves to these services last year. Worryingly, 1,958 - almost one half of the cases - were newly homeless. There are difficulties and multiple reasons, as other Deputies have said, as to why people find themselves in this stark situation. More needs to be done to tackle homelessness and to achieve the Government's very honourable goal of ensuring that long-term homelessness is eliminated by 2016. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I welcomed the decision by Dublin City Council to reverse plans to make cuts to homeless services in January. Instead, it increased supports for the homeless by €400,000 to address the increasing numbers of homeless people on the city's streets. This additional funding will ensure that more homeless people can secure permanent accommodation. We know there are insufficient resources to deal with emergency accommodation. </p>
          <p eId="para_838"> More affordable housing and social housing are needed to deal with these issues in the medium to long term. Another option is that landlords could reserve a portion of their housing for low-income tenants. That should be encouraged, possibly with tax relief at which the Minister for Finance could look in the budget. According to a report by Threshold, a major reason for the increase in the homeless count is the direct pressure in the private rented sector with fewer landlords accepting rent allowance. This is resulting in more people presenting themselves as homeless. The Department of Social Protection is not helping matters by decreasing the rent allowance by 28% since 2011. We know the property market in Dublin is recovering rapidly and that there is a lack of good quality housing. The fact that the rent allowance is not matching increased rents traps people into this bad cycle so, no doubt the Minister of State will be looking at this with her colleague in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> We know from the Daft property website that the supply has drastically reduced. For example, the number of advertised rental units in Dublin has declined from 6,700 in 2009 to under 1,500 at the end of 2013 so it is an issue of supply. When more people are looking for housing and that housing is not there, it drives up rents and creates more problems. We are looking at another property bubble, particularly in Dublin and other cities, if we do not do something to deal with the supply side of things, particularly given the large amount of land banks that surround this city. Those banks must be made available and the only way to do this is through punitive taxes on the owners to get them to free them up and build social and affordable housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_840"> The shortage of social housing is a legacy issue. Like my colleagues in this House, I am inundated week-in, week-out with housing queries. There are people in my constituency who have been on the housing waiting list for more than ten years. The severe shortage of social housing is very worrying. People are being put into hotels and bed-and-breakfasts as an interim measure, which is very expensive and costs extra money. This should not be the case. I thank the Minister of State for visiting Darndale in my constituency to introduce that news about 35 new units, which is very welcome in the area. There is much work to be done here and no doubt the Minister of State will continue to work hard with her colleagues in Government to ensure that the supply of housing comes on stream for people who need it badly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_841">I do not want to go over the individual details comprising social housing and homelessness in four minutes. It is distressful that 90,000 families are on long waiting lists for up to ten years and that 190,000 mortgage holders are in deep arrears and horrible negative equity. I am appealing to the Economic Management Council, the Cabinet, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to join up all the dots. There has been a failure to do that during the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> I have been pressing hard for them to look at the overview, the provisioning in the banks and banks' capital cushion positions. The banks do not have enough. If they had enough, they would be writing down the mortgage debt to the collectible amounts equating to the embedded equity in houses. There is a very simple rule of thumb that anybody with experience knows to apply. If the rent for a house in Dublin, where the demand is supposed to be creeping up, is €2,000 per month, that adds up to €24,000 per year. The capitalised value of that at a yield of 7% is €360,000. If the house goes above that price in a market transaction, it is moving away from the sensible, anchor, economic value. Looked at another way, if the house is owner-occupied, the income in it is €65,000 per year and if one multiplies that figure by three, it is €190,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">They are the anchor magnetic fields or poles that should be applied. </p>
          <p eId="para_844"> We were supposed to have had a banking inquiry and that is important because the prudential rules of fractional reserving and maintenance of proper balance sheets by the banks depends on the knowledge and capability of bank boards to maintain such fractional reserving, namely, to allow only the loans that they create over a period of time to represent about 90% of customer deposits taken in. If they start using other funds like, for instance, shorter-term senior secured bonds and build up their balance sheets, they create a credit bubble. It is a mathematical fact that if banks start increasing their loans beyond 100% of deposits taken in, infinite credit is created on the back of new financial instruments. If they do that, they create an asset price bubble and when that bubble collapses, as it is bound to do, people are left like beached whales. They have huge loans that were advanced to them, which they put into the asset bubble but the assets have gone away. The banks now have the audacity and temerity to insist on trying to collect all of the loans they advanced with money they got from senior secured bonds and other sources, which were all redeemed in full. A case in point is Bank of Ireland which had €61 billion of senior secured bonds in 2008, almost all of which were repaid in full. I am not going to even get into the Anglo Irish Bank example. How was that done? It was done through temporary advances from the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland. That is how they got out but the customers of the banks, approximately 190,000 families, plus the 90,000 on the social housing waiting lists - 280,000 in total or four full Croke Parks - are distressed by debt and distressed by having no house. We should be saying this to the troika. They went away thinking we had turned corners and that there were green shoots. They were not told about the reality that the losses of the banking sector, totalling around €100 billion, have been heaped onto the citizens of Ireland in two ways, through national debt and banking debt. That is wrong. It is simply wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">The Women's Aid refuge in Dundalk is to close its doors with effect from 27 June 2014. On Monday last I received an e-mail from Lisa Marmion, the director of the refuge, which stated that the refuge was closing. The problem is funding. The refuge is to receive only €20,000 to run its operations. The Housing Authority is responsible for its budget. Ms Marmion said that the refuge can be run for as little as €50,000, meaning there is a shortfall of €30,000. Refuge costs include heating, lighting, bedding and so forth. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, took over some areas of responsibility previously in the remit of the HSE, including care costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Women's Aid in Dundalk provides a range of services to women and their children who have experienced violence in the context of an intimate relationship. It operates in the community voluntary sector and its work involves human rights, justice, sexual violence, accommodation, housing and homelessness. Last year 293 requests for shelter at Dundalk Women's Aid refuge had to be refused. This represented an increase of more than 30% in the number the refuge could not facilitate. Domestic violence is not a thing of the past. With the increase in drug and alcohol abuse, we cannot close our eyes to this. </p>
          <p eId="para_847"> I have arranged to meet Lisa Marmion this Friday. I have also spoken to Joe Mc Guinness, chairman of the regional management group of the north east homeless forum, who is willing to meet Women's Aid representatives. Can the Minister of State give me an undertaking to save the Women's Aid refuge in Dundalk? This facility has been the backbone in terms of meeting refuge demand in the north east for years. The services provided by the facility are of immense benefit and are, unfortunately, in great demand. Dundalk and the north east need this facility. I ask the Minister of State to re-evaluate any decision she has made about the aforementioned facility. I ask that her Department works with me to save this invaluable refuge. Can I count on the Minister of State and her Department to work with me and Lisa Marmion from the refuge to explore every possible avenue in order to save this great service?</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> On social housing, I welcome the 5,000 new social housing units that will be provided in 2014 through investment in leasing, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the completion of the existing capital programmes, mortgage-to-rent arrangements and the continued transfer of NAMA units. The additional €15 million investment that will bring more than 500 long-term vacant local authority housing units back into use is also welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_849"> In Dundalk there are as many as 50 properties in just two estates that have fallen into disrepair. I would like to see the local authority given additional powers so that it can take over these houses and turn them into much-needed homes for those on the housing waiting list. Dundalk Town Council is investigating the possibility of acquiring a number of derelict houses in the town. It then hopes to engage the voluntary housing bodies in the development of the sites for new homes. As well as creating much-needed social housing, this would also improve the appearance of the area and help to cut down on anti-social behaviour. </p>
          <p eId="para_850"> Many absentee landlords in Dundalk and other parts of the country are allowing their properties to become rat-infested hovels that are threatening the estates in which they are situated. Many of these landlords, who are based across the Border, have effectively abandoned their houses in Dundalk. Constituents who are on the housing list in Dundalk have come to my office and told me that houses in their area are vacant and have asked if they could move into them. I then discovered that the local authority does not own these properties at all. They are owned by private landlords, many of whom are not registered and will not rent the properties to people in receipt of rent allowance. The properties are left vacant and are not maintained. Rubbish is left lying around and many are infested with rats. </p>
          <p eId="para_851"> One in five households are now in the private rental sector. A lot of marriages and partnerships break up but if a person's name is on the deeds of a property, that person is not entitled to apply for social housing or rent allowance. This is leaving some people homeless and I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue and to help such people to get their lives back on track. </p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I welcome the new two-year capital investment in housing for people with disabilities, the elderly and homeless people which will see €35 million invested this year and next. I also welcome the €30 million investment in improving the energy efficiency of local authority homes which will reduce the energy bills of thousands of families and support green energy jobs.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">Housing is a massive issue. It always has been a big issue but the problem now is that the goal posts have moved dramatically in the past number of years. The Minister of State is responsible for housing and may God help her. She has a very difficult task and if the Government is not prepared to give her any money, that makes it even more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> A media outlet in Wexford contacted me a number of weeks ago and encouraged me to have a kick at the local authority because it was not providing the housing that people would have liked. The truth of the matter was that the local authority in Wexford received €1.5 million last year for housing. It received €25 million in 2006 and the amount has been dwindling ever since. It got a little more this year, admittedly, with an allocation of €2.7 million. That will allow the authority to build 19 units but there are 2,300 people on the housing waiting list. That problem is not going to be solved without money. I realise that the Government does not have an endless supply of money but as others have said, we make choices as to what we do with the money we have. </p>
          <p eId="para_855"> We must take a serious look at housing in Ireland now. We need proper, long-term planning. I could talk all day about the different aspects that need attention. Father Peter McVerry spoke about homelessness recently and pointed out that there were six new homeless people every day and the State was struggling to cater for two of them each time. How the Government is going to deal with that - if it is going to deal with it - I do not know. Father McVerry is at the coalface and is pretty demoralised about what he is facing. </p>
          <p eId="para_856"> A big problem, if one looks back over recent years, is the fact that the whole thinking has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">We do not seem to think that people have a social right to houses anymore and that is why we do not build social housing. The Government provides a lot of money through the rent supplement but I think it is a false economy. It is vital that we start building social housing again. It does not seem to fit with neoliberalism, however, which is the philosophy that comes down the tracks morning, noon and night from Europe. It does not like the idea of the State providing so many services and it is eager to have them cut. Housing has certainly been a victim of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> There are currently approximately 90,000 people on the social housing waiting list but I do not know what the Government's long-term plans are. Does it intend to engage in a massive house-building project? It is a bit mad that, for all practical purposes, the private sector is unregulated. We do not control what happens there, including the numbers built, where they are built or the levels of rent. It is not easy to control rent but it is possible to try. We have seen the Europeans do it lately. In some European countries rents cannot rise by more than 15% in three years. They also limit the amount at which rent can start by the average in a particular district and surrounding districts. That is a start and it addresses the issue in some way. We need to have far more control over what happens in housing in Ireland, not just in State public housing but also in the private sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_859"> Another issue concerns the type and quality of housing, which is a massive problem. If housing is required in Dublin city centre, for example, one can forget about building houses because there is no space for them, so one will have to build apartments. We cannot build the apartments that we have been building for social housing purposes, however, because they are not fit for purpose in my opinion. I have been in housing estates in Turin and Rome to see how they work. They are far more usable and tend to be bigger than here. Apartments have higher ceilings, bigger balconies and more playing space for kids. They work like houses whereas our apartments do not. Our apartments were not even built for private families, not to mention those on the social housing list who tend to have bigger families, so it is more demanding to house them properly. </p>
          <p eId="para_860"> The apartments we built over the last 15 or 20 years were designed for couples or single people, but not for children. I built loads of them myself and we tried to address some of those issues but it was very difficult. For example, we started putting in high ceilings in our apartment complexes but we were losing floors as a result. If one loses a floor it is harder to get the finance to build such properties. The State should play a part in that regard by stating that if somebody is putting four floors in an apartment block, with ten-foot ceilings instead of eight-foot ones to make them better quality living spaces, the local authority should facilitate that. If a floor is taken away it might make the project unbankable, however. Not everybody who builds has billions behind them in the bank. The majority of people who were building worked from project to project. That was borne out by the crisis because once trouble came they could not deal with it and ran out of business. Most of those who were speculating in building houses and apartments, collapsed and were forced out of the business. </p>
          <p eId="para_861"> We need to think about the quality of the product. That leads us to the Minister, Deputy Hogan's, latest attempt to deal with problems like Priory Hall. I am disappointed that the Government has not dealt with the main problem which is a lack of supervision of construction work, which is not being assessed. There is mostly an increase in paperwork and more signing off on different aspects. However, no facility has been put in place whereby somebody would be on site to watch what is being done and check that it is being done properly. Until that is done one will not get the quality product required for social and private housing. </p>
          <p eId="para_862"> The Part 5 agreement meant that one had to provide 20% for social or affordable housing, or a combination of both. What builders were doing in a lot of those cases was scandalous, however, because they were deciding in advance which ones they would sell privately, which ones would be given to the social or affordable part, and they were building them completely differently. Every item going into them was different. That was cheating but there was nobody there to see them doing it and no one checked on them. Therefore they did what they could get away with. That is wrong but if they cannot be trusted there should be greater supervision. For the life of me I cannot understand why the Minister has not dealt with that serious problem. I realise it is an expense for the local authority but it would be money well spent. </p>
          <p eId="para_863"> I realise I have strayed a bit and my time is up.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">I wish to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for coming to Galway last week to visit the COPE premises in Foster Street where it is hoped to establish a new domestic violence refuge. The refuge that COPE operates on the Waterside at Wood Quay was severely damaged by fire and at any one time it can only host a maximum of five families fleeing a lack of safety in their home environment, including violence and other domestic abuse. COPE has been seeking another facility for a long time in order to offer an improved service to more families because the service is under pressure due to capacity constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> The Sisters of Mercy who used to operate the Magdalen laundry at the site in Foster Street have handed over that former convent building to COPE. It will be a wonderful recognition of the hurt that was caused for that premises to be used for the liberation of women fleeing terrible domestic violence, instead of for the incarceration of women as in the past. Such women need an opportunity to escape to a suitable refuge. The convent site is in the centre of Galway, just minutes from Eyre Square, yet it is still secluded with the wonderful secure setting behind a wall and with green grass around it. It is an ideal environment. I thank the Minister of State for coming to visit the site last week. Whatever options she may have within the capital budget, I urge her to examine that project. We have a wonderful potential in Galway to offer a proper, dignified service for these vulnerable people by making that vision for a safe women's refuge in Galway city centre a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> I also thank the Minister of State for visiting with me one of the only builders currently constructing houses in Galway. They are building at Leargán in Knocknacarra. It is a shocking and worrying development when the third largest city - or the fourth largest because Limerick sometimes argues that it is bigger-----</p>

          <p eId="para_868">It is a difficulty that in a city the size of Galway, with so many people moving there for job possibilities, only one company is building any housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Galway is unique in that it was not one of those places which created excess housing. A report from the Minister of State's Department shows that Galway was one of the more prudent, cautious and well managed cities in terms of its expansion and development. The irony is that after the difficult and horrific collapse of the construction sector, Galway is suffering particularly badly because it did not splurge the last time. We have very minimal capacity. On foot of a very moderate upturn in the economy, huge pressure has been put on house prices. In some areas of Galway the price of a three-bedroom, semi-detached house has gone from €170,000 or €180,000 to €220,000 or €230,000 in the space of a year to 18 months. It is a huge increase. It has reintroduced a worry among people that if they are not in the market now, they will be priced out of it. While it is a market, it is fundamentally a question of people's lives. Those who are participating in the market are people who want a home and to plant seeds for the future. We see the same irrationality - perhaps rationality in the circumstances - that persisted in the boom times that if one does not get one's foot on the ladder, one will be priced out. Compounded with a lack of supply where only one company is building any houses, that thinking is creating a perfect storm in Galway housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> All of that feeds its way into every other sector of housing policy. On foot of the shortage of accommodation, people who are unable to buy are having to remain in the rented sector. When they stay in the rented sector, it means demand increases. Rental prices for family homes and apartments of all kinds in Galway have increased rapidly and dramatically. That puts pressure on people who are working and whose wages are not rising at the same rate and on people on low incomes who are barely holding on. A greater proportion of people's incomes is being spent on rent. There is then a further impact on people in subsidised rented accommodation who are in receipt of rent supplement. The caps on the Department of Social Protection's allowances for families for whom social housing is unavailable are not high enough. We are seeing people having to hand out backhanders and top-ups. In many cases, people have been put to the limit financially and have had to leave their accommodation and search with difficulty and often impossibility for alternative accommodation. On foot of the economic situation there is a great deal of unemployment and difficulties with finances. People are reeling from debt. As a result, social housing lists in Galway have gone from approximately 2,500 when I was a councillor on Galway City Council in 2008-09 to approximately 6,000 now. It is a further issue that is in the mix. The only way to describe it is as a perfect storm in housing in Galway. It will get a great deal worse in the very short term unless we do something concrete quickly to alleviate matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I will not pretend the Minister of State has billions in a suitcase which she can release into Galway to start building.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">We must at least start redirecting Government policy in that direction, however. I thank the Minister of State very much for her insistence in the Department that we return to the principle of building. For a long time, the principle was knocked by the Department as something it did not want to do. We wanted to subsidise landlords. We wanted to rent properties and have local authorities foot the bill while long-term value was added. At least now we have funding, some of which will come to Galway to start building houses. It is the right approach. We need much more of it. We need social housing to help those people whose lives are in many ways on hold. It is not until people get roofs over their heads that they settle and build connections and integrate with their children in their neighbourhoods. That is when we see community cohesiveness, not when people try to set up lives in temporary accommodation. While there is perhaps an element of exaggeration in it, someone once told me that staying in rented accommodation for such a long time made them feel almost like being homeless. It was to stay in someone else's home and not to have a home of one's own. It is something we see in the private rented market among people who cannot buy and in the social housing system among those who have been waiting for a house for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Many of the families who come to see me have been waiting 12 years for social housing in Galway. It is not the exception, it is the rule. When people come to my constituency office and tell me they have been on the housing list for four, five and six years, all I can tell them is that it is a list system, that housing is provided on a first-come, first-served basis and that there are those who have been waiting for six years longer. We must start working on those issues now. There are things we could do straight away if the political will was there. While I understand that the Minister of State cannot force every political party in the Dáil to agree a policy position, we must begin investigating and arriving at proposals for the short term on rent controls. It would be one way to alleviate the pressure on those who are living in private rented accommodation. It would stop the pressure coming on those in receipt of rent supplement from landlords who can act on a whim when someone comes to the door with an extra €100 or €200 a month for a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> We must decide once and for all as a country what the place of housing and the home is in Government policy. Is it a commodity to be left purely to the market? That was the position previously and it damaged us greatly. Should we have complete State control whereby all housing is social housing? There is no appetite for that on any side of the House. If we do not have that, we must decide what people should have to pay for a home over the course of their lives. If they cannot afford it, we must look at the State's options. When we decide that, we can build a policy. I worry sometimes that in a knee-jerk reaction to get building going again, we will simply reignite what happened before rather than put in place something different. Rather than to have a "buy, buy, buy" model, we should have a model which acknowledges that some want to buy, some want to rent in the long term and some want to rent for the short term. We need a different housing policy from the one we had before. The previous model has left us with a legacy of misery. We must do something to alleviate the problem right now and in the long term replace it with something completely different.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">We have a chronic crisis in virtually every aspect of housing in the State. There is a catastrophic failure by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, building on the failure of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party before it, to resolve the desperate need for homes. Incredibly, 90,000 families or individuals are on local authority waiting queues nationally. It springs from the crazed property bubble which inflated over ten years to 2008 when developers, big bankers and bondholders were given free rein to profiteer mercilessly at the expense of young working people in the housing market. The price of a home accelerated in a ten-year period to 2006 by the equivalent each year of the average industrial wage. Inevitably, it has left an entire generation in negative equity and shackled in dreadful situations involving unsustainable mortgages, distress and suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Following on from the previous Government, the response of the Government has been that the instigators of the crisis - the profiteers and speculators - have been bailed out and our people left homeless or struggling hard to try and keep their homes. The root of the crisis was the building of homes for profiteering by major construction companies, bankers and speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> A home, the basic right to shelter, is a human right. It is reprehensible that people in need of a home should be at the mercy of the capitalist profiteers in the same way as it is reprehensible that people who are sick should be subject to the profiteers in the health industry. The political establishment and the media, with all that was going on in the property bubble, legislated for it and cheer led the developers and the speculators. They were lionised by the political establishment and the media which pretend to be scandalised about what happened. What happened then and now is that the capitalist cycle and boom and bust is allowed to dictate and the neoliberal agenda, which has intensified for the past ten to 20 years, means that the thinking is all about privatisation. The so-called private market is supposed to fulfil our housing needs with the consequence is appalling suffering by individuals and families. Every public representative knows and experiences that. In my own area we have had horrific cases. Gwen Connell, a very brave single mother with three children, was faced with homelessness when her rent was increased by €400 per month. Gerard Tier with his partner and two young children were forced to go from hotel to hotel under the so-called homeless programme and, bravely, had to go public to try to get some measure of justice and urgent action from the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_879"> Emergency action is needed. Rent controls to stop the increasing rents is essential. It is incredible that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who made her career on the backs of the working class people and the poor of Mulhuddart and Dublin West at a certain occasion, should stand over a situation where single mothers with children are told to go to their landlord and negotiate the rent downwards, in a market where the rents are shooting up because of the lack of homes. That is shameful. </p>
          <p eId="para_880"> We need an urgent programme of social homes. There is a shameful dereliction of duty by the Government in that it is building virtually no social homes. The Library and Research Service has furnished us with the statistics which show that 363 social houses were built in 2012, 486 in 2011, in addition to some co-operative and other housing. Let me contrast those statistics with past periods. The Minister of State's ears should burn with shame and embarrassment when she hears the following. In 1970 we built 3,767 local authority homes. Let me labour the point. In 1971, we built 4,789; in 1972, 5,902; in 1973, 6,072; in 1974, 6,746 social homes; in 1975, 8,794; and in 1976, 7,263. In that seven year period more than 43,000 social homes were built and that was not a time of capitalist boom. There was the oil crisis and other problems of the always weak Irish capitalism but it was prior to the neoliberal drive when Thatcher and Reagan, and then their imitators all over the world, including in the Irish Government, had yet to come on stream. That is a shameful remonstration with this Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_881"> Any homes in the possession of NAMA, receivers, and developers in unsold estates should be taken immediately into public ownership and made available but an emergency programme of house construction is needed. The construction industry is not investing because it is not profitable for it to do so. The major construction companies, with the banks and the financiers, should be nationalised and a programme of major home construction to meet the needs of the people should be put in place. Tens of thousands of construction workers, those who are devastated as a result of the crisis, languishing in unemployment, would have their skills utilised and would be back at work and contributing to the economy. This would help economic recovery. That is the type of radical action that is needed. Ministers come in and moan about the situation and expect the capitalist market to resolve the issue-----</p>

          <p eId="para_886">I thank all those who contributed to the debate which has been wide-ranging across the political spectrum. Deputy Derek Nolan described it as a perfect storm. We are in a position where we have the overhang of the collapse of the economy and the construction industry is not meeting the demand for public and private housing. Our capital budget was slashed and we could do nothing about it for three years because we were signed up to it, but we have come out of that period now and I have announced a mainstream capital construction programme which I intend to ramp up as soon as I get the money to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I welcome the support of colleagues across the political spectrum. I welcome particularly the support of my Labour Party colleagues. Our sub-committee on housing, of which Deputy Ann Phelan is a member, produced a report which was discussed at our parliamentary party meeting yesterday. We do want to construct more housing. In terms of what Deputy Joe Higgins has said, I am not a neoliberal and never will be and I did not agree with taking on the debts of the banks. I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that as a nation we also take on the debts of the developers, because I certainly would not support that idea, if that is what he means by nationalising construction. The Government will publish a construction policy programme within the next couple of weeks. We have to get construction under way again.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> Given that my time is short, I wish to focus particularly on the issue of social housing. First, there is the issue of getting construction under way again. </p>
          <p eId="para_889">A serious problem has arisen because no social housing was provided during the boom and waiting lists continued to grow. I intend to knock on every door to get funding to recommence construction of social housing. I also do not want to see lying vacant in this State any house that can be used as a home. To this end, the provision of €15 million to address the voids programme will be announced shortly. I intend to meet the directors of service for housing to ensure no house is left vacant, no perfectly good kitchen and so on is thrown out and the best practice of some local authorities, in terms of turning around vacant houses as soon as possible, is applied across all local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> Contrary to what Deputy Troy had to say, 30% of the 2,000 units have been transferred from NAMA. A letter received today from NAMA will speed up that process. We need to bring those NAMA units into use. As regards the unfinished estates, funding to bring more of these back into use, although most are located in the wrong places, will be announced shortly. On the voluntary housing bodies, on which people have differing views, the State will provide only 25% of the funding under the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, scheme. The voluntary housing bodies will have to get the remainder of the funding elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> Many interesting and useful suggestions were made, one of which was that the credit unions be utilised as a source of funding in terms of construction. That is a positive suggestion. With regard to the European Investment Bank, a request has been made to it for €100 million to bring 2,000 flats back into use, 1,500 of which are located in Dublin. We hope a decision in this regard will be made by mid-2014. With regard to the local authority loans scheme, I have asked that the decision in this regard be reviewed. I suspect we have gone conservative in the wrong way. There are many non-performing local authority loans but these are in respect of houses that are in negative equity. I am of the view that there are people on low incomes who should qualify for local authority loans to purchase houses. I will have this matter reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> A number of specific proposals from across the board warrant consideration, including the allocation of houses to tenants and having tenants refurbish them rather than waiting until they have been refurbished to allocate them. It was also suggested that the financial contribution scheme be restored and the rural resettlement scheme be revived. The issue of private rent control was raised by a number of members. I am in favour of taking another look at this and have said so publicly. Another suggestion that warrants examination is that a database of rogue developers be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> A couple of specific points were made in relation to refuges, in particular the Dundalk refuge mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick. I will examine the matter. Funding in the homelessness area was not cut this year. The amount provided in this regard this year for each of the regions is the same as that provided last year. As such, the north east should have received the same level of funding from Government. I will follow up on Deputy Fitzpatrick's statement that funding for the Dundalk refuge has been cut. I do not want to see any refuge closing, including the COPE refuge mentioned by Deputy Nolan.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> A number of other issues were raised which will be examined. I am determined that we will address this crisis. I acknowledge there is a serious problem in the social housing area which has been built up over the years. It is one we must try to address with limited public funding. Consideration is also being given to what can be done off balance sheet. We are still required to meet our fiscal targets regardless of whether we like it and so we must operate within that constraint. As I stated, I want every house that can be lived in as a home to be utilised. I want to ensure there is proper control within the private rented sector, which is the purpose of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. There are other issues with regard to private tenants that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, has been rolled out in my constituency and will be rolled out in six other local authority areas this year and, eventually, across the board. It will replace the long-term rent supplement and eliminate some of the poverty traps. I hope it will also flush out landlords who are demanding top-ups, which is an issue raised by a number of Members. This scheme will be gradually rolled out across the board and will, I believe, be an improvement for people in that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> This is not an area on which I have a monopoly of wisdom, although like other Members of this House who were councillors prior to becoming Deputies, including Deputy Wallace, who has just recounted his hands-on experience, I have a great deal of experience in this area. We must use all the methods available to us to ensure every family has a home, which, as rightly said by many speakers, is their right. Houses should not be items of speculation for developers, builders or anyone else. Houses are for families to live in. We must ensure every available house is an appropriate home for a family and that we get the construction of private and social and affordable housing going again. Currently, not enough houses are being constructed to meet ongoing demand. We need to address this. This is the reason the Government is addressing construction and will publish a policy in relation to access to finance for construction, access to finance for people who want to purchase a home and access to public money that can be used for the construction of social houses. We will also have to find other ways of raising money for the construction of houses in order that we can address this issue which is of serious concern to everyone in this Chamber.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">First, I extend apologies on behalf of my colleagues, Deputies Willie Penrose and Jack Wall, who strongly support my stance and share my concerns in relation to this matter but due to other commitments are unable to be here. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to speak on the very serious issue of compulsory redundancy of enlisted Defence Forces members.</p>
            <p eId="para_903"> I am aware that negotiations are ongoing between PDFORRA and officials of the conciliation and arbitration section of the Department of Defence. However, time is of the essence in respect of this issue which is causing great distress in my constituency and, in particular, Kilkenny. The compulsory redundancy of enlisted Defence Forces members, which is based on an upper service limit of 21 years, means those recruited into the force in 1994 and post-1994 stand to be discharged on 10 April next year. These troops will be generally in their mid-30s to early 40s and will have high mortgages, loan repayments, child care costs and young families who must be supported. Many of them are already reliant on the State subsidy of family income supplement. Therefore, this is not just an economic matter but a social one. Continuing in employment is vital to them and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_904"> Naturally, the renewal of contracts is based on eligibility criteria being met, including fitness and medical standards, with which I agree. As well as meeting the criteria, members must also complete service duty abroad and have reached the rank of sergeant through the completion of the non-commissioned officer course. Owing to the recession and subsequent closure of the barracks in Clonmel, there was an influx of transfers to the barracks in Kilkenny.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">This has resulted in a reduction in the number of places available on the NCO course. Most NCO courses have been over-subscribed, which means that, despite having met the other relevant standards, those applying are unable to make the rank of sergeant due to a lack of vacancies. Post-1994 personnel under the rank of sergeant cannot reach their maximum pension, which is 31 years' service, as a consequence. I am not suggesting that such criteria should be deviated from but I am of the view that a degree of flexibility should be shown.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> It does not make sense that serving members of the Defence Forces will be discharged after completing 21 years' service, despite having passed all relevant fitness and medical tests. In some instances, these individuals might be qualified technicians. It also does not make sense for pension and redundancy packages to be paid in respect of these people, only for the positions they held to be filled by other members of the Defence Forces. This means that the Department will be paying pensions, redundancy packages and salaries in respect of the positions in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> Through the training technician scheme, re-enlistment to undergo technician training takes place seven or eight years after someone joins. In addition, 12 years' service may have been delivered by the time a person is fully trained. As a consequence, a fully trained technician will only serve a maximum of nine years. In such circumstances, I fully support PDFORRA's call to have an upper service limit of 50 years for privates and corporals. This would be much more logical and would give rise to much greater dividends. In no other sector of the public service are service periods limited to 21 years. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Tom Hayes)<recordedTime time="2014-04-03T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_908">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, is aware of the interest in the issue and recently spoke on it in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_909"> I will commence by outlining the background to the current upper service limits applicable to personnel who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, after 1 January 1994. Due to the robust nature of many military operations and their attendant physical training regimes, personnel are exposed to a unique range of challenging environments. In these circumstances, it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. In 1990, the Gleeson commission commented on the unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of members of the PDF. Thereafter, an in-depth study of the Defence Forces which was compiled by the then Price Waterhouse consultants - who were engaged by the efficiency audit group, EAG - and published in 1994 expressed severe criticism of the age profile of members of the Defence Forces. The EAG's report was accepted by the then Government in 1995. The findings contained in this report reflected the serious concerns which the military authorities had held for a number of years in respect of the age profile of members of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_910"> The current terms of enlistment for general service recruits arose as a result of the criticisms in the EAG report. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy, with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government that was in office in 1993 had already decided to enlist personnel on a five-year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. In 1997, agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for private soldiers would initially be for five years, with the option to be extended to a maximum of 12, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for non-commissioned officers. In 2004, PDFORRA submitted a claim under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post-1 January 1994, while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges facing a modern military.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years' service must be able to continue to operate at his or her current level, both at home and overseas, on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings. The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows: enlisted personnel, up to and including the rank of corporal - and equivalent Naval Service rank - may not serve beyond 21 years; enlisted personnel, in the rank of sergeant may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of 50 years; and enlisted personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of 56.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He referred to enlisted personnel in the rank of sergeant and therein lies the difficulty. As a result of the influx of other people and the imposition of the moratorium, those who need to reach that level have not been able to do so. Many members of the Defence Forces are skilled in particular areas and they simply will not be in a position to transition into areas of civilian employment. They will be forced to avail of jobseeker's benefit for a period of nine months, at the single rate of €188 per week. The overall amount in this regard will be €1.1 million. The cost to the Exchequer of replacing 100 to 120 post-1994 corporals and privates will run to €1.3 million in pension costs per annum and will give rise to a once-off €2.1 million lost in gratuities. It has been calculated that the State would benefit by €20,000 per individual if they remained in service as opposed to being discharged. Apart from the economic impact this will have on these members and their families, we must ask ourselves what will be the social impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_914"> This matter is causing huge distress. I accept the medical and other criteria being put forward. However, I do not believe it was ever envisaged that men in their mid-30s or very early 40s would be trying to return to the civilian workforce. We are all aware of the difficulties relating to that workforce at present. It is worth pointing out that most of the people to whom I refer have served in Libya, Lebanon and elsewhere. A number of them are currently in Syria and when they return home, they will discover that they are to be discharged next year. There is an element of injustice in the fact that people who have placed their lives at risk for the rest of us might be treated in this way. I understand that negotiations on this matter are ongoing but I want to flag for the Minister of Defence the importance of this issue to me and to the people of Kilkenny.</p>

            <p eId="para_917">I hope that they will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. However, I accept the importance of bringing to the attention of the Minister the points the Deputy raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_918"> As a result of the fact that military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals, it is necessary that members of the Permanent Defence Force be physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and be in a position to undertake their duties when on deployment overseas. It is, therefore, vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised. </p>
            <p eId="para_919"> As such, to maintain the age profile of the Defence Forces to carry out the operational tasks required by the Government, it is necessary to have a constant input of recruits. The maximum age for personnel who have enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 1994 provides the mechanism through which a satisfactory age profile can be achieved. I hope this helps Deputy Phelan in some way.</p>

            <p eId="para_920">Yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i> printed an essay, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, which a little nine-year-old girl called Rachel from Meath wrote about her brother, Matthew. She said she wished her brother could be healed of autism. April is autism awareness month and I am speaking in the House today to celebrate uniqueness while also raising awareness of the challenges faced by those with the condition. Little Rachel explained that when Matthew was two years of age he was diagnosed with autism, that autism has no cure and that some children with autism can talk, understand and communicate, although Matthew cannot.</p>
            <p eId="para_921"> The families facing the challenges that come with autism can and must be helped. It is unacceptable to have what is almost a two-year waiting list for the assessment and diagnosis of autistic children. One of my constituents contacted me recently in a distressed state because she was told that since the waiting list was so long she would be sent monthly e-mails about occupational therapy in the meantime. The sending of e-mails instead of therapy provision is simply not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_922"> The National Educational Welfare Board has stated that it is overstrained but so too are these families. Without early diagnosis parents cannot be assured that their child will be able to access appropriate resource hours or special needs support. This results in children being enrolled in schools for September without adequate support. Every parent should look forward to their child's first day in school, whether in preschool or primary school, but this is not the case for parents of children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_923"> With autism, early diagnosis is essential. Autism is a broad spectrum condition and deserves specific attention. This specific attention should start with a standardised approach to early intervention throughout the country. It is time that we considered the variety of teaching and learning methods being employed for children with autism. At the moment the level of intervention can vary from county to county. I support the wider adoption of applied behaviour analysis, ABA, and picture exchange communication system, PECS, treatments, which have proven to be beneficial for certain children with autism. Little Rachel, whose essay appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i>, specifically referred to PECS and how Matthew's teacher has managed to help him communicate through pictures. With improved and standardised early intervention and training we could provide these children with better opportunities in life and save the State money in the long run.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> Last week, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> featured an article on Patrick Brophy illustrating how autism can be turned into a positive. Patrick, who is from the Dún Laoghaire constituency, was hired by the software firm SAP not only because of his qualifications but also because of his autism. The company values people with autism because of their attention to detail and the different perspectives they can bring to work. I congratulate Patrick on his wonderful achievement; he has broken down barriers. Too often, parents can be made to feel that their child's condition is a burden that places a strain on the State. The Autism Bill 2012 prepared the ground for an autism strategy and was a welcome and positive development. I urge for the process to include widespread consultation, especially with the parents of children with autism.</p>

            <p eId="para_925">I thank Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to outline the current position on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for a detailed outline of the problems relating to this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_926"> April has become synonymous with the raising of awareness of autism and provides an opportunity to consider the challenges faced by children with autism and their families. As Deputy Mitchell O'Connor stated, the month also facilitates a celebration of the uniqueness of children and adults with autism. The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary schools network. The Department of Education and Skills provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with autism to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled he or she will have access to an appropriate education. Children with autism may be enrolled in a mainstream school, attend all mainstream classes and receive additional teaching support through learning supports and resource teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_927"> Some children with autism cannot be accommodated in mainstream education and they may be enrolled in special classes or schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. The Department's position is that as each child with autism is unique he or she should have access to a range of different approaches to meet individual needs. As children differ significantly from one another and as their needs vary and change over time it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. Children with autism can enroll in an early intervention class from the age of three years. If they are assessed younger then home tuition can be provided from the age of two and a half. The pupil-teacher ratio for special classes for children with autism is 6:1 and each class has a minimum of two special needs assistants. Each year, children with autism can avail of an extended school year to include the month of July. This is commonly referred to as the July provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_928"> The Department of Education and Skills has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions, which are delivered through the special education support service. Training is provided in a range of interventions, including treatment and education of autistic and related communication-handicapped children, the picture exchange communication system and applied behaviour analysis. Last year, the Minister for Education and Skills called on the National Council for Special Education to prepare policy advice on the education of children with autism. The purpose was to identify the nature and extent of educational interventions, teaching practices and other supports which should be provided to enable children with autism to achieve educational outcomes appropriate to their needs and abilities. The NCSE has recently undertaken a comprehensive consultation process with parents, schools, professional service providers and other stakeholders. The Minister expects to receive this report in early 2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_929">I agree with much of what the Minister has said and I realise it sounds like utopia, but actually this is not what is happening in practice. As a former school principal, I can assure the Minister of State that parents are upset when they even think their child has autism. They cannot get a diagnosis or early intervention. I recognise that if the child gets into a special education school or class, he or she will get PECS and ABA treatment. However, I assure the Minister of State that there are many children with autism enrolled in mainstream schools who are not getting such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_930"> Something that was not mentioned in the Minister of State's answer is speech therapy. It is important for children with autism or Down's syndrome. The Minister should consider having speech therapists working within the school setting. It happens in some special schools. Instead of working for health boards, therapists should be based in schools in order that principals can ensure children get speech therapy.</p>
            <p eId="para_931"> I wish to raise an issue that relates to the Ministers for Education and Skills and Finance, namely, autism assistance dogs. There is Revenue recognition for blind people with guide dogs, as the dogs are expensive to maintain and sensitive and have special diets. When I submitted a parliamentary question to Revenue, however, the response was that an autism assistance dog was a companion. I have seen at first hand that these dogs transform the lives of children with autism and their families. Revenue and the Minister for Education and Skills should work together to ensure these families get their due.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">I do not have details on the guide dogs issue, but I will bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the relevant Minister and ask that she be furnished with a report.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> While education is not my Department, I know from working on the ground that there is a strong argument for speech therapists working within the school system. I will relate the Deputy's worthwhile suggestion to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who will be receptive to it. The policy advice will be delivered in spring 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process that has commenced. I urge everyone to make submissions to that process. The Deputy's experience as a former teacher should be fed into the report. The Minister would encourage all interested parties, including the Deputy, to contribute to the consultation process. He expects that the National Council for Special Education's final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and, importantly, provide recommendations that will assist in the development of policies for years to come. We await that report, but I will relate the other two issues to the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_934">A coastal walkway will help to prevent flooding in Dundalk and Blackrock while bringing immense benefits to tourism and all facets of recreation and addressing the obesity epidemic. As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and rapporteur on the issue of obesity, I feel obliged to remind the House that, while we are making appreciable inroads in the task of stabilising some health problems such as our drink culture and smoking, one of our principal health problems - obesity - is growing at an alarming rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_935"> As a member of the Committee on Health and Children, I am more exposed on a daily basis to the health and financial timebomb that the growing level of obesity in our population, particularly the youth population, represents. I urge all Deputies to become more aware at their local levels of this ticking bomb and to be more proactive in trying to initiate, in conjunction with their local authority members and managements, local policies, strategies and projects to address this burgeoning problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_936"> By way of example, in my town of Dundalk I have taken an initiative to catalyse our local council into action so as to provide an extension of our local Slí na Sláinte network. A group of committed local environmental activists recently brought to my attention the fact that our only existing riverside walk, which is just under 2 km in length, could easily be extended to link with an existing heavily overgrown earthen embankment that runs along the high water mark of Dundalk Bay for some 4 km from Dundalk to Blackrock. Although this earthen embankment was built almost three centuries ago, it has lasted - almost completely unmaintained - right up to the present. However, it is suffering the ravages of time and tide and, because it provides protection from tidal flooding to more than 3,500 homes and business premises, we must act urgently and decisively to enhance its flood risk mitigation capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> Obviously, my primary interest in connecting our Navy Bank walk to our Dundalk-Blackrock embankment is the Slí na Sláinte potential of the 6 km walkway-cycleway that would be created by joining the embankments and servicing and upgrading them. However, the additional flood risk mitigation for 3,500 homes and business premises that would be secured by the implementation of this strategy is even more important.</p>
            <p eId="para_938"> The initiative I have taken in co-operation with community volunteers, acting pursuant to the provisions of sections 66 and 67 of the Local Government Act 2001 and in joint venture with Dundalk Town Council and Louth County Council, seeks to provide protection for the Dundalk southern inter-tidal marshland and mud flat area of the EU-designated Dundalk Bay special protection area, SPA, Natura 2000 site, which is an internationally significant feeding and roosting habitat for indigenous and migratory water fowl and other birds. An equally important objective of my initiative is to enhance significantly the flood risk mitigation capacity of the existing Lord Limerick earthen embankment.</p>
            <p eId="para_939"> The third element of the proposal is to add the long aspired to Dundalk-Blackrock coastal walkway-cycleway Slí na Sláinte to the recreational tourism amenity public infrastructure offering of the north east by heightening, strengthening and extending the embankment and equipping it with appropriately sited, heavily camouflaged ornithological observation posts. It is also envisaged that a moat barrier will be constructed to prevent the increasing and undesirable intrusion by dogs, anti-social elements, hunters and so forth onto the salt marshes and mud flats, thereby allaying the concerns that have been identified and enumerated in various expert studies and reports over the past 20 years. This will be done through the implementation of the strategy that has been developed and proposed by the Louth Environmental Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for raising this matter and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it in the House. The development of coastal amenities such as walkways does not fall within the remit of the Office of Public Works, OPW, but is a matter for the local authority in the first instance and, in so far as central government responsibility is concerned, would probably be more appropriate to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_941"> I am advised that there is an existing walkway-cycleway from Dundalk to Soldier's Point, but that it has become overgrown and derelict. I also understand a local environmental group has been working on rehabilitating and reinstating the walkway and that it has done excellent work to date. The proposed development of the walkway along this stretch of coast near Dundalk was first examined ten years ago. In order to provide an additional and enhanced amenity, a proposed extension of the walkway-cycleway to the start point of Blackrock was examined by Louth County Council in 2003. This would have involved adapting existing embankments that were created approximately 100 years ago to protect farmland. A preliminary report was produced and discussions took place between the council and the relevant environmental authority on the subject of how the walkway-cycleway could be built in the area, which includes a special area of conservation, SAC, but work was put on hold by the council to await the outcome of the Irish coastal protection strategy study and the subsequent catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study, which is examining the main causes of flood risk in the general area.</p>
            <p eId="para_942"> Dundalk and Blackrock are areas for further assessment under the CFRAM study, that is, areas identified as having significant flood risk and that are being examined in more detail. The OPW has appointed engineering consultants RPS to undertake this study and it is well under way. Under the programme, work on drawing up draft flood maps will be finalised in 2014 and flood risk management plans will be developed by the end of 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_943"> The flood management plan for the Dundalk and Blackrock area will include a list of prioritised measures to address the flood risk in those areas. It may well be that strengthening of the existing embankments on which the existing walkway is situated forms part of the solution. However, it is far too early to know this and we must wait to see what the CFRAM study recommends. In any event, the recommended measures in the study will concern themselves only with addressing flood risk. They will not address other ancillary issues such as the placement of walkways on embankments for amenity or recreational purposes. As I said earlier, this is not part of the OPW's responsibilities. If Louth County Council wishes to address this possibility, it will be a matter for the council to pursue it with the relevant agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> It is important to point out that a key element of the CFRAM programme is public consultation. Public information days on the draft flood maps will take place during 2014. These events will be advertised in local press and regular updates will be available on the website <i>www.cfram.ie</i>. There will be plenty of opportunities, therefore, for the public and particular interest groups to make comments and suggestions or to raise concerns about flooding in the area over the next number of months.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">I thank the Minister for his observations and advice. I will outline some of the benefits to our community which will accrue from the implementation of this proposal. They are multiple and include the following: reducing or eliminating the imminent tidal flood risk danger to several thousand residential and business premises in Dundalk town and its hinterland, particularly those with floor-levels at or below 4 m ODM - 4 metres Ordinance Datum Malin Head; reducing or eliminating the danger to this internationally significant feeding and roosting habitat of migratory and native birds and fowl, which is the beneficiary of the protection which is afforded by the EU designation of the Marsh South section of Dundalk Bay as a Natura 2000 special protection area, from trespass onto the inter-tidal salt marsh by persons who engage in anti-social behaviour, hunters, dogs and so forth; contributing significantly to the implementation of the national anti-obesity strategy; furthering the Slí na Sláinte campaign by the Irish Heart Foundation; endorsing the necessity to continue to strive to secure the alternative transportation objectives which have been the policy of every Government for over 20 years by continuing to extend our growing network of cycle ways and walk ways; recognising the desirability of providing the people of Dundalk and the wider north-east region with access as of right by ownership, instead of by way of tolerated trespass on private property, to the wonderful ambience of this 4 km section of the Dundalk Bay coastline; catalysing the provision of similar public and tourism recreational and flood risk mitigation infrastructure on the northern Castletown River bank, the Flurry Estuary banks, the Dundalk Bay SPA's northern shores and the Dundalk-Greenore railway rail track bed; and addressing the need to continue to enhance and develop our tourism product, particularly for the cycling and walking fraternity which is widely and validly acknowledged as a long-staying, high-spending segment of our tourist profile.</p>

            <p eId="para_946">Much work has been done and much progress has been made in tackling flooding problems throughout the country, with almost €370 million invested from 1995. The OPW has approved total funding of €335,558 to Louth County Council under its minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme since 2009. Three projects have been completed in the Dundalk and Blackrock areas at a total cost of €157,320.</p>
            <p eId="para_947"> For longer-term solutions we must wait for the recommendations that emanate from the CFRAM study and plan. That will be extremely good for the region. I urge Deputy Fitzpatrick to keep in contact with the council. This could be a wonderful project for that area and I would envisage support for it from everybody. It would be good for the area. As the Deputy said, tourism and health could benefit from a project such as this. However, everything in the flood programme must be examined.</p>
