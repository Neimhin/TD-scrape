          <p eId="para_1">As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I hope Deputy Humphreys saw the story in this morning's <i>Irish Independent </i>regarding Fort Lucan, an adventure centre in Lucan that has had to reduce its offering to customers and clients. The business has been there for 25 years, it has grown, it has given great service to families and communities and it employs people. Owing to a massive €25,000 per annum hike in its insurance premium it now has to reduce its offering. This centre is one of 61 play centres across the country that has been threatened with closure this year because of insurance premiums. It is one of countless numbers of small businesses across this country faced with closure, redundancies and reduced services because of increasing insurance premiums, all aligned with a complete lack of action from Government in terms of address of the issue. What we get from Government in regard to insurance premiums is nice words, pats on the back, group hugs and promises, but no action. There is zero action. Meanwhile, businesses are closing, services are being reduced and premiums are increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> One example of the lack of action is the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018, which was introduced by Deputy Kelleher earlier this year and passed by the Dáil, but is awaiting a money message from the Government. It provides that where a case is dismissed under section 26 claimants would have to pay legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">There was also a verbal commitment by Government to establish a specific fraud unit within An Garda Síochána. That was reversed by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, last week in the run-in to the elections. He said that it was not a matter for him but for the Garda. He would not deal with it even though these two issues have been pointed out by several experts as being a key driver of the costs of claims increasing in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Deputy Humphreys is the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. She has a good team. Who in Cabinet will stand up for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, against the cabal of lawyers who are refusing to do anything about insurance costs? Who in Cabinet will stand up against the might of the insurance industry versus small business which is forced to pay for that might? Who in Cabinet will stand up for community festivals which have to curtail their offerings or stop the festival because of insurance premiums? This is being raised month after month and year after year. My colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, was the first to start highlighting this issue during this Dáil, in 2016, yet we have had no action. Will the Minister stand up for small business?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" as="#Minister_for_Business,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am aware of the impact that insurance costs have on SMEs throughout the country. It is an issue which is raised with me regularly. For that reason, this Government is committed to making sure that we continue to proceed with measures that will reduce insurance costs for businesses. In my Department, legislation was enacted in April to ensure greater compliance with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process in personal injury cases. We have strengthened its powers so that more people will have to comply with its process. I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their support for that legislation. The PIAB process delivers compensation more quickly and with lower costs than litigation, encouraging more claimants to finalise their cases through the PIAB process, which will lead to cost savings in the claims environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Two other Bills were enacted in the last year, the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 and the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018. These are further important steps in insurance reform. The fourth Bill is the Judicial Council Bill. Last week, the Government approved the Minister, Deputy Flanagan's, proposal to amend the Judicial Council Bill to establish a new personal injuries guidelines committee within the framework of the judicial council. This gives effect to a key recommendation of the Personal Injuries Commission. The personal injuries guidelines committee will comprise judges, replicating the models in place in neighbouring jurisdictions. This new committee will draw up guidelines on the level of damages which should be awarded in personal injuries actions. This will help to promote consistency in the level of personal injuries damages awarded by the courts. With the co-operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas, we want to see that Bill passed as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> We have published guidelines for reporting fraudulent insurance claims to An Garda Síochána. These guidelines make clear what insurance companies should do in the event that they suspect fraud in a personal injuries claim. The guidelines were also circulated to the Chief Justice and the Judiciary. A new insurance claim fraud category on the Garda PULSE system went live last November. The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland's anti-fraud forum also meet regularly to discuss and act on current and ongoing issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud. There is no silver bullet here but when taken together, all these measures will make a difference in bringing insurance premiums down for businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">There is no silver bullet but there is no urgency either. There is zero understanding of the pressure and stress that businesses are under. In the <i>Irish Independent</i> story this morning, there is a quote from Gillian Martin-Smith, the manager of Fort Lucan. She said that "if the Government doesn't move to address insurance costs they are "going to close down the entire country"." </p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The PIAB legislation the Minister referred to was a Fianna Fáil Bill which was on Government desks for years and was not acted on.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">If the Government does not move to address insurance costs, those costs will close down the country. In the meantime, lawyers are driving things through the PIAB process. The Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill could be enacted now to deal with fraudulent cases. We are awaiting a money message from the Department of Finance in order to progress the Bill. The Minister has spoken of what will happen in the future. Fort Lucan is scaling down services and a total of 61 play centres are threatened with closure. There was no sense of urgency or awareness on this matter from Fine Gael in the past week until the party's brand was affected and then, suddenly, there was an interest in it. The Minister should stand up for business interests and the employers who are creating employment. She should stand up for parents who are using the services and forget about the reputation of her party. I urge her to stand up for business.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">Speaking on "Morning Ireland" earlier, the former head of the Army Ranger Wing, Commandant Cathal Berry, stated that the Defence Forces are being dismantled and demoralised as a result of Government policy. The facts bear that out. There is, in the Defence Forces, as in other areas of the public service, a recruitment and retention crisis. The number of serving personnel has dropped below 8,500 despite a commitment to maintain numbers at 9,500. Morale is on the floor. We are in a situation where members see a long-term career in the Defence Forces as unsustainable and unviable if they are to provide for their families. As a result, they are choosing to leave. This is down to the simple fact that Defence Forces personnel are the worst-paid members of the public service. Many Defence Forces families are reliant on the working family payment. The fact that many families cannot make ends meet has been highlighted here and elsewhere on countless occasions. Some, as the Minister is aware, resort to sleeping in their cars as a way to save on petrol. Others rely on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The Taoiseach stated in January that joining the Defence Forces is about more than just money. I agree with him in that regard because being a member of the Defence Forces is not a cushy number. The work involved is hard and can be dangerous. Those joining the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps are motivated primarily by a desire to serve. All of us appreciate that. However, people do not join the Defence Forces to be disrespected or marginalised. Pride does not put bread on the table. This situation has been allowed to run on without any resolution. The reasons for this are obvious. Members of the Defence Forces have been consistently sidelined in public service pay negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">They are excluded from trade union membership or affiliation with ICTU, and they are legally prevented from protesting their terms and conditions of employment. No other worker in the State gets as raw a deal. It is time for the Minister to listen to their concerns and the concerns of their families, as well as to the concerns of former personnel. </p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Will the Minister recognise that serious damage has been done to the reputation of the Defence Forces as a career option? Will she listen to what Commandant Berry has said, and what hundreds of other former personnel have to say? Will she listen to soldiers and their families, who have said that enough is enough? </p>

          <p eId="para_28">The Government is fully committed to ensuring the Defence Forces have the necessary resources to deliver on all of their assigned roles, as evidenced by an allocation of more than €1 billion to the defence sector, to include Army pensions, in 2019. This allocation includes full funding for the pay and allowances of the target strength of 9,500 Permanent Defence Force personnel, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> The Government is extremely conscious about issues surrounding recruitment and retention within the Defence Forces, which is why these matters have been referred to the Public Service Pay Commission for consideration. This is the right body to examine conditions in the Defence Forces. It is independent and has received submissions from management, both military and civil, and from the representative associations. The Defence Forces have been able to feed into this process; it was part of the consultation. The report is due to be published shortly, and we look forward to its outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Similar to other sectors within the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures to assist in stabilising national finances during the financial crisis. The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales. Like other areas of the public sector, members of the Defence Forces are benefitting from pay increases in accordance with national public service pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement and will see restoration of public sector pay scales to levels that obtained before the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, for all those earning under €70,000. </p>

          <p eId="para_31">Cathal Berry was quite damning; he said that there is a sense of absolute betrayal and that it is palpable and visceral. He added that he has not seen anything even remotely like this in his 23 years of service. The Minister has described a process of pay restoration. She seems to take the view that the Defence Forces personnel are getting a fair and sustainable deal, when all of the evidence is to the contrary. I am sure the Minister has met Defence Forces personnel and their families, because they have been extremely vocal. They feel they have no option but to speak out. They are not getting by.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> When will the Public Service Pay Commission report be published? Can the Minister give us an assurance that when it is published, there will be substantial progress and substantial benefit for members of the Defence Forces and their families? Anything short of that or any approach by Government that is merely concerned with going through the motions will mean that personnel will continue to leave and that these families will continue to struggle. </p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Sinn Féin has tabled an amendment to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2018, which is due to be discussed tomorrow. It recognises that members of the Defence Forces are employees and are entitled to the same protections as every other worker in the State. Will the Minister support that amendment? </p>

          <p eId="para_35"> All Members agree the Defence Forces do wonderful work. We are proud of the work they do, particularly in the peacekeeping duties they carry out abroad and how well they represent us overseas. In terms of the emergency situations which arise in the country, they are always there to lend a helping hand. We are conscious of this but we will have to allow the process to be completed. The commission has completed its report at which we have to look. We will be considering its findings at that stage.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">I have listened with great care to the response of the Minister taking Leaders’ Questions. I am not sure if she has read the commentary reported in today’s media and listened to the interview on “Morning Ireland”. These are unprecedented criticisms of the Department of Defence and defence policy made by a retiring senior military officer. He described our Defence Forces as being dismantled and demoralised. He said the sense of betrayal across our Defence Forces is palpable.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> These are extraordinary comments. In my political lifetime I have never heard a retiring Army officer say anything as strong as this. They are normally reserved people. It is extraordinary that a senior officer would also think it necessary to take early retirement in order to be free to make this comment. That makes it all the more urgent that the Government and all Members have careful regard to what he has to say. This morning he said he is leaving the Army not because he hates it but because he loves it and has been forced out.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> There is a retention crisis and 9% of Defence Forces personnel are leaving. No organisation can sustain that amount of loss. It is a massive exodus. The bottom line is financial. Our Defence Forces, of course, need a total review of pay and conditions. It is on the desk of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform now. It is not as simple, however, as even doing that. If someone can earn twice as much in a meat factory as they can in our Defence Forces - as well as working much greater hours in the Defence Forces - then it is not just good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> Members of our Defence Forces are not permitted to join a trade union or advocate in their own interests as every other worker can do. That is no longer acceptable. I join with Sinn Féin in asking the Government to accept that. When in government, we wanted that. Let us agree to it now and allow members of the military to join a trade union. During peacetime and outside of specific missions, there is no reason we would not do that. Will the Government allow our Defence Forces to unionise? What has the Minister to say in the face of these unprecedented criticisms?</p>
          <p eId="para_41">The notion that it is simply another group of public servants to be treated like all others in this context is quite simply not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I did not hear Commandant Berry's comment but I understand the concerns of the Defence Forces because I know their members have contacted many Deputies to outline their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The independent Public Service Pay Commission was established in 2016 to provide Government with independent advice on public service pay. On the instructions of the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, issues of recruitment and retention in the defence sector were brought to the attention of the commission. As a direct result of that initiative, the Government tasked the commission to undertake a comprehensive examination and analysis of the underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the defence sector. There have been various reports in the media of what the commission will recommend but those are speculation. The Government has not received the report from the commission as yet and I cannot comment on rumours or hearsay. When the commission's report is brought to Government in the coming weeks it will be given due consideration. As I said, we are now in a better position. The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide a fair and sustainable recovery in the public service pay scale.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Again, it is as if the Army has not got a specific case to make. I do not think the Minister is hearing what has been said. Part of the problem is that the Taoiseach has a full-time job as Taoiseach of the country and yet he assigned to himself also the Department of Defence. The Minister of State at the Department of Defence is not an adequate replacement for a Cabinet ministerial role. I will not repeat the comments made by Commandant Berry about the leadership in the Department but suffice to say it was scathing. Is it not now time for a Minister for Defence to be created that has Cabinet rank? It cannot be a job-sharing role for the Taoiseach. Will the Minister accept that? In the unique circumstances now where morale in the Defence Forces generally has all but evaporated and any confidence in Government policy is gone, will the Minister accept the Government needs to take control again to rebuild confidence in our Defence Forces and assure people that the words uttered of appreciation for their fantastic role are matched by actions?</p>

A number of initiatives are being developed, including commissioning from the ranks, criteria for the re-entry of former Permanent Defence Force personnel with specific skills and consideration of increased use of direct entry for specialist posts. There is an ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces, including a current competition for cadetship.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">From the results of the UK's European elections it is becoming increasingly evident that Brexit is an inevitable reality. The detrimental impact of any form of Brexit, whether it be a hard or soft Brexit, on businesses cannot be overstated. Yet, despite numerous reports and constant pleas from those in the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector across the country, the move to tackle the cost of doing business in Ireland has been minimal at best.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Last year, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation published a report on the cost of doing business and discovered six key drivers to uncompetitive costs faced by Irish businesses. Chief among those was insurance premiums. The report highlighted that the book of quantum is not observed in many judgments. For that reason, far too many cases are settled on the steps of the court, if they get that far, because it is too risky for SMEs to take a case, even in situations where they know they are not at fault. In fact, the report went on to recommend the establishment of an insurance fraud unit within An Garda Síochána and that claimants found to have made false claims should face automatic referrals for prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Yesterday, as Deputy Calleary has mentioned, we heard the news that Fort Lucan in west Dublin will be forced to close some of its attractions, as a result of the claim culture partly leading to excessive insurance costs. Earlier this year, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, a presentation was made from a play centre in Navan highlighting the plight of businesses facing such insurance costs. I could list educational, retail and, of course, leisure services facing the fallout from the claim culture and a poor court system for dealing with such claims. If one wants to bring a child to a play facility, for example, one must sign a waiver in most of them. Given the events in the news in the past week, if there is no change what we will see is that the same will apply to adults when they go into a hotel or pub. That would be madness. There must be action on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Despite a number of Bills coming before the Dáil on these issues, and, indeed, one from Deputy Kelleher having passed Second Stage, no real progress has been made on this issue. The Deputy Maria Bailey fiasco this week has put it back into the spotlight. While I am sure it is greatly embarrassing for the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and for her party colleagues, there is a much bigger picture at play here with which the Government must deal. Will the Government urgently progress the legislation to improve the book of quantum, as recommended by the Oireachtas joint committee? Will the Government move to progress Deputy Kelleher's Bill, which would enable a judge to refer a fraudulent claim to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for possible prosecution? Would it consider legislation making it mandatory for claimants to go through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process, thereby reducing the costs of court for everyone?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_33" as="#Minister_for_Business,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_55">There are, of course, many challenges facing business and none greater than Brexit, which the Deputy mentioned at the outset. The Government has put in place a wide range of supports to help businesses prepare for Brexit. Businesses should be conscious that Brexit is very much on the horizon. We need to get them to prepare for the worst possible outcome, which is a hard Brexit, while we negotiate for the best possible outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> There are a number of supports of which businesses need to avail, through Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise office or InterTradeIreland, to help them engage and prepare for Brexit. They need to identify the risks and mitigate for those risks. We have a €300 million Brexit working capital loan scheme, which was launched in March 2018, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and I recently launched a new €300 million future growth loan scheme in April to provide for long-term loans of up to ten years to SMEs for farmers and primary producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> Insurance is another cost which I am aware businesses are incurring. It is an issue that is raised with me regularly. I know how frustrating it is for businesses when fraudulent or exaggerated claims are made because many of them feel that they are being punished for this compensation culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">My view on this is very simple. People need to have some common sense and to be responsible for their own personal safety. If one trips or falls, one has to ask why it happened. More often than not the answer is that it is because of one's own carelessness. People need to accept that and we need to change this culture. There is a culture in this country which is that when one has an accident, it is everyone's fault except one's own. That applies to the play yard as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">It is a culture in this country. When we were children if one fell in the play yard, one was dusted down and sent back to school the next day. Now people look to see if there is an opportunity and that is a culture that we have to change. When people have an accident they have to take responsibility for their own welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> On insurance, as I outlined earlier, the Government is committed to making sure that we continue to proceed with measures that will reduce insurance costs for businesses. In respect of my Department, legislation was enacted in April to ensure greater compliance with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process, which the Deputy mentioned, and we have strengthened its powers.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I will take it that the Minister, in her comments, is also referring to her colleague and showing some leadership in regard to personal responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> Returning to Brexit, we know about the ports and airports and that loans have to be provided to small and medium-sized businesses but we have to address the issue of costs where we need to see action. We spent the first three months of this year doing nothing except Brexit yet we are not addressing one of the key issues that will put businesses out of business. Costs have been identified as the key driver. This has to be given the serious attention it requires. The Government needs to tell us exactly what it intends to do and in what timeframe, so that some of these businesses will still be in business when Brexit inevitably occurs.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">There are a range of supports out there from the agencies, whether from Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland or the local enterprise offices, which also do great work in helping businesses. There are vouchers and there is the market discovery fund and the Be Prepared grant, so there are supports are available to businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> A number of months ago I launched Future Jobs Ireland 2019, which is a whole-of-Government initiative that looks at exactly what the Deputy is talking about, namely, how we can future-proof this economy but, more especially, how we can ensure our businesses remain competitive. There are a number of pillars in this plan. The first one is embracing new technology. We will launch the disruptive technologies fund and we hope to bring businesses in to show them how new technology is going to change the way they do business, whether through artificial intelligence or robotics.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> The second pillar of that plan is improving productivity within the SMEs, which is what the Deputy talked about. We will work with them to look at how they need to improve their processes and whether they need to go onto lean programmes where they can be more productive. Many things are happening. I will have another meeting with the SMEs within the next month at which I will talk to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_80"> I am very concerned by the response of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to Deputies McDonald and Howlin on the comments of Cathal Berry this morning. We are not talking about Private Pike, we are talking about a very senior member of the Army Ranger Wing. Commandant Berry spoke about the Defence Forces being dismantled and demoralised. He also referred to the humiliation and suffocation of the Defence Forces. We are talking here about Óglaigh na hÉireann, our Defence Forces. When somebody so senior makes such a statement, I would expect a more urgent response from Government. The Minister had not even read the interview even though she was taking Leaders' Questions. Would it be possible for the Minister of State with responsibility for defence to come to the House and respond in respect of these very serious issues? It is not just pay and conditions; there is a need for urgent action on a much broader front. We owe it to the men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann to listen when somebody terms such as "dismantled", "demoralised", "humiliation" and "suffocation". We cannot ignore this.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">Two weeks ago, the Minister voted against a Sinn Féin Bill to provide for a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution, as was recommended by the Constitutional Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">As per the programme for Government, that recommendation was referred to the Oireachtas committee on housing, which also recommended that the right to housing be enshrined in the Constitution. The Minister and the Government, however, have consistently faced down and voted against doing anything about that recommendation. The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, stated this morning that the Government should reopen this conversation and I agree with him. Does the Minister agree and where stands the Government on this issue? Has the Constitutional Convention's recommendation effectively been binned? </p>

          <p eId="para_85">It was horrifying to see four members of a young family in the council offices in Tallaght yesterday because they had been removed from a hotel on Friday night and could not get accommodation. Accommodation was provided after a sit-in in the council offices. That is an outrage, as is the fact that the family was given hotel accommodation in a location which meant that the children had to take three buses to get to school. This has to stop. Some sort of protection in the Constitution on the right to housing at least would force the Government, and future Governments, to protect people in such situations. When will the Minister bring that in?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I met the ombudsman recently regarding his report and we went through his recommendations. The Government is open on the question of a right to housing being enshrined in the Constitution. We want to ensure, however, that we follow the same type of process that led to the successful repeal of the eighth amendment and to marriage equality. As a result, this Oireachtas decided to refer that question to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is chaired by a Deputy from the Fianna Fáil party and not a Government Deputy. That process needs to come to a successful conclusion before the Oireachtas decides where we go from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> It is worth noting, however, that a constitutional or legal right to housing in other countries has not ended the problem of homelessness. The real way to do that is through supply. That is why the Government is committed to increasing supply while also remaining open regarding the question of a right to housing being enshrined in the Constitution. A process is under way with the Oireachtas committee at the moment, however, and that has to be followed. </p>

          <p eId="para_91">We have the results of the three plebiscites on directly-elected mayors. I note the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is present. Limerick city voted by a slim majority to accept the proposal, while Cork and Waterford voted by an equally slim majority to reject it. Most of us here see the potential of directly-elected mayors and what they can bring to a reformed and invigorated local government system. What does the Minister of State propose to do next? The Government has committed to have a citizens' assembly in respect of Dublin. Would he consider having a wider citizens' assembly now or a separate one, whichever is the more appropriate? That would allow us to develop a strong, coherent model in order that people can understand what specific powers we want to devolve, as well as the relationship between the executive and a newly elected mayor. That was patently not the case during these plebiscites.</p>

Sinn Féin supported a "Yes" vote for a directly-elected mayor in Limerick but we had a job of work to explain to people the benefits of having that position. That was because of the total lack of information provided by the Government. I have no doubt this lack of clarity contributed to the proposal, which is positive, failing in Waterford and Cork. That is a shame. Will the Minister of State tell us when he will publish legislation to provide for a directly-elected mayor to show more powers are being returned to the citizens of Limerick?</p>

In the next couple of weeks, the Government will decide on the citizens' assembly on the Dublin area. However, Limerick itself will be the test ground for the establishment of the position of directly-elected mayor.

          <p eId="para_105">The message contained in the results of the elections which took place on Friday demanding radical emergency measures to address the climate crisis was dramatic and unmistakable. The central demand of the global climate movement is to keep fossil fuels in the ground. All the science says that 80% of known reserves of fossil fuels must stay in the ground if we are to address the crisis. At the weekend, the Taoiseach promised that the Government would heed the message. In that context, I ask very simply whether the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment will now refuse the application under consideration in his Department from the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation and Exxon Mobil to drill for oil off the Kerry coast? If the Government is serious about climate change and dealing with the climate crisis as promised, will that application now be refused? To permit new drilling for oil off the Kerry coast is completely incompatible with any serious intent to deal with the climate crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">It is important not to pretend there is a magic bullet that will change our 84% dependence on fossil fuels to something else. That will not happen. We must have a sensible transition from a dependence rate of 84% and reduce that over time. Gas will always be part of that transition.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">My question is about jobs for Tipperary. A task force was promised to be set up in Tipperary by the Taoiseach some months ago when he was speaking from the seat in which the Minister is now sitting. The people were delighted, including various groups such as March for Tipp, Jobs for Tipp and all the community groups. An eminent lady, Ms Alison Harvey, was appointed to lead this task force but practically nothing has happened and there is disbelief and shock. The Government members all attended a jobs fair down there, including the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and announced who knows what. Will this task force be funded? Is Ms Harvey going to be allowed to do what is necessary, co-operate and collaborate with the community groups, local authorities and everybody else in Tipperary? They badly need action, not empty words. Does she have a budget and will she be allowed do her work?</p>

I have been down in Tipperary on a number of occasions and the regional enterprise plan has a particular focus on Tipperary town. Funding has been provided from a number of sources to assist that region. It will take a bit of time and we should allow her to continue on with the work she is doing. She will have access to all the different Government funding streams, whether it is the rural regeneration fund, the urban regeneration fund or the regional enterprise development fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">There is a phrase in the climate community to "do the maths." The maths is simple and it would be appropriate to put on the junior certificate maths paper. If there is X amount of carbon that we can produce into the atmosphere and if we know that the known fossil fuel reserves, leaving aside the stuff we have not found yet, is four times that, we have to keep four fifths of the known carbon reserves in the ground. There is something wrong when on the day the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment had his all of Government climate plan meeting in Croke Park to discuss the new all of Government climate plan, his Department issued a licence to Total and Providence, and yesterday, on the very day that the Cabinet subcommittee on climate met, the Department issued a licence to Exxon Mobil and Chinese Nation Offshore Oil Corporation. That has to stop and that has to change.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">The position is that it is about maths. We are 84% dependent on fossil fuels and that will not change overnight. The ambition of Europe is to go from 16% renewables to 32% by 2030. That will still leave huge dependence on fossil fuels in Ireland and in Europe. Our choice is whether, by abandoning exploration, we switch to fracked gas from the US or to gas coming from Russia or Saudi Arabia in the Middle East and sacrifice the revenue that comes into the Exchequer that can help us fund the changes we need, or do we switch that money to paying these oligarchs from abroad for the way in which they generate fossil fuels. The logic is that we have to change our dependence on fossil fuels. That is the change we have to make and pretending that can be done by some sleight of hand is just not realistic. The Deputy is fooling the people.</p>

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, came to my home town of Bandon many months ago and made some announcements, including on the reopening of the Garda station in Ballinspittle. I want to find out when exactly this is opening. The second announcement he made was that Kinsale Garda station would now be manned 24-7. I want to know if that is a physical presence or if it is just access to a Garda car.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">My question is for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Although it was promised that the waiting list for carer's allowance would be reduced, people must currently wait for more than three months for a decision. This is a disgrace. All that people who take care of elderly people or people who are ill and who keep people at home want is their allowance to be paid. Could something be done to increase the number of staff? While I appreciate the work being done by the staff already there, it is a disgrace to keep people waiting for up to three months to be awarded carer's allowance or even to receive an answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">It is a disgrace that family members must take decisions about leaving employment and working without pay. They submit applications but the waiting time remains 16 weeks, having fallen from 19 weeks, according to the most recent response I have received from the Minister. It is utterly unacceptable. In one case, the information submitted by the doctors clearly states the person needs full-time care, which the family members are providing. Is there anything the Minister can do to ensure that the waiting time from the date of application to the date of the request being granted will be reasonable?</p>

          <p eId="para_143">The average waiting time until the end of last year was 19 weeks, which is wholly unacceptable, but it is currently 15 weeks. Although that does not meet the 12-week target we have set in the Department, it is moving in the right direction, for two reasons. The first is we have changed the application form to try to make it less onerous and to allow us gather more information. There are two aspects to a carer's allowance application, namely, the means test and the medical assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The second reason is we have added more staff to the area. As other staff become available, such as those working on our illness benefit transition and the 2012 pension anomaly restorations, they will be moved to address the issue. I hope that will continue to reduce the waiting time to the 12-week target.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">My question relates to the Bill to amend the Constitution to extend the franchise at presidential elections. In 2013, the Constitutional Convention agreed that Irish citizens in the North and the diaspora should have the right to vote in presidential elections. Last October, the Taoiseach announced that a referendum to extend the right to vote in presidential elections to all citizens outside the State would be held in May. On 5 February, however, the Government decided to defer the referendum on extending the franchise until October. Will the Minister outline the timetable for the publication of the heads of the Bill, the publication date for the Bill, whether he is confident the referendum will be held in October, and whether a specific date has been decided?</p>

That will be up to the Oireachtas, but the Government will discuss the memo at its next meeting or the following meeting.</p>

Over the past six months in particular, people have been notified of appointments in Galway that have then been cancelled.

As a result of the fact that some patients need to be accompanied, those travelling with them to hospital book hotel rooms and then receive a phone call on the morning the procedure is due to be carried out stating that it has been cancelled. This is totally outrageous and it is not fair to people who are sick.</p>

Where they have a voice is in regard to voting. I was disturbed to learn at the count centre in Kildare that many of our serving members did not get an opportunity to vote. I understand that the ballot boxes for those serving overseas were not sent. I saw photographs of boxes of ballot papers, which were taken on Monday, which was after the election.

            <p eId="para_215">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The childcare sector in Ireland is under phenomenal pressure. There is a shortage of places and the cost of childcare is putting enormous pressure on parents. There are also serious challenges in terms of staff recruitment. Since the introduction of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme there is additional pressure on services, in particular for babies and toddlers. Is the Minister aware of this and what action does she propose to take to address the issues?</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_216">I thank the Deputy for the question. The unprecedented increase in investment in childcare over the last four budgets has helped to double capacity in the sector. We have doubled the ECCE-free preschool scheme from one to two years. We have also doubled the number of spaces for the zero to three age group. Baby and toddler places have increased from 13,700 in 2014 to over 31,000 in 2018, an increase of 128%. We do need additional capacity and I am continuing my intensive efforts in that regard. I am aware of the challenges providers face in offering services for babies and toddlers. The challenge is largely attributable to the cost of the higher staffing ratios required. The 2019 early years capital scheme has a primary focus on building places for the under threes. I have made €4 million available for this age group and I expect to announce the successful applicants and the creation of 1,300 additional places before the year end. </p>
            <p eId="para_217"> The national childcare scheme, to be introduced later this year, will also be a major incentive for providers to expand capacity. The scheme will provide a progressive system of subsidies, starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under one - up to €5.10 per hour - and the next highest subsidy for one and two year olds - up to €4.35 per hour. </p>
            <p eId="para_218"> I also want to encourage further capacity for the under threes and older age groups in the childminding sector. With this in mind, my Department has recently recruited a national childminding co-ordinator and will soon recruit a team of six development officers around the country to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla and thus enable them access subsidies under the NCS. My Department is currently finalising an action plan for childminding that will set out all the steps that we will take to improve access to high quality and subsidised childminding services.</p>
            <p eId="para_219"> I ensured that childcare would be identified as a strategic priority in the national development plan and I secured €250 million for this purpose, much of which will be invested in additional capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">I thank the Minister for her reply. The introduction of the ECCE second year is a positive but its value is diminished if people are not able to access and avail of it. According to Teresa Heeney, CEO of Early Childhood Ireland, the second year provision has cannibalised the earlier years provision, in particular in areas where there is population growth, and it is more difficult to get a place for babies and toddlers. We are hearing that parents are deferring returning to paid employment because they are unable to find a place. I note that staff numbers have increased but turnover is huge in this sector, with one in four people leaving it as well. What action is being taken to address those issues? Will the Minister support the providers to ensure they can retain their staff and also to ensure there are places available for babies and toddlers in light of the difficulties being experienced in that regard. </p>

            <p eId="para_221">I thank the Deputy. On the main issue he raised, and Teresa Heeney's comments, the question is whether the sector has been replacing baby rooms with ECCE rooms which are perhaps perceived as more lucrative.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">I do not think there is any definitive evidence to support that assertion but we have some anecdotal claims. While there has been a significant increase in ECCE capacity in recent years, the data available from the early years sector profile reports, published by Pobal, show that that has been mirrored by an increase of capacity of the baby rooms. That is the first thing that I would say and what I have tried to outline. As I indicated, we were aware that this challenge of capacity for under threes was coming. That is not news to us. That is why I focused the capital funding I received in 2019 on those aged from zero to three. I will be announcing those grants shortly in order that providers will have time during the summer months to ensure that they have capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_223">The Pobal report indicates that only 19% of facilities have baby rooms and that some 1,700 infants are on waiting lists, almost half of the total number of people who are enrolled. There is an especially acute issue with babies and toddlers. We know that the ECCE room will be exempt from rates, whereas the baby room is not. My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, introduced a Bill to equalise that issue in order that childcare providers could be exempt from rates altogether. Would the Minister consider supporting such measures to level the playing field? Figures from Pobal indicate there is a move towards the ECCE rooms at the expense of the baby and wobbler rooms.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">We are aware of the need to provide capital funding to increase the supply and capacity for under threes. That is why I have moved the capital funding for 2019 in that direction. We are aware of the statistics. Pobal works closely with us. When we fully implement the national childcare scheme in November, there will be incentives of additional supports for childcare providers to have more under threes. With regard to the issue regarding rates for baby rooms, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has responsibility for rates. He knows my views on this and I have sent them to him in writing. I would like to see rates for services looked at and scrapped. It is worth noting that community-run services and those providing free preschool only are not subject to rates. Privately operated services are subject to rates and that is where issues arise. Within my control, I am moving to ensure that we will have capacity for under threes.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">The impact of violence and abuse witnessed or experienced in childhood can last a lifetime. Where a child is in the care of Tusla and where there is a history of violence or other forms of abuse, the courts may order, or social workers may arrange, for access to be supervised to ensure safe oversight of the access visit. I am deeply conscious of and sensitive to the concerns of parents who have experienced domestic abuse, as having to arrange for their children to meet the other parent can be difficult and worrying. This was highlighted in a report that I launched for Women's Aid last month, which suggested that as many as one in five women were under threat of abuse from a violent partner during access visits. This is shocking. My Department and the Department of Justice and Equality have been engaging on this issue for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_228"> I am convinced of the need for the provision of safe child contact spaces when they are needed for protective purposes. My Department has embarked on work to assess exactly what facilities and supports are available for families in this situation. Child access services exist through the family resource centres. Preliminary indications are that at least 42 family resource centres, FRCs, provide some sort of services for access visits. These have grown up in an organic and <i>ad hoc</i> way and are dependent on the facilities and staff available within a centre. For example, some family resource centres provide a pick-up and drop-off service, which helps in the avoidance of contact between parents if that is desirable. I want to build on the services available through FRCs and expand the number of locations where a child's right to have access to both parents is preserved in a safe way. The Deputy may also be aware of the Time 4 Us service in Galway, which is a family access service. Following the resolution of funding and governance issues, the service has now been absorbed into the ARD Family Resource Centre. I understand that this is operating very successfully and is now facilitating even more families than originally planned.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">This is a serious issue. It follows on from some of the issues the Minister raised previously on provisions and supports relating to domestic violence. She has also noted that it was raised by Women's Aid, which recently raised it at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs. Many people will probably find it shocking that there are situations where women have barring orders against their partners who have violent or abusive and there is no assessment of the safety of the children. An individual can have access arrangements to a child and it is up to the mother to facilitate it. She has to deal directly with the abusive ex-partner to arrange access. People like that feel that this is a risk. There also is no assessment of the child. Barnardos conducted a trial of supervised access centres to see if they could be considered and I note the Minister referred to family resource centres. I would like to think that we can revisit this proposal. I do not think that it comes down to funding as such.</p>

            <p eId="para_230">As the Deputy described, these are significant issues for the children and the parents. As the Deputy acknowledges and I said in my original response, it is important that Women's Aid and other organisations highlight the significant concerns about potential harm done to children, as well as the ways in which intimidation etc. in a family can continue, especially with regard to children and access visits. It is important to have that information in front of us and to focus on that. We are intensifying our focus on where they are happening in respect of family resource centres. I have provided additional moneys for family resource centres in the last couple of budgets and hope to continue to do that, with a particular focus on this issue. We have some successful models emerging, such as Time 4 Us in Galway. It would be well worth looking at replicating it.</p>

            <p eId="para_231">I hope that funding can be looked at to ensure that supervised access centres are rolled out across the State. I understand that it would not take a significant amount of funding. People have spoken about community centres being used in the past. Parish centres have also been identified as suitable locations. I ask the Minister to look at this. It is an important issue which has been raised by previous groups. Hopefully the Minister can give a commitment that this will be looked at. If extra funding is necessary, will she commit to giving us that in the 2020 budget?</p>

            <p eId="para_233">Often, it is possible for parents to be supported by community contexts or community centres themselves in order to ensure the safety of children, but the Deputy is asking about the importance of the increased investment by the State to ensure that those safe places are there for children during access visits.</p>

            <p eId="para_235">Recent inspections have shown that serious concerns arise about the quality of private residential care homes, which care for 239 children. Has the Department taken steps to address the concerns that were raised about staffing and other standards in private residential care homes run by Tusla?</p>

            <p eId="para_236">Caring for adolescents, many of whom have traumatic histories, complex behaviour and an ambivalence about their placement is a challenge. When this care takes place in a residential setting it requires high levels of experienced staff to support these children. As is the case in other jurisdictions, maintaining high standards in residential care is an ongoing challenge. At the end of April, as the Deputy indicated, there were 376 children in residential care, and 238 of these children are cared for in privately managed centres commissioned by Tusla. To put that in context,  6% of children in care are in residential care.</p>
            <p eId="para_237"> It is concerning that in some residential centres there is a high turnover of staff. There is also a dependency on agency staff. Staff have sustained injuries in the course of their work. That inevitably has an impact on stability in the centres, which has an impact on children, as well as an impact on staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_238"> One action that Tusla is working on with my Department is increasing the levels of assessment, therapeutic input, counselling and support to the centres. Tusla assessment, consultation and therapy service teams, known as ACTS, who provide the services, have developed significant expertise in terms of working with troubled young people. The process of helping these young people is slow and the support offered to them has varying results. That is the nature of this type of work. In practical terms, the ACTS team can assist in the development of a behaviour management and emotional support plan as part of the overall care plan for the young person on discharge from special care. That type of support can assist staff in residential centres to more appropriately manage and respond to challenging behaviour by traumatised young people. The staff that work with these children are carrying out the most difficult of tasks. Our efforts to improve standards is about making their workplace and their work life better, as well as supporting the children with the best service possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_239">The Minister correctly highlighted some of the serious issues I wish to discuss such as staff turnover, lack of experience of staff and the dependency on agency workers. They have an impact on the mood of the entire centre. The children in Coovagh House in Limerick said they felt like they were living in a youth prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_240"> I understand that the person in charge has only visited the centre four times. A number of other issues have been highlighted. HIQA has responsibility for inspecting centres and following through on inspections but it does not have enforcement powers when it has identified issues. Could the Minister give it those enforcement powers, as was previously highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, in order that it can follow through, once it has identified an issue, to have it corrected?</p>

            <p eId="para_241">I thank Deputy Aindrias Moynihan for raising the particular issue, which I will examine personally. As the Deputy said, HIQA has the responsibility to do the inspection and as part of that it works with the providers of residential care to ensure that a plan is put together in order to meet standards and then come up with a report. Oversight and ensuring standards are raised remains with Tusla and my Department. That is where the responsibility lies in that regard. They are supported and complemented by HIQA continuing with its investigations over a period. That is the process that is currently in place. What I have also tried to describe in terms of the wider breadth of the residential centres is that Tusla is also developing more efforts in terms of its ACTS team to support what goes on within the centres in order to ensure those standards are raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_242">The issues were highlighted more than a year ago and there was a follow-up inspection last August. It does not make sense that when issues are identified they are not followed up. Why does HIQA not have the authority or the teeth to follow through and to enforce its own recommendations?</p>
            <p eId="para_243"> The situation in Coovagh House was identified more than a year ago. I understand that my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, proposed that HIQA would be given the necessary powers. Could the Minister ensure that HIQA has the power to follow through and enforce its recommendations?</p>

            <p eId="para_244">Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raises the question of enforcement as a tool of ensuring things happen, usually with force or by imposition. HIQA has certain responsibilities. It identifies where there are deficits and where the standards need to be raised. In the context of this exceedingly difficult work with very troubled young people, sometimes it takes a long time to resolve the challenges. That is the nature of the work. What we have done to ensure there is enforcement, to use Deputy Aindrias Moynihan's word, change or the raising of the standards is by means of the Tusla team coming in to support what goes on in that context. That is ultimately what will provide the sustainable change we are seeking and enable ultimately, if it is possible, the healing of the young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_246">The question I raise today came up numerous times when we were canvassing in the past seven weeks and relates to crèches turning away babies and toddlers in favour of preschool children that are seen as more lucrative.</p>

            <p eId="para_247">We have had an unprecedented increase of 117% in investment for early learning and care and school-age childcare in recent budgets. The extra investment has supported a doubling of capacity in the sector, including both ECCE and the zero to three age group. It is clear, however, that further capacity is required and that is why I am continuing my intensive efforts in this area. In 2019, I provided €4 million in capital funding to support additional places for children under three years. Decisions on the allocation of the funding will be made very soon and I anticipate that it will support the creation of approximately 1,300 additional places before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_248"> In the longer term, I ensured that childcare would be identified as a strategic priority in the national development plan. To that end, I have secured €250 million for that purpose, much of which will be invested in additional capacity. The national childcare scheme, to be introduced later this year, will also incentivise additional capacity. It provides a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under one year, with graded rates for those aged from one year and upwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_249"> The €50 million figure quoted this week in the media refers to the full-year costs of the scheme in 2020. The Government was aware of the costs when it approved the enhancements to the national childcare scheme  in budget 2019 and these costs will be addressed as normal within the Estimates process for 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_250"> Childminders form a key part of the service provision for young children. I want to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla in order to allow them to access subsidies under the NCS. My Department has recruited a national childminding co-ordinator and will eventually recruit six more people as development officers in order to support this. We will also finalise a childminding action plan to set out the steps we have to take to move forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_251">This issue arose many times on the doorsteps while we canvassed in the past few weeks. In one case, a parent had contacted 25 providers in Tallaght and Clondalkin and still could not find a place for her child. The Minister has stated previously that successive Governments have under-resourced and undervalued childcare in Ireland. This problem is caused by providers that see the provision of childcare for toddlers as more lucrative than that relating to babies. The Minister has indicated that, under the NCS, a subsidy of €5 per hour will be paid in respect of every baby. Is that amount too little? Does it help make financial sense for childcare facilities to provide places for children under the age of one?</p>

            <p eId="para_252">This is a challenging situation for people. I am aware that some parents cannot find places for children under three years of age. That is the reality and it is the reason we have provided capital funding of €4 million to focus on increasing capacity for that age group in particular. It is more costly to care for children who are under three years of age because a higher staff-to-child ratio applies. I have identified that we are also increasing the subsidy for the birth-to-three age category via the NCS, which will begin in November. We plan to deal with the concerns and difficulties in accessing places for those under three in a number of ways and we anticipate that the measures to be taken will make a significant difference.</p>

            <p eId="para_253">In some cases, average childcare costs can equate to mortgage repayments. Some parents are paying up to €1,500 per month for childcare, which is completely unsustainable in the short and the long term. The provider of childcare has to be subsidised by the State. If the subsidy is €5 per hour and the baby is in crèche for 36 to 40 hours per week, it would amount to approximately €800 per month. If the average cost is €1,400 then €600 is paid by the parents. Are the subsidies too low? The Minister is asking for €50 million to plug the black hole relating to the NCS next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_254">I am indicating that subsidies will increase in the 2019 budget. That does not mean that matters are being made considerably easier for parents in terms of the overall cost, but it does increase the level of support provided by the State. I agree with the Deputy and I am committed to seeking an increase in the subsidy, particularly for the age group in question. With the full establishment of the NCS from November, it will be much easier to invest the money for particular ages and it will be easier to increase the subsidy. The system being set up will be more streamlined. With all of the subsidisation, which will be continued, those families with the least will get the most.</p>

            <p eId="para_257"> Earlier today, Tusla published a summary report in respect of the care of three children in a foster home in County Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_258"> Once again, and particularly in light of today's publication, I would like to sincerely acknowledge the pain and distress suffered by the three women at the centre of this report. Lessons have been learned and will continue to be learned from the findings of this investigation. No child should be exposed to the clear risks that were evident after the first disclosures in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_259"> The report provides a sober, full account of what happened, and a clear analysis of the failures that occurred in managing the case. In particular, the report finds that there was enough evidence at the time of the disclosure to warrant the removal of the remaining foster children from the placement. It finds that the safety plan was flawed, and that there was a management failure to recognise the seriousness and complexity of the case. These were very grave errors which have led to lives being changed forever.</p>
            <p eId="para_260"> In the intervening years, there have been changes with Tusla's practices and standards. They are now far advanced from those of the HSE service in the past. Tusla has worked hard to improve its child protection and foster care services, by way of standards, staffing, resources and practices, and I want to make sure that it continues to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_261"> Today's report includes four recommendations. Two of these are on the development of practice within Tusla, namely, that there is a review of the national policy and procedures for the link social worker role and for Tusla to include risk assessment and skills relating to managing child sexual abuse cases as core professional development in the Signs of Safety practice framework. A further two of the major recommendations include developing an integrated approach to the investigation, assessment and management of child sex abuse allegations.</p>
            <p eId="para_262"> As referenced in the report, work is already under way with the development of the One House-Barnahus model. The first centre will be in Galway.</p>

              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_264"> It is also recommended that Tusla develop a multi-agency policy response to how complex cases are managed by Tusla, the Garda and areas of the HSE. This is critical to the State response to children who are being sexually abused.  The report recommends a greater recognition of the fact and dynamics involved in sexual abuse by adolescents.</p>
            <p eId="para_265"> The report sets out the social work practice, its context and what went wrong. It provides insight into the secrecy and dynamics of child sexual abuse that affects many families.</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> I am determined to complete and advance the reforms under way as part of the child protection and welfare strategy and to pursue actions to minimise the chances of anything like this happening in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_269">Why is a summary report being published? Is that the report that was leaked last week? Do the 22 pages that were leaked last week constitute the summary report? Can the Minister clarify how it could possibly have taken until now for a summary report to be published? Is it being published simply because the pages were leaked? Who leaked them? Does the Minister have any idea? Does Tusla know who leaked the pages? It is very important that a report of this nature should not be leaked. We have raised this matter continuously during Leader's Questions. I have looked back and discovered that I raised the matter nine times in the last year. This should have come before the Dáil via the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or through the Minister opposite and it should have been presented to us in order that we could discuss it. How could it possibly have taken this long? The Minister indicated in replies to parliamentary questions I tabled that it was completed at the end of November, six solid months ago, yet we are only getting a summary report now as a result of a leak. I would really appreciate simple, straight answers to my questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_270">I will do my best to answer some of those questions. We do not know who leaked the report; I assure the Deputy that it was not leaked by Tusla. The publication of the summary report was planned for today, and it was published earlier. The Deputy asked why this is a summary report and not the full report.</p>
            <p eId="para_271">My understanding is that Tusla took legal advice regarding the publication of the full report. In light of the different identifications of people etc., in the report, the full report could not be published and it would need to be in summary form. The summary form outlined the recommendations for what is needed for change.</p>

            <p eId="para_274">I thank the Minister for making the effort to give me a straight answer. I have great difficulty, however, in believing in this process. I see no sign in the replies to me that today was the due date for the publication of the summary report. It simply did not occur to anyone doing the replies on the Minister’s behalf to tell me that date is today. That raises serious questions in my mind about trust.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> I believe it was leaked for a purpose. I can only surmise that someone felt this report was never going to be published and then took it upon themselves to leak it. That is deeply troubling if that is what happened. I do not want to believe that narrative but, when I look back, I see nothing else. That a report on this matter should be leaked is unacceptable. Has Tusla carried out a review into the leak? It is extraordinary, given that it was carrying out a review into its behaviour and handling of this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_276"> Why was it not brought back in? If today was the day, was the Minister going to bring it back in before the Government and before us in the Dáil in order that we could discuss it? Considering what happened in this case, it was set up in 2016 and three years later we get a leaked report. It goes back to heinous abuse.</p>

            <p eId="para_286">I am acutely aware of the pay and conditions issues that exist within the sector. I take every possible opportunity to highlight the importance of the work the sector does for children and how we must value it for this. Current hourly pay rates, as well as availability for many practitioners of only part-time-part-year contracts, do not reflect the level of responsibility that early learning and care professionals hold, nor the increasing qualifications required from them.</p>
            <p eId="para_287"> While we have a long way to go to rectify this situation, I am doing everything in my power to do so. I have set out my vision for the sector, as well as a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, the whole-of-government strategy which I launched with the Taoiseach last November. Within First 5, there is a commitment to develop a workforce development plan which will ensure appropriate levels of early learning and care, ELC, and school-age childcare, SAC, staff at all levels in the sector. The rate of employees at graduate level currently stands at 22%. First 5 aims to increase this level to 30% by 2021 and to 50% by 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_288"> The steering group for a new workforce development plan for the sector will meet for the first time on 30 May. The plan will include actions to move to a graduate-led workforce by 2028 and to raise the profile of careers in the sector. It will have regard to the development of a new funding model which will also seek to address workforce issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_289"> As the State is not the employer, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions. I have instead repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a sectoral employment order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_290"> In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions. These include a 117% increase in investment over the past four budgets; a 7% increase in early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and for inclusion co-ordinators; and annual programme support payments of over €19 million to recognise administrative demands.</p>

            <p eId="para_291">The early childhood care sector is in crisis. It is a significantly high cost to parents and providers are facing significant challenges with overheads, commercial rates etc. The staff, who are well educated, earn little more than the minimum wage. Staff turnover in the sector last year was 24.7%. Many childcare workers who have got a third level degree are forced to go on the dole and be in receipt of social welfare benefits for several weeks during the year when they are not paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_292"> I recently met a lady who has childcare qualifications and has worked for ten years in the same childcare centre. With the exception of the minimum wage increase, she has received no other rise in her remuneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> I met another young lady with a first class honours degree in childcare who had to move back from Galway to Westmeath. She has to commute every day to Galway to work because she is on such low wages that she cannot afford to pay the high rents in Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_294"> The Minister talks about valuing this workforce. The Government, however, is not demonstrating that it values them because they certainly do not feel valued at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_295">I am building for the first time a radical new infrastructure for our children and families. The passage of the Childcare Support Act marks the first time ever parents and families have been entitled legally to a financial subsidisation. I am correcting decades of underinvestment in this arena. It takes a long time to correct that.</p>
            <p eId="para_296"> As I have already indicated, we have had an increase of 117% in investment in this sector over the past four budgets. Those kind of statistics demonstrate we are interested in both the children and their families, as well as the workers in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_297"> I have indicated to the Deputy the ways in which we have invested more money in the services and the providers, particularly with raising the ECCE capitation rate. It is hoped that this will ultimately be passed on to the sector and to the people who work in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_303">The workers in the sector do not feel valued. Anybody working ten years in a sector who has had no pay increase in that time will not feel valued. A young girl, who went to college, got a first class honours degree but has to move home from Galway to commute to Westmeath, does not feel valued. Despite the rhetoric and the promises, there is still a bureaucratic regulatory system requirement on the providers. They are still being charged commercial rates despite the fact they are essentially providing a State service.</p>
            <p eId="para_304">There are things the Government could do that are not being done. To talk about 2028 is simply not good enough. It is only 2019. Young people who have qualified want to work and make a contribution to this sector but they do not feel valued. They are leaving in their droves. If corrective action is not taken now rather than in 2028, the Minister will have a greater crisis on her hands.</p>

            <p eId="para_305">First, one of the reasons some people in the sector have higher degrees is because of the investment made by my Department in providing additional training for the people. That is one of the ways in which we have valued the people working in the sector. I am fully aware of the challenges those in the sector face because I meet and speak to them when I travel across the country. I am from the sector also and I have worked closely with it in recent years. I am aware of what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_306"> As already indicated, after decades of underinvestment, there has been a significant amount of investment, with as much of it as I can ensure going towards supporting the pay, conditions, professionalisation, qualifications and training - for example, training to work with young children with special needs in particular. These are all the different ways in which we - while not being the employer - have invested in the people to the extent that we can. Admittedly, we need to do more. I am not stating that we do not. I am aware of that as much as the Deputy but I do not accept the fact that the changes we have made across the board demonstrate that we do not value those who work in this sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_309">On 11 March, I launched the national childcare scheme - our pathway to truly accessible, affordable, quality childcare.   The scheme is scheduled to open to applications later this year in October-November.</p>
            <p eId="para_310"> We are making progress in preparing for the scheme's introduction. Following the enactment of the Childcare Support Act 2018, detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are now being finalised.  Intensive work is also progressing on the scheme’s supporting IT system.</p>
            <p eId="para_311"> A national communications campaign on the scheme is under way to ensure that providers and parents are ready for the scheme when it opens.  This involves a sequenced programme of information, training and supports. Key elements of the campaign include the launch of a new website, <i>www.ncs.gov.ie</i>; the distribution to date of 5,000 information packs and 50,000 parent booklets to providers, libraries, Government offices and other key stakeholders; and a major nationwide training programme for providers, offering more than 12,500 training places across 600 venues. I am happy to report that there is very strong interest in the website, the parent booklets and the training.</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> In September and October, my Department will run a large information campaign across a number of media channels to ensure there is full awareness among parents of their potential entitlements under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_313"> The agreement for service providers to participate in the scheme will be published shortly, and will be available for signing in June. To support providers who enter into contract for the scheme, I recently announced capital funding of €3 million for the provision of ICT software and hardware for providers. Individual services will receive between €500 and €2,000 depending on the number of children who are actively registered on one of the Department’s childcare programmes. Applications for this funding will also open in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> I will continue to work intensively to deliver this landmark scheme which will alter the landscape of childcare in Ireland, support families, provide a sustainable platform for investment and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in children.</p>

            <p eId="para_315">To start on a positive note, it was great to see the Minister in County Cavan last week for the second arts festival the county has had. Ms Kim McCafferty and the other volunteers were delighted about that. It was great to see the Minister taking an interest in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_316"> In the context of the single affordable childcare scheme, it is likely that families receiving very low levels of subsidy may be worse off than they were prior to its introduction. Childcare costs are cripplingly high. The average household spends approximately 35% of its income on childcare costs alone. The average cost of a full-time early years place in Ireland is €167 per week per child and this rises to €214 in certain areas. It is a large amount and accounts for a major chunk out of parents' incomes. With the astronomical burdens on families in terms of the costs of housing, rent and electricity and other bills, how will low income families be able to cope with the cost of this scheme?</p>

            <p eId="para_317">I appreciate the different numbers the Deputy provided. I am probably more aware than most of the challenge of the affordability of childcare for parents. That is the reason I have worked intensively during the past three years to ensure that there has been such an significant increase of investment for families. That is not to say the costs for families are as affordable as we would like. With services and the subsidies being provided under the national childcare scheme in a new way from October and November onwards, it will make it much easier for future Governments to make investment in streamlined and targeted ways in future years, especially for those families who are on the lowest incomes in order that they receive the highest subsidies. I am aware of what the Deputy said and that is the reason we have made such intensive efforts and have increased the investment 117 % during the past four years.</p>

            <p eId="para_318">The Minister referred to the ICT requirements and the infrastructure that must be in place for this scheme to come into play in September. Will those in the childcare sector be given adequate time and training to use this system? Will childcare providers be compensated for the non-contact hours they will have? It is no surprise that certain parts of the country do not have broadband connectivity. My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is badly affected and has black spots in terms of such access. What provision will be in place for childcare providers to be able to deal with this ICT system? Is the Minister confident that the system will be up and running and that those in the sector will have time to be trained in the use of it?</p>

            <p eId="para_319">As indicated, training will continue to be provided. We are also providing moneys to those childcare providers who sign up to the contract with the national childcare scheme, as I indicated, to receive the appropriate software and hardware and support in the use of it. Considerable training in taking place and I am confident that they will be ready. That is not to say that some might not be but, generally speaking, there is an intense effort and an awareness that this is what needs to happen. That addresses the Deputy's first set of questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_320"> As she will be aware, in recent years I put in place and then increased the amount of what we now call programme support payments, which used to be called non-contact time payments, for providers by way of recognition of the amount of time required to do the administration work. Ultimately, the time involved should reduce under the national childcare scheme we are implementing.</p>

            <p eId="para_323">I expect to receive the final report of the independent reviewer, Ms Marion Reynolds, this week, as it is the end of May. I had previously expected that this report would be submitted to me by Easter. In her third report, which I published, Ms Reynolds informed me that this would now be delayed until the end of May.</p>
            <p eId="para_324"> I understand the reason for the delay was that the fieldwork carried out by both Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland was complex, forensic and resource intensive, and took longer than anticipated. This fieldwork has now reached a conclusion. In addition, there were considerable challenges in respect of data protection that had to be overcome, which also delayed the process at one point. I am pleased to say that these issues have been resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> The two previous interim reports from the reviewer have also been published on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> The purpose of this review, which I initiated following the discovery of cases of illegal registrations in the St. Patrick's Guild records, is to determine if similar evidence of illegal birth registrations can be identified from the records of other former adoption agencies and other relevant bodies. The final report and its findings will provide information to assist me in identifying the necessary next steps. I am extremely conscious of the impact that news of an illegal registration can have on those affected. This is particularly true in circumstances where those impacted had no indication of any irregularities.  It seems to me that this must be one of the most difficult and traumatic episodes that anyone would have to deal with in a lifetime. I will study the independent reviewer's report closely as soon as I receive it, and will reflect carefully on what to do next to assist all involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_327">I take it that the Minister has confirmation that she will have the report by the end of the month, because there have been previous dates that moved. It was to be done by October last, then it was to be done by April, I think Easter was mentioned somewhere, and now the end of May. Can the Minister confirm that she will have it in two days' time, at the end of May? Can the Minister then give a date for its publication?</p>
            <p eId="para_328"> The Minister will realise that this came from the discovery by Tusla of 126 cases. However, that is based on much previous work. The adoption association of Ireland brought matters to a previous Government's attention. The <i>Irish Examiner</i> deserves an award for all the work that newspaper and Conall Ó Fátharta have done. All of this has been wrought out. I welcome what has happened, but it was not a proactive decision by the Government. It was wrought from the pain of people and from the good work done by the newspaper. It is important, as with the previous question, that we have trust and if a date is set, that the Minister has the report and a date is given for its publication.</p>

            <p eId="para_330"> I have tried to describe in my answer to the Deputy the reasons, even though I understood it was coming earlier, it was delayed.

            <p eId="para_341">There is a growing crisis in childcare in this country. The crisis is threefold: the extortionate costs of childcare, often reaching over €1,000 a month; the staffing and pay for workers in childcare, which is low and precarious or seasonal; and increasingly, the major problem in accessing childcare places. What is the Government intending to do to address this crisis, particularly the lack of spaces?</p>

            <from>Deputy Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_342">The annual Pobal early years sector profile is based on a survey of all services which participate in State-funded early learning and care and school age childcare schemes. The latest report, containing data from May 2018, indicates that while the sector is experiencing significantly increased demand, it is broadly meeting this demand nationally. I am, however, fully aware of the challenges many parents experience to access high quality and affordable places, particularly for younger children. This is why I have worked intensively with my officials to introduce a number of measures to address the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_343"> The substantial increase in investment in childcare over the past four budgets has delivered a range of improvements, including a doubling of capacity in the sector for both ECCE and the birth to three years age group, but clearly more needs to be done. I am taking a number of steps to address capacity issues. I have provided €9.6 million in capital funding for the sector in 2019 to focus on increasing the number of places available.</p>
            <p eId="para_344"> My Department is also helping services to get ready for the forthcoming national childcare scheme. This capital funding, decisions on which will be published very shortly, is expected to produce approximately 1,300 new spaces for birth to three year olds and 2,300 new school age childcare places this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_345"> The national childcare scheme, which will be introduced later this year, will also be a major incentive for providers to expand capacity. The scheme will provide a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under one - up to €5.10 per hour - and the next highest subsidy for one and two year olds - up to €4.35 per hour.</p>
            <p eId="para_346"> As I have mentioned in responses to earlier questions today, I will publish a childminding action plan in the coming months that will set out the actions my Department will take to support more childminders to offer high quality and subsidised childcare.</p>

            <p eId="para_347">I am sceptical that the efforts the Minister has outlined will deliver the affordable childcare that we need. There is already evidence that the childcare scheme may merely push up the prices charged by the private providers and wipe out the value of the subsidy. That highlights the overall problem. A little like the housing crisis, the Government's plans for childcare depend on the private sector. I am not sure the private sector will deliver. It may merely increase prices but also not deliver the places.</p>
            <p eId="para_348">To my mind, unless the State directly provides affordable childcare places, which will also deal with the issue of precarious work and pay, we will not get the sort of affordable childcare that we desperately need.</p>
            <p eId="para_349"> In my area, there is a large new housing development called Cualanor and Honeypark. A crèche was supposed to be provided as part of planning. It was never provided because when we are depending on a private developer to do it, it just does not happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_350">I will address the first couple of issues there. As I said to some of the Deputy's colleagues, I appreciate that childcare is not yet fully affordable. That is because of decades of underinvestment in childcare. Even though we started from a very low base, we have 170% more investment in the development of a systematic effort over the last couple of years - to look at ways in which we can enable a financial entitlement to subsidisation of childcare for families, which we have now, and build a capacity, as well as provide the providers with the qualifications required to offer the quality that we require. That is going on.</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> On the second issue, I, too, have that concern on the raising of fees that meets the subsidisation. A certain increase has happened since we have been monitoring this, but costs have increased too. I will actively discuss this concern with my Department over these coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_352">Is it not the problem that because we are relying on the private sector, this will inevitably happen? The evidence is there and the Minister acknowledged it. As to the provision of places, the issue was highlighted to me in my area where there was a crèche in the Holy Child school in Sallynoggin. For reasons I do not understand, the school closed the crèche in the middle of the year, leaving a number of mothers, children and families high and dry with nowhere to go. They were told to find somewhere else, which they simply could not do. People in Sallynoggin were told to go to Rathfarnham, which was totally unsustainable for people working in education and so on. There are simply not the places. The local childcare committee in the council acknowledge the problem but does not have the resources because we are not directly providing the affordable childcare places. That is the only way we are going to get the affordable childcare on the scale we need to address this need.</p>

            <from>Deputy Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_353">My heart is with the Deputy in what he said. It is correct to say that we are going in a different direction. On the Deputy's comments on places, in answering a number of earlier questions, I have stated that we have a systematic approach, especially in our work with Pobal, to try to identify where we need to increase capacity so that the supply meets the demand. That does not sometimes always work. I am happy to listen to what the Deputy is saying about his particular area and we need to be refocused on that. I accept that it does not always work but it is an exaggeration to say that it does not work across the board. That is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_354"> With this model and a higher percentage of private providers than community not-for-profit providers, I have looked at many different ways to see how we can maintain in a better way the level of affordability for parents. What we have arrived at as part of our First 5 approach is to develop a way of using public funds to ensure that fees increase more reasonably for parents but in a way that can assure that the providers, namely, the professionals, are paid what they are worth. That will take a longer time to develop. That is part of the vision of the First 5 and ultimately that will happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_357">The second year of the early childhood care and education programme, ECCE, has been a positive move. The value of it is diminished when people are not able to gain access to the scheme. Recent parliamentary questions show that in Cork there are 1,300 people who are waiting, while at the same time there are 1,300 vacancies. Clearly, there is an imbalance and the spaces are not where the demand is. We need to establish what the plan is to expand the provision so that people can get access to the ECCE scheme in their area when they need it.</p>

            <p eId="para_358">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 33 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_359"> One of the key priorities for my Department's capital programme is supporting private and not-for-profit childcare providers to extend their existing services, or to establish new services, where the need or the demand exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> Each year my Department reviews the early learning, care and school age childcare sector to determine how the capital funding available can best be invested. For the 2019 capital programme, grants will be allocated to applications of the highest quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> The decision on where to target capital spending is informed by an analysis of the current state of the childcare sector, learnings from previous capital programmes and feedback and input from stakeholders, including childcare providers, and data from Pobal and other sources. While the prioritisation of a particular area or region has not formed part of the capital schemes to date, the design of the scheme has regard to Pobal's geosparsity index.</p>
            <p eId="para_362"> Early years providers from Cork compete alongside services from all other parts of the country and all applications are appraised in a fair and impartial manner and solely on the basis of the quality of their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> As regards capacity issues more generally, each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to childcare services in Ireland, including capacity. The latest early years sector profile report, based on a survey completed in May 2018, outlines a 7% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in Cork. It simultaneously reports a 12% waiting list rate, indicating both under supply and oversupply but in different areas or for different age groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> Pobal reports that nationally the trend for waiting lists suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under twos but cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot by itself be used to inform capacity decisions as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> Finally, if the Deputy is aware of any specific cases of parents having difficulty accessing childcare places, they could make contact with their local city or county childcare committee who will be pleased to assist them.</p>

            <p eId="para_366">The figures the Minister outlined are consistent with those furnished in the replies to parliamentary questions where people are waiting and there are vacancies in different parts of Cork. There is a mismatch and availability needs to be provided locally. People are having to travel further. One service provider, a person on the edge of the city, has people coming from more than a 22 km radius because people are not able to get a service in their area and are having to travel greater distances.</p>
            <p eId="para_367"> These issues should have been visible to the Minister before the scheme was launched. Providers should have had the opportunity to get ready for this. Looking a year or two ahead, this will be a serious challenge for parents because they will only have one year or two years benefit from the scheme. There needs to be faster response to ensure that the spaces are available locally and that people can gain access to the ECCE programme in their community.</p>

            <p eId="para_368">I appreciate what the Deputy said and he has drawn attention to these issues in particular areas previously. We are aware of that. Matching supply and demand is not an exact science, as the Deputy is well aware. I do not accept that in planning forward we have not identified, to the extent we can, where demand will surface and supply will need to be met. There are at least two factors operative here. One has to do with our planning, efforts and investment. In 2017 and 2018 we have invested more than €1,304,000 in developing the supply in Cork city and county.</p>
            <p eId="para_369">The other part of it is the providers and ensuring they are ready to step up and to increase the capacity and the places for the delivery of more services in the areas where children live. We are trying to support them to do that to the best of our ability but we must work together to move forward in order that there will not be the mismatch identified by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_370">One area of which the Minister does have control is the availability of capital funding and the ability to ensure that the various providers are able to get access and to build and that services could be built in areas where they do not exist. I understand that €9.6 million is available this year but when one spreads that across the country, it is only a couple of hundred thousand euro per county. The scale of the funding is mismatched with the demand and a lot of catch-up is needed. Is the Minister in a position to provide further funding to address those gaps and to have the services provided in time for parents, given there is only a short window of opportunity in a child’s life when he or she is able to benefit from the scheme? One must have the facilities available for them to learn at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_371">As for the identification of where the money will go and what it is for - let us say it is €9 million this time - our policy is to target the under-three cohort in particular this year. We know there is a capacity issue in that regard. That affects the design of the scheme. The assessment for capital applications also has regard to Pobal’s geosparsity index, which means we also look at geography.</p>
            <p eId="para_372"> When the applications come in they must be of a certain quality for us to be assured that the money invested will deliver what is required. We try to support that too. All of those things need to be in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_373"> The Deputy asked whether we can provide more investment. I would like to see that. Let us see how the first round goes. If there is a need, we can request additional applications from providers that are ready to ensure they can provide facilities of the quality that is required.</p>

            <p eId="para_376">I thank Deputy Gino Kenny for asking my view on the devastating crisis of homelessness among children and young people. The fact that, as of March 2019, there are 1,733 families experiencing homelessness in Ireland, and 3,821 children and young people is, quite frankly, heartbreaking. Although ultimate responsibility for addressing the homelessness crisis rests with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, my Department and Tusla are continuing to make every effort to alleviate the difficulties experienced by children and families who are homeless.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> Homelessness is a traumatic experience which, as the Deputy suggests, can have a profound impact on young lives. There is no doubt that the effects of this crisis will be felt for many years to come. To mitigate the trauma as far as possible, I am using my Department’s powers and resources to the greatest possible extent in providing supports for children and families experiencing homelessness. I have ensured that free childcare is provided for the children of families experiencing homelessness, including a daily meal for each child. A total of 312 children have been registered under this scheme in the current programme year.</p>
            <p eId="para_378"> I have also succeeded in having young adults leaving State care included as a separate category for funding under the capital assistance scheme, CAS. That provides targeted assistance to the most vulnerable care leavers by enabling approved housing bodies to acquire residential units to accommodate them. I am pleased to report that as of last Friday, 24 care leavers have availed of places with various approved housing bodies, including 15 with Focus Ireland, six with the Peter McVerry Trust, and three with Don Bosco. Additional placements have been secured and are expected to come on stream within the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> In addition, I have supported and resourced Tusla to support families who are homeless. I have secured an additional €1.5 million in 2019 to enable the further roll-out of family resource centres, which provide facilities to support families who are homeless in order that they can have a safe, warm environment for homework and relaxation and nutritious food.</p>

            <p eId="para_380">I do not doubt the Minister’s sincerity when it comes to this issue, but the facts speak for themselves and the fact is that since this Government has taken office in 2016, child homelessness has increased by 70%. That is more than 1,800 children in emergency accommodation. As the Minister stated, it has had a profound effect on each child and on their families, who are in a completely unnatural environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_381"> As an Independent Member, who is not affiliated to Fine Gael, has the Minister thought of withdrawing her support for the Government? It is obvious that the Government’s policy on housing and giving shelter to citizens of this country is profoundly wrong and is going nowhere. Child homelessness has risen exponentially in the past three years. Has the Minister considered her position in supporting the Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_382">The question is not relevant to what we are looking at here but as an Independent member of the Government, I regularly review my participation with my Government partners. That is a fact. This is a significant issue. I have put forward a number of recommendations and suggestions, some of which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has taken on board, to increase security of tenure for those renting and to have more of a focus on affordable housing, in addition to increasing the amount of social housing. I have also put forward suggestions in respect of looking at models used in other countries. Recently, I have been investigating what is going on in Germany in terms of co-operative housing. By staying in, I am continuing to use my every effort and thought to support the overall actions that are needed to move us beyond where we are. In respect of the areas for which I have responsibility - it is not just my sincerity - what I have put in place has led to a number of actions and resources that are mitigating the harm for the children who experience homelessness in the context of their families.</p>

It is obvious that the current housing policy of the Fine Gael Government is an abject failure and not only for the 10,000 people in emergency accommodation. The vast majority of people find that figure absolutely staggering. Somebody has to bear responsibility. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs must surely have had sleepless nights in the last three years in respect of the 4,000 homeless children. It is not her fault personally but it is the fault of the Government she upholds.</p>

            <p eId="para_388">I am pleased that we have managed to increase substantially our investment in childcare over the last few years. I want to continue increasing this investment but, in doing so, we must have an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.</p>
            <p eId="para_389">Subsidies for all early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on the level of attendance of a child. These rules differ slightly across different schemes, reflecting the varied needs and circumstances of families.</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> My Department has been proactive in communicating these rules to service providers through our monthly e-zines, general guidance, letters and discussions with representative bodies. The 30 childcare committees nationally have also given support in this area.  Pobal administers these childcare programmes on behalf of my Department and carries out compliance visits. Findings of non-compliance may affect a service financially, but I believe our approach to protecting Exchequer funding is balanced appropriately with the supports we provide to community services to enable them to continue to deliver a sustainable and high quality service. My Department worked closely with Pobal in developing processes and policies to prepare for any potential sustainability impact of correcting non-compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> I appreciate that community childcare services provide a critical service to children and families across the country. Significant supports, including financial supports, are available through a case management system to bring them onto a more sustainable footing, while being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.  This includes a strand of funding which will be available to the services facing the most serious threats to their sustainability due to community childcare subvention overclaims, subject to a financial assessment. Pobal’s case management team has aimed to contact all of the affected community services to engage with them concerning any supports required. This has included one-to-one engagement to ensure services are aware of the supports available to them, including financial supports. </p>

            <p eId="para_392">I re-emphasise that Pobal's recent compliance reports and audits are causing great distress on the ground to community managed and operated childcare providers. My information comes first-hand from childcare providers in Carlow-Kilkenny. They have told me that the recent loss of funding arising from Pobal's compliance reports will result in staff reductions and the loss of service and parental supports within the sector. That is first-hand information from the people providing the service. They are telling me that this important service will be lost if they do not get more funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_393"> Is the Minister satisfied that the sector will not sustain mass closures and a reduction in services? Many not-for-profit community managed and operated childcare providers are reporting that is what is going to happen. Service providers and members of the Carlow Kilkenny Community Childcare Forum have communicated to my office that they are disappointed with the lack of engagement from the Minister's Department. I will be interested to hear the response from the Minister. I am being told one thing from people on the ground and she is telling me something else. Something is wrong somewhere in between. I ask and plead with the Minister to take this on board. </p>

            <p eId="para_394">I certainly will take that point on board. I will investigate the issues Deputy Aylward has raised regarding services in his Carlow-Kilkenny constituency. The Deputy is stating he is being told that the service is going to be lost in light of the compliance audit. I expect that the Deputy accepts the basic principle that audits are required. I indicated that my Department has spent much time supporting service providers to ensure that they are aware of what is required to comply. Having said that, there are services that, for whatever reasons, have been found wanting in this respect. I also understand that supports are there, particularly and most recently financial supports, to ensure the sustainability of these services, where required. Deputy Aylward, however, is telling me that information has not reached his area or that it is not part of what the county childcare committee is doing. I will investigate the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">I am conscious that the school completion programme, SCP, continues to deliver a valuable service for some of our most vulnerable young people. Currently, the SCP receives annual funding of €24.7 million. My Department works with the educational welfare service, EWS, to ensure that necessary resources are available to support this programme and to ensure staffing levels are sufficient to deliver a high quality service for those young people most at risk of early school leaving. A number of long term complex issues continue to exist, however, regarding both the governance and the staffing of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_399"> In this regard and in recognition of the need for a strong policy platform for educational welfare services, including the SCP, I requested my officials establish a task group to support the further development and integration of these services. The work of this group is near completion and I am eager to ensure that output will result in a clear blueprint for the development of the three strands of the EWS, including the SCP. A consultation event on the blueprint will be held on 10 June. Those working with vulnerable young people as part of the EWS will then have an opportunity to express their views and help shape the policy blueprint prior to its publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> As part of the implementation of the actions contained in the blueprint, I have requested that a new SCP scheme be scoped out and developed to ensure that its reach, resources and impact are maximised in supporting young people. I will also continue to examine options concerning the employment status of SCP co-ordinators and project workers. I am also aware that the EWS requires adequate staff numbers to ensure the three strands - home schooling, SCP and EWS - can meet the increasing demands on the service.  The EWS has advised that it employs 89 education welfare officers who are managed by 12 senior educational welfare officers and that a service is provided to 3,952 schools. The most recent school enrolment figures stand at just over 920,000 students, with an average of 10,300 students per educational welfare officer. My Department continues to work to ensure necessary resources are available to support the EWS in its work. </p>

            <p eId="para_401">Ms Tanya Ward of the Children's Rights Alliance was before the committee and she stated that we need more education welfare officers. She made the point that many of the children in Oberstown had not completed school and that if there had been early intervention many of those children would not be there. I welcome what the Minister stated about the task force and the blueprint policy. There seem, however, to be ongoing issues in respect of the understaffing of the school completion programme. That has been the case, particularly, since responsibility for the programme was transferred to the Minister's Department from the Department of Education and Skills. Are we really going to increase the numbers of these education welfare officers? Has the Minster given any consideration to this programme moving back to the Department of Education and Skills?</p>

            <p eId="para_402">I do not know if there will be a rise in the numbers, so I cannot say "Yes" or "No" right now. I can state that we have had a really intensive focus on the education welfare service in general. It is part of Tusla. We started that focus, as Deputy Mitchell knows, with the review of the school completion programme itself. When I looked at it more deeply, however, I realised that we could not just look at that issue in isolation. We had to look at the other two aspects of the education welfare service as well. That in turn brought us to the wider examination and the belief that we need this overall blueprint to move forward to ensure better integration and a better way of supporting our young people staying in school. That may require more people or it may not. I respect the views of the Children's Rights Alliance and Ms Ward. We will listen to those views and perhaps Ms Ward may even participate in a consultation event. We have done much work which will be put in front of the stakeholders and we want to hear back from them before we move forward on decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">I am raising the issue, with Deputy Jack Chambers, of what has been happening, or rather not happening, in respect of Pelletstown Educate Together national school. </p>
            <p eId="para_404">The parents, children and staff are undergoing trials and tribulations because the Government has failed, in its third year in office, to build the permanent school. There was a threat that the school would be moved to different temporary accommodation yet again. In the context of the recent elections, that threat was removed some days ago. Obviously, the parents are relieved. However, they do not intend to allow their children to be bussed between locations or allocated further temporary accommodation. The school is now in its fourth year of existence. A temporary site has been identified. The resolution arrived at is that which Deputy Jack Chambers and I suggested, namely, to ensure the developers who owned the site would extend the lease into the middle of next year. That has now been confirmed. However, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to confirm that the school will not be asked to move premises again, either in whole or in part, until such time as the permanent school building has been provided. I ask him to confirm the stage that arrangements with Dublin City Council regarding the planning for permanent school site have reached. When can we expect to see diggers on site, as we have now been promised numerous times, to commence the permanent accommodation? The school does not need any further temporary moves, it needs a permanent home to carry on the work of educating the children by the dedicated staff and the work of the dedicated parents of the school community which is a vibrant place for learning.</p>

            <p eId="para_405">This is an example of very poor departmental planning. We have had the dislocation of students and the undermining of their accommodation repeatedly over a period of months. A new school in a new community should be discussing the curriculum and community development. However, the children attending this school have had to write to their local representatives about remaining at the existing site and preventing themselves being bussed from one place to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> In September 2015, the school started out in a bunker or basement with no natural light. Planning delays in 2017 meant pupils had to be bussed to different locations. In February 2019, we had an accommodation crisis and fears that the school could not properly open for incoming children in September 2019. Again, there were more delays and poor forward planning from the Department. Recently, and despite a permanent build occurring but with no diggers on site, as Deputy Burton stated, the potential dislocation of pupils in the early part of next year arose again. What is the forward-planning unit of the Department of Education and Skills doing? Why is it allowing a cliff-edge crisis to arise again and again in respect of this school? Pelletstown and the wider Royal Canal and Rathborne area is a new community where there is excellent parental involvement. The children and teachers have great pride in their school but they are having to deal with this cliff-edge approach by the Department whereby potential dislocation arises on an ongoing basis. I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on the current situation. Will there be absolute certainty regarding the accommodation of pupils next year in order that there is a smooth transition from the temporary site to the permanent site? What is the Department doing by way of forward planning to address this ongoing cliff-edge approach which is not fit for purpose in the context of the budgetary allocations it is providing?</p>

            <p eId="para_407">I propose to reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who cannot, unfortunately, be here due to other commitments. I thank Deputies Burton and Jack Chambers for raising the matter and for giving me the opportunity to set out the position in relation to the accommodation needs of Pelletstown Educate Together national school. The school is currently in interim accommodation at Ashtown Road, Rathborne, Dublin 15, and that accommodation is currently sufficient. In September 2019, the school will require additional interim accommodation. The planning application for the additional interim accommodation was lodged with Dublin City Council on 25 February and a notification of a decision to grant was received from the local authority on 18 April. The final grant is awaited. The tender process for the required additional interim accommodation commenced in parallel with the planning application. In addition, the permanent-site acquisition process for the school is now complete. A planning application for the permanent accommodation for the school was lodged in January. A request for additional information received from the local authority was responded to on 26 April and a decision is awaited. Following receipt of planning permission the project will proceed to tender. Provided that no issues arise, it is envisaged that the permanent accommodation will be completed in September 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_408"> In the context of the need for the school's interim accommodation to move from its current location at Ashtown Road in February 2020, I advise as follows. The school's interim accommodation is located on a privately owned site and the landlord had required the Department to confirm that the school would vacate the property at the end of January 2020. As the Deputies opposite have already confirmed, the landlord contacted the Department on 27 May to advise that it had carried out a review of the business plan and strategy for the site and was now agreeable to extend the lease termination date from the 31 January 2020 to the 30 June 2020. As such, there is no longer a need for the school to move to alternative interim accommodation in January 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_409"> I have already outlined the position regarding the permanent accommodation for the school. The matter will be kept under review. The Department is in regular contact with and holds monthly meetings with the school's patron body, Educate Together, in respect of this and a number of other projects under its remit. It will continue to keep the patron body fully informed of progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_410">I speak on behalf of the children, parents and staff of the school. Can the Minister of State commit on the floor of the Dáil to the statement in his script to the effect that, provided that no issues arise, it is envisaged that the permanent accommodation will be completed in September 2020? Will he commit further that if there is any slippage in relation to that date, the Department will ensure no further temporary movements are required of the school? The school has been in a situation of uncertainty for four years, which is a long time in the start-up life of a school and in the life of a child attending primary school. We want to ensure the uncertainty and fear created by the basement experience and the busing experience will not recur. We assume the owners of the site are its developers. They are probably making many millions of euro from the construction of houses and apartments there. I cannot see why the Department is not exercising its role in education by providing schools in areas in which large-scale residential development has taken place. I ask the Minister of State to commit, therefore, that there will be no further disruption to the school until it receives the permanent building in September 2020, as has just been promised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jack Chambers<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_411">Clarity is needed around this given the fact that, notwithstanding the provision by the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, of a similar level of certainty two months ago, we are raising the issue on the floor of the Dáil again today. While there is a commitment on the part of the developer to provide the site to the school until summer 2020, what will happen if there is further slippage and delay in the tendering process, design works or any of the other aspects of the development of the permanent school? Such delays have occurred in respect of other school development sites. Can the Minister of State say with absolute certainty that there will be no further dislocation for children, teachers, parents and the broader school community? They have already had to deal with the developer at Rathborne-Royal Canal leaving a lot of vacant sites in the area in an unsightly state.</p>
            <p eId="para_412">The least that can occur is that the Department secures the future site trajectory until the permanent school opens. That is what the parents want and that is what the school community wants. We need that commitment from the Minister of State and from the forward planning section because the forward planning section of the Department appears to be on an ongoing cliff edge where it has let this school down.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> It is time that we provided certainty. Children should not have to be uncertain about their accommodation on a weekly and monthly basis and that has been the story of this school for the past six months because of the failure of the Department to communicate with and forward plan for this school. The least they can be given from the Minister of State, the Department and the Government is that this will not happen any more and that we will not have to continually raise this issue to have it resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_414">I thank both of the Deputies for raising this issue. The Department's building unit works exceptionally hard, under incredible pressure, to deliver on probably the greatest school building programme that this country has ever undertaken. If it is considered that in the first quarter of 2011 we had the most births per capita in the history of this State, that demographic bubble is now working its way through the education system, and consequently, there is incredible pressure being placed upon the Department's building unit to deliver schools across this country, particularly in locations where we have seen significant population increases over the past five to ten years, Pelletstown being one such location.</p>
            <p eId="para_415"> The Department does not intend to cause anxiety or angst to the school community and has not intended to do so in the past. It is working in close partnership with the school community to deliver this school. In my earlier response, I confirmed that it is envisaged that the permanent accommodation will be completed in September 2020. The Department has also engaged in extensive negotiations with the owner of this privately owned site to ensure that the lease would be extended to 30 June 2020, thus allowing for the school community to remain exactly where it is.</p>
            <p eId="para_416"> If either of my two Oireachtas colleagues was sitting on this side of the House, he or she could not give any commitment over and above that on the certainty. There are issues that may arise through the planning process and nobody can foresee those. There is absolute commitment from the building unit, the Department and this Government to all that we can that is within our power, and I stress that we will do what is within our power, to ensure that this school is delivered on time and no further stress or anxiety shall be caused to the pupils, to the parents and to the teachers of that school.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_418">As the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, knows, I sought yesterday to adjourn Dáil Éireann to address the subject matter of this Topical Issue, which is for the Government to take all urgent steps to resource An Garda Síochána and to introduce any necessary legislation to end the appalling series of murders on the north side of Dublin in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_419"> Last week, communities I represent were devastated to hear of two more dastardly assassinations of young men, allegedly by gangs involved in the illegal drugs trade. One of those savage murders took place in broad daylight last Wednesday afternoon just outside our infants’ school, crèche and church in Darndale Belcamp parish and the tragic victim had been wheeling his child in a buggy just before he ran for his life and was brutally murdered. The area where this outrageous act took place is just beside our Darndale Belcamp village centre, our Sphere 17 youth centre and our local Belcamp tenants’ organisation, BESC, where I have held my weekly meetings with constituents for the past 25 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_420"> This appalling murder follows closely on a similar savage execution in north Fingal, and another earlier dastardly murder of a local citizen and family man on his way to work at 6 a.m. a few months ago, which I raised with the Taoiseach in February. As the Minister of State knows, RTÉ and Dublin Live have reported there has been another barbarous gun murder in Kilmore parish in Coolock just a few minutes ago, again in broad daylight and in total defiance of our community. This litany of gun murders across north and west Dublin and Kildare going back a few months beforehand is a direct threat to our Republic and democracy and it needs the Minister of State and the Government to vigorously address and bring those responsible for this appalling and cavalier lack of respect for human life to immediate justice and to take the stern steps that are necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> In the case of the parish affected last week, I have been deeply proud to represent Darndale Belcamp parish for over a quarter of a century and indeed all the neighbouring parishes of the greater Coolock area, including Kilmore. The wonderful people of Darndale Belcamp and their community leaders have produced a caring and progressive local infrastructure since the estate was developed in the 1970s. At the behest of the people themselves, the estate was largely redesigned, and on their own initiative, Darndale Belcamp village centre was built with the support of the European Union and Dublin City Council, DCC, about 18 years ago. Our local primary schools, youth centre, tenants and the Dales Centre alongside the New Life Centre and our parish of Our Lady Immaculate have all provided a great fulcrum for our vibrant local community. Just recently, we had a fundraising football match between our local Darndale Football Club and the great Glasgow Celtic Legends team.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> This community is shocked and exasperated by this cruel and brutal gun murder, as I am sure Kilmore parish just south of Darndale is today. The longstanding peace of north Coolock was seriously disrupted from the summer of 2017 with an outbreak of anti-social and criminal behaviour including joyriding, dumping and intimidation. Our Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, north Garda Síochána and local community leaders have made huge efforts to curtail this appalling behaviour and I asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Taoiseach to ensure that An Garda Síochána had all the necessary resources, in particular for community and traffic policing and for specialist units like the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau and for Garda actions such as Operation Hybrid.</p>
            <p eId="para_423"> Will these efforts be redoubled and all necessary funding and personnel be provided to Commissioner Harris? I am aware the Criminal Justice Acts need to be revisited, that there are a number of actions on the clár and we had the recent Supreme Court judgment on mandatory sentences, which seems to some extent to be a challenge to this Oireachtas. Is the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, planning specific legislation to tackle gun crime, gang crime and the level of homicides in the State which number up to 80 and more in recent years? What additional resources can also be provided for early education supports and community development given the major cuts to so many services?</p>
            <p eId="para_424"> Today's outrage in the past few hours makes it critical that the Government's response be vigorous and that it bring this disgraceful and appalling mayhem to an end.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_425">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and I recognise his commitment to this very serious issue. Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is unable to take this debate as he is in the Seanad Chamber. He wanted to be here but he is committed to the Seanad this afternoon and he sends his apologies. However, he has spoken in the House on this matter previously and I know that he shares the concerns of Deputy Broughan, as we all do and all Members of this House are horrified by the shocking disregard for life displayed by the persons who carry out these abhorrent crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_426"> The Garda strength of the DMR north central and west regions on 30 April 2019, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 692 and 715, respectively. There are also 34 Garda reserves and 51 Garda staff attached to the DMR north central division and 23 Garda reserves and 63 Garda staff attached to the DMR west division. When necessary, the work of local gardaí is supported by a number of Garda national units, such as the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> The Deputy will also be aware that Operation Hybrid was established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address concerns about community safety, particularly in the north east inner city. That operation benefits from significant support by armed support units. The robust Garda response to the series of shootings perpetrated by violent criminals in Dublin has, as of 5 May 2019, seen 76,699 high-visibility checkpoints implemented and a number of arrests and seizures carried out. The Minister is informed that An Garda Síochána is intently focused on disrupting the activities of these criminal gangs, with a particular focus on intelligence-led policing activities. For example, between Monday, 20 May and Thursday, 23 May, gardaí attached to the drugs unit in Ballymun division carried out a series of intelligence led searches targeting street dealers. A total of 14 houses were searched and 14 males arrested. During these searches, cannabis and cocaine to the value of €42,000 were seized, along with €14,000 in cash. Two vehicles and a scrambler bike were also seized. Members of the Garda also discovered and seized two firearms and ammunition in a follow-up search.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> With regard to the introduction of legislation, I wish to assure Deputies that there is already a robust legal framework in place to address this form of criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_429">The crime of murder, as the Deputy will be aware, carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, as provided for by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990. A sentence of life imprisonment means that the prisoner will be subject to that sentence for the rest of his or her life.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provided enhanced Garda powers in the investigation of offences. Part 7 deals specifically with organised crime, providing for offences targeting the activities of those involved in criminal organisations and those who commit offences for the benefit of criminal organisations. It also provides for a number of specific offences relating to participating or assisting in the carrying out of criminal activities by organised gangs.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> I join Deputy Broughan in acknowledging the shock and horror felt by the decent people of the area the Deputy represents following such crimes. I assure him that everything possible is being, and will be, done to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent it happening again. I am aware a man was shot dead in Coolock this afternoon and have been told gardaí are responding at the scene of the crime. The news is breaking as we speak. Unfortunately, it is another horrible crime in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">The Minister of State referred to Operation Hybrid. A few months ago, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, outlined the successes of the operation, with 86 arrests and 11 people charged in relation to organised crime and gang murder investigations. There were three convictions for murder following the operation. However, only 37 firearms were seized, which seemed low given the number of reported crimes. What other measures have been taken to prevent the importation and use of illegal guns? Have the Government and the Department approached other governments or gun manufacturers in the European Union, the United States or elsewhere about the use of weapons they manufacture?</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> The media report on different developments and personalities in gangland crime but our constituents do not want to know that information. All they want is the organisers and perpetrators of murder on our peaceful streets to be identified, arrested by An Garda Síochána and sentenced to life imprisonment as urgently as possible. The Minister of State referred to the 2006 Act, which was important legislation introduced by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senator McDowell. It is clear that it is now necessary to implement the Act fully to apply to the directors of murder rather than only the perpetrators.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> The constituents believe that the Garda needs substantial resources to address the seriousness of the problem. During the mayhem, they were disappointed to read that Garda overtime had been cut. There were reports in the media that An Garda Síochána had not received sufficient resources for overtime. As the Minister of State will be aware, some of the constituents believe we need a permanent, 24-7, static and patrolling presence in the districts most affected by gun crime and drug-fuelled savagery.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> I have previously asked the Minister of State and the Taoiseach, who is with our EU partners today, whether the State has approached leaders in other jurisdictions about the alleged organisers of major drug-fuelled crime in Ireland who are reportedly domiciled abroad. Will the Minister of State report on any efforts in that regard by the Government with the support of Interpol and Europol? Have we used our extrajudicial powers to reach such people?</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> As the Minister of State will be aware, early intervention in community policing is the key. Today is another tragic and appalling day for our communities. We need a forceful response from the State, given that there is a threat to our democracy.</p>

            <p eId="para_437">I will convey the Deputy's concerns and the points he has made to the Minister for Justice and Equality. As the Deputy outlined, two young men were shot dead within 24 hours of each other last week. They were shockingly callous murders carried out in broad daylight, as the Deputy described. By all accounts, neither man was particularly notorious or a high-level criminal, although that did not prevent them from being killed, which makes it all the more shocking. The murders should act as a warning to all those involved in low-level drug dealing or in any way with the enterprise of such criminal organisations that they have no regard for life.</p>
            <p eId="para_438"> It is important to join with the Garda to urge anyone who may have seen something before or after the incidents to contact the Garda confidential line on 1800 666 111. I fully appreciate the fear of reprisals that can accompany making any statement to the Garda about such a serious incident. The Garda confidential line allows concerned citizens to report often crucial details to the Garda, fully confident their identity will never be disclosed. The smallest detail can be very important. The Minister is assured by the Garda Commissioner that the level of recruitment of Garda members, both ongoing and planned for 2019, will ensure that the Government's commitment to increasing the strength of An Garda Síochána to 15,000 Garda members by 2021 will be achieved. The injection of such a large number of officers into the field, along with new recruits, will be beneficial to protecting communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_439"> I accept what the Deputy stated about community policing. He is dead right in that regard, as he is in respect of education and other community supports. I am working hard on the area of youth justice to try to make a difference. I have been told the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met people in the area last night and visited Coolock Garda station. I appreciate that all Deputies in the area are concerned about the matter. If anybody has information about it, the Garda confidential line is the way to go. We will ensure that the Garda Commissioner will have all the resources necessary to tackle the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> On the Deputy's points about international contact, he is dead right that much of the response must be intelligence led. I assure him that everything that can be done will be done. We are all shocked by the breaking news of another man shot dead in Coolock this afternoon. It is terrible news.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">This is a short, technical Bill, with only five sections to amend certain qualification recognition provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. One of the requirements for registration under the Act is that the applicant must hold an approved qualification. The Bill will provide that a professional qualification which has been recognised, either by the Minister or a body acting on behalf of the State, prior to the introduction of statutory registration for the relevant profession at the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, will be considered an approved qualification under the Act. This will mean there will be no requirement for reassessment of the qualification by CORU, which will allow holders of such professional qualifications to apply for statutory registration at CORU in order that they can legally practise their professions in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The legislation, as it stands, does not allow for the registration either of EEA persons who have had their non-Irish qualifications recognised under a directive which has been subsequently repealed, or of non-EEA persons or persons with non-EEA qualifications who have previously had their qualifications recognised in Ireland under the administrative process. The Bill addresses that gap in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I thank all the Deputies for their valuable and thoughtful contributions on Second Stage and the health committee for its consideration of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The Bill has already passed all Stages in the Seanad and I trust it can now be passed by the Dáil with a view to enactment.

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_449">I welcome the imminent passage of this legislation, which is very important in terms of the prudent management of the public finances. This is a proposal that Fianna Fáil initially made in outline form in 2015. I am glad that it has been fleshed out and embraced by the Government and that this contingency fund, colloquially known as a rainy-day fund, will be established. Our corporation tax receipts in particular are booming, with approximately €10.5 billion collected last year and a similarly strong performance expected again this year. However, there are many changes coming down the track, not least international changes with regard to how corporation tax is treated via the OECD process, etc. There are many threats on that front. Generally speaking, there is a significant risk that we will face economic headwinds in the period ahead. We have had a good run but that may not necessarily continue, so we do need to have a buffer in place that we can call upon in the event that we need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Fianna Fáil welcomes that this legislation will become the law of the land. If the Minister of State has any details regarding the logistics in terms of when the fund will be put in place, when it will be operational and where we go from here he might share them with the House. The putting in place of this fund is an important step, one that is supported by many of the international and domestic organisations, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">This Bill is an important tool in terms of the counter-cyclical methodology that is required to deal with where we are today. Fiscally, we have strong, robust taxes coming in, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the corporate tax rate. I always mention that the income tax take has doubled in the past seven years. It is crucial that we take the opportunity when taxes are buoyant, as they currently are, to set some moneys aside. The amount involved here is small in the greater scheme of things, namely, less than 1% of what is coming in overall. However, we may need that money in the future. Hopefully, it will not be required but we can set it aside and use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I do not have a start-up date. I appreciate this initiative was first considered in 2015. I will try to get the Deputy a detailed note about the speed of the implementation of the fund and the details in that regard.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Seán Kyne)<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis seo deiseanna fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge a phlé inniu. Is í Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 polasaí an Stáit i leith na Gaeilge agus is ionann an Plean Gníomhaíochta 2018-2022 don Ghaeilge agus mapa bóthair ina ndéantar rianú beacht ann faoin méid a dhéanfar go ceann cúig bliana chun cúram a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge, don Ghaeltacht agus do chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise dá réir.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> Ag croílár na n-iarrachtaí seo ar fad ar leas na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, tá an próiseas pleanála teanga, a bhfuil feidhm reachtúil aige faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012. Faoin bpróiseas, atá faoi lán seoil ó 2014, tá an deis á thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta, do phobail i mbailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta agus i líonraí Gaeilge, chun a bheith rannpháirteach in ullmhú agus i bhfeidhmiú pleananna ar bhonn áitiúil le cúnamh leanúnach an Stáit. Ní hamháin go bhfuil an próiseas seo ag dul ag giniúint tairbhe shuntasach don Ghaeilge sna ceantair lena mbaineann sé, ach cruthófar deiseanna breise fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Cuimhnímis go bhfuil sé i gceist go mbeidh oifigeach pleanála teanga, agus oifigeach cúnta pleanála teanga i gcásanna áirithe, le bheith fostaithe go háitiúil i ngach aon cheann den 26 limistéar pleanála teanga Gaeltachta atá luaite faoin bpróiseas. Nuair atá feidhmiú pleananna ar bun sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, sna bailte seirbhíse agus sna líonraí Gaeilge, d'fhéadfadh suas le 50 duine a bheith fostaithe go lán-aimseartha faoin bpróiseas agus iad ag obair as lámh a chéile faoi stiúir ceanneagraíochtaí pleanála teanga áitiúla, ag cabhrú le feidhmiú pleananna teanga faoin bpróiseas. Díol suntais agus dóchais é go deimhin, go bhfuil 14 oifigeach i mbun na hoibre seo faoi láthair faoin bpróiseas agus go bhfuil an líon daoine sin ag fás diaidh ar ndiaidh de réir mar a cheadaítear pleananna.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Agus an t-ábhar maidir le deiseanna fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge á phlé, ní miste a chur sa gcomhaireamh chomh maith, na deiseanna fostaíochta atá á gcur ar fáil in earnáil na Gaeilge de thoradh infheistíocht leanúnach an Stáit. Ag croílár an scéil seo tá an clár tacaíochtaí pobail agus teanga. Faoin gclár seo, cuirtear cúnamh reatha ar fáil chun cabhrú le feidhmiú roinnt scéimeanna faoi leith. De thoradh scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, cuir i gcás, cabhraítear le deiseanna fostaíochta ar bhonn pháirtaimseartha a chur ar fáil do suas le 700 ban tí agus os cionn 1,000 múinteoirí agus cinnirí. De thoradh scéim na gcúntóirí teanga, tá breis agus 100 duine fostaithe mar chúntóirí teanga i scoileanna Gaeltachta atá aitheanta faoin scéim. In éindí leis an dá scéim sin, cuirtear cúnamh reatha ar fáil faoin gclár tacaíochtaí pobail agus teanga do raon leathan eagraíochtaí atá ag feidhmiú ar leas na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ar bhonn leanúnach.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Is gá na heagraíochtaí eile Gaeltachta, atá ag cothú fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge de thoradh chúnamh leanúnach mo Roinne agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, a lua chomh maith. Tá leithéidí Comhar Naíonraí na Gaeltachta, Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta, Ealaín na Gaeltachta, Muintearas agus Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne i mbun oibre go leanúnach agus iad ag plé le tacaíochtaí éagsúla a chur ar fáil ar leas an phróisis pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Agus muid ag caint ar chúrsaí fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge, is gá an tábhacht atá ag baint leis na comharchumainn agus na comhlachtaí pobalbhunaithe Gaeltachta a chur san áireamh. De thoradh chúnamh an Státchiste a chuirtear ar fáil tríd an údarás, tá fostaíocht curtha ar fáil do bhreis agus 80 duine faoi scáth na gcomharchumann Gaeltachta. De thoradh cur chuige nuálach an údaráis mar a bhaineann sé le g-teic, cuirfear tuilleadh leis an infreastruchtúr nua-aoiseach atá ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht, a chothóidh deiseanna breise do dhaoine feidhmiú in earnáil na Gaeilge agus in earnálacha eile ach a bheith lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht. </p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Agus muid ag caint ar an údarás, is ábhar sásaimh é gur éirigh leis an eagraíocht 589 post a chruthú in 2018 agus go raibh 122 duine breise fostaithe i gcuideachtaí an údaráis sa Ghaeltacht ag deireadh na bliana 2018 i gcomparáid leis an mbliain roimhe sin. Bhí 7,625 post i gcliantchuideachtaí an udaráis ag deireadh na bliana sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Mar is eol don Teach, tá oifigigh mo Roinne ag obair in éineacht le hOifig an Ard-Aighne faoi láthair ar mhaithe leis an Bille teanga nua a dhréachtú. Beidh an Bille ag iarraidh dul i ngleic le dá mhórcheist na scéimeanna teanga agus an earcaíocht sa tSeirbhís Phoiblí. Tá sé i gceist córas na gcaighdeán a thabhairt isteach in áit na scéimeanna teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Má tá an chórais seo chun a bheith éifeachtach, beidh orainn díriú isteach ar chúrsaí earcaíochta.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Is é ceann de na príomhfhadhbanna a chuireann bac ar sheirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge ná nach bhfuil na daoine leis na scileanna cuí fostaithe sna hoifigí cuí. Má tá muid chun feabhas a chur air seo, caithfidh an Stáit líon na bhfostaithe Stáit atá in ann seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge a mhéadú agus a chinntiú go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag oifigigh Stáit atá ag feidhmiú i gceantair Ghaeltachta. Chuige sin, beidh sé mar chuspóir sa Bhille go mbeidh 20% de na daoine nua a earcaítear don tseirbhís phoiblí ina gcainteoirí Gaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoiblí atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh na comhlachtaí in ann freastal ar an éileamh ón bpobal ar sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Is deis iontach é seo dóibh siúd a bhfuil Gaeilge acu, ach is dúshlán an-mhór é dúinne teacht ar na daoine seo agus iad a threorú agus a spreagadh i dtreo saol ghairmiúil sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Mar chuid den obair seo, tá plé leanúnach ag dul ar aghaidh leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe agus an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí, PAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Is é an dúshlán is mó a bheidh againn ná líon leordhóthanach daoine a fháil le cur isteach ar na comórtais seo sa gcéad áit, agus go mbeidh na scileanna agus na hinniúlachtaí cuí acu le teacht tríd an gcóras earcaíochta. Beidh ról lárnach againn ar fad anseo, chun an scéal a scaipeadh go bhfuil agus go mbeidh deiseanna ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí, agus gur fiú go mór do dhaoine a bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu cur isteach ar na comórtais seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Ó thaobh na hEorpa de, bronnadh stádas iomlán mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre ar an nGaeilge san AE ón 1 Eanáir 2007. Mar aon le gach teanga, tá úsáid na Gaeilge ag leibhéal oifigiúil mar chuid lárnach de na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun chun a chinntiú go mbeidh an teanga in úsáid i measc na nglúnta atá le teacht inár ndiaidh. Sa chomhthéacs seo, ba chinneadh ríthábhachtach don Ghaeilge é deireadh a chur leis an maolú i 2022. De bharr an chinnidh seo, tá deiseanna ar fáil do chainteoirí Gaeilge san Eoraip, áit a mbeidh fostaíocht d'ard-chaighdeán ar fáil dóibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Tá dúshlán roimh na hinstitiúidí ó thaobh na hearcaíochta de, agus romhainn féin, le cinntiú go mbeidh líon leordhóthanach pearsanra le Gaeilge ar fáil chun na folúntais san Eoraip a líonadh. Tá obair shuntasach ar bun ag an Roinn chun céimithe cáilithe a chur ar fáil le freastal ar riachtanais earcaíochta an AE, áit a bhfuil thart ar 101 duine fostaithe anois sna hinstitiúidí agus iad ag plé le cúrsaí Gaeilge. Cuireann mo Roinn, i gcomhar leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna agus leis an t-Údarás um Ard-Oideachas, maoiniú ar fáil do chúrsaí ábhartha tríú leibhéal, ar mhaithe le ráta ratha i gcomórtais earcaíochta an Aontas Eorpaigh a fheabhsú agus céimithe inniúla a sholáthar d'fhostaíocht sna hinstitiúidí Eorpacha.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Tagraím do deiseanna sa teicneolaíocht. Creidim go láidir go bhfuil féidearthachtaí móra ann chun cuidiú le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge tríd an teicneolaíocht. Is cúis sásaimh agus dóchais é an chaoi go bhfuil an Ghaeilge le fáil go forleathan cheana ar na meáin dhigiteacha. Le teacht chun cinn na ré digití, tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an teicneolaíocht i ngach gné den saol, ó thaobh cumarsáide de, i gcúrsaí oibre agus sa saol sóisialta. Tá athrú ag teacht ar an gcaoi ina bhfeidhmíonn daoine ina saol laethúil agus sa chaidreamh a bhíonn acu le daoine eile agus leis an domhan mórthimpeall orthu de bharr dhul chun cinn na teicneolaíochta. Tá na meáin shóisialta ag cruthú gréasáin nua, agus tá siad lárnach i saol an aosa óig inniu.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Tá ardáin éagsúla ilmheán forbartha ag RTÉ, TG4 agus RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tá tábhacht ar leith le nuachtáin agus irisí Gaeilge, tá forbairtí móra déanta agus á ndéanamh ar chorpas na Gaeilge leis an bhfoclóir nua www.focloir.ie agus an suíomh www.tearma.ie. D'fhorbair Ollscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, DCU, córais ríomhaistriúcháin don Ghaeilge agus tá an tionscadal taighde www.abair.ie i gColáiste na Tríonóide ag déanamh tuilleadh forbartha ar córas faoinar féidir téacs scríofa a aistriú go caint bheo i gcanúintí éagsúla. Níor samhlaíodh cuid mhaith de na forbairtí seo nuair a bhí an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge á cur le chéile, agus is cinnte go mbeidh tionchar ollmhór ag an teicneolaíocht ar chúrsaí teanga, agus ar an réimse fostaíochta a bheidh ar fáil, sna blianta amach romhainn.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Tá agus beidh tuilleadh deiseanna fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge. Rinne mé ionad TechSpace Áras na nGael a sheoladh go hoifigiúil inné. Tá lán-muinín agam go mbeidh todhchaí geall ag na daoine óga atá anois ag tabhairt aghaidh ar na cúrsaí atá á gcur ar fáil. Beidh deis acu scileanna nua a fhoghlaim agus iad a chur i bhfeidhm, beidh deis acu gréasáin nua a chothú agus beidh fostaíocht ar fáil dóibh, agus iad ag feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Tá dúshlán le sárú ach is iontach na deiseanna taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus san Eoraip dóibh siúd le h-ardchumas scríofa agus labhartha sa Ghaeilge. Teastaíonn lucht labhartha Gaeilge i ngach earnáil oideachas agus leighis, san earnáil poiblí, sna meáin agus eile. Tá deiseanna ar fáil go díreach agus go h-indíreach agus caithfear na deiseanna seo a thapú. De thoradh infheistíocht leanúnach ón Státchiste, atá ag ardú de réir a chéile, is léir go bhfuil bonn láidir fís a leagtha síos atá ar leas cúrsaí fostaíochta in earnáil na Gaeilge. Caithfear a chinntiú go bhfuil an t-aos óg ach go háirithe ar an eolas faoi na féidearthachtaí fostaíochta atá ann agus tacú leo siúd na scileanna cuí a fhorbairt chun leas a bhaint as na deiseanna atá agus a bheidh ann.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_473">Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuilimid ag díriú isteach ar an gceist seo maidir le poist i nGaeilge nó in earnáil na Gaeilge. Ní thaitníonn an téarma "earnáil na Gaeilge" liom mar an rud atá i gceist ansin ná go bhfuil sí beagáinín scartha amach ó gach rud eile. An meon atá agamsa ná gur cóir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge fite fuaite i ngach uile gné den saol agus má táimid ag rá go bhfuil sí scartha amach ó shin agus go bhfuil sí eisceachtúil, fanann sí eisceachtúil. Tuigim cad atá i gceist agus tuigim an ról atá ann agus an gá le poist a chothú in earnáil na Gaeilge ach díreach ansin go bhfuilimid ag díriú ar phoist do Ghaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht atá díreach bainteach leis an nGaeilge. Tuigim sin agus caithfimid díriú ar sin chomh maith céanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Tá tuarascáil ann agus tá a fhios agam gur rinneadh plé ar an tuarascáil a rinne An Chomhairle um Thaighde in Éirinn a d'fhoilsigh an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh. Léiríonn sí sin cuibheasach simplí i slí amháin ach tá sé scanrúil, próifíl socheacnamaíocha de seacht gceantair Ghaeltachta in Éirinn. Foilsíodh sí sin anuraidh, bunaithe ar an méid a bhí sa daonáireamh ar aon chaoi ach tá sí leagtha amach os ár comhair gur féidir í a léamh cuibheasach éasca agus gur gá díriú ar na Gaeltachtaí maidir le a lán ceisteanna socheacnamaíocha ach go háirithe. Mura ndéanfaimid siúd atá sa Ghaeltacht a mhealladh fanacht ann, mura ndéanfaimid poist a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht, tá fadhb anuas ar an méid atá ann ó thaobh an Ghaeilge féin de. Tacaím leis sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Tacaím chomh maith leis an méid atá déanta thar na blianta maidir le poist a chruthú ann agus tá roinnt poist lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht timpeall na meáin Ghaeilge agus tá sé sin go maith mar is sin an áit atá an bun stór den Ghaeilge, nó an tobar. Tá tar éis éirí go hiontach le Raidió na Gaeltachta agus le TG4 sa mhéid sin agus poist a chothú agus cabhrú le Gaeilgeoirí oiliúint a fháil ar na scileanna ar ghá dóibh a bheith acu chun a bheith i mbarr a réime sna meáin cumarsáide i nGaeilge ach i mBéarla chomh maith. Ní gá ach féachaint orthu siúd atá tar éis seasamh suas a dhéanamh agus go bhfuil i mbarr a réime ó thaobh an Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla de sna meáin anseo, in RTÉ ach go háirithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Sé sin ráite, ní gá ach féachaint ar an tuarascáil ón gCoimisinéir Teanga a foilsíodh le gairid. Bhí sé os comhair an choiste linn an tseachtain seo caite ag labhairt linn faoin tuarascáil sin agus bhí seisean ag díriú isteach sa tuarascáil ar an bhfadhb agus ar an slí atá RTÉ tar éis caitheamh leis an teanga agus go bhfuil sé ag tromaíocht ar an nGaeilge toisc nach bhfuil sé ag cur cláir ar fáil agus dá mbeadh sé ag cur cláir ar fáil, dar ndóigh bheadh poist breise ann. Sin ceist shimplí. Tá agus bhí smacht ag an Stát ar an ról gur chóir go mbeadh ag Raidió na Gaeltachta so ba chóir go mbeadh muid istigh anseo ag impí ar an Aire níos mó craolacháin a dhéanamh agus dul in a luí ar bhord RTÉ i bhfad Éireann níos mó a dhéanamh agus cloí leis an dualgas bunreachtúil agus an dualgas poiblí atá aige, mar atá leagtha síos sa tuarascáil ón gCoimisinéir Teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Tá an méid a dúirt an coimisinéir díreach inniu spéisiúil mar bhí sé ag labhairt ar an bpobalbhreith iarvótála a bhí ag RTÉ agus TG4, áit a gcreideann daoine gurb iad na beartais is tábhachtaí maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ná tacú leis an nGaeloideachas, leis an nGaeltacht agus le cláir theilifíse Ghaeilge. Dúirt sé gur léirigh an phobalbhreith seo an athuair an tacaíocht i measc an phobail do chearta teanga, an tábhacht atá le cearta teanga i gcúrsaí oideachais agus craolacháin agus gur léirigh na torthaí cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé go gcomhlíonfadh RTÉ a dhualgas reachtúil maidir leis an soláthar réimse cuimsitheach de chláir Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Sa tuarascáil bhliantúil is déanaí uaidh an coimisinéir, dúirt sé go raibh 99.3% de chláir de sceideal teilifíse RTÉ i mBéarla amháin. Is scannal é sin nuair atá teanga náisiúnta againn de réir Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla go bhfuil stádas comhchéime aige sa Bhunreacht agus tá an éagóir sin á déanamh ag RTÉ ar an nGaeilge. Láithreach bonn, dá mbeadh an Ghaeilge fite fuaite i ngach rud a bhí an craoltóir náisiúnta ag déanamh, bheadh i bhfad Éireann níos mó post cruthaithe ansin agus san earnáil Ghaeilge, dá réir.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Aontaím leis an Aire Stáit sa mhéid a bhaineann leis an bpleanáil teanga maidir le húsáid na Gaeltachta. Bhí an tAire Stáit ag labhairt ag coiste roimhe seo maidir le bailte seirbhíse, go mbeidh poist ag teacht toisc go bhfuilimid ag bogadh isteach i bpleanáil teanga, an teanga agus an Ghaeltacht a tharrtháil, agus go dtiocfadh poist as sin le linn dúinn seirbhísiú a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge mar theanga, ar an gcomhphobal agus ar an gceantar Gaeltachta mar aon. Ní leor díriú isteach ar an nGaeilge. Ní dhéanfaidh an Ghaeilge an ceantar Gaeltachta a shlánú ann féin. Tá i bhfad Éireann níos mó le déanamh. Is teanga labhartha agus beo í, agus mura bhfuil obair sna ceantair seo, tarlóidh mar a tharla roimhe seo. Imeoidh daoine ar imirce agus beidh bánú sna ceantair sin. Caithfear infheistíocht a dhéanamh. Má táimid ag iarraidh an infheistíocht sin a dhéanamh, is féidir linn díriú isteach ar phoist ar féidir a dhéanamh sna ceantair sin ionas nach gá do dhaoine bogadh go dtí an chathair.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Impím ar an Aire Stáit arís cinneadh ceart tapa a dhéanamh maidir leis an leathanbhanda. Ní gá é a chur ar cháblaí ná ar a leithéid ach go mbeidh sé ar fáil i gceantair Ghaeltachta d'fhonn gur féidir le gnáthphobal na gceantar sin obair remote working, mar a ghlaoitear ar i mBéarla, a dhéanamh ansin cé go bhfuil an obair, i ndáiríre, i mBaile Átha Cliath. Is féidir obair aistriúcháin a bheith á déanamh acu nó iad a bheith ina rúnaí ar oifig atá i mBaile Átha Cliath nó ar rannóg Stáit nó dá leithéid. Is féidir leis sin a tharlú an-tapa. Leis sin, coimeádtar an pobal agus an clann sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus cuirtear leis an nGaelscolaíocht sna ceantair sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Is ceist mhór eile í an Ghaelscolaíocht. Táim den tuairim, agus bhí mé i gcónaí, gur cóir go mbeadh athrú poirt ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna maidir leis an nGaeloideachas agus gur cóir go mbeadh sí ag dul amach ag cothú éilimh toisc gur teanga náisiúnta í an Ghaeilge, seachas a bheith ag fanacht ar an éileamh agus ag déileáil leis ansin. Ní dhearna an Roinn an dara rud, is é sin níor dhéileáil sí nó níor chaith an Roinn go maith leis an éileamh sin. Ní fheicim go dtarlóidh sé sin anois. Táim ag impí ar an Aire Stáit, más féidir in aon chor, déileáil leis na héilimh, agus má tá éileamh ann do Ghaelscoil nua, go mbeadh tús áite ag an éileamh sin, toisc go bhfuil sé ag cosaint cultúr na hÉireann, seachas a bheith ag díriú isteach ar scoil Bhéarla a chothú. In aon cheantar a bhfuil scoil Bhéarla ag teacht chun cinn, tá éileamh ann do scoil lán-Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Tá sé feicthe agam timpeall na tíre thar na blianta go bhfuil éacht á dhéanamh sa Ghaelscolaíocht agus ag na múinteoirí atá ann nuair atá na cáilíochtaí teanga acu agus na nithe eile. Fiú amháin, seachas é sin, tagann páistí amach as na scoileanna sin go minic le caighdeán níos fearr ná roinnt de na scoileanna atá in aice leo. Impím ar an Aire Stáit dul sa treo sin agus iarraidh ar an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna cuidiú le tuismitheoirí agus le pobal an t-éileamh sin a chur le chéile i gceart, de réir rialacha na Roinne, mar go bhfuil dualgas breise ar an Roinn é sin a chothú. Mura dtarlaíonn é sin, beidh sé deacair orainn amach anseo. Má tá Gaeilge ag daoine, beidh sí á húsáid, agus má tá sí á húsáid, beidh lucht gnó agus Stáit ag féachaint uirthi agus ag cothú post a mbeidh bunaithe ar sin chomh maith. Is é sin an todhchaí atá ann agus tá deis againn anois má táimid dáiríre faoin nGaeilge.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_483">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis an Aire Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis labhartha faoin ábhar seo. Ní raibh mé réitithe mar gur cheap mé go mbeadh an díospóireacht ar siúl beagáinín níos déanaí agus, dá réir, bhí mé i mbun agallaimh a réiteach, ach leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh ar aon nós.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> Ní mór dom a aithint go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta san earnáil seo le blianta anuas agus go bhfuil réimse níos fairsinge fostaíochta ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí a bhfuil spéis acu dul i mbun oibre san earnáil. Tá na poist seo thar a bheith tábhachtach, ní amháin do na daoine atá ag obair iontu ach chun a thaispeáint do dhaoine óga gur féidir leo slí bheatha a bhaint amach trí Ghaeilge. Ar ndóigh, spreagann na poist seo mic léinn atá ag tosú ar an tríú leibhéal chun machnamh a dhéanamh ar ghairm bheatha le Gaeilge a roghnú dóibh féin don todhchaí. Cuimsíonn na poist in earnáil na Gaeilge an córas oideachais, na meáin chumarsáide, an earnáil phoiblí agus réimsí éagsúla na n-ealaín. Chomh maith leis sin, táimid ag súil agus tá an tAire Stáit ar an eolas go mbeidh cuspóir faoi leith ann go mbeidh 20% de líon na n-oibrithe nua sa Státseirbhís Iíofa sa Ghaeilge sa Bhille nua na dTeangacha Oifigiúla nuair a fhoilseofar é go luath, is dócha roimh dheireadh an tseisiúin seo, agus go mbeidh spriocdháta sásúil i gceist chun an Iíon fostaithe sin a bhaint amach.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Faraor géar, in ainneoin an dul chun cinn, tá laigí móra agus easnaimh le haithint fós san earnáil, go háirithe sna meáin chumarsáide. Mar shampla, Iéiríonn an tuarascáil is déanaí ón gCoimisinéir Teanga cé chomh dofheicthe agus atá an Ghaeilge ar an stáisiún náisiúnta. Go sonrach, Iuaitear sa tuarascáil:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_487">Níl sna cláir Ghaeilge a chraolann RTÉ ach níos lú ná 1% de na cláir theilifíse a chraolann sé trí chéile. Is é sin in ainneoin dualgas a bheith ar an gcraoItóir náisiúnta réimse cuimsitheach clár a chur ar fáil sa teanga sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">In ainneoin na ndualgas dlíthiúil sin atá ar RTÉ, tá teipthe go huile is go hiomlán ar an stáisiún an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tá an teip seo chomh dáiríre sin gur thug an Coimisinéir Teanga sé mhí do RTÉ chun plean feidhmithe a réiteach. Tá na sé mhí sin beagnach thart. Tá sé dona go leor nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge fheiceálach ar RTÉ, ár bpríomhchraoltóir, ach chomh maith leis sin, tá an teachtaireacht iomlán mhícheart á cur amach ó thaobh fostaíochta de ag RTÉ chuig pobal na Gaeilge. Cén chaoi is féidir oibrithe le Gaeilge a mhealladh i dtreo slí bheatha le RTÉ agus an cur i gcéill seo i gceist?</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Cinnte, caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt ar an sárú dlí seo chun a chinntiú go mbeidh áit lárnach ag an nGaeilge ar an stáisiún teilifíse náisiúnta agus chun Gaeilgeoirí óga a mhealladh chuig na meáin chumarsáide Ghaeilge. Sa chomhthéacs sin, beidh tábhacht faoi leith ag baint leis an bplean feidhmithe a bhfuil an coimisinéir ag fanacht air. Mar a dúirt mé roimhe seo, tá na sé mhí a thug an coimisinéir do RTÉ beagnach thart.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Táimid, mar an Comhchoiste Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOileán san Oireachtas, ar tí tuarascáil a fhoilsiú a bhaineann leis an ábhar seo agus leis na dúshláin a bhaineann le craoltóireacht na Gaeilge. Luaim go sonrach an taighde a rinne Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh agus Coláiste Mhuire gan Smál in Ollscoil Luimnigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I gcoitinne, bhí an bheirt taighdeoir go láidir den tuairim gur ról siombalach atá ag an nGaeilge sa chraoltóireacht agus nach bhfuil an teanga á cothú mar theanga bheo san earnáil seo. Sin an taighde neamhspleách ó Dr. John Walsh agus Dr. Rosemary Day. Taispeánann an taighde go raibh ceithre stáisiún tráchtála ann nár chraol aon ábhar Gaeilge agus ceithre stáisiún eile nach raibh ag craoladh ach míreanna gearra sa teanga. Go ginearálta, léiríonn a gcuid taighde ar úsáid na Gaeilge ar an raidió go gcraoltar 3.5 uair de Ghaeilge ag an meán ar stáisiúin raidió i gcoitinne agus go gcraoltar na huaireanta seo ag amanna lasmuigh de na buaicamanna, cuid acu i lár na hoíche. Is fiú don Aire Stáit agus don Roinn an taighde sin a léamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> Ní luann siad an taighde sin ná an Bille atá geallta. Is easnamh mór é sin. Cuirim fáilte roimh an rud a thug an tAire Stáit dúinn ach tá sé suntasach nach bhfuil an Bille luaite ann. Sa Bhille sin níl muid ag caint ach faoi bhunchearta leithéidí an ceart ár gcuid ainmneacha agus síntí fada a úsáid. Is bunchearta iad sin. Ní luann an tAire Stáit an tuarascáil ón gCoimisinéir Teanga. Ní mór dó beart a dhéanamh de réir briathar agus Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a fhoilsiú gan tuilleadh moille. Tugadh gealltanas dúinn go mbeadh sé foilsithe anuraidh, roimh an samhradh agus ansin roimh an Nollaig, ach níor foilsíodh é. Ansin tháinig an tAire Stáit ar ais agus thug sé an Breatimeacht mar leithscéal. Thuig mé é sin. Cuireadh ar an méar fhada arís é. Le déanaí deimhníodh go raibh sé ar an gclár oibre don seisiún seo ach fós níl tásc ná tuairisc ar an mBille. An féidir leis an Aire Stáit a rá anocht an dáta a bhfoilseofar an Bille?</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> Chomh maith leis sin, mar Chathaoirleach ar Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOileán, bhí de phribhléid agam agus ag baill den choiste taistil ar fud na tíre ó Ghaeltacht go Gaeltacht. Tháinig na téamaí ceannann céanna suas arís agus arís. Tá obair na gcapall á déanamh ag na coistí deonacha ar an talamh ar bhuiséid shrianta. Tá sé sin ar eolas ag an Aire Stáit. Tá obair na gcapall á déanamh ag na comharchumainn ar airgead srianta freisin. Má tá an Rialtas i ndáiríre faoi earnáil na Gaeilge, ní mór dúinn airgead cuí a chur ar fáil do na coistí deonacha agus do na comharchumainn ar an talamh ionas go mbeidh siad in ann leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair atá á déanamh acu. Sin mo chéad phointe.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Is é mo dhara phointe ná, má tá muid i ndáiríre faoi earnáil na Gaeilge, ní mór don Rialtas an ghéarchéim a aithint. Tá géarchéim ann ó thaobh na Gaeilge in ainneoin an dul chun cinn atá déanta. Tá géarchéim sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá a fhios againn é sin. Tá laghdú suntasach ar líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge. Tá sé sin soiléir ón taighde atá déanta ag lucht acadúla ar easpa Gaeilge ar na meáin chumarsáide agus ar dhul siar na Gaeilge. Ní mór dúinn é sin a aithint. Ní féidir dul i ngleic le fadhb gan an fhadhb a aithint i dtús báire agus ansin plean a réiteach agus acmhainní cuí a chur ar fáil. Tá ardmholadh tuillte ag cosmhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ag na daoine ar an talamh ar fud na tíre atá i mbun oibre leanúnach ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ach tá gá le plean cuimsitheach ón Rialtas. Tá an straitéis 20 bliain agus an plean gníomhaíochta againn, ach in ainneoin sin, tá géarchéim fós againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Mar a dúirt mé, fáiltím roimh an deis chúpla focal a rá sa Dáil ar an ábhar seo, ach ní mór dúinn, mar Dháil, agus don Rialtas beart a dhéanamh de réir briathar agus a chur in iúl go bhfuil muid i ndáiríre fostaíocht a chothú sna Gaeltachtaí toisc go bhfuil fostaíocht agus an Ghaeilge fite fuaite le chéile. Gan é sin agus an ghéarchéim a aithint, beimid anseo arís i gceann cúpla mí ag rá an rud ceannann céanna.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_496">Tá brón orm nach raibh mé ann níos luaithe. Cheap mé go raibh an díospóireacht seo ann ar ball. Fáiltím roimh an seans ráiteas agus plé a dhéanamh ar an ábhar seo. Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh agus an Teachta Connolly agus aontaím go mór leis an méid a bhí le rá acu faoi chúrsaí sna meáin chumarsáide agus faoi chúrsaí in RTÉ ach go háirithe. D'aithin an Coimisinéir Teanga an fhadhb atá ann ach níl éinne ag déanamh aon rud faoi. Agus coimisinéir ann a bhfuil cumhachtaí aige, tá sé tábhachtach go ndéanfaimis rudaí nuair a léiríonn sé go bhfuil fadhb ann maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge ar na stáisiúin teilifíse agus raidió is mó sa tír. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit ag an Nollaig agus é ag ceannach madra, ní don Nollaig amháin madra. Ní do TG4 agus do Raidió na Gaeltachta amháin cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta. Sin a cheapann RTÉ ag an nóiméad seo. Tá an smaoineamh sin ag déanamh dochair do na deiseanna atá ann le haghaidh fostaíochta in earnáil na teanga Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Tá mórán suime ann i gcúrsaí Gaeilge nach raibh ann cheana. Feictear é sin sa tsuim atá ag daoine i nGaelscoileanna ag leibhéal na bunscoile agus na meánscoile agus sa tsuim atá ag daoine sa Ghaeilge ag an tríú agus an cheathrú leibhéal. Beidh mórán deiseanna ag teacht suas agus athruithe á ndéanamh don derogation maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge san Eoraip. Beidh deiseanna ann d'aistritheoirí agus do dhaoine gur mian leo Gaeilge a úsáid chun obair san Eoraip. Beidh obair le fáil le comhlachtaí a bhfuil suim acu i gcúrsaí Eorpacha nó a bhfuil baint acu leo.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> Braitheann sé sin ar a lán rudaí, go háirithe ar na cúrsaí réigiúnacha atá á bplé againn. Rinne an coiste a bhfuil mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó Cuív agus an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, baill dó agus a bhfuil Teachta Connolly mar Chathaoirleach air tuarascáil iontach faoi eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta. Bhí maidin iontach agus suimiúil againn i gCeathrú Thaidhg cúpla mí ó shin. Phléigh muid na deiseanna atá ann le daoine Gaeltachta. Bhí siad ag rá go raibh a lán deiseanna agus a lán suime ann. Bhí suim ann i ndeiseanna oideachais, go háirithe le haghaidh daoine fásta a bhfuil suim acu Gaeilge níos fearr a bheith acu nó Gaeilge a fhoghlaim. Ba chóir go mbeidh airgead ann chun dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus am a chaitheamh ann fiú taobh amuigh de chúrsaí samhraidh sa gheimhreadh nó sna hamanna ciúine. Dá mbeadh seans agus cuidiú ag daoine é sin a dhéanamh, bheadh deis ann sna Gaeltachtaí scoileanna i gcomhair na gcúrsaí sin a bhunú.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Maidir le cúrsaí údaráis, tá Gteic iontach. Tugann sé deiseanna do na ceantair Ghaeltachta nach raibh ann cheana. Tá daoine ann a bhfuil suim acu dul abhaile chuig na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus leanúint ag obair le haghaidh comhlachtaí atá lonnaithe, mar shampla, anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath. Dá mbeadh leathanbhanda i bhfad níos fearr ná mar atá sé, bheadh na deiseanna sin ann. Thiocfadh deiseanna fostaíochta agus deiseanna don Ghaeilge as freisin. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an plean leathanbhanda ar siúl ach is díospóireacht eile é sin. Dá mbrúfadh an tAire Stáit chun go mbeidh na ceantair Ghaeltachta ag tús an queue chun leathanbhanda iontach a fháil as an scéim seo, cibé comhlacht a fheidhmeoidh é, thiocfadh a lán deiseanna as sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Tá a lán rudaí eile ann ach caithfidh an tAire Stáit rud éigin a dhéanamh maidir le cúrsaí údaráis. Tá a fhios agam go ndeir an tAire Stáit go bhfuil airgead breise ag dul chuige gach lá a phléann muid an t-údarás. Tá, ach tá sé an-bheag.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Más rogha é an Údarás go mbeadh an seans agus an t-airgead acu is atá ag LEADER, nach bhfuil á chaitheamh acu - beidh i bhfad níos mó deiseanna sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Is fiú don Aire fadhb an underspend atá le cúrsaí LEADER a phlé leis an Aire Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail, an Teachta Ring. An bhfuilimid chun dul go dtí deireadh an chláir LEADER seo le underspend nuair atá an tÚdarás ag iarradh airgead a chaitheamh? Tá a lán suime agus ideas ag daoine ach níl airgead ag an Údarás chun caitheamh orthu. Caithfear comhoibriú leis an Aire Forbartha, Tuaithe agus Pobail chun an t-airgead nach bhfuil sé á chaitheamh, a chaitheamh ar chúrsaí agus deiseanna Gaeilge i ngach chuid den tír, ach go háirithe sna ceantair Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> Tá béim agus suim in oideachas na Gaeilge ann, ach cad atá muid ag déanamh chun an suim seo a choimeád? Nuair a fhágann daoine an bhunscoil chun dul go dtí an mheánscoil, níl an Rialtas ag tabhairt deiseanna do na meánscoileanna, agus tá sé sin léirithe sa bpobalbhreith LAG sin. Bhí rudaí maithe ann freisin, áfach. Tá suim ag meánscoileanna sa Ghaeilge agus caithfidh an tAire Stáit a bheith i bhfad níos láidre, mar Aire atá freagrach as na Gaeltachtaí, ag cur brú ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna chun patronage a thabhairt do na gaelscoileanna sin. Sa tslí sin, tar éis na hArdteiste beidh suim ag daoine dul ar aghaidh chun Gaeilge a úsáid agus poist a fháil a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge. Tá an taithí bunscoile agus meánscoile sin acu, agus ba cheart go mbainfeadh siad úsáid as agus go ndéanfadh siad iarracht Gaeilge a bheith mar phríomh-theanga sa tír. Beidh daoine ann le Gaeilge mar phríomh-theanga agus deiseanna gnó agus deiseanna airgid acu. Tuigeann gach gnó cúrsaí airgid. Má úsáideann daoine Gaeilge, beidh gnóthaí ag déanamh deiseanna le haghaidh sin, ach caithfidh an tAire Stáit brú a chur ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna chun é sin a thuiscint agus na deiseanna sin a thabhairt do dhaoine a bheidh ag fáil oideachais trí chúrsaí Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Tá plé déanta againn freisin faoi chúrsaí réigiúnacha, mar chúrsaí bóithre agus cúrsaí eile atá muid ag plé agus ag troid mar gheall orthu le na míonna sna toghcháin áitiúla. Is as Gaeltacht é an tAire Stáit, mar sin tuigeann sé an brú atá sna cúrsaí Gaeilge ag na nóiméad seo. Mar Aire a bhfuil freagrach as an nGaeltacht, caithfidh sé brú a chur ar an Aire Iompar, Turasóireachta agus Spóirt. Ní cheapaim go bhfuil aon suim ag an Aire sin i gcúrsaí iompair. Ceapaim nach dtuigeann sé go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí ann ach an oiread. Maidir le Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin, tá i bhfad níos mó daoine ag baint úsáide as bóithre agus rudaí eile sna ceantair Ghaeilge, ach níl aon airgead breise tugtha do chomhairlí chontaetha Mhaigh Eo, Gaillimh, nó an Chláir chun airgead a chaitheamh mar gheall go bhfuil na deiseanna sin ann. Níl aon airgead breise á caitheamh ar na bóithre nó ar rudaí chun cuidiú le daoine atá ag taisteal chun úsáid a bhaint as an gceantar seo. Má chaitear an t-airgead sin, agus má oibríonn an tAire Stáit leis an Aire Iompar, Turasóireachta agus Spóirt agus leis an Aire Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail, beidh deiseanna fostaíochta ann, chomh maith le deiseanna do dhaoine gnóthaí a bhunú a bhaineann úsáid as an teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I ngach díospóireacht sa Teach seo, cibé ábhar atá i gceist, bíonn sé soiléir go bhfuil silo i ngach Roinn agus nach n-oibríonn na ranna le chéile. Chun na cúrsaí agus na deiseanna seo ó thaobh fostaíocht i gcúrsaí Gaeilge a bhaint amach, caithfidh an tAire Stáit, mar Aire atá freagrach as an nGaeltacht, obriú le gach Aire, an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna agus an tAire Talmhaíochta, Bia agus Mara ina measc, agus plean a chur le chéile. Ní chaithfidh Aire gach Roinn oibriú go neamhspleách. Caithfidh gach Aire oibriú le chéile agus saghas action plan a chruthú, má tá siad sásta teideal a chur air. Caithfidh an plean seo oibriú, agus gan spin amháin a bheith i gceist leis.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_505">Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an ábhar seo. Má bhreathnaíonn muid ar an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge, ar an gcéad dul síos is léir gur straitéis Rialtais é, agus nach straitéis é d'aon Roinn Stáit amháin. An dara rud ná go raibh aidhm an-simplí ag an straitéis, agus sin pobal labhartha Gaeilge a chothú. ‘Sé sin, go mbeadh go leor daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil sa tír, le h-ais mar atá i láthair na huaire. Tá thart ar 80,000 duine a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge go laethúil sa tír seo. Bhí sprioc uaillmhianach againn, ach chreid muid dá gcuirfí chuige i gceart, go bhféadfaí é sin a thabhairt suas go 250,000. Ag an deireadh seachtaine rinne TG4 pobalbhreith ar dhaoine ag fágáil na stáisiúin vótála, agus léirigh sé sin gurb iad an dream is óige sa tír is báúil don Ghaeilge. Is as an ngrúpa sin a thiocfaidh fás na Gaeilge, agus mar sin, tá tuair áirithe dóchais ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> An t-ábhar atá muid á phlé ná cruthú fostaíochta, ach ní féidir fostaíocht a chruthú mura bhfuil éileamh ann. Chomh maith leis sin, ní féidir fostaíocht a chruthú mura bhfuil daoine ann le Gaeilge chun glacadh leis na poist a chruthaítear. I láthair na huaire tá fáinne fí ann. Is é sin le rá, mar shampla, go dtuigimid go mbeidh Gaeilge ag daoine sa todhchaí, go mór mór taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, agus go dteastaíonn gaelscoileanna agus ard-mhúineadh na Gaeilge i scoileanna atá ag múineadh trí Bhéarla. Tá ganntanas múinteoirí i ngach ábhar agus múinteoirí bunscoile le togha na Gaeilge le dul ag múineadh sna scoileanna. Mar sin, tá an t-éileamh ann, ach níl an soláthar ann. Bhí mé ag breathnú ar fhigiúirí maidir le daoine a chur isteach ar na poist Ghaeilge taobh istigh den Gharda Síochána, agus tá an rud ceánna le feiceáil ansin. Lena gceart a thabhairt dó, rinne siad an rud praiticiúil. Nuair a bhíonn sé ag earcú anois, glacann siad le daoine le Gaeilge agus tá acmhainn faoi leith ann dóibh sin. Arís, bhí sé díomách an méid beag daoine a chur isteach ar na h-áiteanna sin, agus mar sin, caithfimid breathnú amach don soláthar. Tá dhá rud i gceist ansin. An chéad rud ná go mbeidh Gaeilge ag daoine ar an gcéad dul síos, agus an dara rud ná go mbeidh fógraíocht agus bolscaireacht déanta go bhfuil na poist ar fáil agus go mbeadh siad ar fáil, mar nuair atá daoine óga ag fágáil an scoil, caithfidh siad tuiscint go bhfuil deiseanna ann ó thaobh fostaíochta Gaeilge de.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Ceann de na rudaí nach bhfuil a fhios againn, a bhí mé ag plé an rud seo le Coláiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh le gairid, ná cén éileamh ar phoist atá ann chun mianta an Rialtais agus mianta na straitéise 20 bliain a chomhlíonadh. Mar shampla, níl aon tuairim againn cé mhéad urlabhraithe cainte, dochtúr, nó altra le Gaeilge atá ag teastáil, agus aon duine atá sa Ghaeltacht anois, tuigfidh siad nach féidir altraí nó dochtúir le Gaeilge a fháil, cé go mbíodh muid in ann iad a fáil cheana. Níl a fhios againn cé mhéad duine a bheidh ag teastáil sna meáin amach anseo, nó daoine a bheidh ag plé le cúrsaí cumarsáide go ginearálta, agus mar sin de. Mar sin, tá sé in am dúinn aithint cé mhéad duine a theastóidh uainn, cé mhéad duine atá á oiliúint i láthair na huaire, agus céard a theastaíonn ó thaobh oiliúnaí de.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Is fiú cinnte a dhéanamh de go bhfuil cúrsaí oiliúna ollscoileanna trí mheán na Gaeilge. Tá faitíos orm go bhfuil muid tar éis dul siar go mór le h-ocht nó naoi de bhlianta ó thaobh cúrsaí trí Ghaeilge agus daoine ag freastal ar chúrsaí trí Ghaeilge ar an tríú leibhéal. Ní amháin go gcaithfear daoine a oiliúint trí Ghaeilge, ach chomh maith leis sin caithfimid cinntiú ó thaobh iad siúd a dhéanann staidéar ar leigheas, tréidliacht, altranas, traenáil sna meáin cumarsáide mar dhaoine a bhíonn ag obair le ceamaraí, léiritheoirí agus mar sin de – na daoine seo ar fad - mura bhfuil siad ag déanamh a gcúrsaí trí Ghaeilge, go bhfuil deis acu an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim go leibhéal ar a mbeidh siad in ann oibriú trí Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> Rud eile a chreid mé i gcónaí go gcaithfear a dhéanamh ná teastasú a chur ar bun.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Má tá post fógartha mar phost ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge riachtanach, ba cheart go ndéanfaí teastasú neamhspleách ar an bhfostóir. Má théimse ag tiomáint leoraí, níl aon mhaith don fhostóir a rá go gcreideann sé go bhfuilim in ann leoraí a thiomáint gan teastas ón dream neamhspleách a eisíonn teastais tiomána a lorg uaim. Sa chás sin, déarfaidh an fostóir nach bhfuilim in ann an jab a fháil gan an teastas sin a bheith agam. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé seo riachtanach. Nuair a bhí an brú ann san am atá caite, dúradh rómhinic go bhfoghlaimeodh na hoifigigh an Ghaeilge arís. Níl sé sin sách maith. Má tá sé mar choinníoll do phost áirithe go mbeadh cáilíocht ag an iarrthóir, ba cheart go mbeadh sé aige nó aici. Ní ceart é a fhágáil don fhostóir amháin. Is féidir úsáid a bhaint as na caighdeáin Eorpacha do theangacha atá leagtha amach anois. Teastaíonn caighdeáin níos airde ná a chéile i gcás poist áirithe. Mar shampla, tá ard-ardchaighdeán ag teastáil i gcás aistritheoir. B'fhéidir nach mbeadh leibhéal an aistritheora ag teastáil i gcás cléireach oifige, ach bheadh leibhéal an-ard fós ag teastáil. Caithfimid é sin a dhéanamh má táimid dáiríre faoi seo agus má táimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh buntáiste ann. Ar an ttaobh eile den scéal, ba cheart go mbeadh caighdeáin i gceist.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> Má dhéantar na rudaí seo ar fad, agus má chuirtear na seirbhísí ar fáil, creidim go mbeidh an t-éileamh ann. Mar is eol dúinn cheana féin i go leor réimsí, dá mbeadh an tseirbhís ar fáil, bheadh an t-éileamh ann. Is féidir cás na mbunmhúinteoirí a thuiscint go simplí. Tá go leor de phobal na Gaeilge ag dul go dtí teiripeoirí cainte le Béarla mar nach bhfuil aon rogha eile acu. Glacann siad leis nach bhfuil a mhalairt ar fáil. Tá sé tugtha faoi deara agam thar blianta fada, agus mé ag tabhairt seirbhís trí Ghaeilge do dhaoine, go ndéanann siad a gcuid gnó trí Ghaeilge nuair a thagann siad go dtí Gaeilgeoir. Má cheapann siad nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag an duine, déanann siad a gcuid gnó leis nó léi trí Bhéarla mar go mbíonn Béarla acu. Ar an gcaoi sin, seachas fáinne fí a bheith ann, d'fhéadfadh fáinne dóchais a bheith ann go bhfuil an rud ar fad ag láidriú. Tarlóidh sé seo de réir mar a fheiceann daoine go bhfuil buntáistí ag baint leis an nGaeilge. B'iad na buntáistí eacnamaíochta a bhí ag baint leis an mBéarla a chuir an teanga sin chun tosaigh an chéad lá riamh. Ní ceart go mbeadh aon dul amú orainn sa chomhthéacs sin. A thúisce agus go bhfeicfidh daoine go bhfuil buntáistí ag baint leis an nGaeilge, bogfaidh siad i dtreo na teanga. Cuirfidh siad a gcuid gasúir ag na Gaelscoileanna, mar atá go leor daoine ag déanamh faoi láthair. Dé réir mar a tharlaíonn na rudaí seo, méadóidh an t-éileamh ar an bhfostaíocht. Sa chás sin, bheadh an rud ag dul ar aghaidh go láidir seachas bheith ag dul ar chúl.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Thar aon rud eile i láthair na huaire, creidim gur cheart dúinn leagan síos i dtaobh jabanna áirithe - an mhúinteoireacht, mar shampla - cén caighdeán a chaithfidh a bheith ag daoine chun riachtanais na jabanna seo a chomhlíonadh. Chomh maith leis sin, caithfimid bolscaireacht a thabhairt do dhaoine óga agus iad ag déanamh roghanna sna scoileanna céard a dhéanfaidh siad tar éis na scoile. Ba cheart dúinn béim a chur ar na buntáistí móra atá i gceist le bheith dátheangach. Mar shampla, osclaíonn an dátheangachas deiseanna fostaíochta sa Stát nach bhfuil ar fáil don dream atá aonteangach. Ina theannta sin, is buntáiste é don dream atá ag iarraidh dul go dtí an Bhruiséil bheith trítheangach, ceithretheangach nó cúigtheangach. Ba cheart dúinn tuilleadh bolscaireachta a thabhairt nuair atá na seirbhísí seo ar fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> D'fhéadfainn go leor eile a rá ar an ábhar seo, ach níl ach nóiméad fágtha agam. Caithfimid cur ina luí ar dhaoine nár cheart smaoineamh ar dhuine gan Gaeilge a chur siar go Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige, mar a tharla i gcaitheamh an deireadh seachtaine nuair a d'iarr duine a bhí i mbun pobalbhreithe ar an bpobal cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an Ghaeilge, ach cuireadh na ceisteanna i mBéarla amháin. Ní ceart go nglacfadh RTÉ nó TG4 le sin. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé mar chaighdeán ag Red C, nó aon chomhlacht atá ag cur fostaí go dtí an Ghaeltacht go sonrach, nach smaoineofaí ar dhuine gan an teanga phobail a chur i láthair. Sa chás seo, bhí suirbhé á dhéanamh ar bhosca amháin Gaeltachta. Má dhéanaimid na rudaí sin ar fad, tiocfaidh forbairt agus fás ollmhór ar fhostaíocht na Gaeilge. Má tharlaíonn sé sin, méadóidh an spéis sa Ghaeilge agus sroichfimid an pobal 250,000. Nuair a bheidh sé sin bainte amach, ní bheidh orainn bheith ag caint ar an nGaeilge riamh go deo istigh sa Teach seo. Fásfaidh sé ó shin. Nuair a shroichfear an 250,000 duine, beidh pobal inmharthana againn agus mairfidh an Ghaeilge ós rud é go mbeidh an pobal sách foirfe chun é féin a chur chun cinn.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aindrias Moynihan<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_514">Ba mhaith liom díriú isteach ar cúpla ábhar faoi leith. Tuigim go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo dírithe ar fhostaíocht maidir le cúrsaí Gaolainne, seachas fostaíocht go ginearálta. Labhair mé cheana faoin reachtaíocht nua i gcomhthéacs an stádais atá ag an nGaolainn in Éirinn agus san Eoraip. Tá Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOileán tar éis an-chuid plé a dhéanamh le rannóga éagsúla le roinnt míonna anuas, ag féachaint ar cé chomh gníomhach is atá siad agus iad ag freastal ar mhuintir na Gaolainne agus freisin ar an bplean atá acu chun fás agus forbairt a chuir ar a gcuid fostaíochta Gaolainne. Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil easpa mhór ann. Tá bearnaí i go leor áiteanna. In áiteanna eile, tá feabhas tagtha agus tá cúrsaí go maith. Is cosúil nach mbíonn an t-éileamh ann, ach tá sé deacair an t-éileamh a thomhas. Nuair a théann daoine i dteagmháil leis na rannóga éagsúla, go minic bíonn sé níos tapúla orthu a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Bhéarla seachas bheith ag feitheamh leis an duine a bheadh ag glaoch orthu an lá dár gcionn. Dá mbeadh níos mó oifigigh sna rannóga éagsúla ábalta freastal ar Ghaeilgeoirí, bhainfí níos mó úsáide as seirbhísí Gaolainne agus bheadh an t-éileamh níos soiléire.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Mhol an choiste i gcomhthéacs an Bhille go mbeadh an Ghaolainn ag 20% de na daoine nua atá á tabhairt isteach sna rannóga éagsúla ionas go mbeidís ábalta freastal ar mhuintir na Gaolainne. Tuigim go bhfuil plé fós á dhéanamh ar an mBille sin. Tá sé á phlé in Oifig an Ard-Aighne le fada an lá. B'fhéidir go bhfuil deis fostaíochta ansin. B'fhéidir gur cheart cúpla duine breise a lonnú san oifig sin chun an próiseas a bhrostú ar aghaidh. Tá an reachtaíocht sáite san oifig sin i bhfad rófhada. Táimid ag iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit deifir a dhéanamh leis an mBille sin gan a thuilleadh moille. Ba cheart dó díriú isteach ar an éileamh ón gcoiste go mbeadh sé mar sprioc ag an Rialtas go mbeadh an Ghaolainn ag 20% de na daoine nua atá á fhostú agus go mbeidís ábalta freastal ar mhuintir na Gaolainne.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Luadh an córas oideachais cheana féin. Tá sé riachtanach go dtógaimid ar an gcéim dhearfach a bhí sa straitéis oideachais Gaolainne agus Gaeltachta. Ní leor straitéis a bheith ann. Ba cheart dúinn brostú ar aghaidh agus a chinntiú go mbeidh soláthar múinteoirí ar fáil. Ba cheart go mbeadh na háiseanna éagsúla ar fad ar fáil do na scoileanna agus do phobal na scoile, go háirithe na daltaí. Caithfidh an tAire Stáit a chinntiú go bhfuil múinteoirí ar fáil. Ba cheart go mbeadh cúrsaí ar fáil chun oiliúint a dhéanamh ar na múinteoirí sna hábhair éagsúla ar fad, ina measc an eolaíocht agus an ealaín, ionas go mbeidh daltaí in ann múinteoir le Gaolainn a bheith acu sna hábhair sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Ba mhaith liom deacracht eile maidir leis an gcóras oideachais a lua. Tá ceist na pátrúnachta luaite agam leis an Aire Stáit cheana. Tá borradh tagtha ar chúrsaí Gaolainne in áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht - san ardchathair agus in áiteanna eile chomh maith. Teastaíonn ó dhaoine Gaelscoileanna a bhunú, ach nuair a thagann sé chuig pátrúnacht agus scoil nua á bhunú, tá deacracht faoi leith ag Gaelscoileanna. Bíonn siad in iomaíocht le scoileanna a bhíonn ag déanamh a gcuid gnó trí Bhéarla. Tá sé an-deacair orthu, fiú má tá 30% ag iarraidh go mbeidh Gaelscolaíocht sa cheantar. Bíonn siad faoi bhrú agus ní éiríonn leo Gaelscoil a bhaint amach. Ba cheart athbhreithniú a dhéanamh air sin. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit an t-ábhar seo a phlé leis an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna. Tuigim go bhfuil an ról ceannaireachta ag an Aire, an Teachta McHugh, sa chomhthéacs seo, ach tá ról fíorthábhachtach ag Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Is cuid den straitéis 20 bliain freisin a chinntiú go mbeidh deis ann ag aon phobal Gaolainne a scoil féin a bheith aige agus go mbeidh sé ábalta pátrúnacht na scoile a bhaint amach. Phléamar deiseanna fostaíochta leis an HSE, go háirithe i leith Gaeilgeoirí laistigh den chóras a theastaíonn uathu bogadh mórthimpeall nó forbairt agus dul chun cinn chun ardú céime a bhaint amach. Ní theastaíonn uathu a bheith pigeon-holed mar an Gaeilgeoir a fhreastalaíonn ar an bhfón an t-am ar fad. Teastaíonn uathu go mbeidh deiseanna ann. Ní theastaíonn uathu a bheith srianta. Caithfear a chinntiú go mbeidh go leor daoine sna rannóga éagsúla. Anuas air sin, feictear nach bhfuil an HSE ag tabhairt na Ghaolainne san áireamh mar cheann de na príomhspriocanna nó príomhábhair nuair a bhíonn sé ag aistriú daoine - altraí, cléirigh agus a leithéid - cuir i gcás má tá post le líonadh i gceantar Gaeltachta. Tá argóint ann. An bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí duine a aistriú ó north Lee go south Lee nó Gaeilgeoir a chur ar fáil chun freastal ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta? Caithfear a chinntiú go mbeidh an Ghaolainn mar cheann de na hábhair mhóra agus nach argóint laistigh den chóras féin é conas a dhéanann sé fostaíochta a láimhseáil. Ba chóir go mbeidh an pobal níos tábhachtaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> Is ceann de na hábhair eile gur mhaith liom é a lua ná aitheantas don Ghaolainn san Aontas Eorpach. Ba chéim mhór chun cinn é sin do mo pháirtí féin, a lorg an chéim chun cinn seo roinnt blianta ó shin. Is maith an rud é go bhfuil muid beagnach tar éis é sin a bhaint amach agus go bhfuil an maolú nó díolúnas a bhí ann á chur i leataobh faoi dheireadh. Tá deiseanna fostaíochta ann dóibh siúd a bheidh á lorg amach anseo. Is céim mhór chun cinn é go bhfuil sé sin tagtha chun cinn. Níl an fhostaíocht amháin tábhachtach, ach an t-aitheantas a sheasann leis. Tá an Ghaeilge amuigh ann ar chomhchéim le na teangacha Eorpacha eile. Léiríonn sé sin ráiteas muiníneach agus láidir. Ba chóir go dtabharfadh sé breis muiníne do mhuintir na Gaeilge a gcearta a lorg agus a chinntiú nuair a théann siad i dteagmháil leis an Aontas Eorpach nó le Ranna Stáit anseo agus go mbeidh na heagraíochtaí sin ábalta freastal orthu trí Ghaolainn. Má tá Gaeilgeoir ag íoc cánach agus duine gan Ghaolainn ag íoc cánach, tá an dá euro mar an gcéanna nuair a thagann siad isteach sa státchóras. Tá siad ar chomhionann agus ar chomhchéim. Ba chóir go mbeadh gach saoránach ábalta a bheith ag súil go mbeidh an Státchóras ag freastal air nó uirthi ar chomhchéim.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Sin iad na príomhphointí a theastaíonn uaim a chinntiú: stádas na Gaolainne san Aontas Eorpach, agus an deis atá ag an Aire Stáit a chinntiú go bhfuil an státchóras anseo ag feidhmiú agus ag freastal ar mhuintir na Gaolainne. Caithfidh an tAire Stáit díriú isteach ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna chun a chinntiú go mbeidh na ceisteanna faoi phátrúnacht scoile agus faoin nGaelscolaíocht réitithe, go háirithe toisc go bhfuil pátrúnacht scoileanna nua fós le tabhairt amach. Ní chóir go mbeidh a thuilleadh moille ansin. Ba chóir go mbeidh múinteoirí sna hábhair éagsúla ar fáil ar fud na tíre chun a chinntiú go mbeidh deis ag glúin nua Gaeilgeoirí oideachas a fháil trí Ghaeilge.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">Gabhaím buíochas do na Teachtaí go léir as ucht a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht seo. Aontaím leis an gcuid is mó de na smaointe a tháinig amach ón díospóireacht. Labhair an Teachta Ó Snodaigh faoin tuarascáil ón Seanadóir Pádraig Ó Céidigh ó thaobh fostaíochta. Tá an tÚdarás ag díriú ar chúrsaí fostaíochta sna ceantair seo. Cruthaíodh 122 post breise in 2018. Maidir leis an tuarascáil ón gCoimisinéir Teanga a luaigh an Teachta Calleary agus an Teachta Connolly, tuigim go bhfuil an coimisinéir ag fanacht ar phlean nó freagra ó RTÉ maidir leis an laghad Gaeilge a bhíonn ar a chuid stáisiún. Táimid ag súil leis sin a fheiceáil agus go dtagadh toradh dearfach amach as. Tá grúpcheannasaí Gaeilge nua ceaptha ag RTÉ agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sí ag breathnú ar na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an coimisinéir. Níl a fhios agam an raibh deis aici fós cúrsaí a phlé leis an gcomhchoiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Labhair an Teachta Calleary faoi remote working freisin. Tá an ceart aige ó thaobh deiseanna fostaíochta le remote working. Tá an-dul chun cinn á dhéanamh. Luaigh an Teachta Calleary Gteic agus an obair atá an tÚdarás á déanamh agus na deiseanna atá sé ag cruthú. Tá a fhios againn go léir an plean atá ag an Rialtas ó thaobh leathanbhanda agus an costas de €3 billiún a ghabhann leis. Bíonn daoine ag tabhairt amach faoi. Nuair a bhí mise i gceannas air bhí daoine i gcuid de na cathracha agus na bailte móra ag tabhairt amach faoin gcostas agus ag rá nach bhfuil sé ag teastáil. Tá a fhios ag daoine faoin tuath go dteastaíonn leathanbhanda. Tá ar an Rialtas agus ar an Stát airgead a chaitheamh chun na seirbhísí seo a chur ar fáil. </p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Ó thaobh an Ghaeloideachais, tá éacht déanta ag an earnáil. Caithfimid oibriú leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ar mhaithe le hoideachas trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Connolly i leith daltaí scoile a spreagadh. Chuige sin, tá mo Roinn ag maoiniú seó bóthair le Conradh na Gaeilge le cúpla bliain anuas. Téann sé go scoileanna dara leibhéal agus coláiste samhraidh timpeall na tíre chun na scoláirí a chur ar an eolas faoi na deiseanna a bhaineann leis an teanga. </p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Maidir le craoltóireacht trí Ghaeilge, tá mo Roinn ag maoiniú Raidió Rí-Rá le deich mbliana anuas. Tá dúshlán ann cinnte ach tá sé seo ardaithe ag an gCoimisinéir Teanga. Ó thaobh an Achta teanga, tá oifigí mo Roinne fós ag obair ar an mBille sin. Tá dul chun cinn suntasach air. Tá an plean gníomhaíochta a seoladh anuraidh ag tabhairt clár oibre dúinn don tréimhse suas go 2022 a dhéanfaidh cúram don teanga agus don Ghaeltacht. Tá cúrsaí fostaíochta mar chuid lárnach sa phlean sin. Luaigh an Teachta Calleary RTÉ - ceist atá freagartha agam - agus Gteic. </p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Ó thaobh deiseanna san Eoraip, beidh níos mó deiseanna ag daoine obair sa bhaile mar shaor-aistritheoirí - freelancers - d'institiúidí na hEorpa sna blianta amach romhainn. Tá an obair sin ag dul ar aghaidh. Ó thaobh cúrsaí réigiúnda, tuigim na deacrachtaí ó thaobh bóithre agus mar sin de sna ceantair tuaithe. Is iontach na deiseanna atá ceangailte le Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin ach cruthaíonn an méadú ar na huimhreacha turasóirí deacrachtaí freisin. Caithfimid aghaidh a thabhairt orthu sin. </p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuív gur cúis dóchais iad torthaí na pobalbhreithe, go háirithe ó thaobh meon an phobail i dtaobh na teanga. Caithfimid tógáil air sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh a leithéid déanta maidir le Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Aontaím leis sin. Arís, táimid ag maoiniú an seó bóthair trí Chonradh na Gaeilge. Táimid ag obair le PAS faoi láthair maidir le staidéar a dhéanamh ar chomórtais earcaíochta le cúpla bliain anuas chun chur le fostaíocht le Gaeilge. Ó thaobh teastais, táimid tar éis comórtas do phríomhoifigeach cúnta a reáchtáil sa Roinn agus bhí ar na hiarrthóirí scrúduithe Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge, TEG, a reáchtálfar i gcomhair le hOllscoil Mhá Nuad, a dhéanamh. Táimid ag breathnú ar na féidearthachtaí maidir leis an gcóras seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Beidh sé sin á phlé againn nuair a bheidh an Bille ag dul trí Thithe an Oireachtais freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Maidir leis an Teachta Ó Muineacháin, tuigimid na fadhbanna maidir le héileamh agus tá sé i gceist go mbeidh an tairiscint ghnímh mar chuid den Bhille teanga do dhaoine a chuireann fáilte roimh an teanga i gcomhlachtaí poiblí.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Ó thaobh cúrsaí oideachais, tá scéim nua oideachais Erasmus sa Ghaeltacht ar mhaithe le caighdeán Gaeilge daoine a ardú agus tá sé seo foilsithe agam le cúpla seachtain.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> Maidir leis an HSE, ba mhaith linn go mbeadh a dhóthain daoine le Gaeilge fostaithe a fheiceáil ach nach dtarlóidh é seo go dtí go bhfeicfear an Ghaeilge mar bhuntáiste agus aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuív faoi seo. Rud a bheidh lárnach san Acht teanga ná go mbeimid ag cruthú na deiseanna seo, go mbeidh a fhios ag daoine go mbeidh deiseanna sa tseirbhís phoiblí agus go mbeidh daoine in ann plean a dhéanamh i dtaca leis an ábhar a mbeidh á fhoghlaim ag mac léinn sa scoil agus san ollscoil agus go mbeidh na deiseanna acu poist a fháil sa Ghaeltacht, faoin tuath nó cibé áit ar mhian leo agus go mbeidh siad ar an eolas faoi seo. Is é sin an rud a bhfuilimid ag iarraidh a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí go léir as ucht a bheith linn agus as páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">I am very happy to introduce the motion on behalf of the Rural Independent Group and thank the Minister for taking the debate. The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to providing protection for distressed mortgage holders and borrowers, tenants and small to medium-sized enterprises whose loans have been sold or transferred to non-regulated entities, which effectively are vulture funds. The Fine Gael Government has not lived up to this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Vulture funds are private equity companies such as pension or investment funds, which seek to make a quick profit from distressed mortgage holders by buying cheap and selling on at a quick profit without any compassion or social conscience. Effectively, they are buying debt and turning it into a quick profit. That surely goes against the principles of this Government. Vulture funds are buying distressed loans in large batches from our pillar banks, which are almost exclusively owned by the taxpayer, such as AIB and Bank of Ireland. During the last economic boom, banks acted irresponsibly by lending money by way of mortgages to people who did not have the capacity to repay those mortgages, particularly in an economic downturn. However, those very banks take no responsibility for that reckless lending. The same banks were bailed out by the taxpayer to ensure their survival. In return for that support, banks are allowed to sell these distressed mortgages at a substantial write-down to vulture funds that demand rapid repayment, compulsory sale or repossession with no regard to the circumstances of the mortgage holder or their tenants, many of whom effectively become homeless, thus becoming the responsibility of the State, which has to house them in whatever accommodation is available or place them in emergency temporary accommodation to the detriment of the family and at great loss to the State. This makes no sense. </p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I am not an economist or an expert on these matters but I do understand the difference between a State supporting its citizens and a State which turns its back on its citizens either directly or indirectly. Mr. David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, which has assisted over 10,000 families restructure their mortgages, states “it is not just loans that are being sold, but real families, real people and real lives that are being fed to [vulture funds], and this is a real social issue.” Banks have resisted personal insolvency legislation and taken legal challenges to various aspects of legislation to prevent its impact on writing down debt. It is not acceptable to allow vulture funds to come into our country, act in the manner in which they conduct their business and not interfere meaningfully to protect our citizens. What the Minister permits, he condones.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> This is not just a financial disaster but also a social and cultural disaster for many families who have suffered family break-up, mental distress and suicide. The activities of banks and vulture funds have far-reaching destructive effects which go far beyond the financial loss. The financial recovery of the past few years has not been even or uniform and there have been many casualties along the way. It is incumbent on this Fine Gael Government to protect its citizens from the effects of the financial crash, and defend them from those who seek to profit from their misfortune. There is an absolute expectation that this Government would protect its citizens from banks selling performing and so-called non-performing loans, restructured loans, and bad debts to entities about which we know little and which are poorly or weakly regulated, faceless global conglomerates of which people are afraid. </p>
          <p eId="para_553"> A substantial proportion of the 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, including 4,000 children, are there directly or indirectly as a result of vulture fund activity Do these vulture funds pay tax to the Irish economy and if so, how much? This is not just an abstract debate about fiscal housekeeping. What value is placed in maintaining the structure and social health of a family and a household when compared to the quick profit of a vulture fund? Is what is happening today in keeping with the principles articulated by the First Dáil in 1919, which we commemorated last January? Is it consistent with the Democratic Programme which was delivered on that day, the Proclamation of 1916 or the Constitution of 1937? Are vulture funds in keeping with the moral and social responsibility of this Government? Do vulture funds operate to the same level of regulation as is expected from our pillar banks? </p>
          <p eId="para_554"> Housing, homelessness and, by extension, the activities of vulture funds were among the main issues raised on the doorsteps during the local and European elections. The Government says it is going to become greener following the local elections. I would suggest that it should also become more compassionate and caring, listening to its citizens and being more responsive to their needs rather than to financial vulture funds that hold profit as their only goal. </p>
          <p eId="para_555"> Rather than facilitating vulture funds to operate in Ireland, we need to highly regulate them but also to reform our banking system by introducing competition into the market by promoting a community banking system along the lines of the Sparkasse banks in Germany or the Kiwibank in New Zealand. Providing banking services via our post office network would provide loans and mortgages at far lower and affordable interest rates, would plough the profits back into the local community and would give a lifeline to our struggling post office network. Instead, Fine Gael seems to be intent on protecting the pillar banks from such competition. </p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The vulture funds have their defenders. The Taoiseach thinks they are good, as does the Minister for Finance. The Central Bank is okay with them. The European Central Bank has recently been putting more pressure on Irish lenders to reduce the number of non-performing loans on their books. This is where vulture funds come into play. In many cases, banks are happy to sell large portfolios of non-performing mortgages to these funds, generally at a significant discount when compared with the original value of the loans. </p>
          <p eId="para_557"> This motion asks the House to say once again that vulture funds are not okay and that we must keep reminding the Government and the financial establishment that they are not working in the best interests of Irish families. Politicians who fail to challenge the credo that vulture funds are good are not doing their duty. Politicians who support the unregulated activities of vulture funds are working against the interests of Irish families. The reality for those whose loans are sold to a vulture fund is that they are far more likely to lose their homes. </p>

          <p eId="para_559">Whatever arrangement vulture funds are allowed to enter into, the net effect should not result in the loss of a family home or families becoming homeless. Fine Gael should not allow vulture funds to say to distressed mortgage holders, "nothing personal, it's just business" I remind the Minister of the maxim, “what you permit, you promote or condone." What will the Government do to protect families within their family homes from faceless vulture funds?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_560">I thank our Whip, Deputy Mattie McGrath, and David Mullins and Máiread McGrath in his office, for the preparatory work they did in bringing forward this very important motion. Each and every one of us, from all political parties and none, are all dealing with one issue which is the same to all of us, namely, the people who are affected by the crisis that has not gone away. There may have been an economic recovery for some but there are many others who are really in trouble. As lately as today I had three new cases of people in serious financial difficulty. The categories of people I am talking about are homeowners in their family homes, small business people such as someone with a small shop or a small, struggling business, small publicans, and the likes of a farmer who tried expanding and borrowed money to try to better himself and his output and make his business sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Those are the very people we as politicians should be doing everything we can to protect. We should be doing everything possible to help further their best interests and carry them into the future. I remember many years ago when it was thought that planners and other such people were trying to prevent people living in the countryside. There might have been condemnation of a farmer who sold a site. A funny thing about that practice, however, was that, even though the farmer might not have wanted to sell, the sale of a site might have sustained the family's small business and made it viable for years to come. The sale of half an acre might have made it possible to build sheds, install a slatted tank and improve the rest of the farm. A small business was helped at a critical time in the life of the farmer and people were also brought into the rural community. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> This motion is an effort to help people and protect them from vulture funds. The same thing happens now in many places when properties become available. Hundreds of units are being sold to big groups of investors at home and abroad. We will regret that in future. We are driving people involved in private rental accommodation out of the business. Those people are only trying to better themselves and make a living. I am talking about people who might have only one to four units for rent. Those people are not going to remain in that business given some of the proposals being brought forward by other Members of this House. They are trying to criminalise those types of people. We are going to finish up with people renting accommodation from landlords with as many as 500 or 1,000 units. It will be possible for those property owners to create a monopoly in the market and increase rents to whatever price they want. We will rue the day we allow that to happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Turning to the vulture funds, I have long worried about the Taoiseach's comments regarding their activities. Those funds endanger young and middle-aged couples with mortgages. I am not surprised, however. To judge people's ability to make good decisions it is necessary to look at what they have done themselves. I hate talking about someone who is not here. I would much prefer if the Taoiseach was here when I speak about his own life experience in business, or lack of it. It is the same with other Government Ministers and people in charge. I consider what they have done in their own lives. Have they ever paid a week's wages to any man, woman or child at the end of a week? If they have not done much in their own lives, it is difficult for them to know the problems faced by people in business. I am talking predominantly about small business people. It is very difficult to understand the problems other people face without having experience. </p>
          <p eId="para_564"> I worry when I hear the Taoiseach stating that he thinks it is a good thing to have vulture funds coming in here, buying up masses of loan books and then being in charge of the destiny of those people. This is happening at a time when the families concerned might not even know the sale has taken place. That is horrific. It is a major worry.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">We are dealing with the people affected daily in our clinics. We are dealing with the upset and trauma being caused to families and the damage inflicted on their financial situations. It is no wonder that we and others have brought motions like this before the House. We want to see the Minister bring in legislation that has teeth and power and that will be meaningful to the people in our society who feel vulnerable. It is our duty. We are here as elected representatives to help those people. That is why we are asking the Minister to not just pay lip service to this motion and to not just state he is taking it on board while coming up with a counter proposal, as he has done, to water it down and change it.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> We are trying to be decisive and firm. The Government and the Dáil should be united behind people who are trying to work and pay their debts in a respectable fashion. Those people are only trying to get on in life, rear their children and educate them in the best way possible. All they want is a fair crack of the whip. They certainly do not want to see billionaires and vulture funds coming into this country and taking over without proper legislation being in place to provide protection. </p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Another thing I cannot let go without mention tonight is what is going on now with what are called our pillar banks. Not many things drive me mad. I am angered, however, when I see advertisements stating that a bank is "Backing Brave" and putting workers first and all of the rest of this rubbish. Banks are trying to give the impression that they are loaning out money. They are not. That is the case with AIB in particular. It is impossible for anybody to get money from that bank. Every possible obstacle is placed in the way of a potential borrower. AIB is making it impossible for anybody, whether young or middle-aged and beyond, to borrow money. </p>
          <p eId="para_569"> I would not have a problem with that if the bank were to admit to what is happening. I would accept it if AIB stated tomorrow that it, and the other banks, are shut down, not loaning money and making it impossible for borrowers. I would accept it if the bank told people to not waste their time going in. That is what the banks are doing now and I am sick of seeing what is happening to people. I am sick of hearing stories about people being fooled and codded up to their eyeballs by people in suits regarding why money cannot be loaned. We must remember that those banks would not exist and would not be in business now except for the taxpayers. </p>

          <p eId="para_575">They are not loaning money. I am thinking of a nice respectable family, a young couple starting out or a young individual, perhaps between 20 years old and 30 years old, deciding to go to the bank to see if it might be possible to get a loan for a business or a mortgage. Those people are all wasting their time because nothing is being done to help them. All we see are the fancy advertisements on the television, in the newspapers and on the windows of the banks asking people to call in because they are lending. Those banks are not lending. They might be lending to millionaires and big businesses. Perhaps that is why at the end of the year it is possible for them to state that they backed different industries with so many hundreds of millions or billions of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> All I know is that from the point of view of the ordinary person, the people we represent, the banks are not lending. I condemn what the Government has done. There have been calls for many years from myself and others - including people like Tom O'Callaghan of the Independent Postmasters Group of Ireland - for the introduction of proper community banking. When I refer to community banking, I mean banking where any profits accrued go back into rural communities, as they do in similar models around the world. It was a sensible proposition and there was nothing wrong with it. Did the Government support it? No, it did not. It went around the houses in every possible way. It went around the dresser and the kitchen table to avoid supporting it and came up with every suggestion in the world except what we wanted.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">I was terribly disappointed that the Government would not take our proposal on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">When we looked at other parts of the world, we did not need to go further than England, Scotland and Wales to see how many post offices were lost. When one compares that with countries with proper community banking, one sees that they saved their post offices. We wore ourselves to a thread trying to tell that to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and other members of the Government. We did everything we could to persuade them, but they did not listen. As a result, what I predicted many years ago in the House has, very sadly, come to pass. We have not lost ten or 20 post offices, we have lost hundreds and I can say to the Minister with absolute confidence that we will lose hundreds more because of Government policy and inaction. We lost those post offices, which there was no need to do. We could have kept people banking in their local communities at a time when pillar banks are doing nothing to help and support our people. Rather, they are trying only to make fools of them. I really do not like that. "Pillar banks" is a term I would love to see being done away with given that they are the pillars of nothing. To me, a pillar is something that holds something up. It is something strong that supports one. I am very glad to be able to support the Private Members' motion tonight and I thank the staff of Deputy Mattie McGrath's office who did a great deal of work to prepare it.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">I acknowledge the Deputies for placing the motion, which the Government will not be supporting, before the House. Before I outline why, I note that no one in the House, including those Deputies who have proposed the motion, has a monopoly on understanding the difficulty and anxiety citizens in mortgage difficulty can face. It is an anxiety I well understand and share. I understand the challenge our citizens face when they face mortgage difficulty. In particular, I note with regard to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's reference to the Taoiseach that anyone who has the ability to be re-elected has more than enough stock of experience and appreciation of what constituents face. For the Deputy to suggest otherwise is unworthy of him. He also said nothing had been done, which Deputy Harty also stated. I will touch on that in a moment. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae also raised the issue of why I did not support a community banking organisation and the development of such banking beyond what is there. I reiterate to the Deputy what I said on the issue before. If anyone, including the Deputy himself, is willing to raise the money to fund the idea, I am happy to look at it. However, I am not in the business of reinvesting Irish taxpayers' money into activities to create lending when we still have billions of euro absorbed in banks which I want to get back. If those who are putting this idea forward think it is such a good one, they might be willing to put their own capital on the table to make it happen. When they do so, I will be happy to sit down and look at the idea again, as I have said I will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I will deal now with the points Deputy Harty made. I would have hoped for some acknowledgment from the Deputy of the progress which has been made. I am sorry he could not provide that this evening. Deputy Harty said the Government was failing. It is up to the people to determine whether we are failing.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">I am used to the interruptions but I will continue on. I would have hoped for a broader appreciation from Deputy Harty of the facts in this context but he did not feel able to offer it on this occasion. Restating the anxiety and understanding, which I share with Deputy Harty, of the worry citizens face when dealing with arrears, I would have hoped to hear from the Deputy, whose contributions on other matters tend to be fair-minded, an acknowledgement, as acknowledged in the amendment to the motion, that the number of people in mortgage arrears has almost halved in the last number of years. Progress like that had been deemed impossible. That does not invalidate the worry and concern of those who are still in arrears. However, to suggest no progress has been made and that nothing has been done is not commensurate with the changes that have taken place in our economy and society. While I do not hold any hope in respect of Deputy Mattie McGrath, I would have hoped that Deputy Harty would at least have acknowledged the fact that 115,000 mortgage accounts had been restructured. That has happened because the Government and the House recognise the worry and need to respond to the personal crises faced by too many people. I would have hoped for at least some recognition that the level of arrears in Ireland has declined for 21 consecutive quarters. The fact that there is no such acknowledgment in either the motion or the speeches in support of it is the reason I have moved the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Before I deal with the issue of the purchase of loan books by equity funds, I will discuss what we have done. With the constructive input of the House, we have introduced personal insolvency legislation. We have established Abhaile, which has issued 10,000 vouchers to provide support for citizens in distress. Of those who have secured personal insolvency arrangements pursuant to the legislation, 95% have stayed in their homes. In addition, we have put in place other legislation, in particular the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, on the amendment of which I was happy to work with Deputy Michael McGrath who identified an issue I accepted needed to be addressed. We put two enactments in place, one of which was initiated by the Government and one of which was initiated by Deputy Michael McGrath, to ensure that any entity operating in Ireland with access to and ownership of our loan book is subject to the regulation of the Central Bank. Further, I asked the Central Bank to review the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to consider whether those whose loans were sold were treated differently to those whose loans continued to be held by banks. That review was carried out independently by the Central Bank which recommended that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears be left unchanged. Before the Oireachtas currently we have the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill 2019, which was acknowledged by no one in this debate thus far. The whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the 2013 Act is amended and strengthened to strike the appropriate balance for citizens who are in great debt difficulty and distress in our courts. We have put the legislation in place to ensure the right balance is struck between those in difficulty and the broader obligations and needs of banks in how they manage themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I am on the side of fairness and ensuring people are treated fairly. That includes those who have mortgages and those who need them. It includes those who are paying for them. I address a point Deputy Michael Healy-Rae identified when he asked why more credit was not available. I ask the Deputy whether he will acknowledge the possible link between the fact that we continue to have one of the highest levels of non-performing loans of any country in the European Union and the fact that there is still an appetite for more credit from our banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">They are related. We are a country and we are an economy that has gone through a number of years of employment growth and income growth. A number of our banks still have a level of non-performing loans that is very high versus the European average. We went through many years in which Opposition speakers, I and many in this House criticised the fact that we either did not have an independent bank regulator or, if we did have one, that it did not have enough power, and if it did not have enough power, that it was not using it. That is now in place and that has consequences. One of the consequences of this is that our regulators, led by and represented by the Central Bank of Ireland, are saying that banks, particularly at a time of relative economic recovery and stability, need to do more to make sure that balance sheets are safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> As Minister for Finance, I understand the need for that to happen but I also understand that those who are in difficulty, who are in distress and who find themselves facing grievous worry about their future because of the level of debt they have, need protection and to be treated fairly as well. The 2015 Act, the 2018 Act, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, the current one that is being revised at the moment and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears have all contributed to a significant amount of mortgage restructuring to alleviate our citizens from difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I will continue to work with those who want to be constructive on this to see if there are ways in which we can continue to get that balance right. Those who are in difficulty need to be and must be treated fairly. We will look and I will continue to look at ways in which this could be done, but let us acknowledge what has happened, let us acknowledge the progress that has been made, and let us acknowledge that we need to find, in a fair way, ways to ensure that our banks can meet the needs of today and of tomorrow.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_616">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Private Members' motion. I will be sharing my time with Deputy Brassil. At the outset, I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath and his colleagues from the Rural Independent Group for bringing this motion to the House tonight and for facilitating such an important debate because we are all fresh from the local and European elections and we are fresh from a lot of direct interaction on the doorsteps with constituents, and this is an issue. It is an issue how people are being treated, especially when their loans are sold. There is no doubt about that and there are real concerns. It is our job to assess whether those concerns are well founded, to seek to address them, to come forward with the right policy response, and to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> There are a number of points that I want to make on behalf of our party as part of this debate. First, there can be a characterisation at times that the loans that are sold to so called vulture funds, whether they be mortgages, farm loans or business loans, are basket cases and a lost cause, but that is not the case. Many of them are deep in arrears and in some cases no repayments have been made for many years, but in a great number of cases, these are inherently good loans. They are loans where the borrower is engaging, where in many cases restructuring agreements have been entered into and are being honoured by both the lender and the borrower. Despite this, the loans are still technically classified as non-performing on the balance sheet of the respective bank, in line with the technical definition of a non-performing loan as defined by the European Banking Authority. These banks are under pressure from Europe to reduce their level of non-performing loans and there is no doubt about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The question is, however, whether there is a better way of doing it. The Minister pointed to the undoubted success there has been in bringing down the overall level of arrears. Thankfully, the number and percentage of mortgages in particular that are in arrears has fallen, in line with the growth of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> It is fair to say that while we all have many challenges engaging with banks on behalf of borrowers, in the vast majority of cases, where there is goodwill on both sides, where the borrower is making a genuine effort and where he or she is paying what he or she can, in most cases but not all, a deal can be done and an arrangement can be entered into at least to buy time and perhaps to enter into a split mortgage, to get forbearance through term extension, or to get an interest-only mortgage for a period. Whether that is always the case when public representatives are not involved is another matter and it is up to the Central Bank to assess the data and the evidence on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Good loans are being sold as well as loans that are not in such good shape. There are those who would argue that there is a better prospect of getting a deal from a vulture fund than from a financial institution. I have tried to deal with them as well as borrower representative bodies and my experience is that there is a prospect of getting a deal if one is prepared to lose and forfeit the ownership of one's property.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">There may well be a deal to be done on an outstanding deficit in the loan account but one will lose one's home. I have not had success, and I am not aware of other groups having had success, in entering into new long-term restructuring arrangements with these loan owners or so called vulture funds. They are incredibly difficult to deal with and it is frustrating trying to get any feedback whatsoever.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">One is dealing with an intermediary, namely, a credit servicing firm as a legacy of the regime that was there all along. It is simply a conduit. It is the messenger and it is passing the information back to the vulture fund and then the loan is one of a long list of loans that goes through its credit committee. There is no real engagement. One never gets to talk to a decision-maker. That is my experience. The same argument can be made for banks and their systems need to continue to be improved, but as I say, in many cases deals are being done in that scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> The other point, which we have discussed previously, is that at least the banks will come before these Houses in the form of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and they will allow themselves to be held to account. They fill up very detailed questionnaires that we, as members of the committee, send to them in advance of their appearance before the committee. They are very detailed questions and, by and large, those questions are answered in the questionnaires. Then they come in and they have maybe a four, five or six-hour engagement with members of the committee, and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, will be well aware of this from when he was a member of that committee. They will answer those questions to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We get no such opportunity when it comes to these funds. We have tried time and again to get them in before the committee to talk about how they deal with these loans, their business plan, what type of restructuring options they are offering, and the approach that they adopt, and they simply refuse time and again to come in and have any discussion. If they come in, they will be given a fair hearing and they will be given an opportunity to answer questions and to set out from their perspective their approach to managing these loans. I always get suspicious when businesses such as that are afraid to be held accountable and will not allow themselves to come into a public forum and be questioned by publicly elected representatives. That is not on.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The people whom we represent are those who are making a genuine effort, people who are paying what they can for mortgages, people who are prioritising the retention of their home and who are doing their best to meet their commitments and face up to their responsibilities. The vast majority are. I have not seen any data backing up the suggestion that there are a huge number of so called strategic defaulters. I have no doubt there are some but they are a small minority. The vast majority of people want to keep their homes and they are paying what they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> I have acknowledged the Government's support for the Fianna Fáil legislation, which the Minister referenced and which means these funds are regulated. That is an important step in the right direction. What we had up to that point was a halfway house, to my mind, whereby the agent, with whom all the borrower's contact was, was regulated but the fund making all of the key decisions on the future of that loan was not regulated by the Central Bank. The fact that they are now regulated is progress. I want that to be active regulation and I want to see the Central Bank going into the offices of these funds carrying out its inspections, doing its thematic work and assessing the compliance by these loan owners themselves directly, not their middlemen or agents, but these funds directly, with the various codes and with the legislation that they are obliged to honour.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> On 18 April, representatives from FLAC and Mr. David Hall from the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation appeared before our committee to discuss Deputy Pearse Doherty's Private Members' Bill, which has been discussed in the House. In the context of the sale of loans to so-called vulture funds and the impact of that on borrowers, they raised some important issues the Minister needs to address. We followed up on a number of the issues with parliamentary questions. One issue raised by both bodies was that, in their view, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is not a statutory code. The Minister, however, denies that. He has stated it is issued under the Central Bank Acts and that it is, therefore, a statutory code and that the Central Bank has enforcement powers for non-compliance with that code. Mr. Paul Joyce from FLAC, who is highly respected, made the point to the committee that while the code is issued under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1999, it is neither primary nor secondary legislation and it has neither been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas nor signed into law by the relevant Minister, who in this case would be the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> He went on to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in Irish Life and Permanent plc <i>v</i>. Dunne and Irish Life and Permanent plc <i>v</i>. Dunphy. He described them as seminal cases to test the enforceability of the arrangements entered into by lenders under the terms of the code. He said the Supreme Court stated the only measure in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears that was legally enforceable was the three-month moratorium on the bringing of proceedings against the borrower when the borrower had been exited from the mortgage arrears resolution process. He stated there was nothing else in the code the court could discover that was sufficiently precise and tangible to provide legally enforceable rights for borrowers. I have yet to see a full response to that from the Department of Finance but it should be forthcoming because FLAC has questioned the enforceability of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears in reference to the Supreme Court's judgment. We cannot allow any ambiguity or question mark over the enforceability and applicability of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> Another issue raised at the committee and which continues to arise relates to section 39 of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. Under that section, lenders are required to explore all the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender and all the usual forbearance arrangements are listed from A to L. Lenders are required to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender but they are not obliged to consider all the options. They can say they offer only A, B and C, or only F, G and H. I have seen many letters received from the funds in which it is stated a conclusion has been reached that the loan is not sustainable and that, therefore, the only solutions offered are voluntary sale, voluntary surrender or court proceedings. They should be required at least to consider all the options set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears but that is not the case. It is a deficit that should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Other issues raised that need to be dealt with include the fact that thus far, despite all the Central Bank inspections of lenders in respect of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, not a single sanction has been imposed by the Central Bank, even though it found a litany of issues and of breaches of the code by lenders. In a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister stated no firm had been sanctioned for a breach of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to date. I was suspicious when I heard from organisations such as FLAC that there was a question mark over the enforceability of the code. Despite the Central Bank finding issues with the approach of the lenders to the code during its inspections, not a single sanction has been imposed. That is a significant concern and it should be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_633"> We have heard time and again from the Minister and others that when a loan is sold, all the protections travel with the loan and the borrower is not disadvantaged in any way. They claim that if the borrower has entered into a restructuring arrangement with the seller of the loan, namely, the bank, that arrangement must be honoured by the new loan owner. FLAC made the point, however, that such a requirement is not written anywhere. It is not part of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or part of any legislation. While it appears to be the case that restructuring arrangements continue to be honoured, that will be tested fully as time passes. Currently, there is no requirement in the code for new loan owners to honour an alternative arrangement. In a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister stated: "The Central Bank expects that where a co-operating borrower is complying with the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) and where the borrower’s circumstances have not changed, the terms of the ARA will continue to be honoured." The Central Bank expects but it cannot enforce. There is nothing the Central Bank can do if a fund purchases a loan and says it does not like that arrangement and that it will tear it up. That is a concern and it needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Another important issue which arose at the committee was that representatives had found over time that the file relating to the loan, its origin and its full documentation was not being transferred to the purchaser. We queried the issue with the Minister, who replied, "I am advised by the Central Bank that while there is no specific provision in the Central Bank’s codes which requires that a full file be received by the loan purchaser from the original lender, the General Principles of the Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code 2012 provide that 'a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market'". There is nothing written to provide that the full file must be transferred, but I would expect that to be a basic requirement that should be honoured. </p>
          <p eId="para_635"> I have used my speaking time to convey to the Minister that it is not as simple as saying that if a loan is sold, it will have no impact on the borrower. I have made three or four specific points which show that at a minimum, there is a question mark and ambiguity. The points need to be addressed because by not doing so, the Minister is potentially exposing borrowers to the types of risks my colleagues have highlighted.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. Fianna Fáil will support its principle and sentiment but will table some amendments to strengthen it.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> We have all campaigned in recent months. In County Kerry, I campaigned in towns such as Tralee, Killarney and Killorglin, as well as in rural areas. I also did some campaigning in Dublin. As one goes along, one picks up on issues that educate one about what is actually going on rather than what we are told. For example, while canvassing I came across a couple who have a business with a few properties and who owed just over €1 million to the bank. They agreed a settlement with the bank and were selling off the properties to hold on to the business. They were paying 80% of what they owed, as agreed with the bank. Nothing happened for five or six weeks. They could not contact anybody or receive an answer to emails or phone calls. When they eventually succeeded, they were informed their properties were now part of a group of 450 other properties and were being sold to a fund, but that was the first they had heard of it. That is utterly unacceptable. We still own 71% of AIB, 14% of Bank of Ireland and 75% of Permanent TSB. However we wish to dress it up as politicians, the public expects us to exert some control and give some help to distressed mortgage holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">They saw how we had bailed out the banks and now they are asking the Government to legislate for the banks to help them out. This is not unreasonable and it is not happening in isolation, as we are in the middle of a housing crisis. It is not as if all of these loans will not create another problem if they are sold on and the new vulture fund does not deal fairly with the people living in these houses. That is a real concern. I imagine the banks are under pressure from the European Union to sell the loans and get their loan books in order, but sometimes we just have to say no to the European Union. We have always been good enough Europeans, but do we choose citizens or being good Europeans? I say we should look after citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> I ask the Minister to consider two very practical measures. There are 63,000 mortgage accounts in arrears and until the housing crisis is resolved, bulk selling of these accounts to vulture funds should be prevented. The second consideration is developments being purchased in their entirety by investment funds. For example, a development of 50 houses may be bought in its entirety by a vulture fund. This means that a young couple who are trying to get into the property market are excluded from it. The fund then controls the properties and the rents charged, which adds to the developing housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> On Jersey people cannot buy a property if they are not from the island. That is probably extreme, but it is factual. As far as I understand, in New Zealand investment funds are not allowed to bulk-buy properties. We should be looking at measures such as this to support citizens and stop vulture funds from taking advantage of properties they can buy for half nothing to be moved on at a later stage to make profits for the investors. I am not interested in making profits for investors but in looking after citizens. We looked after the banks which should now help citizens out of the crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_641">The Minister said the people sitting opposite him did not have a monopoly of understanding the fears and anxieties of those with distressed mortgages or who found it difficult to pay very high mortgages. That may or may not be correct, but I do not believe the Government understands fully what is happening to the families concerns and their real fears and anxieties when vulture funds arrive on the scene. To understand them we must go back and understand the journey the people concerned went on and what happened to them. By and large, they are families who worked hard and bought homes before the economic crash. I will give the example of two working people who wanted to own their own home, were not looking for anything from the State, the Government or anybody else and bought a house. Most of those involved bought their houses at the top end of the market before the crash. When the crash came, it was not their fault and the bottom fell out of the economy. The banks were exposed for their bad practices and went bust. What happened then? The State saved the banks; the National Pension Reserve Fund was cleaned out; we borrowed money from the troika and took taxpayers' money and put it into the banks that had acted so irresponsibly. The very same families who had bought their house at the top end of the market are the ones who are paying the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> We found ourselves exposed with no money to invest in the economy. What did Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil do? What did the Green Party and the Labour Party do when they were in government supporting these parties? They took an axe to public services and cut welfare and social supports. People lost their jobs causing huge distress and anxiety for families. People had to leave the country. Families made sacrifices at the time, but they stuck it out and tried their best. There was a pick-up in the economy and perhaps one or both persons in a household with a mortgage found a job. They then entered into a long-term arrangement with a bank they trusted and with which they had taken out the mortgage. It was a bank they, their families and communities owned. Peoples' taxes, blood, sweat and tears went into supporting the banks, through no fault of their own. They trusted them. Families who were struggling, thought everything was okay and worried that a letter could be a bill that they might not have been able to afford, received letters from the banks they owned stating their mortgages were being sold to a vulture fund. They have no way to stop this from happening as they have no ownership. There is real fear and anxiety, but the Government has no understanding of it. No matter what he says, I do not believe the Minister has such an understanding.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">This is the deal. Families cannot do anything about the letters they receive. They are then told not to worry because all of the deals they entered into will be honoured and that there is nothing to see here, similar to what the Government stated about Bills brought forward by the Opposition to regulate and deal with vulture funds. There is no problem, until people receive a letter from a vulture fund stating it wants payment within 30 days. That is what is happening to so many families. What does the Government do? It does nothing. It allows the vulture funds to come in, circle and prey on the vulnerabilities of families and does nothing about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> The Minister has challenged and put it up to me to propose alternatives. We brought forward a Bill to provide for no sale without consent. It was passed democratically in the House on Second Stage, which means nothing to the Government. We can vote in the House as a majority, but the Government, supported by Fianna Fáil, ignores the majority and nothing is done. We brought forward the Bill to regulate vulture funds and make sure families would have a say and have to give their consent before their mortgages were sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> There are alternatives, including the Bill proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty. Who are the people who are trying to block these alternatives? They include Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the European Central Bank. Mr. Draghi came before an Oireachtas committee to tell people the Bill could not be delivered or supported. The Minister for Finance and previous Ministers said nothing could be done, but the people who are really concerned about this issue, whose mortgages are being sold from under their noses, are under real pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> I again remind the Minister that some of the vulture funds hire mercenaries to forcibly remove people from their homes. We have seen this happen in some parts of the country. When the Minister accuses members of the Opposition of pretending that they have a monopoly of compassion for the families concerned, the reason he does so is he knows that, in fact, it is the truth. If he had compassion and really understood their fears and anxieties, he would do something about the unregulated nature of how vulture funds come into the country. Many of them are shelf companies, with hundreds of subsidiaries hiding behind other names. Nobody knows who they are, but one thing for sure is they are not here to act in the interests of the people. They are not here to act in the interests of those who bailed out the pillar banks. They are not here to keep people in their homes and they are not here to support hard-working families or help those in mortgage distress; rather, they are here to make money on the back of people's misery. I am afraid the Minister's contribution was underwhelming and shameful because he did not acknowledge the suffering and anxiety of the individuals in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Sinn Féin will be supporting the motion. Through our finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, we will continue our work to have the No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019 passed. We will continue to provide the alternatives. If the Minister is not prepared to listen or implement the alternatives, that is on him, the Fine Gael Party and the Government. The Minister needs to do an awful lot more. He needs to understand that this issue is real and he also needs to understand the reason the vulture funds are here. I think the Minister does understand. Fine Gael represents the cosseted privileged class who will always put the interests of vulture funds, banks, landlords, speculators and people who want to make huge amounts of money on the backs of other people ahead of the interests of people who simply want a roof over their heads. That is all people want: a roof over their heads. People work hard to have a roof over their heads. When things go wrong, they expect some level of support, but of course it is not there. The Government will not support the people who need to be helped when they are in crisis but it will support the vulture funds, the banks and landlords. That is what this Government has done. The Minister should not pretend there is no alternative or that the Sinn Féin does not care or understand. Sinn Féin does care. The Minister understands but he does not care and the Government does not care. If it did, it would do something about it.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_651">Vulture funds have fast become a normal feature in the economy since the Government came to power. Distressed mortgages are now regarded as a new commodity, bundled up in a new financial product to be offered as fresh pickings for vulture funds making their way through the economy at the invitation of the Government. Fine Gael continues to open up the market to include a wider net of homeowners vulnerable to vulture fund takeovers, which may be at the behest of the European Central Bank or the Irish Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> A new low has been reached. The Government and those with vested interests in the sector have been doing their best to make it out that vulture funds are a sign of a healthy functioning economy. So much spin has been spun that when the Central Bank's report on the credit servicing funds was published before Christmas, the Government and key players in the industry, including the Central Bank itself, used the report to speak positively about vulture funds and the contribution that they make. They made out that vulture funds were not only good for the economy but that they were in fact better than banks for those with distressed mortgages. We have heard in all of the contributions tonight how much they better are. Either banks in this country have reached a new low or spin has reached a new height. Either way, we are in sorry times if we are hearing that vulture funds are better than banks. Let us face it, the existence of vulture funds in our economy is a symptom of a complacent Government prioritising private sector interests over the interests of ordinary people in this country. It is also a symptom of a banking system collapse, a system that has failed to provide a service to its people. Banks, through incompetence and the prioritisation of a select few, have developed a situation where vulture funds could easily move in. The recession was used by the banks to transfer the responsibility of loans to another entity, one beyond the radar of Central Bank regulations. This was no doubt done on purpose because it suits the Government to shift the responsibility for financial hang-ups from the recession onto another entity. For that reason, those of us in opposition who have defended the rights of homeowners have consistently called for greater regulation of the credit financing firms.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> I agree with the call of this Private Members' motion that the Government accept the conclusion reached by FLAC that there is a significant inequality of arms between the lender and the borrower in that the borrower may have no meaningful influence on the content of the terms of a loan and may be wholly unaware that the lender is reserving the right to sell the loan on to an entity of its choice. I also agree that the Central Bank of Ireland's report on the effectiveness of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders, which was furnished to the Minister for Finance in February in 2018, should be given legislative force to ensure that all parts of the code are expressly admissible in repossession hearings. One has to wonder why this has not been done already. It must surely be to give the banks the leeway to do what they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> The Government must recognise that so-called vulture funds pose an immediate and overwhelming threat to borrowers in rural and urban Ireland and it must accept that unregulated entities have demonstrated a clear unwillingness to abide by voluntary codes of conduct. We need to revise the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to ensure that provisions 38 and 39 mandatorily require lenders to provide solutions. Most important, we need to recognise housing as a right and as part of economic, social and cultural rights. In this way, the right to a home can be defended at this juncture and into the courts, if required. Currently, the banks have a greater right to homes than people. That is the crux of the problem and that is what has to change in our society. The issue of bailouts was mentioned earlier. The Portuguese respect the right to housing in their constitution and they also respect the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens. For that reason, the troika could not attack homes in Portugal because they were constitutionally protected. We do not have that provision here. The troika attacked our homes and we are still living through the crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">It saddens me greatly that the Rural Independent Group and I had to raise a motion regarding vulture funds in this House. Since the crash many homeowners, farmers, fishermen and business owners have worked very hard to keep afloat. Our State supported the banking sector in a big way. Now, some of the banks that we supported are dealing ruthlessly with their customers. Many loans are being sold at large reductions to foreign banks. Let us call them what they are, namely, vulture companies. These loans are acquired as cheaply as possible by the vulture companies, often at close to half the value of the original loan. The vulture companies then pursue the borrower for the full amount even though they have bought the loan at a hugely reduced rate. We have often seen these vulture companies pursue the borrower through the courts for the full amount and the evictions that resulted. Many homeowners, farmers, fishermen and business people give in under the pressure to these vulture funds and they surrender their property quietly out of public view because of the perceived shame and pressure. These cases do not hit the papers or media, but they are happening wholesale. The distress these people suffer is severe and the pressure they are under is unreal. Many people's health is affected. There is no doubt that this has led to many suicides throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> Families are paying a huge price. The Government has done a Pontius Pilate and washed its hands of this situation. It has allowed the banks to throw borrowers to the wolves. Banks and vulture funds are trampling on people, treating them in an appalling manner. Vulture funds are making a killing on the backs of hard-working, honest, Irish people. The banks tell us they are selling the loans of those people who are not engaging or co-operating to resolve the situation. We are told that it is only loans that are in default for more than two years that are being sold, but we are hearing a different story. People who were engaging with the banks and agreeing to a restructuring of their loans and had the capacity to meet their commitments suddenly were told that the bank was in the process of selling their loans to the vulture funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> What has happened in this country since April last is nothing short of criminal. A bank that was rescued by the taxpayer is now selling the loans of farmers and business people throughout the country and mortgages to vulture funds at knock-down rates. They have been told that contracts were already signed with the vulture funds. The distress that this has caused is unimaginable. People are at risk of losing their homes, farms or businesses. The lives of many people are being destroyed by the heavy-handed and reckless behaviour of our banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> The Government does not seem to care. It is allowing the banks to do what they like. In the case of Allied Irish Banks, AIB, the State owns over 70% of the bank. What steps have been taken to protect ordinary people from the ruthless actions of this bank? The Government is not in touch with ordinary people. This has to change. I propose that the banks should engage in a meaningful and realistic way with borrowers and be prepared to restructure their loans and give them the support to work their way out of their difficulties over time. Where the banks feel they are justified in selling these loans to the foreign banks or what we call vulture funds at knock-down rates, the borrower should be given an opportunity to purchase the loan at the same price as it is being offered to the vulture funds. Before a contract is entered into to sell these loans, the borrower should be informed well in advance. It is not good enough to inform the borrower that the contract to sell the loan has already been signed.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> We cannot forget there are people and families behind these loans. Lives are being damaged and destroyed as a result. The banks and the Government must take a different approach.</p>

        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2019-05-28T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_661">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important matter. I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for doing so much work in the background to get this Private Members' business up and running. I regret the sarcastic attack that the Minister made on us because we are raising this issue. He says that we do not have a monopoly, which we do not. We have an understanding and the Government does not. We are asking the Government to deal with the matter where vulture funds are profiting from vulnerable people. We know what is happening. It is a traumatic time for a family to lose their home and to have to leave. Other things could be done to prevent that. The Government is giving money to local authorities to buy houses and compete against first-time buyers on the open market instead of building houses. The Government could do different things. It could buy these houses, give the funds to the local authorities, and rent the houses back to the families. In time, maybe they could get on their feet again and go from renting to getting a loan and buying back the house. They would remain in their home. It would mean that small children could stay in their own little bedrooms and sitting rooms, and they could keep using the kitchen and the fridge that they were used to.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> Small businesses, farmers and people who survived the crash and who paid employees are still going to the wall because lenders will not even talk to the people who are in trouble. The next thing that happens is that the vultures sell off their properties and leave them behind. It cannot be right for the borrower to be overruled after going into a contract with a certain lender, bank or mortgage company. They overrule it and give the poor borrower no say about what it is doing. We know what vultures are on a farm. They are great crows that come and pick the eyes out of a lamb or a calf. I have seen it myself. They are left to die. I know what we are talking about when we talk about vulture funds. I appreciate people who employ others, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, because I employ people. I do not know if the Minister understands it, since I do not know what his background is, but I certainly know that Friday evening comes very quickly if one has 20, 40 or 60 men to pay. If a payment does not come in, things can start to go wrong very quickly. Even after all the years of building up something, one can start to get into trouble. People need a bit of time. As Deputy Brassil said, these institutions will not even answer calls and talk to people, which is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> I read a sign in front of a pub in Killarney stating that a bank is an institution that will lend money if a person does not need it or has money. We saw that when farmers were supposed to get cheap loans. The Government made a big announcement about farmers getting loans to deal with the fodder shortage. I know what happened. If someone was a short way into the red, that person got no loan. Only the fellows who did not need them got the loans. That is wrong but it is the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I am hurt by the sarcastic way in which the Minister attacked us for tabling this motion. We may not have a monopoly and I agree with him on that, but we have an understanding and know that people are hurt. This is wrong. The Minister and the Government have the power to stop this.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">The Deputies can take offence if they wish but it is a compliment to Deputy Harty rather than an insult to the rest of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I have put the Government's performance on the record previously and wish people would accept it. In 2009, action 1 was the introduction of the statutory CCMA. As action 2, in 2012, the mortgage-to-rent scheme was introduced. As action 3, in 2012, the Personal Insolvency Act was introduced, which reformed the bankruptcy system. Action 4 in 2012 was the introduction of a mortgage information and advice scheme by the Department of Social Protection. Action 5 in 2013 was the revision of the code of conduct, making a distinction between co-operating and non co-operating borrowers and provided that a moratorium of the last eight months would be available to co-operating borrowers. Action 6 was the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, by the 2012 Act. Action 7 in October 2014 involved the ISI waiving existing application fees for the three statutory debt relief solutions in an effort to remove any possible perceived barrier to debtors availing of solutions. Action 8 in 2015 was the enactment of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act. In 2015, we reduced the period for which people would be allowed to be insolvent under the Personal Insolvency Act, as action 9. Action 10 was the enactment of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, to allow courts, where they considered it reasonable in the circumstances of an individual case, to approve a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA. Action 11 in 2016 was the introduction of the Abhaile scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Action 12 from 2017 to 2019 is the finalisation by the Department of Justice and Equality of the review of operation of Part 3 of the Personal Insolvency Act to reduce the period in which bankruptcy applies to people to one year. For action 13, the Central Bank reviewed the CCMA, which found that it was working effectively for those who engaged with the process. As action 14, the Government supported Deputy Michael McGrath's Private Members' Bill - Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 - which has been enacted. Under action 15, the Government is supporting the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill 2019, which is now on Committee Stage, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, referred it. Action 16 is the Central Bank's consumer protection code. The CCMA makes specific provisions for those in mortgage arrears in their homes. Section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 relates to lending to small and medium enterprises. Under action 18, in individual cases where a regulated entity does not behave properly, the consumer has a right to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. Last year, we also expanded in the same Act on long-term financial services. There have been 19 actions in nine years.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">As I said to Deputy Harty, I consider him a fair-minded person. None of that was mentioned in his contribution. There are very few jurisdictions where there are more protections for people, their property and their loan, and if their loan is bundled and packaged and sold to others. Most fair-minded people would accept that not just this Government and the parties in it, but the previous Fine Gael and Labour Government and the Administration prior to that of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and some Independents have put in place structures in the past decade to protect people in their homes. However, not everybody can be protected on all occasions. On some occasions there are loans that are not sustainable. To deal with those people, what we have done is brought the bankruptcy period down to one year from 12 years. Previously, the Victorian notion of shame was attached to being bankrupt, which lasted for 12 years, and that was specified in the legislation that was in this House for more than 100 years. We did that to protect people and, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, to allow children to stay in their own beds in their own homes, as best we can. However, we cannot protect everybody all of the time, but no jurisdiction anywhere does that. Properties are not free. Somebody pays for the land. Somebody pays for a house and at some stage somebody has to pay for the construction and for the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> I will touch on a number of other issues that were raised in the brief time available. Deputy Brassil highlighted New Zealand and Jersey. Neither jurisdiction is part of the European Union. An Irish person can go to Spain and buy a house. That is the law. That is one of the four freedoms that being much debated across the water in the UK. All 28 countries in the European Union currently are still entitled to do that. Capital can move and people can purchase properties. The protection of the purchase of a property from a citizen of the country is a matter for each individual country if it chooses to do so, if it is outside of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> In response to what Deputy Cullinane said, I am always amused by Sinn Féin. The Deputies over there said we got an answer last week; for their information, we did get an answer, we got 20 extra county council seats. Sinn Féin lost county council seats. That is a point of fact for people to understand.</p>

Every economy is attached to employment figures and when one gets employment right, the economy flows and it has flowed to a point where we have grown and grown. I cannot recall the number of quarters of consecutive growth we have had. That is what we have done for the people of Ireland who are back to work and who have the dignity of work. The Deputies over there who are less fair minded than Deputy Harty have no understanding of that. They stand up and speak with the same blinding, horrible negativity time after time. It is the same speech but a different subject of debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Deputy Michael Collins spoke about evictions. The Irish psyche is scarred by evictions. It is part of our history. That is why we introduced all of those actions to try to prevent evictions. It is not what we want. It is the last space that we want anybody to be in. The State purchases more properties than anybody else. Much has been said about vulture funds buying apartment blocks and parcels of land but the State is the largest purchaser. We do that to improve the social housing stock. Last year we purchased 8,500 units, which is a significant number of purchases, so as to allow people to have the dignity of a home they can live in where their children can have consistent education in moving from primary school to secondary school and, hopefully, to college.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I am an employer but I do not see the correlation between that and what has been said about us over here not understanding. I do not know if the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has ever employed anybody, but I know that he and the Taoiseach have more understanding than any of the Deputies opposite will ever have because they are fair minded like Deputy Harty. The other Deputies are not fair minded. It is the same bile, same venom and same nastiness on all occasions but a different speech.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">I acknowledge all those who spoke this evening in support of the motion. Where are all the Minister and Minister of State's backbenchers? Where are the Labour Party Members and the Sinn Féin Members? There are only a few of us in the Chamber and people are suffering distress and trauma. That is the way the Government has it. The Ministers' colleagues are all licking their wounds after the local and European elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> I acknowledge also the great work that is done by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, regarding this matter. This is a timely and important motion that should generate significant cross-party support. For us as rural Deputies, it is a source of significant alarm that farmers and businesses who for years have been operating in good standing with their banks are now being pursued through no fault of their own. It is shameful. This takes me to the heart of why we introduced the motion. As we have noted this evening, the most recent statistical mortgage arrears report from the Central Bank, which the Minister did not quote, to the end of the final quarter of 2018, concerning principal dwelling houses, shows that the significant majority of approximately 14,000 loans acquired by unregulated loan owners in the course of that quarter are performing restructures. The Ministers did not mention that at all. They used the statistics that suited them.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I will take no indignation from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. He said he understands it, but we do not understand it at all. Surely, if he understands it, that means he is complicit in wrongdoing. We know he is complicit in wrongdoing because we saw the bailiffs, the mercenaries, come in from Northern Ireland. We saw the way they kicked out the family in Balbriggan. We saw what happened down in Roscommon and in many other places and the Minister just stood idly by. There were no prosecutions. The Minister was complicit and stood idly by.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">Despite that, people hold the belief that if they simply act in good faith and try their level best the regulatory powers in the State will protect them, but that has not been happening. That is not the experience of so many thousands of families right across the country. Then the Minister tries to lecture us on bringing forward a well-researched motion. The figures are there if he wants to quote them but he does not. I was only in court this morning to witness the shameful treatment in the Four Courts by a major bank, AIB. It is pure disgusting that we put money into it. I voted to save it. That was the biggest political mistake I ever made in my life. I said that countless times here. Our grandchildren will be paying for it. What did we do? We gave it the right to treat people like dirt. That is what is happening. In fact, what is going on in this State is very much like the old Roman circus, where the innocent were thrown to the lions for the amusement and the profit of the elite. It is disgusting. A previous Minister and Taoiseach said vulture funds were good.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Deputy Danny Healy-Rae reminded us of what vultures are; anyone farming or living in the country knows what these funds do. I will not repeat what the Deputy said. </p>
          <p eId="para_719"> If the Minister believes that is an overstatement then I encourage him to spend a week or even a day with any of these families and let him see what it is like to see one's entire life’s work being eaten away from the inside by vicious and heartless vultures. It is like a corrosive rust; it is sick and vile. It was suggested that we were vile; we are just telling the truth. We are Teachtaí Dála, messengers of the people. The Minister forgets that. We are bringing the message to the Parliament, even though it is empty and although the Government is smug, laughing and sneering at us. The electorate will have the final say. </p>
          <p eId="para_720"> Our motion is clear. We are calling on the Government to accept the principle of the conclusions reached by FLAC that there is a significant inequality of arms between the lender and the borrower, where the borrower may have no meaningful influence on the content of the terms of the loan and may be wholly unaware that the lender is reserving the right to sell the loan on to an entity of its choice. That is deceit, plain and simple, and should be called nothing else. It is a profoundly stark and brutally honest assessment of where we are. The power of the lender and the power of the borrower are in no way fair or proportionate. The vultures and other regulated and unregulated entities have absolutely no fear whatsoever of the Central Bank’s code of conduct on mortgage arrears. I have said here numerous times; the regulators are toothless, useless, and fruitless. It is like rubbing margarine or butter into a fat sow's behind. That is what is being done. They are laughing all the way to the bank. The vultures are totally unregulated entities and have absolutely no fear of the Central Bank's code of conduct. The Minister might as well write to Santa Claus, or whistle "Dixie". </p>
          <p eId="para_721"> As our motion noted, a report on this was furnished to the Minister for Finance in 2018. I accept that this element of our motion needed to be clearer, and I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for raising the point. We have no monopoly on knowledge and do not claim to have but nor do we have the resources the Government has either. To be specific, we ask that the provisions of the code of conduct be given legislative force to ensure that all parts of the code are expressly admissible in repossession hearings. This would have the effect of greatly diminishing the imbalance of power between borrower and lender, which is what is really at the heart of the difficulty here. Anyone who wants to see that can see it. We broadly agree with FLAC’s conclusions that not all elements of the report are acceptable or desirable. Given the context and detail of the motion, what we meant is clear even if I accept that it could have been phrased to enable more clarity on the matter. Other speakers mentioned the request of the motion calling on the Government to recognise that so-called vulture funds pose an immediate and overwhelming threat to borrowers in rural and urban Ireland and to accept that unregulated entities have demonstrated a clear unwillingness to abide by voluntary codes of conduct. Deputy Michael McGrath made that quite clear. The vulture funds refused to come before the Oireachtas committee on finance. The Minister refuses to put it into legislation that those funds must appear before that committee. The Minister accepted that the banks will appear before the committee to answer questions and do their best and to face the music. The funds, however, have a <i>carte blanche</i> and are above all of that. They do the dirty work, like the invaders in our country before we got our own democracy, and the Government lets them off with impunity. </p>
          <p eId="para_722"> These points should not be open to negotiation given how clear-cut they are. The funds must be regulated and be made accountable to this House. We are accountable to the people, as is the Government. We do not live in a dictatorship, although sometimes one would wonder. As we have pointed out already, this motion must be seen in the context of what has happened with respect to the sale of mortgage loan books. I refer specifically to the decision by Allied Irish Banks to sell a significant volume of non-performing-to-let loans to Cerberus, involving buy-to-let loans with an approximate value of €1 billion involving at least 2,200 customers. Some people do not even know that this has happened. Does the Minister care about those people? They have been thrown to the wolves, like the Romans did. This is to say nothing of the fact that the decision by AIB was preceded by the sale of 6,139 loans linked to family homes by Permanent TSB, despite such accounts meeting the terms of their agreed arrangements. What is the point in acting in good faith? People might have agreements on restructuring and is meeting those agreements but the whole thing can be cleared like snow off a ditch when the sun comes out. It is totally disgraceful and reprehensible. We must ask ourselves the following important question, namely, if the banks are only too willing to sell off both performing and non-performing loans, then what is the point in engaging with them at all. Why should people bother being responsible when both those who are reckless and those who are acting in good faith are being thrown to the wolves? I am asking the Minister to accept that we have both a real and an emerging problem with this in our State. Communities and families are living in absolute dread of receiving notification that their loans are being sold on. They simply do not have confidence in the regulatory powers to protect their interests. That needs to change and it needs to change quickly. However, the Minister's attitude here tonight has been to dismiss the Rural Independent Group. He has shown his annoyance with us for putting down this motion, as much as to say we thought we had a monopoly. We never claimed that. The Minister does not seem to have any interest in this whatsoever. The Government seems to be in bed with the banks and the vultures. They can do what they like. They are supported, and are given <i>carte blanche</i>. What about the people who pay their hard taxes and who have worked might and main to build up their businesses and to pay their mortgages? This is the treatment they get. They are being let down by this Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The Government has refused a Sinn Féin Bill and a Fianna Fáil Bill. It now appears totally opposed to this motion we have brought forward, which is common sense. It is reflective of the situation and it must be accepted by the Government. The Government is a minority government. We were told there would be new politics. This is not new politics; it is dictatorship. Moreover, Members should look around the Chamber tonight. Is mór an trua an rud seo nach bhfuil éinne anseo. The Labour Party: cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? Tá na Teachtaí ón Lucht Oibre imithe. Where are all the heroes, my colleagues from the hard left? I compliment any Deputy from the House who stood for election to the European Parliament; some of whom have been successful. I wish them all well, including those who were unsuccessful. However, this is shameful. This is such an important issue. I am surprised the Minister for Finance stayed tonight, and I thank him for that. It is seldom he stays; he has no interest in the backbenches. His party is the party of the big people, of those who live up twisting avenues, up the boreen lined with trees and the daffodils growing. It represents the elite, the rich, and to hell with ordinary people. It is a sad day for Ireland when that is the interest Members have. This is not new politics; it is dictatorship. The Government is beholden to the banks and the vulture funds. There is also a situation regarding the funding of political parties. We know what is going on. The process is supposed to be transparent and totally democratic. It is codswallop.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Fine Gael is the party of the landed gentry and big business. There are many cranes in Dublin, but nothing is going on in the rest of the country because AIB and many other banks are closed for business. They are not lending and they are not supporting the economy. They are refusing to support loyal customers they had for decades. A businessman in my parish contacted me recently. He only found out, when he rang his bank, that his loan had been sold on. He had been with the bank for 35 years, and his father had been with the same bank for 30 years before that. He was a good employer, and that is the kind of respect being shown. The Government wants to grow the economy but it is being grown with foreign direct investment and slave labour and labour camps. Think of Turas Nua, which the Government has been forced to abandon. I implore the Minister to reflect on what we have to offer and listen to us. We are elected by the people, as the Minister is. Deputy Harty was more reflective on the situation than we are. He is an excellent Deputy who does his best, and just because he does not blindly support the Government, the Minister stiffly criticised him. When we bring forward a motion and research it, as we are entitled to do, it must be listened to with respect, not with indignation. </p>

As I see it, everyone is committed to trying to find a solution. We have different approaches, perhaps. A very valid point was raised about the lack of participation in debates on important issues. However, the Minister for Finance does not deserve to be criticised because he has been here in respect of every debate that is relevant to his portfolio, as has been his Minister of State.</p>
