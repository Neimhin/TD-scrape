The format of the meeting is that Mr. Considine and Mr. Walsh will make some opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session.  As the meeting is being broadcast by UPC on channel 207 I remind members to switch off their mobile telephones and I advise members in the public gallery to do the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p>

          <from> Mr. Joe Walsh<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">I thank the committee for the invitation and the opportunity to make a short statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">  At the request of the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, I agreed to have my name included in a list of people who would be available to be appointed as public interest directors.  I was appointed to the board of Bank of Ireland in January 2009. I have been a member of the board since then and a member of the nomination and governance committee. The committee oversaw the complete renewal of the board's non-executive directors, none of whose tenure at present pre-dates 2009.  As a member of the committee, I contributed to the successful implementation of compliance with very substantial new governance codes, including the Central Bank of Ireland's corporate governance code for credit institutions and insurance undertakings which became effective from 1 January 2011; the revised version of the UK corporate governance code; the Irish corporate governance annex to the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange; and the Central Bank of Ireland's fitness and probity requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">  Over that time 5,200 people in Bank of Ireland have been put through the required due diligence and assessment in accordance with these stringent fitness and probity requirements.  As a public interest director I see it as my function to ensure continued monitoring of compliance with these standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">  The committee has presided over very significant change in the top echelons of the bank.  Of the 61 people on the board, group executive and direct reports to the group executive, at 30 September 2008, 62% have left or will have left the group in the next couple of months and 28% are in new roles.  All of the non-executive directors have left the group over that period as have five of the eight group executive team.  We now have a new experienced board.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">  The Central Bank mandated a review of corporate governance at the Bank of Ireland by a major international firm in December 2010.  It concluded: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_30">The form of BoI governance complies with best practice guidelines.  We have also found no evidence that there are any major weaknesses in terms of how governance is "lived" at BoI. Finally, when comparing Bol with benchmarks, we found its governance to be broadly in line with international banking peers, and Board effectiveness to be better.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The external review of board effectiveness in the fourth quarter of 2011 concluded that "Board performance exceeded benchmarks on 45 dimensions out of 50 including critical areas such as knowledge, challenge and dissent".  In addition, the Bank of Ireland's restructuring plan has been agreed with the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">  I have been a member of the group remuneration committee from January 2009 to date and became chairman of the remuneration committee in January 2012.  During that period, the committee oversaw a major change in remuneration levels and employment structures in the Bank of Ireland.  Taking into consideration the changes in remuneration and reductions through voluntary redundancy in staff numbers, wage costs to the bank have reduced by about a quarter in the past four years.  There have been major changes to pay structures in terms of absolute salaries, variable pay and pension benefits.   More than 4,500 fewer people are working with the group since January 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">  The remuneration committee has ensured compliance with the very stringent provisions set out by the Minister of Finance, under the subscription agreement in 2009 and his subsequent letter of July 2011.  The latter was disclosed as part of the documentation in connection with the bank's successful recapitalisation, primarily from the private sector, in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">  The remuneration committee led the revision of remuneration structures to ensure adequate reflection of risk in remuneration.  Specifically, it ensured the necessary changes were made to ensure compliance with the European Banking Authority requirements, in so far as possible in circumstances where bonus variable pay is not permitted in the Bank of Ireland.  This has included the identification of staff with particular influence on the risk profile of the group, the implementation of mandatory risk goals for all executives and managers, and the updating of the group remuneration policy to reflect the focus on risk.  </p>
          <p eId="para_35">  The committee ensured appropriate public disclosures on remuneration in the annual report and accounts and Pillar 3.  The Central Bank of Ireland reviewed the group's compliance versus the EBA guidelines in 2011.  In addition, the Financial Services Authority reviewed the UK subsidiary's remuneration policy statement for 2011.  The remuneration committee made significant revisions to group remuneration policy and required management to conduct significant upgrading of the group's database of information on employees' remuneration.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">  As a board member and public interest director whose career has spanned both the business and political spheres, I take a keen interest in how Bank of Ireland has met its stated strategy of supporting and benefitting from economic recovery in Ireland.  With regard to lending, I shall deal with mortgages first.  With an existing share of about 20% of the mortgage market, Bank of Ireland has provided about 40% of the new mortgages in the market in the year to date.  The mortgage market has increased by 7% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  This was the first positive year on year growth since 2006 and the third quarter in a row to show an increase.  According to the Irish Mortgage Council, approvals in the third quarter of 2012 are up 14% year on year supporting the bank's expectation that this improving trend will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">  Bank of Ireland continues to demonstrate its commitment to the mortgage market. For example, a €1.5 billion mortgage fund was launched in December 2011 to support first-time buyers and movers purchasing a home during 2012.  Due to the oversubscription of applications to the fund a new €2 billion mortgage fund was launched in October 2012 to cover the remainder of 2012 and 2013.  Other initiatives include the bank's negative equity mortgages for both those trading up and those trading down which was launched in April 2012, participation in the NAMA deferred payment initiative and hosting the Bank of Ireland's home buyers' week in October 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">  I shall now discuss mortgage arrears management.  Bank of Ireland has mobilised significantly around the management of mortgage arrears.  It is a large-scale programme that is well under way in the bank and supports our customers who are facing, or are in, financial difficulty with their mortgage repayments.  In the past year we have significantly increased the number of staff involved in our mortgage arrears programme.  We now have more than 700 staff across the group involved in the management of mortgage arrears.  We have made considerable investment in the training of our staff which is supported by internationally recognised experts in the field of mortgage arrears management.  We have the largest bank branch network in the country and we have trained mortgage adviser experts in each branch.  We also have mobile advisers throughout the country who can meet customers in their homes or an alternative location to their branches.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">  We offer restructure options to between 400 and 500 customers every week and have added more long-term solutions to our products.  We have formally restructured more than 16,000 mortgages and more than 86% of those customers whose mortgages have been formally restructured are meeting their contracted payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">We also have a significant number of customers on informal arrangements with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> Bank of Ireland business banking has achieved, and will exceed, its €3.5 billion SME lending target for 2012. This figure represents the bank's approvals for new and increased credit facilities for businesses and farmers. Credit approved for customers seeking restructured facilities are excluded from these figures as reported by Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The €3.5 billion represents a 16% increase in approvals in the year to date when compared with 2011, which is as a result of increased demand from several sectors in the Irish economy. There has been increased demand from customers in the health care, manufacturing and hospitality sectors, and lending to farmers has also remained strong. Increased demand for asset and commercial loan finance has also been a feature. Of particular importance is the fact that lending to businesses and farmers has increased in all regions throughout the country, underpinning Bank of Ireland's confidence in its nationwide branch network. Lending to Dublin businesses was up by 27% compared to last year. With more than 40% of businesses located in the capital the bank believes this indicates that confidence is returning, as evidenced by the growth we have been seeing in credit demand from viable businesses in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Bank of Ireland has just completed its seventh national enterprise programme in which we organised 80 events and networking meetings that more than 5,000 businesses and farmers attended. Some 1,500 businesses also took the opportunity to showcase their products and services in Bank of Ireland branches. In 2013, the bank will roll out a series of free SME lending clinics which aim to explain the lending application process primarily to start-up and micro-sized businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> We have an increased lending target of €4 billion for next year and we are determined to achieve it.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_45">Thank you Mr. Walsh.  I invite Mr. Considine to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Mr. Tom Considine<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_46">I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to appear before the joint committee.  At the request of the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, I agreed to have my name included in a list of people who would be available to be appointed as public interest directors.  I was appointed from that list to the board of the Bank of Ireland in January 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">  As a board member I worked on the development of a strategy to stabilise the bank in order to safeguard the investment made by the taxpayer and to provide the public with an effective banking service.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">  As a board member I have contributed to the significant progress made by Bank of Ireland in reducing the risk exposure of the State and moving it ever closer to being able to fund its operations without State support.  In September 2008, the State was guaranteeing €136 billion of liabilities for the bank under the exceptional eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, generally known as ELG.  This amount  was down to less than €26 billion in November 2012.  In its trading update on 13 November 2012, the bank announced that it had prepared for and was ready for the expiry of the ELG scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">  The bank has made significant progress in funding itself in the market without the support of the State guarantee.  Let me give an example.  Last week it raised €250 million in ten-year subordinated debt and last month it raised €1 billion in three-year asset-covered securities.  Both issues received strong market support even though they were not supported by a State guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">  Bank of Ireland received a total cash injection of €4.8 billion from the Exchequer and is very grateful to the Government and the taxpayer for that support.  The public interest directors and the board and management of the bank are making every effort to repay that money.  Already the bank has made cash payments of €2.7 billion to the Exchequer.  This is composed of guarantee fees of €1.3 billion, interest on the preference shares and on the contingent capital instrument of €500 million and €900 million in respect of warrants repurchased and recapitalisation fees.  In addition, I am confident the remaining State holding of €2.8 billion of preference shares and contingent capital, which carry a coupon of circa 10% per annum plus the 15% of equity held by the State, will be profitable investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">  I have been a member of the board audit committee since January 2009.  In that role I have taken a particular interest in ensuring the system of internal controls is fit for purpose and that the provision for bad and doubtful debts included in the accounts is well supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">  As a public interest director I was anxious to ensure that risk governance at Bank of Ireland would be developed to ensure as far as possible that taxpayer support would not be required in the future.  In that context I was asked by the board to chair a group of non-executive directors to determine in the light of recent experience the most appropriate risk governance arrangements for the group and to recommend any necessary changes to the existing governance arrangements.  That group was established in February 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">  The work of that group had a strong public interest dimension because it was aimed at putting in place systems and structures that would avoid a repeat of the events that led to the taxpayer being called upon to support the bank.  As chairman of this group, I worked to bring about significant enhancements to the way in which risk was managed in the group.  The board readily accepted a recommendation that board-level engagement in risk oversight should be materially increased with particular attention being given to ensuring that risks were properly identified, assessed, controlled and managed and that strategy was informed by and aligned with the group's risk appetite.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">  To put these changes on a firm footing, the board agreed in July 2009 to establish a board risk committee of non-executive directors and to restructure the executive risk committees.  To support the new risk structure, the board agreed to fund a programme of work designed to build up a uniform management information system across the Bank of Ireland group.  As a result of these changes, the board of the bank is in a much stronger position to direct, control and monitor the business.  As chairman of the board risk committee I played a key role in these developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">  The major enhancement initiatives identified in 2009 have now been implemented and the progress the group has made in enhancing risk management has been recognised by external advisers.  In December 2010, Boston Consulting Group commented in its review commissioned in response to the Central Bank's risk mitigation programme that, "risk management at BoI is broadly aligned with peer best practice.  There are no critical gaps and in some areas there is rapid improvement".</p>
          <p eId="para_56">  In April 2012, Promontory Financial Group commented that its review commissioned in response to the Central Bank's risks mitigation programme that: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_57">...evidenced considerable strengths in the Group's risk governance framework reflecting a sustained focus from the Court in recent years.  Following the crisis, the profile of risk within the Group has been greatly enhanced and the Court and the Executive team are clearly focused on risk issues which receive detailed attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">  The board, the board risk committee and management are continuing to develop the risk governance structure to keep pace with best practice in the market and with the changing macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">  I am happy to answer any questions from members.</p>

When Mr. Boucher appeared before this committee he said the only difference between public interest directors and appointed directors of Bank of Ireland was that the former were not elected.

In the public interest, as far as I am concerned, I bring my background as a public representative of many years, my involvement in industry and in dealing with the public to bear on that.  There are several aspects to the public interest, as far as I am concerned.  Number one is the State because the State has put a lot of money into the particular bank with which I am involved, Bank of Ireland.  Number two is the citizens of the State because the taxpayers funded that and they will need-----</p>

          <p eId="para_120">First of all, Chairman, you are absolutely right that all directors have the same legal underpinning of their roles and are all charged with the same job of running the bank.  Section 48 of the 2010 Act, with which the committee will be familiar, makes it clear that all directors of the covered institutions have an overriding requirement to take care of the public interest.

You were not elected to the board but were appointed by the Minister for Finance in 2009 and have served on the board of the bank for four years.  I am not interested in what other directors are doing.  Bank of Ireland is partly owned by the State and those directors have a job to do.  You also have a specific job to do and what I want to hear about this morning is what you have been doing as a public interest director.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Yes, I would be delighted to do that.  As a public interest director I have done a large amount of work in developing the governance structure, and the risk structure in particular, of Bank of Ireland.  The outcome of that has been to put very fundamental and far-reaching proposals to the board, which were adopted.  As chairman of the risk committee, I have overseen their implementation.  I am perfectly happy to stand over that.  As a public interest director, I would consider that one of the main objectives of the State is to ensure that this never happens again.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">As a member of the bank's nomination of governance committee, I would have spearheaded an insistence that the Bank of Ireland comply with the various regulatory authority missives that I outlined in my original statement.  Similarly, I was very strong on the fact that compliance was fully adhered to concerning the subscription agreement and the Minister's letter.  As we know, there has been some public commentary about the lack of regulation in banking up to then.  As a public interest director representing the State, which has a 15% holding in Bank of Ireland, I felt that I had to be strong on those areas in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I have a final question.  A number of measures have been put in place, both by the current Administration and the previous one, concerning banks engaging with small and medium enterprises and distressed mortgages.  In his role, I am sure that Mr. Walsh is familiar with the level of despair that currently exists both in the business and residential sectors.  On any occasion at board level, has Mr. Walsh taken up the task of dealing with either the forthcoming insolvency legislation or particular measures to provide credit for small and medium enterprises?</p>

          <from> Mr. Joe Walsh<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_127">Yes, I can confirm that I contributed strongly at board level, first of all in relation to SMEs.  My background was as the manager of a small business in Clonakilty, a little town in west Cork with which the Chairman will be familiar.  The fact is that a target of €3.5 billion was given for new and increased lending.  Not alone have we met that but we have exceeded it.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">  As regards mortgages, like everybody else I was extremely concerned about those people who got into difficulties mainly due to factors outside their control.  Because of the economic situation, processes were put in place in tandem with the Central Bank to ensure that they were treated fairly.  Packages of measures were put in place to ameliorate the worst effects of the recession on those people.</p>

          <from> Mr. Tom Considine<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_129">First of all, in the case of business lending, the reality is that we want to be the number one business bank in Ireland.  We want to lend money because if we do not do so, we will not put the bank on a sustainable basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">  Second, as my colleague has just said concerning the lending that we have done, to be absolutely clear, some €3.5 billion plus of new money has gone into the system.  We talk about additional new money.  In other words, if a person has an overdraft of €100,000 and he or she wants it increased to €150,000, we count the €50,000, not the €150,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">  There is no doubt that businesses have difficulties, but there are systems in place.  First of all, we are getting about 1,000 applications a week.  Approximately 82% of those are successful.  Where people have a problem there is an appeals system.  In addition, they can go to the Credit Review Office if they are not satisfied.  The Credit Review Office is an innovative and useful addition but very small numbers are going there.  In time, it will be possible to assess how credit performed that was granted as a result of that intervention.  These systems are there and we can be judged by reference to that when the time comes, although it will take some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">  If anyone has problems with Bank of Ireland, I am happy to provide contact numbers with the committee when I leave here today.  Those numbers can be called and if, in the unlikely event that it does not resolve the problem, I would ask members of the committee to give me a call.  That is an open offer.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">I welcome Mr. Walsh and Mr. Considine here today.  I want to read one sentence to them from a parliamentary reply given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, on 9 October 2012 when he was asked about the role of public interest directors.  His specific response on the Dáil record of 9 October was as follows: "Public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or the Department of Finance."  The Minister made it absolutely clear that there was not a formal reporting relationship between the public interest directors and himself or with the Department of Finance.  In view of the Minister's stated position, I would consider it inappropriate for the witnesses to have that relationship when the Minister has made it absolutely clear that there is not a formal reporting relationship.  I suspect that it would have been in breach of the witnesses' duties as public interest directors to have a formal relationship with the Central Bank that was different from that of other directors.  Would Mr. Considine agree with that?</p>

          <p eId="para_145">No, but I wish to be helpful to the Deputy if he could give me a minute.  The way I look at the public interest is that there are a number of dimensions to it.  At the State level, the first thing we have to do is repay the Exchequer and the taxpayer by remunerating the money they have loaned us - in other words, the €2.8 billion of preference shares and contingent capital at about 10% a year.  We must enable the Minister to be in a position to cash in his shares if, in future, he so wishes.  The second thing is to provide a stable banking system to support the economy.  As the Chairman said, there is a real need to support enterprise and the rebuilding of the mortgage market.  We are doing both of those things.  Third, the governance changes I referred to are being made to ensure that never again will the Exchequer and the taxpayer be called upon to bail out the bank.  The fourth matter at that level is to generate the capital we will need to support that lending to the business and mortgage sectors.  In my view, they are top-level public interest requirements to which we must pay attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">  The next level down is the sectoral level, which is about consumers, business people and mortgage borrowers.  While the Minister has not given us any specific directions in that area, it is clear from the guidelines that he has given us on lending to SMEs, that it is an area where he wants support for the economy.  Equally, it is clear from all of the debate that is going on about mortgages that the Minister wants us to give attention - as the Central Bank has made clear, as well - to how mortgage arrears are worked out.  That is what I see as the public interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">On the investment by the taxpayer in Bank of Ireland in particular, it was mentioned that it was €4.8 billion, but approximately €1 billion has been paid off and the State is receiving an interest rate of 10%, which is a high rate, on most of the remaining investment.  I estimate that approximately 5% of the €64 billion that has been put into the banking sector in this country has gone to Bank of Ireland – currently a maximum of approximately €4 billion at this stage.  What was the maximum shareholding the State had in Bank of Ireland?  The current percentage is 15%.  Does Mr. Considine expect the percentage to reduce further?</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I wish to separate Bank of Ireland from all the other failed banking institutions that we have had before the committee on various occasions such as Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and AIB, which are totally State owned.  Yesterday we had Irish Life &amp; Permanent before the committee.  The maximum State involvement in Bank of Ireland was of the order of 30%.  It has now reduced to 15% and the bank hopes to reduce it further.  Bank of Ireland is in a completely different category from all the other institutions in that the State has only a small and reducing shareholding in it.  Mr. Considine was invited to join the board in 2008 and he joined it at the beginning of 2009.  What were the bank’s annual losses then and what are the loss projections for next year?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">As the crisis was evolving, it took time for the losses to work through because of the accounting rules with which Deputy Fleming is familiar.  The peak underlying losses were not reached until 2010.  We are now working our way through the process.  The underlying loss in 2010 was €3.5 billion.  It was down to €1.5 billion in 2011.  The underlying loss in the first half of 2012 was €907 million.  As the chief executive said, we hope to move into a better place in 2014 and to see the end of the loss-making period.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">Deputy Fleming got off lightly.  It is a pity that the increase in interest rates on credit cards had to be introduced, especially in Christmas week.  Bank of Ireland has approximately 500,000 credit cards in circulation.  Approximately 91% of those are active.  The vast majority of people pay what they owe on their credit cards each month.  Under those circumstances people get 56 days interest-free credit.  In addition, there is no annual account fee or transaction fee for purchases at point of sale.  Neither was there an increase in the rates paid by those with student cards.  On the Clear credit card – 4% of accounts - the increase rate will increase by 4%.  The Classic credit card – 12% of accounts – will increase by 2% and the remaining personal credit cards will increase by 0.7%.</p>

Therefore, approximately 50% of people do not pay interest at all, which leaves approximately 200,000 customers paying interest on their credit cards.

A continuous review is taking place of the rates the bank charges and the rates it pays on deposits.  Without a functioning banking system that is able to stand on its own two feet, go out in the market and raise money, we will not be able to support the economy as we would wish.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">Yes.  I said “finally”.  The bank expects to be out of the bank guarantee system early in the new year.  Of all the banks that have come before the committee, the State shareholding in Bank of Ireland has reduced from 30% to 15% and the bank hopes to reduce it further.  Our definition of the success of the public interest directors is that they will work themselves out of a job because of the hope that in a few years time Bank of Ireland will have repurchased all of its shares from the State and it will return to being a private company with no requirement for public interest directors when there is no public funding in the bank.  I look forward to that day coming soon.</p>

The amount under guarantee at September 2008 was €136 billion and that is down to approximately €25 billion now.  Bank of Ireland has been in discussion with the Department of Finance and it has signalled its wish to be taken off the guarantee.  The Minister extended the guarantee for the first half of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">A considerable amount of money is being paid under the guarantee. We have paid more than €1 billion already and last year it was approximately €450 million.

We previously met with other board members of banks and it is fair to say that we were unhappy with significant parts of what they told us.  Much of the tetchiness the witnesses may encounter this morning results from the fact that we were unhappy about the level of engagement by Bank of Ireland and Mr. Boucher in particular.  It is true that we only own 15% of Bank of Ireland but that bank would not exist without the Irish taxpayer.  I had hoped public interest directors would hold positions which differed from the other directors.  While Mr. MacSharry, Mrs. Hayes, Mr. Walsh and Mr. Considine are undoubtedly fine directors, I have yet to see any justification for appointing public interest directors.  I hope the witnesses will help me to change my opinion.  Were they additional to the existing board or did they replace two other board members?</p>

Bank of Ireland's board has included people from the public service in the past but they were not public service directors.  They had careers in the public service.  One such individual was on the board when we joined it in January 2009.  Mr. MacSharry was on the board at one stage, as was Ken Whitaker.  The idea that public servants could contribute to the board of Bank of Ireland is not new.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">It depends on one's interests.  As I noted in my opening statement, I have taken a particular interest in the governance structure of the bank and making the changes required to ensure the board has tighter control over what happens so that this type of situation does not arise again and the Exchequer does not have to step in.  I can only speculate whether someone else appointed to the board would have taken the same interest.  I am chairman of the risk committee because I took that interest.  I outlined in my opening statement the type of changes we have made.  We have validated those changes by getting people who are recognised in the industry to examine whether we are meeting best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">  My overriding interest as a member of the board is to ensure the taxpayer is repaid and that the bank is developed in a way that enables it to support the economy.  If the bank does not support the economy, all this will be more difficult for everyone.</p>

When a dispute arises and it is clear that debt forgiveness is required, the bank takes the view that it is not willing to give it, whereas the Government, the taxpayer and the Oireachtas believe debt forgiveness should be provided for.  Does Mr. Considine see his role of public interest director as batting for the bank's opinion or the taxpayer's opinion?</p>

          <p eId="para_202">The public interest is much wider than that.  The public interest comprises several dimensions.  The first and most important element is a stable system.  The State must be able to get out of this mess so that we can get back to normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">That involves repaying the State, remunerating the debt to the State and making the changes I spoke about earlier and also generating the capital that will be needed to support the lending the State will require if it is to make a full recovery, which I believe it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> At the sectorial level, there are a number of competing interests. On the one hand is the requirement to repay the State and remunerate the money it has lent us, which is a reasonable expectation for the taxpayer, but this must be balanced with the interest of the people who are in difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">I fully accept that.  We all want the banks to be able to return to lending.  We all accept that the banks play a very important role in the economy.  The personal insolvency legislation, of which I assume Mr. Considine is aware, is very targeted to the people in most difficulty.  Mr. Considine has not answered the specific question on whether he sees a distinctive role for board member appointed in the public interest in the context of that legislation.  Does Mr. Considine believe he needs more legislative support from Government to allow public interest board members to function differently?  Clearly, at present, public interest directors function in the same way as every other board member.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  The people who talk to me across the constituency and in the country feel very hurt by the banks, in particular by Bank of Ireland.  They see that people who are in distress with their mortgages are not getting the support in terms of debt relief from the bank.  They see that the taxpayer has invested €5.7 billion in the bank, yet the bank has increased the rate of interest on credit card debt and has not reduced the variable interest rate on mortgages in line with the ECB interest rates.  They also see bank services being reduced in rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">  They also know that Mr. Walsh was a former Minister and Mr. Considine was a former Secretary General and both retired prior to the age that normal people retire at and are in receipt of pensions from the public pay purse above €100,000.  They will know from the details of this committee that they are the highest paid public interest directors in the State.  To date the amount of fees paid to the two public interest directors totals €600,000.  This is on top of the lavish public sector pensions.  When the legislation was enacted to create public interest directors, the people believed that those who were appointed under the legislation would protect their interest.  It is clear that is not the case.  We dealt with this yesterday.  Public interest directors are the same as any other director of a board.  Given the amount of money they receive from the public purse - in particular Mr. Considine was granted the benefit of additional years in his retirement - is it appropriate that they have received an additional €600,000 since 2009 as a director of Bank of Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I must disagree strongly.  I made this point yesterday, that this was a sweetheart deal.  In 2008, the Minister decided to talk to the Opposition parties on public interest directors and they put forward nominees, but they had absolutely no strength, no mandate and no specific role outside what another director has.  The Minister appointed four former politicians, from the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party and three former Secretaries General.  It allowed the witnesses to draw down hundred of thousands of euro in expenses over a period.  I do not see any positive impact on the banks from the role they have played on the boards of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">  The former Minister, Mr. Walsh stated he was on the remuneration committee since January 2009 and that the remuneration was in line with the terms laid down by the Government.  Mr. Walsh was on the remuneration committee when the bank paid out €66,370,000 in bonuses between September 2008 to December 2010.  How can he stand over the fact that was allowed to happen when it was in complete breach of the Government guidelines that no bonuses were to be paid following the Government bank guarantee?</p>

Do Mr. Walsh and Mr. Considine, as public interest directors, intend to object to this increase?

          <p eId="para_242">It is unfortunate that these charge increases must be introduced.  Bank of Ireland operates a credit card business, which is competitive.  How much the bank should charge for services in the market is a matter for management of the bank.  We want to remain in that market and to be successful there.  The interest rate in respect of the Clear credit card, which accounts for 4% of all accounts, will increase by 4% to 17.8%.  The Classic credit card, which accounts for 12% of accounts, will increase by 2%.  Interest rates on the remaining cards will increase by 0.7%.  We would like to be in a position not to have to announce increases.  However, if the Bank of Ireland is to remain viable, it is necessary to increase charges.  We do not like doing this but this is what is required to ensure a viable banking system in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">It is necessary in all of this to start at the beginning and to ask why we are deleveraging.  We are deleveraging because we want to reduce the risk to the taxpayer.  This goes back to the PCAR exercise conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland, which led to the recent recapitalisation of the Bank of Ireland.  Assessments were made at that time as to what type of discount to book value would be needed to do this.  As a board, that is our main concern.  The actual discount was less than what had been allowed for in the PCAR exercise.  Therefore, the deleveraging exercise was capital positive.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">To get to the crux of the issue, in this case which was the largest real estate portfolio acquisition completed in Europe in 2011, the head of the non-core division of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Ben Hoey, which was responsible for selling it to Kennedy Wilson is now the managing director of that same loan portfolio. He is now the managing director of Kennedy Wilson in Europe. Kennedy Wilson is one of the investors within Bank of Ireland. It is part of the consortium with Fairfax and Wilbur Ross. As public interest directors, do alarm bells not start ringing? These people know Bank of Ireland has to deleverage and sell its assets and is involved in a fire sale and in my view these people are asset stripping the company and, therefore, are asset stripping the taxpayer.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">The facts do not seem to support the Deputy's argument.  As I said, the PCAR exercise conducted by the Central Bank made an assessment of what discount would be required to deleverage.  The discount achieved was better than what was assessed.  In the business world, people are head hunted.  If one is doing a deal with a company and sees a person one likes and that person is offered a job, does that raise a suspicion immediately?  As a member of the board of directors, all I can tell the committee is what I see, and what I see are rigorous controls.  I know nothing that would in any way raise the kind doubts being implied.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">That is not going to wash here because the public interest requires justice to be seen to be done for what is ultimately felt by those in mortgage arrears or employed by small and medium-sized enterprises that are haemorrhaging staff and money or are near closure.  There are consequences but these should ultimately look towards justice.  As the role of the witnesses is that of public interest director, I am not suggesting they have brought the public interest into disrepute.  On the contrary, I am of the opinion that the bank is in a far better position now.  The market capitalisation of the bank is about €3.6 billion.  The reason for the increased value of a bank such as Bank of Ireland is that there were projected earnings to be made on the loans that were given out.  As the witnesses are aware, many of the mortgages given out in Ireland from 2005 to 2007 are 62.5% in arrears in the city of Dublin.  People have been given loans that will be paid back over 25 to 40 years.  It was a form of lending that had no basis in reality.  However, the repayments have a basis in reality when people's relative incomes have decreased and their capacity to repay those mortgages have decreased.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">  The substantial element is that we as a generation, who are not represented on the board, are the people who are feeling the brunt of it.  I do not think there is anything in Bank of Ireland or any other bank to recognise debt forgiveness or debt write-down.  As my colleague Deputy Dara Murphy pointed out, this is the generation that is supposed to drive the economy and, at the same time, it is not getting a break out of what was a form of lending that had no basis in reality other than trying to achieve the bottom line in profit.  Where is the justice in the business model that Bank of Ireland is pursuing and if it is worth €3.6 billion, as we have been told, how is it that it worth that amount and where is the profit to be made?  Perhaps the witnesses will explain where the justice will be for the people who are hurting.</p>

To me, that is an injustice.  This is one of the issues I would like the witnesses to stand up for.  There should be a moratorium on any form of profit-making on those mortgages lent out between 2002 and 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">We must be aware that for a period there will be no margins on any mortgages between those periods. The sense of justice does not seem to exist. The public interest might be served in that the Bank of Ireland is paying back the €4.8 billion the State pumped into it. That is not the kernel of what the public wants. It wants to see the benefit going to households more than to the State.</p>

From where I sit, the bottom line has a number of different constituencies, including the State insisting - and rightly so - that the money it gave to the Bank of Ireland is remunerated at a significant rate of interest and that the Government gets back its money on the equity it holds, whenever it chooses.  The State has a critical interest in ensuring the bank is sufficiently strong to support the development of the economy.  Unless there is a banking system that can support and lend to the SME as well as the mortgage sectors, we will not have an economy.</p>

Is Mr. Walsh comfortable that he is doing the right things by the country and by the bank?  Following Mr. Boucher's attendance at this joint committee, I sent a letter to the Minister for Finance asking him to withdraw his support for Mr. Boucher as the chief executive of Bank of Ireland due to his contemptuous attitude to the members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Mr. Boucher was on the board that drove Bank of Ireland on to the rocks.  I wonder if that culture has changed?  Is that part of Mr. Boucher's culture and how much influence does he still have on the board?</p>

          <p eId="para_307">With all due respect, the performance of the bank is assessed on the balance sheet.  The public interest is not decided by the balance sheet.  The people have bailed out the banks and given them a life line but there does not seem to be an equitable approach to dealing with people who are bearing the brunt of bad banking.  In any other form of business, an entity with the debts of Bank of Ireland would have been wiped out and disappeared, but we helped it to survive.  I am not happy with Mr. Boucher's attitude.  I do not like the attitude that it is the bank's balance sheet that ultimately matters most.  There is far more at stake.  I am concerned about the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">Let us be clear about this, Deputy Spring, I did not say the balance sheet was the most important thing.  I said the performance of the bank was important.  The State invested €4.8 billion in equity in the Bank of Ireland and the bank has made repayments to the tune of €2.7 billion.  As the next year goes on, I think it will reduce that much further.  In relation to a number of other matters, it was given a directive to allocate €3.5 billion to SMEs and has exceeded that figure in new and increased lending.  The Bank of Ireland has earmarked an increased amount for next year, some €4 billion for small businesses.  The Bank of Ireland made provision of €1.5 billion last year for mortgages.  That was fully taken up and a further €2 billion is allocated for mortgages at the end of this year and for next year.  They have built up the number and capacity of people dealing with arrears to 739 staff and a trained person to deal with mortgage arrears provides this service in every single branch of the 250 bank branches throughout the country.  There is a menu of products to deal with mortgage arrears.  Let me add that Bank of Ireland has the least worst mortgage arrears.  Some 90% of 161,000 people who have owner-occupier mortgages are meeting their commitments fully.  By any of those yardsticks, Bank of Ireland is contributing to the development of the economy.  The indications are that Ireland Inc. is slowly returning to economic development.  Bank of Ireland will be there in the new year to assist the Government in developing the economy further.</p>

Since the crash the witnesses have got €0.5 million for being public interest directors on the board and yet the people who paid for the bailout of the banks, and effectively for the salaries of Mr. Boucher and the witnesses through that bailout, are still on their knees in mortgage distress and in small and medium businesses that have been crushed.  The witnesses tell us they have to preserve the best interests of the bank and that somehow that will be good for us all in the end.  Do they not understand how people view that and why they believe nothing has changed, that they are still being screwed and the same people who were in charge are still in charge and are well protected?

I understand at first hand how the public react to matters and, on the matter of the economy to which the Deputy specifically referred, the public made a decision and the impact was devastating.  I do not blame the public for that because they had a right to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">  I took up my current role in early 2009.  The Deputy mentioned small businesses and mortgage holders and the record will show that the Bank of Ireland demonstrably has made greater facilities available to small businesses and mortgage holders than any of the other banks in the country.  It has acceded to and complied with requests from the Minister and the Department from time to time not alone to the letter but to the spirit of the directives that were given.</p>

Given that, does Mr. Walsh not think the very least that people could expect is that there would be a clear and transparent line of accountability between their public interest directors and the public and their public representatives?  The witnesses are there to champion the interests of distressed mortgage holders, the public and the taxpayers first and foremost before any priorities the bank as an entity might have.  Do the witnesses not think that is the very least people would expect from them and if that is not the case there is no point in them being there?</p>

          <p eId="para_329">I would say we do that, but the Deputy's interpretation of the public interest and mine is different.  I have a wider interpretation of what is the public interest.  It is in the public interest that the State gets paid back the money it gave to the Bank of Ireland and in the meantime that it is remunerated at a rate of around 10% for that part of it which is not equity.  It is also in the interests of the State that the governance of the banking system should be strengthened to ensure we do not have a repeat of what happened previously.  It is in the interests of the State that the bank should be strong enough to lend to SMEs and mortgage holders, and the Bank of Ireland is doing that.  The bank has about 20% of the mortgage market and currently the rate of approvals is about 40%.  In the case of the SMEs, as we have said, we have exceeded our target of €3.5 billion.  It is not because we were given that target that we are lending that money, we are lending it because we want a bank that functions.  We want to be in the business-----</p>

          <p eId="para_335">The position is that in any modern democracy it is important to have a stable banking arm and, demonstrably again since 2009 under the leadership of Mr. Boucher, the Bank of Ireland has transformed itself and is in a position to be supportive of small businesses and mortgages and to assist distressed mortgages and a range of areas.  The bank has been supportive of the development role of the Government in the economy and that is in the public interest.  Some might not like to hear it, but the fact of the matter is the economy is slowly recovering.  That information is coming from a number of economic commentators and researchers whose job it is to examine such matters.  What we have done with mortgage arrears for example is to train, recruit and put in place more than 700 people to restructure mortgages to the tune of 400 to 500 per week.  We have retained our branch structure throughout the length and breadth of the country and trained personnel in every single one of those branches to give intensive care to people and provide a menu of packages because we want to keep as many people as possible in their homes.  Of the 161,000 mortgage holders, 90% are meeting their targets.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">It is not a criticism; it is an observation.  </p>
          <p eId="para_340">   The witnesses are welcome.  Yesterday, I said I had a feeling of unreality listening to contributions.  It was akin to the film “The Truman Show”.  Today, I feel I am in a fog.  The reason is that this is the first opportunity to have an appraisal of the job of national interest directors on the board of Bank of Ireland.  They have been in place since 2009.  One could ask what has happened in that period.  First, what is the job description of the national interest directors?  We have discovered they do not have one; it is vague.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">  Second, what has happened in the period to be appraised?  The bank effectively went bankrupt and the biggest exercise that had to be carried out was, first, to get an injection of share capital from the State, which it did.  I was at the annual general meeting where it was approved.  It was a joke that the life-saving injection had to be approved by the shareholders.  It is similar to having a formal meeting to approve life support for a patient in a hospital.  It was absurd, but people went through the charade.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">  The next big exercise was the transfer of the NAMA loans to see how it would affect the bank.  They are the overview parameters.  The Bank of Ireland had a line-up on foot of the PwC exercise of €16 billion of loans to go into NAMA and in the three months before the end of 2009 that figure was, unbelievably, revised downwards to €12 billion.  I asked myself why.  The question was if €4 billion less loans are being transferred to NAMA at a 30% discount it meant there would be a €1.2 billion less requirement for capital, which would keep the bank out of State majority control.  That was the first thing.  As board directors, perhaps collectively and individually, they should have spotted that and wondered if it was a good judgment call.  It was a bad judgment call because the prudential capital assessment review that took place in March 2009 indicated that if Bank of Ireland got approximately €5 billion before the year end all would be well and it could stay outside State control.  That was not a very honest exercise.  It would be much better if the bank had sufficient capital to do what it needed to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">  Other speakers this morning asked where the bank stands now as regards writing down to honest collectable amounts the loans it had advanced over the period up to 2008.  The answer to that lies hidden somewhere in the fog of what the executive management, Mr. Richard Boucher, brought to us a few weeks ago.  Does either of the witnesses know the overall loan book of the bank off the top of their heads?</p>

As I am sure both witnesses are aware, it is the clear intent of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the Government that there would be debt forgiveness as part of the personal insolvency legislation.  Mr. Boucher is reported in Monday's newspapers as "categorically ruling out reducing a portion of the personal debt of any of its customers".  Can the witnesses tell me their position?  Do they agree with Mr. Boucher or, as public interest directors, do they disagree with his position?</p>

          <p eId="para_393">I am going to make an intervention here because, unfortunately, this is reflecting a similar situation we had with Bank of Ireland when the bank's representatives appeared before us.  Deputy Donnelly is not asking about blanket forgiveness.  He is asking that on a case-by-case basis, in situations where people cannot meet the full sum of their mortgage, with regard to any forbearance that can be given to them, will there be situations where there will be debt adjustment, debt write-off, debt write-down or debt forgiveness, whatever vernacular or vocabulary we apply to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_394">  The personal insolvency legislation is about getting people out of their current difficulties and back functioning in the economy.  There are people in despair who cannot see daylight on the horizon because of debt that is shored upon them.  The question that is being put to you, Mr. Considine and Mr. Walsh - and Deputy Mathews has pointed out that the CEO is a servant of the board - is whether you, as public interest directors, envisage a situation where people who are in insurmountable debt will be able to avail of the insolvency legislation and have some of that debt lifted off their shoulders.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I am making sure that there is a structure in place which will operate the new legislation when it comes in.  Where individuals have debts that are unmanageable, it is a matter for the executive of the bank to deal with that within the structure that we are putting in place.  I am a non-executive director; I am not an executive director.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I can read out the rules of what a non-executive director is.  I will read them to you, if you give me one moment.  "A non-executive director is a director who does not have a contract of service with the company and normally serves the company on a part-time basis."  Your role is that you were not actually elected to the board; you were appointed by the Minister of the day and have been there for the last four years.  As a non-executive director, you will have a management function in the running of the business other than assisting in the deliberations of the board.  You have a running function as a non-executive director.  You direct how the bank operates.  None the less, your legal powers and duties are identical to those of executive directors and for this reason you should ensure you have the same ability to obtain information from within the company as other directors, even though in practice you may use mainly summarised information submitted in the reports of the board.  How you gather the information on which you make your decisions can be in detail or in summary.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">  More specifically, you have a duty of care which is required both by executive and non-executive directors.  In your situation, your duty of care is in reference to being a public interest director.  Your duties as a non-executive director will be intermittent and, as a result, you are not expected to give the same continuous attention to the company's affairs as that given by other executive directors.  We accept that.  However, Mr. Considine and Mr. Walsh are both there, having been well remunerated for four years to the tune of €500,000 each.  On behalf of this committee, I am asking you what are you doing in the public interest.  You are servants of the State, operating on this board.  I can put out all the information here.  It says quite specifically that your duty under the legislation is owed to the Minister on behalf of the State.  That is why you are in there.  Your duty takes priority over any other duty you have as a director, even if it becomes inconsistent with the duty of the bank.  That is what it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Legislation has been passed and people are hanging on by their fingernails, hoping for hope. I am not interested in what Bank of Ireland is doing. I am interested in what the public interest directors are doing with respect to the legislation. That is what the committee wants to know. I apologise for interjecting but we have arrived at the kernel of the roles and responsibilities of public interest directors. Tell us what you are doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">The kernel of it is whether the public interest directors support Mr. Boucher's position.  The personal insolvency legislation is where the public interest and the interests of the bank are in conflict.  The whole point of the public interest directorships is to act, as compelled by legislation, in the public interest where there is a conflict with the interests of the bank.  Mr. Boucher's position is contrary to the spirit of the personal insolvency legislation.  Therefore, the public interest in this case is defined by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I welcome the witnesses.  There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about this meeting.  The CEO of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Richie Boucher, was before the committee a couple of weeks ago.  The witnesses today must be using the same PR people.  They have the same approach.  They are going all over the shop and stonewalling.  The public is looking in and I suspect is immensely frustrated.  The witnesses are seasoned professionals who have attended before many committees and know how to handle them.  They should have left that way of doing things at the door and attended with the intention of telling the public what it needs to hear.  The witnesses joined the board of the bank in January 2009 and Mr. Boucher was appointed CEO in February of the same year.  My understanding was that his appointment was unanimously agreed by the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">I was mystified at the time by the approach of the public interest directors.  Mr. Boucher was deputy CEO of the bank and responsible for introducing 100% mortgages.  Mr. Considine mentioned arrears, which are at nearly double the rate they were in 2005-06.  How do the public interest directors stand over that appointment?  They spoke about a cultural change in the bank, but the manner in which Bank of Ireland has dealt with the committee demonstrates that no change in culture has taken place.  The witnesses were appointed as public interest directors to ensure a cultural change.  How did they then contribute to a unanimous decision by the board to appoint Mr. Boucher?</p>

How did the witnesses come to approve the appointment of Mr. Boucher when they were supposed to effect a change in culture as public interest directors?  When he was appointed, his remuneration breached CIROC policy and the board had to row back on that.  I want an explanation of their decision as public interest directors.  Did the witnesses see much of Mr. Boucher's performance before the committee?</p>

The bank does not get what is required by the public.  I have listened to this.  I do not think the witnesses understand the role of public interest director.  Mr. Considine mentioned the 2010 Act which provides in section 48 that the Minister may publish guidelines.  Guidelines should have been published.  When the witnesses interviewed Mr. Boucher, did they take into account the issue of 100% mortgages in 2005-06 in respect of which the rate of arrears is almost 15%, nearly double the rate in respect of other loans?  Did the effect of the appointment on the image of the bank and public perception cross the minds of the witnesses and did they consider as public interest directors that it was the wrong thing for the bank?</p>

For them to sit here and tell us that Richie Boucher was a good appointment and that there is a change in ethos is absurd.

          <p eId="para_457">The Minister replied very comprehensively to the question about public interest directors.  He stated categorically and clearly, as the Official Report shows, that his line of communication with the bank - and I can speak only for the Bank of Ireland - is through the chairman and the CEO.  That is his single point of contact.  He sees no other way of making credible contact with the Bank of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">The Bank of Ireland has been in receipt of €4.8 billion.  It has made payments to the Exchequer of the order of €2.7 billion or €2.8 billion.  We have complied absolutely with the directives and agreements with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, one of which was a target given to the Bank of Ireland to provide new and increased lending to small businesses.  Uniquely, the Bank of Ireland has not alone reached that target but has surpassed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">For next year we will increase the amount of money going to small businesses from €3.5 billion up to €4 billion. I can only speak for Bank of Ireland but, uniquely, it is the only bank that is doing that. A total of €1.5 billion was put aside for new mortgages. That has been fully taken up and a further €2 billion has been provided for people who want to buy their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> On the risk to the State, we had a guarantee about which much has been written and said. Bank of Ireland has pleaded with the Department of Finance to get off the guarantee. Shortly before I became a director on the board of Bank of Ireland, the risk to the State was €136 billion. It is now down to €25 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> The loans to deposit ratio is critical. It was one of the reasons Bank of Ireland and other banks got into trouble. It was 175%. It is now down to 128%.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">We resume in public session with our examination of the role of public interest directors.  The joint committee will hear in this session from the two public interest directors of Allied Irish Banks, Mr. Dick Spring and Dr. Michael Somers, whom I welcome to the meeting.  I understand Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers wish to make opening statements and I invite Mr. Spring to make his first.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_434">
          <from> Mr. Dick Spring<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_522">I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for inviting me to appear before them in my capacity as a Government-appointed public interest director on the board of Allied Irish Bank.  I have always valued the role played by Oireachtas committees as a forum for real engagement with agencies and organisations from outside the Houses.  I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to, I hope, provide the committee with insight into my role in AIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">  I understand the chief executive of the bank, Mr. David Duffy, and members of his team had a constructive meeting with the committee in October.  I assume as a result of that meeting members are probably <i>au fait</i>  with the current overall position of Allied Irish Bank in terms of the progress achieved in returning the bank to viability and the work ahead that must be completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">  It is important for me personally and as a director of the bank to acknowledge the enormous debt owed by AIB to the Irish taxpayer, without which the bank would not exist.  As a member of the bank's board, all my efforts have been focused on actions to stabilise the institution, to help it regain viability and, by definition, to ensure the bank plays a critical role in the recovery of the economy and returns, over time, as much as possible of the State's investment.  This is a long and difficult journey.  Painful lessons have been learned from the financial crisis, lessons that are helping us in the reshaping of Allied Irish Bank as a strong bank, functioning without State support, keeping the impact on the customer central to all decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">  Like everybody else in this room and beyond I would like the bank to reach its goal quicker.  However, the current issues in the economy are unprecedented and unique and will take time to resolve.  The bank is vigorously implementing a strategy that will result in its return to viability while ensuring it plays a fundamental role in the recovery of the Irish economy.  Since my appointment to the board of AIB in January 2009, I have witnessed enormous and positive change in the organisation.  This re-organisation has ranged from a fundamental restructuring of the bank to a revised strategy to rebuild sustainability.  AIB has, at every stage, worked closely and constructively with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance through the relationship framework agreement.  I am pleased to say that AIB's relationship with Government and the regulator is constructive, open and marked differently from that which existed when I joined the bank in 2009.  </p>
          <p eId="para_526">  When invited to join the board of AIB by the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, I was extremely conscious of the tumultuous effect the financial crisis had on the bank's relationship with Government.  That relationship is now much more constructive as the bank navigates a path back to viability.  The bank is in daily contact with the Department of Finance, senior management meet formally with Department of Finance officials on a monthly basis and the bank reports continuously to the Central Bank.  Like other company directors in the bank, I am, as a director, subject to the requirements of company law in the discharge of my duties.  My responsibilities are the same as those of other directors and I carry the same duty of care to our shareholders, namely, the Irish people, through the Government.  These duties are to protect and enhance the value of the company for the Exchequer.  The board has full responsibility for all operations and business of the bank in accordance with its legal and fiduciary duties.  It must ensure the bank is in compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations and must at all times, working with the management team, ensure business is conducted in a prudent and sustainable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">  I am also a member of Allied Irish Bank's board risk committee, which was established in the past two years, and a member of the nomination and corporate governance committee.  The bank's work is continuous and painstaking.  However, progress is evident on the ground.  A total of 2,000 bank staff are now employed in supporting customers experiencing difficulties with their loans.  We expect to see a rapid increase in the resolution of these types of loans in the next six months, where customers are working collaboratively with the bank.  I recognise the critical role of AIB in contributing to the resolution of unsustainable debt.  However, it is important to note that this is a complex issue and the bank's decisions in respect of debt restructuring must be based around the fundamental principle of any underlying affordability for the customer.  Any other outcome creates an expectation that debt will be written off, which is not economically viable.  In the year up to end October 2012, AIB approved €1.2 billion in new mortgages, which is comfortably in excess of the bank's internal target for the year of €1 billion.  The approval rate in the year to date is in excess of 70%.  During the same period, AIB's year-to-date SME lending reached €3.75 billion, which is in excess of the Government's target for the year.  Approval rates for formal applications in the SME sector are in excess of 90%.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">  There is constant debate in regard to whether the banks are lending.  Allied Irish Bank must lend to ensure it returns to a sustainable operating model that will allow it to generate its own capital and increase lending into the economy.  As a director, I acknowledge that the bank has more to do in terms of improving its processes and customer engagement on lending to viable customers.  However, the dynamics of the demand for new lending in the economy are complicated given the sheer volume of legacy debt which remains.  It is incumbent on all of us to change the message and to ensure people are not discouraged from seeking credit on the basis of perceptions.  The bank is continuously engaged in a process to promote lending through business initiatives for SMEs and mortgage holders and this will accelerate into 2013 as the bank seeks to implement its strategy more broadly. I am determined to ensure Allied Irish Bank supports the economy in its return to financial health in an expedited manner which demonstrates genuine leadership on the many complicated issues ahead while at the time treating customers fairly.  This is being done in full co-operation with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. </p>
          <p eId="para_529">   I understand the committee requires information in terms of my background.  I have a strong connection with the labour and trade union movement in Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I also have a strong connection with the farming community in north Kerry, as my late mother came from a small-holding in Lixnaw. There was, and is, a strong work ethic in my genes. From the age of 14, I undertook summer employment in factories in Tralee, building sites in Birmingham or warehouses on Long Island. This was all to help with defraying the expenses incurred in educational pursuits.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> I am a graduate of Trinity College and qualified as a Barrister of Law at King's Inns. I spent a number of years practising on the Munster circuit in the 1970s. In 1979, I was elected to Kerry County Council and Tralee Town Council. I was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1981 and became a Minister of State in the Department of Justice at that time. I became leader of the Labour Party in November 1982, a position I held until 1997. I was Tánaiste, Minister for the Environment, and Minister for Energy during the coalition governments of the 1980s. At that stage, I experienced difficult enough economic times. I was again Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1997, at which stage I stood down from the leadership of the Labour Party after 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Since exiting public life in 2002, I have been active in a number of business areas, especially in financial services and technology. I have helped companies to develop business in the Middle East and Asia in particular. I am particularly proud of my involvement with two companies based in Kerry, FEXCO and Altobridge, which are major employers in our region. </p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I have also devoted an amount of time to my chairmanship of the Réalta Global Foundation, which is a charity involved in addressing the serious problems of HIV-Aids treatment for large numbers of people in Uganda. In the past six years, we have raised over €5 million, mainly for research in the area of anti-retroviral drugs in an effort to assist HIV-Aids sufferers in that country. We also fund and manage an orphanage. We have built three health centres in conjunction with the Ugandan government and have made a meaningful contribution to the quality of life for many citizens of that country. </p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Since my appointment to the board of AIB in January 2009 there have been 139 meetings of the main board. There have also been 25 meetings of the board risk committee and nine meetings of the nominations and corporate governance committee since my appointment as a member.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> In terms of my remuneration levels, in which I understand the committee is interested, I have received the following amounts of money since joining the board in 2009. First, I would remind the Chairman that the first decision at my board meeting was to reduce directors' fees by 25% at that time. I received the sum of €26,000 in 2009, €47,000 in 2010 and €59,000 in 2011, bringing a total of €132,000. After a taxation level of about 54%, which brings it down to €64,000, it would average about €21,000 per annum for my services to the bank. </p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_435">
          <from> Dr. Michael Somers<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_536">I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with the Chairman and other members of the joint committee and to discuss any aspect of my role as a Government-appointed director of the board of AIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">  The committee has already heard details of the functions and duties of public interest directors.  Even though I am not a public interest director, as such, my position with AIB does not differ from that of my colleague Mr. Dick Spring.  I have carried exactly the same fiduciary responsibilities and onus of trust since I was appointed to the board in January 2010 as a Government nominee under the terms of the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission's preference share investment.  I am also deputy chairman of the AIB board and chairman of its risk committee since November 2010.  In this particular role I lead questioning of, and challenges to, the bank's risk tolerances levels, risk appetite on lending, and internal controls and procedures.  For my own part, I am clear that significant progress has been made in these areas since I joined the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">  In addition to the clear legal imperatives that govern our functions, I am very much aware of the weight of expectation among the public that banks, particularly those in receipt of such large State support, should apply the utmost stringency and pragmatism to all their decision-making.  We have two critical goals here - to turn AIB around and restore it to viability, whilst ensuring that the bank contributes to economic recovery, both in terms of new lending and in resolving the significant challenges of customers in difficulty.  I believe that, as these goals are fully achieved over time, public sentiment will change and we will convert negative perception into positive reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">  There is no clear definition of what is in the public interest at any given point in time.  Critically, however, the public interest can be served by ensuring the achievement of a sound, prudently-run banking system that can drive economic recovery through appropriate lending and offering security for deposit holders.  The duty of all of the board's directors is to safeguard the shareholder's interest which is, by definition, the Irish taxpayer who has supported this bank to such an enormous degree.  Without a return to viability and the reduction of dependency on the State, the common good will not be well served.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">  I joined the AIB board almost three years ago, two years after the economic crisis broke.  In my time on the board I, too, have seen significant stabilisation and recovery in the bank and the pursuit of policies that will enable recovery: reduced funding costs; the aligning of loan pricing to funding costs; the reduction of bad debt provision levels; putting in place processes to allow for the systematic tackling of the mortgage arrears crisis, while assisting large numbers of customers in difficulty; and the achievement of lending to business targets, as set out internally and by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">  Following the banking collapse and the unfolding financial crisis that businesses, individuals and families confronted, AIB has had to mobilise significant resources by way of response.  Untangling debt issues for businesses and home-owners does take time and the bank is coming to grips with the complexity of these problems and expediting an appropriate response.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">  I acknowledge that the bank has more to do in these areas.  However, the complexity and scale of the problems cannot be underestimated and there is no simple and easy solution to these issues.  The bank must continue to work diligently, methodically and as expeditiously as possible to ensure viable long-terms solutions are put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">  Perception is a powerful force and AIB is also battling against the widespread view that it is still not lending to business.  However, the reality is that AlB's SME and mortgage-lending targets are being met and exceeded.  The perception that exists will, in large part, be changed by the continued focus of our staff in engaging positively with customers as they make formal applications for credit.  After almost three years on the board of this bank, I am confident that in time it will reach the objective of making a return to the Irish taxpayer while ensuring economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">  Since my appointment to the board in January 2010 there have been 102 meetings of the main board where I serve as deputy chairman.  There have also been 25 meetings of the board risk committee of which I am chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">  I gather that the committee is interested in my background, as well as that of Mr. Spring, so I will briefly go through that.  I joined the civil service in 1960 as an executive officer.  I was appointed to the Department of Industry and Commerce and was immediately sent to an outfit called An Foras Tionscal, which at that stage was the grant-giving agency of the IDA.  In mid-1963, I was successful in a competition for administrative officer in the Department of Finance.  I was assigned there to what was regarded at the time as one of the worst sections - the pensions section - which actually turned out to be quite interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">  When Dr. Ken Whitaker was appointed governor of the Central Bank he invited me down and I spent two years there which gave me some knowledge of monetary policy.  I then came back to the Department of Finance and was in the finance division, which dealt with all the financial affairs of the State.  I was also involved with the EU when we joined in 1972.  In 1985, I was appointed secretary of the Department of Defence when these positions were opened up to people generally in the public service.  On the change of Government in 1987, I was brought back to the Department of Finance by the then Taoiseach.  I was appointed as secretary of national debt management there, with a view to doing something about the national debt, which was a huge issue at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">  In 1990, under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, I was asked to establish the NTMA, which I did.  The aim was to try to get debt service costs down.  At the time, the debt-service was a huge burden on the Exchequer.  It was a question of whether to cut health, social welfare and education or the debt service costs.  Politically, the debt service costs were obviously much more acceptable.  That was the main reason for setting up the NTMA.  It went on to establish the State Pension Fund which at its peak had €25 billion in it.  We also set up the State Claims Agency which dealt with anybody who wanted to sue the State or hospitals.  We also set up the National Development Finance Agency.  I ran that organisation for 19 years.  I retired, or resigned, just over three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">  During the course of my career I was a member of the EU monetary committee in Brussels and was on the board of the European Investment Bank.  I was on other committees.  I was a member of the OECD's capital markets committee.  I was also part of the delegation to the IMF and World Bank boards.  I was chairman of the group that set up the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, to bail out the countries of the former Soviet Union when it broke up. </p>
          <p eId="para_549">I have a diploma in public administration, a B.Com, a master of Economic Science and a PhD in Economics from UCD. The President of France made me a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur for my efforts in setting the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD. At present, apart from the board of AIB, I am on a number of other boards, both <i>pro bono </i>and others. In terms of remuneration, which is available in the bank's annual reports, I received the following amounts in the execution of my various roles. In 2010, I received €98,000; in 2011 I received €150,000. I should add, as Dick Spring has said, roughly half of that amount goes back to the State and I never see it, the differential in the amounts between the two years is due to my appointment as deputy chairman and chairman of the risk committee with effect from 1 June 2010. </p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I am happy to answer any questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I received a phone call from the late Brian Lenihan, asking if I would make myself available to take on a role as a public interest director at a time when there was practically a breakdown between the banking system in the country and Dáil Éireann, particularly with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Regulator.  I told Brian Lenihan that I would obviously need to consider it and check the amount of time the role required.  He said he would really appreciate it if I could get back to him ASAP.  I think I got back to him within about two days, having considered it, discussed it at home and having tried to check out the time commitment it required.  I was informed that the time commitment would be about 40 days per annum.  I have since then communicated with the chairman of the bank that I would make myself available for 60 days per annum because of the amount of work that is required.  We had a briefing from the Department of Finance, a collective briefing for all the directors who were being appointed at the time.</p>

We also had a briefing from the senior partner in Arthur Cox on company law requirements and fiduciary responsibilities, some of which I would have recollected from my days in the Kings' Inns, but it was useful to get an update on it.  Effectively, we did not receive what I would call instructions on how to conduct business on a day-to-day basis from the Department of Finance.  In my time as a director I communicated at least on one occasion with the late Minister for Finance and on another occasion I communicated with the Taoiseach directly.</p>

Within two months of my appointment I was beginning to form opinions, to the effect that the crisis was deeper than the Oireachtas, the Government or the Department realised and I communicated that to the Taoiseach and certain actions were taken at that stage.  I had one formal meeting with the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  My then colleague, Mr. Declan Collier, who is no longer on the board as he left to take up an appointment in London some months ago, and I asked to meet the Finance for Finance.  The Minister was accompanied by the Secretary General of his Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">There were no specific terms of reference, no formal recording mechanisms and no formal reporting to the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance or to the Central Bank.  Now four years since the appointment of the first public interest director, this is the first formal report to the Oireachtas.  Is that not peculiar?</p>

          <p eId="para_570">I will answer that question.  If the situation which pertained when I joined the board of the bank had continued, I think it would have required a very formal reporting methodology.  The situation has changed quite dramatically.  It is primarily governed by the relationship framework document, with which I am sure the Chair is very familiar.  That is the bible on the relationship between the bank, the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the troika.  There is continuous reporting of the bank meetings I have attended.  I think I attended all the board meetings.  The Central Bank has had a member of its staff sitting in on the majority of those meetings.  The minutes of each meeting is given to the Department of Finance and I think it is given to the Central Bank as well, but the Central Bank is present.  There is a continuous information flow.  The management of AIB meet the Department of Finance on a monthly basis.  The chief executive and his colleagues meet the economic management council on a fairly regular basis.  There is a continuous flow of information between Allied Irish Banks and the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I accept that, Mr. Spring.  The purpose of these series of meetings is to deal specifically with the role and activity of the public interest directors.  What we would like to learn from both Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring is the actions in which they have been engaged that makes them distinctly different from any other director of the bank.  When Mr. Richie Boucher came before the joint committee in November last, he stated emphatically that directors of the bank, public interest or otherwise, are directors whose job under company law is to serve the interests of the banks.  That question has been under discussion by the committee because others have stated that the appointment of public interest directors is governed by specific rules, which allows public interest directors to take a conflictual position from other directors.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">  May I ask both Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring whether they have been in a position in which they proposed a matter that was in conflict with the bank?  Have they put the issue to a vote or achieved a consensus on the issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_573">Let me answer some of these issues.  As Mr. Spring said, I was approached by the then Minister for Finance, the late Mr. Lenihan.  I decided to resign from the National Treasury Management Agency approximately two years before my term of office expired.  He asked me about various appointments to the public service.  At that stage I just wanted to make a clean break of things.  I had worked for 49 years in the public service.  He asked me if I would join the board of AIB and I said no to that request.  He then rang me in November, which I remember very well because I had come back from a dinner in the Dutch embassy and I got a call at 11.45 p.m. asking me to join the board of AIB.  He asked me for my immediate response.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">My time is limited and so will the time of members of the committee.  I run a very strict time regime.  While the background to the appointment of Dr. Somers is very interesting, I am asking him to outline his behaviour since his appointment.  What proposals did Dr. Somers put before the AIB board that would reflect matters of public interest, such as issues relating to small and medium sized enterprises getting credit, as many complaints have been made that small businesses cannot get that type of credit?</p>
          <p eId="para_575">There are also issues regarding mortgage arrears, managing these arrears and debt settlements coming down the line after the enactment of the insolvency legislation. Have Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring being to the fore in raising these matters with their board at times when they might be in conflict with the other directors' interests?</p>

          <p eId="para_578">There was no risk committee when I joined AIB.  It was a pretty chaotic organisation.  There was no chief risk officer, which was quite extraordinary.  I set up a risk committee from scratch, which is essential in a bank.  We had great difficulty in getting a chief risk officer.  The first two people who took up the post lasted about six months each.  We then had to get another risk officer and staff the organisation up.  Quite a number of people who had appeared on the risk committee when I first joined it disappeared, resigned, retired or whatever.  We now have a fully functioning risk committee that looks at every risk the bank runs.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">  Regarding providing funds for industry, many people telephone me when they have financial difficulties.  I do try to help them but I cannot interfere in credit decisions in the bank as that is not my role.  When someone who has been turned down credit contacts me, I first ask them if it is AIB.

          <p eId="para_581">I have urged that money be lent to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  I am not particularly proud of the amount of new money the bank has lent.  I would prefer if it were more.  When I ask the bank about this, it says many people do not want more money as they are already trying to deleverage, and for the others, one would not lend them the money anyway.  I am not a credit expert so I have to take the bank's word on this.  I am told, however, that money is readily available for good projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">  We have spent hours going through the remediation attempts to deal with the mortgage crisis.  We have come up with a good solution.

          <p eId="para_584">To add to that, there were two particular areas in which Dr. Somers and I were particularly active.  One was ensuring the bank made contact with former executives who had retired on large pensions.  We felt very strongly that they had a contribution to make.  As the Chairman knows, this has been done.  It was not done as quickly as we would have liked but was done consequent upon last year's annual general meeting.  I understand progress has been made in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">  We both have an aversion to the presence of consultants in the bank.  The bank has spent a lot of money on consultancy fees over the past several years.  We are determined that will end as quickly as possible and reduce the cost of same.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">I welcome the two public interest directors and thank them for their presentations.  I have some considerable sympathy for them and those public interest directors before us already.  They took on the role at a time when it was clear the banks were in a very difficult position.  Both Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring have considerable reputations, as indeed do the other bank public interest directors.  There was a bigger risk to their reputations if matters had not worked out.  Much of this is lost in an effort to highlight the difficulties that exist with their terms of reference which I would contend are not of their making.  They are doing the job that was set out for them at the time.  From my vantage point, I believe they are doing it to the best of their abilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">  In the context of the Oireachtas providing advice to the Minister for Finance at a later stage, how would Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring build on the role of a public interest director?  As they are the pioneers in this role, how would they define and develop the role so that the next group who takes on this onerous task can discharge their duties to the State?  How would they develop a broader and more comprehensive set of guidelines that would not necessitate future public interest directors having to justify everything they do before a committee or the media?  How does a public interest director balance fiduciary duties in line with company law and the obligation to the taxpayer, the main shareholder of AIB?</p>

          <p eId="para_591">Every director is now effectively a public interest director.  Under the 2010 Act, everybody was told their first obligation was to develop credit and so forth, legislation with which the committee is familiar.  I am the second longest serving director, after Mr. Dick Spring, on the board.  All the people appointed were new to me.  They were all on a list that the Minister for Finance had or were recommended to him by the chairman of AIB.  They all had to be cleared by the Minister for Finance.  Unless they were cleared by him, they were not appointed.  These directors are as much appointed by the Minister for Finance as I am.  By the way, I offered to go up for election, the same as everyone else, because there was an issue about whether we were regarded as independent non-executive directors.  I do not believe there is a significant difference between what we are trying to do, how we were appointed and the others on the board, four of whom are not resident in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">  We are all trying to get this bank back in order again.  It is essential for the economy to have a working banking system.  We have spent ages at this.  As this is an extraordinarily complex area, one needs people who know about financial affairs.  I heard Mr. Spring say on occasion that there are an awful lot of moving parts in this.  We are trying to keep track of all of these.  We are trying to get the bank funded and get more deposits in.  At the same time, we are trying to lend because a bank only makes money if it is lending.  We are trying to solve the problem of all the people that are in debt.  It does not come easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">  One arrives on these boards and is presented with all of these issues.  If one has a financial background, it makes it easier.  If one does not, it is more difficult as one is on a steep learning curve.  Future appointees will need some financial background or, at least, know the terminology involved, as well as being prepared to spend an awful lot of time at this.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">What about the structure of communication?  Concern has been raised about this.  Does Dr. Somers believe there is a necessity to have those appointed by the Government to have separate communication channels with the Minister?  Mr. Spring has outlined how, in an informal way, as information became available, he felt he had a duty to communicate with the then Taoiseach and Minister.  Should there be a formalised structure?</p>

          <p eId="para_595">In my own case, I have known the Minister for Finance for many years.  Sometime after he became Minister, I rang him and said I would like to drop over to talk to him just to explain what I was doing.  I spent about an hour or so with him and then he asked me to talk to some of his officials, which I did.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I met him casually on other occasions when I mentioned things to him. He has my telephone number - I have his telephone number - if he wants to ring me about anything. All the papers we see go to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. There are no secrets and they know we are around if they want to get elaboration on anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">Obviously, if we can improve communications, that is all the better.  To pick up on what the Chairman asked about, namely, the fact that we had not come before the committee, we are quite happy to do so.  We are happy for the committee to formalise an exchange on an annual basis.  It is important in an exchange such as this that we can get information to the public that might not normally be disseminated.  I am not sure how interested people are in reading bank annual reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">  Apart from our fiduciary duties under company law, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act puts it all into a new ball game.  As Dr. Somers has said, all directors are now practically public interest directors.  I look on the public interest concept as being very wide in terms of making sure AIB is able to function.  It is a pillar bank and a major bank in the State.  It must be able to give credit.  If a bank is not lending, it is not making money, and if it is not making money, then it is not viable.  Without a functioning bank in the State, this country will not get back on its feet.  To be blunt, it has been a horrendous journey from the crisis of 2008.  The deputy governor of the central bank in the United Kingdom said that this crisis was of such magnitude that no politician, banker or economist currently alive has any experience of a crisis of such seriousness.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">  A total of 48 of the top management in the bank who were there during the crisis are gone.  We are taking costs out of the bank on a daily basis.  We aim to take out approximately €400 million between now and 2014 to bring our costs-to-income ratio down so that the bank will be viable.  At the end of all of that, apart from having a solid pillar bank, I hope we will be in a position to repay the taxpayer because the bank would not exist without the money that has been put in through the Oireachtas by the taxpayer.  However, it is one hell of a difficult journey.  We are giving it our all.  In fairness, we have a new team.  As Dr. Somers has described, we could not get a chief executive of the bank for a long time.  We had a number of chief risk officers who effectively ran out of the place.  They did not want to stay.  We now have a solid risk officer, a new internal auditor and a new chief operations officer.  We were lucky to get David Duffy back from Singapore to work in an Irish bank.  He has shown a high level of commitment to try to ensure that we put the bank back on a solid footing.</p>

This morning we had fog.  The fog is lifting.  I thank the witnesses for the refreshing tone of their opening statements and the free-flowing conversation they have had with the Chairman during the opening remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">  In the three years the witnesses have been <i>in situ</i>, the bank has come from a situation where the PwC listed NAMA loans of €24 billion, which would be the first indication of capital requirement, and it was indicated that the discounts would be heavy.  That was the first body blow and winding of the bank for losses.  Subsequently, there was the PCAR of March 2010 where the figures that stick in my head were that AIB needed €7.8 billion before the year end.  That was hopelessly wrong.  It was 100% wrong.  Another PCAR in March 2011 was again wrong.  To date, the amount injected has been approximately €20 billion.  Could the witnesses please outline their experience as they observed what was happening and Boston Consulting tinkered around with governance, probity and capital requirement issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_606">I first came across the problems in the banking system when I was still in the NTMA when the first PricewaterhouseCoopers report was done.  At that stage it was a question of lending to developers and builders.  I was shocked when I saw the figures.  It was lending of billions to, effectively, individuals.  I had a difficult enough relationship with AIB in the NTMA because it was not particularly supportive of our bond issuance.  We were borrowing as little as €100 million to try to fund the State and suddenly I found that AIB and the other banks had lent billions to those people.  I was in a state of absolute shock.  I could not believe it.  Then the pension fund which we had carefully built up to meet the pensions of people in this country over a long period had to be raided to capitalise AIB.  Approximately €15 billion of the State pension fund went to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">That was July 2011.  I wish to go back a little to examine the situation as the picture was emerging.  Mr. Spring said that shortly after joining, he was horrified by the scale of the losses.  I am amazed that the accounting firms did not have some anticipation of that but they seemed to be dulled in their minds as to what had happened to the balance sheets of banks.  They should have seen that the engineering ratios were going all wrong.  Loans to deposits were crazy.  Lehman Brothers had nothing to do it.  It was a self-orchestrated disaster.

          <p eId="para_609">Are there provisions against that?  I apologise for having caught Dr. Somers off guard.  The reason I ask is that I have a benchmark picture in my head that Certus, which is doing the loans work-out for the Lloyds Bank subsidiary, Bank of Scotland (Ireland), has, to date, written off €22 billion of the €40 billion where its loans peaked.  That is colossal.  The bank’s loans were in a sector that was predominantly property-based for property investment and development.  AIB had a good helping of that type of loan portfolio as well.  I would expect that loan provisions, cumulative to date, having got rid of all the NAMA stuff, should be probably at a level of approximately 15% for the remaining book.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, it is under 7% at the moment, which is far too low.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">Our provisions are much higher.  Perhaps we were unduly pessimistic but the provisions are made by technical people who know how to work that out.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">Technical people in March 2010 and March 2011 got it 100% wrong on both occasions.  That is my fear.  Our best argument for getting capitalisation from the euro system through creditor write-down for all the banks – the dead ones and the survivor ones – is by getting the picture accurate, making the provisions right and substantiating it with what will be arriving down the tracks in the next 24 months as the resolutions of the customer loans with the bank are dealt with and resolved.  If the bank can do a good estimate now of what households and businesses need in loan write-down to get back to repayable amounts over their normal expected income levels in the next five to ten years, then it can present its best argument to the euro system that this is it and we are getting it right.  It is not a case of drip, drip, drip as it has been for the past three or four years.  It is important to say that we are going for this and we are insisting on it because we were trashed by those guys in 2008 and 2009.  That is our best argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">  This is my one opportunity to ask the witnesses because I know they have presented their case and their update report, and I am delighted that they understand these things.  Therefore, they are our best articulation and validation and their credentials and backgrounds are good.  They are persuasive because they line up the facts.  It is a case of <i>res ipsa loquitor</i> when they meet Mr. Draghi and others.  They should offer their services to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">I say that specifically for this reason: to get the ELA owed by the IBRC written off.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">This would mean the promissory notes could be torn up. In the case of AIB - and the Bank of Ireland may be too foggy-headed at the moment to articulate it - it can do it. AIB can articulate that for the triangle of banks - the two big remaining banks and Permanent TSB as a smaller add-on - to get the indigenous national economy going. There will be a need to write off debts for households and businesses which are otherwise viable but are smothered in legacy debt which weighs down their existing good businesses. This would enable them to get off the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> In addition, the insolvency legislation will put a line through this matter of the banks having a veto on insolvency. That is like trying to sail a boat with the anchor down. It is just silly.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">  In my last job, when we were trying to invest some of the pension fund, a property company in the United States told us about repossessions of houses there, which was a disaster.  First of all, people did not want to buy the houses and by the time they paid for maintenance and insurance, they reckoned they got back about 40% of what the houses were worth.  It is a disaster.</p>

          <p eId="para_621">Yes, Dr. Somers is quite right.  Some 99% of people are honourable and decent and want to pay back what they can.  It is therefore up to both parties to sit down and work out what can honourably be repaid over income expectations.  We are all agreed on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">  However, as the bank with which we have met and conversed, I am asking AIB to spearhead the requirement of the effort in that negotiation with the banking sector's creditors, because we have run out of money.  As Dr. Somers said, the pension fund that was built up for the people of Ireland has decreased.  They stupidly raided it.  They gave Wilbur Ross 35% of the other bank for €1 billion, when our State paid €5 billion for 15% of the bank.  A junior certificate student would know that is stupid.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">Just to add to what Dr. Somers said, I certainly welcome the Deputy's remarks.  I am glad that the insolvency legislation is eventually getting through this House.  I was hoping it would have happened a lot earlier because that is obviously the ultimate denouement of solving a lot of the problems which we are facing.  As I said in my opening remarks, we now have 2,000 people addressing this situation.  Given the combination of the public insolvency legislation and the forbearance that is on offer from the banks, we will get to grips with a very difficult problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">  We are starting on a second journey but we are now in a far better position.  Our numbers are going in the right direction and, even if one looks at the losses over recent years, we are going in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">  As regards the bigger issues the Deputy raised, I am not sure that Mr. Draghi would be overly impressed if I asked to meet him, but that is for another day.  I accept that there are bigger questions to which the State must respond, as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">I think the survivor bank system needs further capitalisation.  In the case of Bank of Ireland it could be €10 billion minimally to get its provisions right so that it can start the sort of work that would follow from the insolvency stuff.  I think that AIB will need more, too, as will Permanent TSB.  The IBRC issue is being lumped onto the main national debt.  In all, we are talking about a minimum of about €60 billion.  However, we need people who really understand it and who can, without having to shuffle through opening statements with simultaneous translation, get it across, eye to eye, with the other person.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">As regards needing more cash, we have been through numerous stress tests on the future of AIB and have looked at different scenarios, including interest rates moving and economies not growing.  In other than extreme circumstances, the expectation is that we will not need any more capital from the State.  I hope that is correct and that we do not have to come back looking for any more capital, but one can never be absolutely certain.</p>

Is it because the capital or the people are not there, or is it both?</p>

In response to the Chairman's questions, Mr. Spring talked about the time involved in taking up the position as a public interest director.

          <p eId="para_648">It would be both in the sense that there is a lot of work in preparing for meetings, including briefing oneself.  Then there are meetings and also there is a lot of work currently in terms of what I would call continuous education and training which we are now undergoing.  I will give an example.  Last week,  we had our board risk meeting at 2 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, which lasted for four hours.  We then had a working dinner with the board of the bank.  We started our board meeting at 8 o'clock on Thursday morning and that lasted until 2.30 p.m.  We then went into a training session which lasted until 6.30 p.m. that day.  On Friday we resumed the training session which lasted from 8.30 a.m. to 1 p.m.  That is the bank's working week and there are obviously other meetings in between.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">  The figure of 40 days was indicated as the Central Bank's requirement.  One would want to commit oneself to being available, which I was in a position to do.  I saw, however, that there was extra work involved and I put it in writing to the chairman that I was quite prepared to do extra days.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">I note the number of meetings Mr. Spring attended last year was 24, while Dr. Somers attended 22.  Of the four public interest directors who are former Ministers, Mr. Spring is in receipt of the highest Government pension.  He is in receipt of €121,108 per annum.  Last year, for example, his fees were €59,000.  Excluding last year, he has received fees of €132,000 since the time of his appointment.  That is on top of the fact that he has got what I think is a lavish pension.  I genuinely do not believe that any public servant should be in receipt of pensions of €121,000 - never mind the fact that they are getting fees of €59,000.  The 60 days to which Mr. Spring referred, equates to €1,000 per day.  That is his fee as a public interest director on the board of AIB.  That is a very heavy fee for his involvement, given the fact that this State is already paying him €121,000.  I know that everybody pays tax on their incomes.  Mr. Spring has said before that he is a socialist.  Does he believe it is appropriate that people like himself who are serving in the public interest are claiming such an extraordinary amount of money from the taxpayer?</p>

          <p eId="para_651">I think the fees which I have outlined are reasonable for the effort and time that I put into working at Allied Irish Banks.  My pension is as a former Deputy - which Deputy Doherty will be entitled to in time - and as a Minister.  Deputy Doherty will obviously get a ministerial pension if he ever achieves ministerial office and I think he will be perfectly entitled to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">  There is another way of looking at this.  I have turned down numerous invitations to take up other positions, which would be equally if not more lucrative than working for Allied Irish Banks.  In fact, I have turned down two in recent months because I do not have the time and am not available.  I think the payments are reasonable for the time and effort put in.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">I think Mr. Spring's answer to whether he is worth the €1,000 per day fee on top of his pension, rings similar to Dr. Somers's answer - if he does not mind me saying so - when he was receiving more than €1 million in payment as chief executive of the NTMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Dr. Somers may believe public servants should receive lavish pensions plus €1,000 per day to serve on the board of AIB, but there are many who do not believe it serves their interests, in particular, the one in four who are in mortgage distress and those who have seen increased fees and increases in variable interest rates out of line with ECB rates. I share their view that it is inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> The Personal Insolvency Bill provides that those in mortgage distress can restructure their loans. They will be able to reduce their debt burden and to have their debt written off after a process is gone through. Is it the view of the public interest directors that this is something which needs to be done and that AIB must ensure that debt write-offs take place? Will they ensure that AIB does not use the veto contained within the legislation? I draw the attention of the public interest directors to what Mr. Fergus Murphy of AIB said in answer to me when he was before the joint committee. He said the sum written off thus far is €600,000. He said any write-offs will be minuscule or near zero. He said that on a balance sheet of €95 billion, €600,000 is zero and that AIB was not writing off debt. Do the public interest directors agree with that and do they believe that is the position the bank should take after the Personal Insolvency Bill is enacted?</p>

          <p eId="para_656">AIB will comply fully with the terms of the legislation.  I am not an expert on it and only heard this morning about the five-year provision, having listened to a programme on the radio.  The aim of AIB is to deal with customers without having to go near the legislation.  There is no upside in trying to get blood from a turnip.  If people do not have money, they cannot pay up.  There has been a great deal of discussion of debt forgiveness and what forgiveness means exactly.  I am long in the tooth and a Roman Catholic and forgiveness has a certain meaning to me.  It means one goes to confession and one's wrongdoings are forgiven.  While the bank is not going to engage in divine mercy, it will deal with individuals and consider the totality of their liabilities and their income and leave them with a sufficient amount of cash to have a reasonable quality of life.  It will then deal with them regarding what will happen with outstanding debt.  If restructuring involves eliminating debt, so be it.  If money cannot be got, it cannot be got.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">People have been in mortgage distress for a number of years.  This has not happened today or last week.  People are in serious mortgage distress.  The Government has had to introduce far-reaching legislation, which is nevertheless flawed because it provides for a veto by banks.  Dr. Somers can say the bank will act under the law and, of course, that is true because the law provides it with a veto.  Government, politicians and people generally do not want the bank to use its veto but rather to engage in debt write-down after the process provided for has taken place.  The problem for the public interest directors is that to date only €600,000 has been written off for distressed mortgage holders out of a total of €95 billion.  What comfort can the witnesses give the joint committee and people watching that there will be a new direction in AIB on writing off debt?  If AIB was doing its job properly, there would be no need for the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">I do not know the detail of the discussion the joint committee had with AIB representatives on the €600,000 or whether they undertook to provide further information.  It appears to be a very small figure.  When loans are written off, it is somebody else's money.  Money does not come from nowhere and in this instance has probably come from the State pension fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">Yes.  Bank officials must be careful that they are not hoodwinked.  There are approximately 37,000 people who must be dealt with individually on the basis of the totality of their financial circumstances.  It is equivalent to three quarters of the capacity of the Aviva stadium.  Some people are in distress on foot of their house loans, some on the basis of buy-to-let properties and some have SMEs.  I hear all sorts of stories on how people got themselves into a mess by borrowing too much from banks.  It is not AIB's intention to throw people out on the streets.  Some deal with have to be cut and if it requires the writing down of debt, so be it.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">It has not happened to date or only to the extent of €600,000.  A director of the Central Bank made a widely reported comment to the effect that the banks are behaving like spoiled children and asked what they are waiting for.  Does Dr. Somers agree with that in respect of the bank and its directors?  What is the bank waiting for and why is it not dealing with the mortgage crisis?  Representatives of the Central Bank and the regulator have told the joint committee they are not happy with the banks' efforts to deal with the mortgage crisis.  Does Dr. Somers believe AIB is behaving that way?</p>

          <p eId="para_662">I do not.  I do not know what the context for those comments was.  I read about them in the newspapers where they got great headlines.  Anything to do with bashing banks gets very good headlines.  It is only recently that the bank has put together this team of 2,000 people, all of whom had to be retrained.  The problem is that the banks were used to lending money and much less accustomed to getting it back and dealing with those who got into distress.  We all know we got into this mess because money was being made too freely available.  Bank staff have had to be retrained and reprogrammed to clean up the mess.  It has only been done in relatively recent times since Mr. Duffy came on board as CEO.  We are ready to go and Mr. Duffy has put these people to work.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">I dispute Dr. Somers comments earlier about lending to small businesses.  New lending stands at €600 million, not the €3.5 billion target which was supposed to be reached.  I cannot go into that, however.  Bank of Ireland paid out bonuses in breach of the State contract, which is a matter I put to the directors earlier.  In the first nine months of 2010, during which year Mr. Spring was a director, the bank paid €700,000 in bonuses to two senior executives.  A total bonus package of €3.06 million was paid to 41 managers and €60 million was paid out by the bank over two years.  How do the public interest directors stand over large salaries and bonus payments by a bank which has cost the State so much money?  How many senior executives have responded positively to the request for a reduction in pensions?</p>

          <p eId="para_666">I suspect there would be a difficulty with that on grounds of confidentiality in respect of executives' pension entitlements.  Most of them understand they are privileged and should make some repayment to the State.  We will certainly keep the joint committee informed on that.  I do not have the figures before me on bonuses paid in 2010 but I suspect they related to contractual obligations which had to be honoured on the basis of legal advice.  From memory, AIB was taken to court and a ruling was made that the payments had to be made.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">We need economic recovery.  I was very relieved to see that we had growth in recent months, albeit 0.2%.  At least it is going in the right direction.  We need consumer confidence to be restored.  I am probably as familiar with rural Ireland and the city as most Members of the Oireachtas and there is a definite constraint on people wanting to borrow at the moment compared with the rush for borrowings during the Celtic tiger years.  Savings are at an all time high.  People want to pay down debt.  Even in respect of remarks about lending to SMEs, the chief executive of the bank, in his many meetings around the country with SMEs and business people, will always ask whether there are people in the room who want to borrow money and he will invite them to come and talk to the bank.  We need to give credit.  That is the function of the bank.  If it is to be a viable bank we must issue credit, take in deposits and give out loans in a prudential manner, not like the chaos of the Celtic tiger when, as Dr. Somers said, there was no risk assessment.  We did not have a risk committee.  I do not think there was even a chief risk officer in the bank during that crisis.  AIB came late to the crisis but by God it came fast and furious to catch up with the other banks which were making a 39% return on investment at that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">I had a discussion with someone running a small business last week who could not get access to money.  I am not in a position to say what kind of risk would be involved in that SME.  When the two bank CEOs appeared before this committee, the CEO of Bank of Ireland told us that its figure referred to new lending, not re-financing, because the €3.5 billion had hit the Government target.  The CEO of AIB said the bank's figure did not relate to new lending.  The witnesses have given the figures again in their presentation today.  Can they give me a breakdown of what is new lending and what is refinancing?  What is the €3.5 billion that is being lent out to the SMEs?</p>

          <from> Dr. Michael Somers<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_682">AIB has said that €600 million of the €3.5 billion, or whatever the figure is, is new lending.  The rest is refinancing, turning over existing loans.  That is just as important in many ways as new lending because many people are complaining that they cannot get their loans refinanced.  I hear complaints all the time, and I am sure the Deputy does too, from people who go into the banks and find that their loan is due for repayment and they are obliged to repay it.  If they want to roll it over, the bank refuses to do so.  They cannot go anywhere else because when one's own bank turns one down, there is nowhere to go.  I would much prefer if there was more lending.  I am told that it is just as important to roll over existing loans as to give out new lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">  The bank is prepared to lend to viable projects.  It keeps saying so to us because we raise this regularly at the board.  As Mr. Spring said, the CEO has gone around the country and asked people if they want money.  In the past week or two we introduced a new provision whereby the banks would lend €25,000 to individuals on a turnaround of either 24 or 48 hours.  I know this is a small thing but we are doing our best to push this matter.  We cannot get this economy moving if there is no credit being provided.  We are determined to do everything we can to get credit into the system.</p>

I have appeared before many Oireachtas committees over the years.  Deputy Higgins and I have discussed matters, in particular in the Committee of Public Accounts.

As Dr. Somers said, all the information is available to the Department currently.  We were appointed by the previous Minister for Finance, sadly no longer with us, and the current Minister wishes to retain us on the board.

          <p eId="para_702">Alder Capital is a currency speculator and has speculated heavily against the euro over a number of years, reportedly making massive profits as a result.  Its co-founder Brian McCarthy boasted "we have capitalised on the weakness of the euro".  Does Mr. Spring accept that there is a fundamental and fatal conflict of interest in representing the Irish people as a public interest director in AIB while wearing another hat as chairman of a company active in the financial markets system - the casino economy - which seeks to profit at the expense of the Irish and European people?</p>

          <p eId="para_703">There is absolutely no conflict.  As Deputy Higgins will be aware if he has the company's reports, I do not engage in day-to-day trading with the company.  I assume Deputy Higgins has some information about this and it was made perfectly clear when the question was asked before.  I have no conflict of interest whatever because I have no involvement in the trading by Alder Capital on a daily basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">With respect, I did not suggest Mr. Spring was on the trading floor manning the phones, but he is the chairman.  According to the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, the remit of the public interest directors is to address the serious and continuing disruption to the economy and the financial system and the continuing serious threat to the stability of certain credit institutions in the State and the financial system generally.  The activities of Alder Capital and its like - vulture capitalists - are precisely opposed to that.  They thrive on instability and profit massively from the creation of instability through currency speculation.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">I understand.  I continue to live in rural Ireland, as Deputy Higgins is aware, and I interact with many customers of the bank daily.  Many people are hurting.  Of our mortgage holders, 90% are paying their way and 10% are in serious difficulties.  We are addressing those difficulties.  Deputy Higgins is implying that I should not be out there working or earning money, on all of which I pay my taxes.  I am proud to do so and will continue to work on behalf of people who are in difficulties in the banks.  We did not cause the crisis, but we are trying to find a solution.  We are giving a great deal of our time to work with the bank to find a solution for the many people who are hard pressed to pay their debts each week and to provide for their families.  It is only when the economy returns to viability that we will be in a position to solve many of the problems we face.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">When the bank's chief executive was before the joint committee, it was set out that this year 34,000 mortgages are subject to forbearance, of which 66% are interest only.  That is the huge suffering.  Those people are in essence slaves to the banks.  Have the public interest representatives considered or discussed with the board a different approach rather than to torture families and individual home owners?</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I am speaking of a more general write-down of mortgage debt for single-owner occupiers rather than multiples to reflect the values today of those properties and, therefore, a calibrating downwards of the monthly payments which, on the one hand, would ease unconscionable pressure on people and, on the other, free up hundreds of millions, perhaps of billions, of euro a year, thus allowing the real economy to develop and more jobs to be created as that money would be spent in shops and on services. Has this issue been discussed or bought to the attention of the board? </p>

          <p eId="para_718">I would not tolerate the torture of anybody.  I am not in that business.  The bank treats people with respect etc.  If otherwise was happening, I would be concerned.  On a general write-down of debt, money does not come from nowhere.  If the bank writes down people's liabilities this hits investment in the State pension fund, into which we have all paid, thus reducing the amount that will be available in due course to pay the pensions of people in this State.  There are many chancers in the economy who would be only too happy to have their liabilities written down.  Our aim is to deal with genuine cases and to do so sympathetically, leaving people with a reasonable standard of living while trying to restructure their indebtedness.  I assure the Deputy we are sincere about this.  We are not out to cause unnecessary pain or to torture anybody.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">I do not wish to repeat what Dr. Somers has said.  I believe the chief executive may have explained the broad forbearance being applied to people by the bank.  Our short term forbearance includes interest only repayments, reduced payments, payments holidays, arrears capitalisation or deferred interest.  The bank's long term forbearance strategy includes term extension, interest rate reduction, split mortgages, interest rate only payments, reduced payments or a combination.  There is also then the ultimate resolution treatment which includes voluntary sale, trade down or mortgage to rent.  In the case of Allied Irish Bank, repossessions have been on an exceptional basis only.  A small number of its repossessions have been voluntary, with people simply wishing to get out of their homes.</p>

A general write-down, not for chancers but for ordinary people who were the victims of the gouging and speculation that went on in the profiteering markets, is required.

          <p eId="para_732">I welcome Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers, with whom I would like to raise a couple of points.  This is the third set of hearings on this matter.  The context is simple - a general distrust of the public in the banking system and a lack of understanding or faith in the public interest directors.  Section 48 of the Act has been quoted at length.  There is clearly a need for the Minister to put in place guidelines for transparent lines of reporting, which is currently lacking in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">  I would like to touch briefly on the €600 million referred to.  We met previously with officials from the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank at which time officials from the Bank of Ireland stated emphatically that the figure of €3.5 billion represented new lending.  Mr. Duffy from Allied Irish Bank stated that €600 million of the €3.5 billion was new lending and the remainder represented restructuring.  Be that as it may, €600 million in new lending is very little.  I do not concur that there is no demand for lending.  The problem is the type of lending available.  The banks have become extraordinarily risk averse.  We are trying to get the SME sector going.  What I am hearing on the ground from the SME sector is that much depends on the individual within a bank with whom an applicant is dealing.  I believe there is a need for the banks to put in place defined communications structures in regard to dealings with customers.  I am astounded to hear there was no risk committee in the bank.  </p>
          <p eId="para_734">  I would like to hear from Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers regarding the type of structures around loans that were in place in AIB when they took up their appointments on the board.  Dr. Somers referred to his relationship with AIB when employed by the National Treasury Management Agency in terms of its capacity to invest in Government bonds.  What is the current position in that regard?  I would like if the witnesses could give us a flavour of what they found when they took up their appointments.  For example, if the bank had no risk system in place at that time, it should offer some leverage in terms of its dealings with people in difficulty with mortgage loans etc.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">I presume it would be total exposure.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">It was an enormous sum of money. The board was not really focusing on loans. In years gone by the main focus of the board would have been on making loans, to whom it was lending and why, and in to what sectors etc. but that all seemed to fall by the wayside and the board was otherwise engaged. Some of them told me they were becoming experts in Basel II and so on which may be very laudable but it does not get one very far in terms of pushing money into the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">We have to bring down the cost of running this institution.  The banks had to go through almost every account to see whether people were over or under-charged interest and fees etc.  Doing that and dealing with restitution and the regulatory requirements of the banks is taking 25% of the banks' resources.  That must be brought down.  We are reducing staff numbers to a more reasonable number.  AIB was one of the few multinationals of which we were proud but now we are reducing it to what some would say is almost a local utility.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">I have a few questions, as we all do, to ask of AIB.  There is a marked contrast between the attitude of Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring towards this committee, in their willingness to answer questions and their greater sensitivity to some of the issues we are raising, and that of the public interest directors from the Bank of Ireland.  Would the witnesses agree this contrast has something to do with the fact their bank is 100% owned by the State which shows the merits of nationalised banks over those in which we have only a minority share holding and people like Mr. Boucher think they can treat public representatives with contempt?</p>

We would appreciate if there was a formal structure for doing so.  The bank is owned by the taxpayer and our responsibility is to the taxpayer and the Members of the Oireachtas represent the taxpayer.  We are trying to be as open as possible with the committee in the situation we face and with which we are dealing.  We are giving it our best shot to bring this bank back to viability in the shortest possible time.  David Duffy told this committee he hoped to have this bank back in profitability by 2014.  That certainly is our target.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">Mr. Spring is not going to say it but it needs to be said.  It speaks for itself.  I was nice in my first question but while this is not a matter of chasing individuals I have worked out from the witnesses' answers that Mr. Spring receives approximately €1,000 per meeting and Dr. Somers receives €3,000 per meeting.  Carers work just as hard as Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers and their function in our society is just as important.  The witnesses earn for one meeting what carers earn for five weeks and that payment is being cut.  Do the witnesses think that is fair?  Do they understand how angry people are that because of the behaviour of banks and the very wealthy the people are suffering cuts which will put them in a worse position?</p>

          <p eId="para_781">We have taken steps in the bank to reduce salaries.  The management have reduced their salaries by 15% in the past few months, the next level of management have reduced their salaries by 7.5% and there is effectively a pay freeze in the bank.  We are taking steps primarily because we must take out costs.  The bank works in an international environment and when we sought a new chief executive the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, instructed us to find somebody who was not an insider.  We trawled around the world to find a chief executive and having interviewed many we found an Irish-American who we felt was suitable for the job because he had vast experience of retail and investment banking.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">  The resale of the bank will be ultimately determined by the level of interest from the private markets.  They will look at the cash flow and the ability of the borrowers to make repayments.  The ESM is the potential mechanism by which the bank can be recapitalised and refunded and ultimately taken over by an institution that can firewall it and provide it with the ability to accelerate growth in our economy.  I am sure they have seen what the IMF had to say about the ESM yesterday.  Have the witnesses a strategy for the way the bank should go forward?  Should it be sold to the private market or is the ESM the preferred route?</p>
          <p eId="para_807">  I know that Dr. Somers had a great deal of experience in the funding of the banks.  The funding of banks can come from the European Central Bank, deposit holders, the wholesale markets and so on.  The current multilayered approach is more suited to the private market.  However I, together with some of my colleagues, believe that if we could access further ECB funding we could ultimately reduce the cost of funding to the banks and pass on that to the stressed borrowers.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_808">The ECB is doing a great service for the State in that it is providing a very large amount of money at an interest rate of 0.75%.  It has also provided three year money, which is quite unusual for a Central Bank.  Usually the period of lending by a Central Bank is much shorter.  It has also undertaken to buy up bonds.  Many people say the ECB should take some of the pain for what has happened.  There is an issue about the ECB and I am telling members what I understand the scene to be because there may be subtleties that are lost to me, but its share capital is €10 billion, and effectively if it loses money it has to be recapitalised in some way or another.  It can be recapitalised by the regional Central Banks and if it cannot do it, it will have to come from the Exchequer.  It does not have the ability to take on board losses.  People have also spoken about the ESM and some people have suggested that the €20 billion put in by the State could be taken over by the ESM.  Frankly, I do not think it can because the ESM will have to borrow its funds on the international markets.  It needs a good rating.  As far as I know, it has been downgraded to AA plus and it does not even have a AAA credit rating.  It cannot afford to take any losses either or else it will not be able to raise money at a reasonable rate on the market.  The idea that the EMS would be the solution to our problems in taking on board the losses of the Irish Banks would not work.  I do not think there are any free lunches in this game.</p>

          <p eId="para_810">In theory, as I do not know whether there are other legal problems, if the ESM were to take over AIB it would not pay €20 billion for it.  It might pay, I am guessing €8 billion, and that crystalises a loss of €12 billion.  It could take over something at its market value, it cannot pay over the odds for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">To that end, in relation to the market value of the bank, the market value will be determined by the loans that exist, particularly the mortgage loans that exist.  Built into the loans that have been given for 30, 35 and 40 years is a margin and the margin will be disposable income of my generation more than, with all due respect, the generation of Dr. Somers.  I am not of the belief that any bank should be in a position to capitalise on what I consider to be negligent lending to a generation.  I am of the belief that there should be a moratorium on margin-making gains for the banks until a point in time that the generation has caught up with the natural progression of society.  If that were implemented under the watch of the witnesses in the bank, the value of the bank would be less, but it would ultimately mean society would be able to kick start the economy.  That is a fairer solution to it.  People are looking for justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_812">I think we are moving very much into the area of public policy and what the Government wants to do.  Obviously, whatever happens, when the Government decides to move on any of these areas, it will not be just with AIB but with all the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">  The Deputy refers to what different generations paid for their homes.  I had a mortgage for very many years and I do not think I ever had an interest lower than 8%.  People complain about interest rates of 4% but I suffered under a rate of 8% and more.  I recall in 1992 and 1993, when we had the currency crisis - Mr. Spring will recall this as we both sat around the same table at that time - one of the reasons was that the banks were charging 14% for mortgages and were about to jack up the rate to 18%.  At that stage, we threw in the towel.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">The point is that there was never the level of arrears or stressed mortgages in Dr. Somers's generation as there is at present.  That is the acid test.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">  My last question is in relation to the role of the witnesses as public interest directors.  They ultimately have a responsibility to the shareholders.  The point has been made that 48 staff of the senior management grade have stood down or have been removed.  In the witnesses' estimation, if the bank is left literally bankrupt and with no resaleable value, are they culpable as directors for leading the bank to that position?  In their estimation, is it appropriate that these senior people are remunerated with lucrative pensions in light of the fact that under their stewardship the banks were essentially destroyed?  I put this question to both Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">I thank Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers for accepting the invitation of the committee.  In the interests of time, I will skip straight to the core issue, which is the pension top up of €1.1 billion.  Can each outline his role in that decision?</p>

          <p eId="para_820">This arose out of the need to reduce substantially the number of staff in the bank and to provide both for early retirement provisions and for redundancy, or for whatever term one wants to put on a reduction in the number of employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The trustees of the pension fund required that additional funds be put into the pension fund by the bank to meet the additional pension liabilities that would accrue as a result of the early retirement arrangements. The amount of funding required was fixed at €1.1 billion. The Department of Finance did not want the bank to put any cash into the fund. As such, it put in loans which hopefully will generate funds over time. The proposal came to the board in the context of the restructuring and downsizing of the bank and the board approved the arrangement. I should point out that the bank had no option but to approve it.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">As stated by Dr. Somers, in terms of reducing costs in the bank we took on the early retirement severance scheme under which 2,500 employees will leave the bank between now and 2014.  The pension trustees pointed out to the bank that the pension fund would not be adequately funded if we did that to pay existing pensions.  It was the only option open to the board of the bank.  Obviously, all pensioners benefit but our main focus in the actions we took was to ensure the pension fund for the many thousands of pensioners of Allied Irish Bank would be adequately funded.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">I will respond to that question on a few different levels.  If the State had not bailed out Allied Irish Bank, the situation would have been disastrous.  In terms of the cost of these redundancies, I understand the pay-back period is one year.  This was part of the action to reduce the overall cost of running the bank.  As a result of reduced staff numbers and a reduction in the size of the bank, €400 million per annum will be saved.  We are caught between a rock and a hard place on these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">With the greatest of respect for both of the witnesses, whom I thank for attending today and for their public service, I put it to them that in this case they oversaw a €1.1 billion payment to facilitate voluntary redundancies for staff who, had the State not intervened, would not have been afforded voluntary redundancy and that that was a bad call and a bad use of public money.  I believe it would have been acceptable to let go those people and for them not to have been paid voluntary redundancy packages by the people of Ireland because, had they not stepped in, those staff would not have got any packages.  I say that with great respect for the witnesses.  However, I believe the call made in this case was a bad one.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to brief it today on the European Commission's legislative proposals to bring about a single supervisory mechanism, which constitutes a key element of the proposed banking union for Europe.  I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">  As the committee is aware, the single supervisory mechanism constitutes two regulations which were published by the European Commission on 12 September 2012.  Taken together, the regulations will introduce the first stage of the banking union, the single supervisory mechanism, SSM.  The remaining elements are the completion of CRD IV – the Basel III capital requirements for banks, the common deposit insurance and a common resolution framework, to which I will return later.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">  The two proposals before the committee which we are discussing today are a proposal for a Council regulation conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions - the ECB proposal; and a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No.1093/2010 establishing a European supervisory authority - the European Banking Authority - the EBA proposal.  The Commission also issued a communication to the European Parliament and the Council, A Roadmap towards a Banking Union (COM 510) on 12 September.  The communication sets the single supervisory mechanism in context and indicates further work towards a banking union beyond these first proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">  The ECB proposal aims to introduce a new single supervisory mechanism, SSM, within which the ECB and national competent authorities, NCAs, will co-operate.  Under the proposal, the ECB will have responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions in the euro-area member states and, with a view to maintaining and deepening the Internal Market, member states whose currencies are not the euro will have the right to opt into the SSM.  The EBA proposal aims to introduce the necessary changes to the 2010 EBA regulation in order to ensure decision-making structures continue to be balanced and effective and preserve the interests of all its members.  That will assist in avoiding fragmentation of the Internal Market following the establishment of the SSM.  The banking union will be complete when the single supervisory mechanism is joined with European bank resolution and deposit guarantee mechanisms.  The completion of CRD IV will be also an important element in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">  I propose to take a few minutes to set out the main elements of the ECB regulation under the proposal as published by the Commission in September, which is the subject matter of today's discussion.  The main elements were the conferral on the ECB of specific tasks and policies relating to the prudential supervision of all euro area credit institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> The main elements were, as follows. The conferral on the ECB of specific tasks and policies relating to the prudential supervision of all euro area credit institutions. The ECB would have exclusive competence for a list of prudential supervisory tasks, including authorisation and licensing. The ECB, with the support of the national supervisors, would form the single supervisory mechanism. National supervisors would assist the ECB and comply with its instructions. National supervisors would remain responsible for supervisory tasks not transferred to the ECB, such as supervision of third country branches, supervision of payment services, on-site verifications, implementing guidance or regulations issued by the ECB, and anti-money laundering prevention. It would have explicit and significant responsibility to safeguard financial stability in the EU. The ECB would be responsible for co-ordinating the position of the competent authorities of participating member states in EBA decision-making contexts. There would be a full separation between the ECB’s role in monetary policy and the exercise of supervisory functions. A supervisory board encompassing the specific expertise of national supervisors would be set up to achieve this. The ECB governing council would remain ultimately responsible for supervisory decision-making, with the supervisory board carrying out clearly defined tasks and related decisions. Any non-euro area member state and the ECB could enter into close co-operation. The ECB would then carry out its supervisory tasks in relation to credit institutions established in that non-euro member state. The ECB would be required to act independently in carrying out supervisory functions. It would be accountable to the EU Parliament and to the Council. While the ECB would start supervisory tasks as soon as possible, implementation would be on a phased-in basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> Accompanying the ECB regulation was the EBA regulation, which is the second element of the single supervisory mechanism proposals. It is the proposed regulation amending the existing regulation establishing the European Banking Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> From January 2011, the regulation of financial services across Europe has been overseen by the European Supervisory Authorities, ESAs. There are three European supervisory authorities: the European Banking Authority, EBA; the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA; and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA. The EBA is the regulatory agency tasked with improving co-operation between national supervisors and continuing the development of a single rule-book for financial services in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> The main amendments to the EBA regulation under the Commission's proposal, as published in September, were as follows. In imposing a binding decision to resolve disagreement between supervisors or to require action in an emergency situation, the EBA could request the ECB to follow its decision but could not require the ECB to do so. Where the ECB did not comply, it would have to provide adequate justification for non-compliance. There would be given to an independent panel dealing with the EBA, powers concerning breaches of EU law and the settlement of disagreements between national supervisors. It was proposed that a three-person panel would be required to include at least one member from a non-participating member state. The EBA management board would be required to include at least two representatives from member states not participating in the single supervisory mechanism. EBA voting on decisions relating to regulatory matters would continue to be based on qualified majority voting but with certain safeguards for non-euro member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">That is a description of the proposal as presented in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> Following the publication of the proposals, the European Council set up an <i>ad hoc </i>working party. In view of the importance of the proposals and their complexity, officials and experts from each member state came together to examine the proposals. The <i>ad hoc </i> working party met eight times between late September and early December. The negotiations allowed the Presidency to submit to ECOFIN ministers compromise draft texts on both regulations for final political agreement. The committee might note that, judging by the way the Council works, this was an exceptional measure. It involved a considerable commitment to these regulations and reflected the priority given at EU level to drawing a conclusion as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Arising from the work of that group, on 12 December, ECOFIN finance ministers reached a Council general agreement on the ECB and EBA regulations. As part of the council deliberations the text was amended to take on board the concerns of member states, so there has been considerable amendment to the original proposals as I have just outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> As EU President from 1 January, Ireland will now be tasked to represent the Council position in trialogue negotiations with the European Parliament. I will now briefly describe the current agreed proposal by the ECOFIN ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> Chapter I, articles 1 and 2, deals with subject matter, scope, and definitions. Chapter II deals with co-operation and tasks, and comprises articles 3 to 7. These are some of the important provisions of the regulation. Article 3 ensures the ECB and national supervisors co-operate closely in pursuit of high supervisory standards and that the ECB co-operates with the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and the European Stability Mechanism, ESM. Article 4 provides for the tasks conferred on the ECB. Article 5 establishes the criteria by which the ECB will determine which credit institutions it will supervise directly and those where it will rely on national supervisors to implement the supervisory guidelines and instructions of the ECB.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> The criteria for this assessment are based on an assets on balance-sheet threshold of €30 billion or an assets-to-GDP ratio of 20%. It is important to keep in mind that the ECB will exercise oversight over the functioning of the entire system and will retain the right to intervene to supervise directly any credit institution in any participating member state where it considers it to be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> Article 6 provides for non euro-area member states to enter into a close co-operation with the ECB to join the SSM. It provides for circumstances where one of these objects to a decision of the governing council of the ECB. Chapter III deals with powers of the ECB, and comprises articles 8 to 15. The ECB can, within the SSM, direct national supervisors to take action. </p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Under article 9, the ECB has rights to information from legal and natural persons, and provides for the sharing of this information with the national supervisors. The ECB, supported by national supervisors, as the case may be, can conduct on-site investigations. Article 13 provides for specific powers relating to authorisations and article 15 allows for the ECB to issue administrative sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Chapter IV deals with organisational principles and comprises articles 16 to 25. Article 16 confirms the independence of the ECB and the supervisory board. Article 17 makes the ECB accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council. Significantly, it includes a separate provision allowing for national parliaments to ask questions of the ECB and to invite the chair of the supervisory board to participate in an exchange of views. National supervisors will continue to be accountable to national parliaments. Furthermore, article 17 requires the ECB to prepare reports on the execution of tasks under the regulation. Article 18 ensures the operation of ECB monetary policy is separate from supervisory policy. </p>
          <p eId="para_853"> The supervisory board of the SSM is created under article 19. It will be composed of members of the ECB and the national competent authority from each participating member state. In most cases, the supervisory board will take decisions on the basis of one member, one vote. A steering committee of the supervisory board will be appointed on a rotational basis to support the work of the supervisory board. Article 24 allows the ECB to levy fees on the supervised entities in relation to the costs incurred by it in the operation of tasks conferred upon the ECB by the regulation. </p>
          <p eId="para_854"> Chapter V deals with general and final provisions, and comprises articles 26 to 28. The ECB will assume its full tasks under the regulation on 1 March 2014, or 12 months from the date the regulation enters into force. In the transitional period from when the regulation enters into force and the ECB assumes its full tasks, the ECB is required to prepare a quarterly report on the implementation of the regulation for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. During this transitional period, the ECB will retain the right to assume the supervision of any credit institution in a participating member state where it considers it necessary, or if the ESM requests that it do so, as a precondition for direct recapitalisation by the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Article 26 provides for a review at the end of 2015, which will be repeated every three years thereafter. </p>
          <p eId="para_856"> As regards the EBA amending regulation, the main change from September is that additional safeguards are given to member states who are not participating in the SSM in relation to decision making in the EBA. Decisions on regulatory matters will continue to be made by qualified majority voting, QMV. However, it will have an additional safeguard in that decisions will be deemed adopted only if they are supported by a simple majority of member states participating in the SSM and a simple majority of non-participating member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">When decisions are taking on a breach of law or binding mediation, an independent panel will be established to prepare the relevant decisions. Each such panel will consist of a chairperson, three representatives from participating member states and three representatives from non-participating member states. Decisions of a panel will be taken by simple majority. Where a panel proposes a decision to the board of supervisors, the board will adopt it by a simple majority of participating member states and a simple majority of non-participating member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> The SSM is the first element of the package of banking union measures. It is necessary to conclude as a matter of priority discussions on the remaining elements. The December European Council conclusions call on co-legislators to agree proposals for a recovery and resolution directive and deposit guarantee scheme prior to June 2013. A more harmonised deposit guarantee mechanism would contribute to a more complete banking union. Its absence has increased the cost of bank failures to taxpayers and complicated their handling. The Commission's recent proposals on a bank recovery and resolution mechanism represent an important first step towards an efficient, financially sound, Europe-wide bank resolution regime. They aim to provide a harmonised toolbox at EU level. To overcome the challenges surrounding the orderly resolution of cross-border institutions an independent resolution authority will be required to exercise independently the bank resolution function across the eurozone. Heads of state and the Commission have indicated their commitment to bring forward proposals on such a resolution function mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> Members will be aware that the capital requirements regulations and directive are currently under discussion in the trilogue negotiations in the Commission and European Parliament. The package known as CRD4 aims to strengthen the effectiveness of the regulation of credit institutions and investment firms and to enhance financial stability. The proposals aim to transpose the agreement reached by the Basel committee on banking supervision as endorsed by G20 leaders. Ireland has taken over from the Cypriot Presidency of the EU and it is our intention to complete negotiations under this file. We have commenced initial discussions with Council, Parliament and the Commission and early indications are that all parties will enhance their co-operation with a view to reaching an early agreement with the European Parliament. CRD4 is seen as important to a single supervisory mechanism which provides common standards to be applied across the single supervisory mechanism area. Under the EBA proposal the Presidency has commenced trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament. The ECB proposal will be decided according to the procedure set out in Article 127(6) of the Treaty which requires consultation with the European Parliament only, however both regulations will be considered as a package in the negotiations with that body.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> Ireland's Presidency will give priority to the banking union package to ensure the remaining pillars, CRD4 and harmonised resolution and deposit are put in place as soon as possible to complement the single supervisory mechanism. As President of the Council, Ireland will be required to reflect the views of all member states in concluding negotiations and will act as an honest broker while having due regard to national considerations. I am happy to take questions or clarify anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_862">Proposing a single supervisory mechanism across 17 member states raised a concern at EU level that the banking authority balance which had existed across 27 member states with 27 different positions would be upset.  Those not in the single mechanism were concerned that there would not be a voting block of 17 member states which could consistently outvote those outside.  It was important therefore to amend the European banking authority voting modalities to achieve a more balanced voting arrangement between those inside and those outside the mechanism.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">The ECB is to take over responsibility for the prudential supervision of all banks within the eurozone.  Much of the discussion in the negotiations centred on the fact that the Council decision said there should be differentiated supervision whereby the ECB would take a direct, hands-on interest in day-to-day supervision in some institutions while relying on national competent authorities to supervise the smaller institutions of which there are some 6,000 to 7,000 across Europe.  That would all take place within a single supervisory mechanism.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">I would not put a figure on it but we are talking about several hundreds of larger institutions.  As I highlighted in my opening statement, the text includes thresholds of €30 billion in assets or 20% of GDP of the relevant member state.  Banks large enough to exceed those thresholds will be taken into direct day-to-day supervision by the ECB.  Banks below the threshold will continue to be supervised day-to-day by local competent authorities under the oversight of the ECB and within its general guidelines and rules.  Provision is also being made to ensure that at least three banks in each eurozone state will be supervised directly by the ECB.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">The thresholds are clear, but the regulation provides that the ECB must bring forward methodologies on their application and tease out the detail of how to identify specific banks to supervise.  Based on the criteria, it is likely the two pillar banks in Ireland will fall under direct supervision.  It is a matter to be determined based on a methodology yet to be established by the ECB.  The ECB will take over supervision in March 2014.  As of today, the banks may meet the criteria, but we will see what happens in future.</p>

Old debt has been replaced by new debt which has in turn been placed on the shoulders of taxpayers.  Will the same principles apply?</p>

          <p eId="para_872">As I pointed out in my statement, this is a first and most important step towards achieving an integrated banking union across Europe.  These provisions deal with consolidating the supervision function to the ECB.  That should contribute to improved financial stability across Europe, greater confidence in the markets, better functioning banks that will lend to each other and operate across borders in a way that they have not done because there was no cross-border trust.  If there is a single supervisor applying clearly defined standards across the area it will generate confidence in the banking union which is an important first step.  The December statement of the Heads of State has made very clear that this initial step on supervision must be complemented by further measures in respect of a co-ordinated resolution mechanism and deposit guarantee scheme.  The improved dealing with bank failures will take place in the context of that resolution mechanism and deposit guarantee scheme.</p>

It has been a very complicated discussion and it is a complicated text and issue.  The Deputy is right in saying the single supervisory mechanism is only one part of the key architecture which is made up of European regulations which are directly applied law, European directives which are transposed law, and European rules and technical standards which are developed by the European Banking Authority consistent with that law.  Within that there is a comprehensive framework of rules to be applied consistently across Europe by a single supervisor.</p>

I do not mean prosecute in the legal sense but to say there is a weakness here and we must address it no matter how uncomfortable that is or how powerful the bank is.

The text, which was agreed at Council level, provides clearly that the supervisor will report to the European Parliament as a European institution under European law and will also report to Council.  In the negotiation the Council members provided a specific requirement for a report to national parliaments because the actions of the European Central Bank will have a national impact.

          <p eId="para_901">  The decision making process at Europe is a co-decision between the Council and the Parliament.  That is the trialogue process that brings together the Commission, the Council and the Parliament.  It is the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, that trialogue, that will finally put in place the regulations and the law which will define how this new European Central Bank Supervisory Authority operates.  The Supervisory Authority will take over day-to-day supervision on a consistent manner for all of the larger banks across Europe and a number of banks in each country.  The Supervisory Authority will be accountable to the Parliament and to the Council for the way they do that.  The Supervisory Authority within the ECB has not been created out of nothing.  There is an actual supervisory board that will be running this, which is made up of the head of regulation of every supervisor in every member state that is involved.  It is bringing together all the national expertise into this one entity.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">The legislation had to be delicately drafted around this because as a European institution, it can be accountable only to the European Parliament and the European Council.  Within the provisions, it is quite clear that national parliaments can ask questions of this body and the ECB has made it very clear in its commitment to Council that questions put to the body will be dealt with.  If national authorities ask questions they will get replies and explanations.  There is provision for any of the national authorities to seek to meet a member of the supervisory board, which we would expect to be the national member of the supervisory board and to ask questions of that person as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">  To answer the Chairman's specific question, from the outset the United Kingdom has made it very clear that it sees this as a very good development for Europe but that it will not be participating in it and it would prefer to continue with its sole supervisory arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_918">The legislation does not anticipate every particular eventuality.  The situation of IBRC is unique.  As I mentioned, the methodology on the application of the threshold is to be developed by the ECB and that must be done by June 2013.  We would expect that when the methodology is clearer, the detail of its application to things such as wind down banks will be somewhat clearer.</p>

          <p eId="para_920">I thank Mr. Carrigan for helping us get the structure clear in our heads.  To what extent is the rule book written?  Will it be possible for us to see the rule book which will then be applied by the supervisory mechanism?  Will the rule book be in a fairly clearly understandable form?</p>
          <p eId="para_921">  We are talking in terms of architecture and engineering of the supervisory structure, but then of course policy comes into play.  One could have concerns, especially given my perception of the attitude of the ECB.  I have made this point a number of times.  At the beginning of 2008 the ECB issued a guideline to States and to Central Banks in which it states that if states needed to rescue banks, if possible they should avoid nationalisation but even if they nationalise them they should avoid diverting the goals of the bank from profit maximisation to other social goals.  That is its directive because it believes that to be in the best interests of banking, but as some of the discussions we have had earlier today and much of the discussion between the Parliament and banks at present, we might have a very different view of that.  We might think it would be a good thing if the banks took social and macro-economic goals more into account when deciding their policies.  To put some of this into context, it would be useful for us to know what the rules are, how far-reaching they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Some of them are about the level of capitalisation, possibly risk management and so on, but how far reaching are they and will more rules be developed and, if so, will we see them in a clearly understandable form in order that we know what rules are being applied to the banks and then we can decide whether they are a good idea? </p>

          <from> Ms Mary Burke<recordedTime time="2012-12-20T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_931">I will answer that question as best I can.  There is a rule book.  At least some of the rule book is written.  When Mr. Aidan Carrigan speaks about the fact that we are looking at CRD, he is referring to the capital requirements directive No. 4.  By definition there were three previous directives, at present we are on the third version.  As it is being expanded there will be more rules.  Yes, one can see the rules to the extent that they are EU legislation, to the extent that the EBA issues rules, guidelines, standards, all of which are published.  They go through a consultation process and are finalised and published.  I cannot give a guarantee that they will be particularly user friendly, by their nature they are legalistic and technical but they are available.  Further rules are being developed.  Therefore, the area about which the Deputy inquired, which might be captured under bank resolution, for example, currently the CRD would not go that far but they are working on a resolution directive which, in my recollection of the outcome of the recent summit, was that they wanted that finalised in the first half of 2013.  That is working on a basis of national resolution regimes.  Any aspiration to a pan-European resolution regime is somewhat further out but it is one of the goals of banking union and is recognised both by the Heads of State and, I think, by Mr. Draghi, in some recent statement that is essential.</p>
