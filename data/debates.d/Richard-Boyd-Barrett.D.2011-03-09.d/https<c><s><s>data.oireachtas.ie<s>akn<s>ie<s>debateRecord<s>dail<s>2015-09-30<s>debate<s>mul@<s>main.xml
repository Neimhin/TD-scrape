            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Willie O'Dea</b> asked the <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection</b> her plans to expand social welfare entitlements for self-employed persons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.  [33329/15]</p>
          </question>

            <p eId="para_2">I raise this question again to ascertain if there have been any developments in this matter since it was last raised with the Minister in May. As the House will be aware, we are trying to develop the indigenous sector and the extension of benefits to the self-employed is central to that project.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The self-employed pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4%. These contributions provide cover for long-term social insurance benefits including the State pension (contributory) and the widow’s, widower’s or surviving civil partner’s contributory pension. In contrast, a combined employer and employee PRSI rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of most employees, who can then access the full range of social insurance benefits. </p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The most recent actuarial review of the social insurance fund published in 2012 found that, in the case of the self-employed with earnings equivalent to national average earnings, a 15% contribution rate would be needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory) to the self-employed. This compares very favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed. The review also showed that the self-employed at all income levels got better value for money for their contributions in regard to the State pension than employees generally. </p>
            <p eId="para_5"> In its 2013 report, the advisory group on tax and social welfare found that almost nine out of every ten self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker’s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment. Therefore, it was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker’s benefit. </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> However, the group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes. In this regard the group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only. </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlement for people who are self-employed - there are many such people and the number is growing - any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">I do not detect from the Minister's response any developments since this matter was raised five months ago. It seems that the Minister is using the report to avoid making any decision that would assist the self-employed while, at the same time, the Taoiseach said it is central to Government policy to develop the indigenous sector. Reports report, Ministers decide. The Minister will be aware that the report recommended that the right to illness benefit, invalidity pension and so on, should be extended to the self-employed. I admit the report stated that should be done on a compulsory basis but there is no rationale to that because countries such as Denmark, Germany, Sweden, France, Lithuania, even Romania, are doing this, either for unemployment benefits or sickness benefits on a voluntary basis, such as we have proposed. Will the Minister indicate if she has given thought to extending this on a voluntary basis? If people are prepared to pay, surely they should be accommodated.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">

            <p eId="para_9">I recall when I came into the office of Minister for Social Protection the deficit on the social insurance fund was €2 billion, which was a cause of great concern. Through very careful management we have actually reduced that deficit or, as some people in the media used to call it, the hole in the social insurance fund, to about €180 million, compared to the €2 billion plus left to us by the previous Government. If the Deputy is talking about expanding social insurance then he should be aware that first, it has to be funded and second, it has to be funded in a way that is appropriate for the people who are interested. The Deputy's first point was whether it could be made voluntary. I do not think there is any example anywhere of a voluntary social insurance scheme because the people more at risk would pay and the people who appear not to be at risk, much younger people, might choose not to pay at all. It would cause an enormous problem, even for contributory old age pensions that self-employed people receive for a 4% contribution. Let me be clear about this, I am all in favour of extending it but it will have to be contributed to. I do not know what is Fianna Fáil's attitude on this issue. Having almost crashed and wrecked the social insurance fund it now wants to do that again.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">The people will cast their judgment shortly on the Minister's management of the system. I look forward to it eagerly. The Minister made a statement which is patently false. She said there was no example anywhere of a voluntary contribution providing for extra benefits. I have named six OECD countries which operate just such a system on either the jobseeker's benefit side or the illness benefit side so I ask the Minister to retract that statement. It is perverse that the Government should announce, as it has done about 142 times, that it will encourage the self-employed sector by extending a tax credit to people who are already in business, while at the same time it is doing nothing to extend illness benefit, at a minimum, for people who want to become self-employed or those who lose their businesses because of illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">Is that not perverse? Is the Minister also aware that the leader of her sister party in the United Kingdom, the Rt Hon Jeremy Corbyn, has now put this issue at the very centre of Labour Party policy in the United Kingdom?</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> We are facing an election. Many people are contacting me about this issue to find out if anything is happening about it. Can I now report back to those people that the Government intends to do nothing about this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I am very pleased that I will be launching the comprehensive employment strategy this Friday. I welcomed and supported the Disability Activation Project, which was jointly funded by the European Social Fund and the Department of Social Protection and ran from 2012 to April 2015 in the BMW regions. The objective of the project was to explore ways in which people with disabilities are enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The Department commissioned an independent evaluation to identify the learning from the projects, focusing on what works to increase the capacity and potential of people who have a disability to participate in the labour market. It also examined which aspects of the project are capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the delivery of supports to people with disabilities in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> We have a stream of funding for a follow-on programme, based on the learning from the projects. The new ESF operational programme<i>, </i>Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning, 2014-2020, will provide €10 million in funding for future disability activation activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The Disability Activation Project evaluation report will be examined by an inter-departmental group, which will be chaired by my Department and will include the National Disability Authority and representatives of Departments which have commitments under the comprehensive employment strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> This group will provide, in the context of the actions outlined in the comprehensive employment strategy, a practical mechanism for advancing the positive aspects of the work identified in the evaluation and will determine the next steps in the context of future disability activation activities being provided for under the new ESF programme where the funding will be expanded.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">I was not being overly critical of the Minister. My problem is that there is now a lacuna. For instance, 119 young people took part in one of the projects I am aware of, the WALK PEER programme, and some of those ended up back on the live register. The problem is the gap. If the project had been extended until such time as a replacement model was ready to be triggered, it would not have affected those people who are most vulnerable in our society, namely, the young people and others with disabilities who benefited from the Disability Activation Project.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">As the Deputy will appreciate, the funding was EU funding. As Minister, I managed to identify and set up the programmes, which related in particular to young adults with disabilities, to help them access work, both in the open market and in terms of work amounting to more than eight hours a week because not everybody doing the programmes would have wanted to be involved in a very lengthy number of hours in a working week. The EU funding was conditional on all of these being pilot programmes. We will review the INDECON report, which will not take long to do. I have been with the peer group on several occasions, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, and we are very familiar with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> As a society we have a broader issue relating to young adults who have gone through education but who, when they come to be of working age, are finding it extremely difficult to get work that is attractive to them and for the hours they would be interested in and suit their particular circumstances.</p>

Since the Minister is aware of the WALK PEER programme, I presume she is aware of the huge savings that can be made, as well as the benefits to the young people. Some people who were previously in day services were able to move to projects such as the peer programme, and there is a saving from that. Not everybody is suitable for those programmes. Can the Minister give an indication of the number of months that will pass before we see an equivalent to what the INDECON report had stated was one of the better ones and should be replicated? How long will that take? Reports can be published and it can take months, and sometimes years, before action is taken arising from them.</p>

For friends and relations of mine who would have children in that situation, it is very important. We have mainstreamed many young people into primary and secondary school, and now into preschool, and as the Deputy is aware, there is a number of programmes relating to third level education, all of which I have been a strong supporter of, both privately and publicly.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">I personally know some of the people who have been on various programmes connected to the organisation involved in WALK. The approach taken has been very positive for many of the people I know who participated in the programmes. The EU funding came in the context of activation for work. The question that really arises is what is the best mix. We know there are social benefits and the types of benefits mentioned by the Deputy regarding families and individuals, with which I agree wholeheartedly, but this does not necessarily constitute work-type activation. The issue we really have is with the changes that have happened in institutions, where there were often sheltered workshops. We are moving more towards a wider employment area and the question is how best to do this while meeting the needs of people. As the Deputy probably knows-----</p>

            <p eId="para_52">The most recent figures we received on food poverty were in 2013, when they showed that one in ten people suffered food poverty. This figure was one in nine in Donegal, the county with the lowest income levels. I have not been able to find updated figures to see whether the position has got better or worse. We know from the CEO of Crosscare, Michael McDonagh, that there is a growing demand for food banks throughout the country. Obviously, there has been an increase in the figures and I would like to know whether the Tánaiste will provide them.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">I will give the Deputy some of the figures. The official indicator of poverty is consistent poverty, which is the overlap of two measures, namely, at risk of poverty and basic deprivation. The basic deprivation indicator includes two items relating to the consumption of food. According to the CSO survey of income and living conditions of 2013, which contains the most recent statistics we have on this, 4% of the population were unable to afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day and 8% were unable to afford a roast in addition once a week. Food-related items are, therefore, a very small component of the basic deprivation index. These statistics are available in full and listed in the survey of income and living conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The Department of Social Protection provides income support to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty. In 2013 social transfers, excluding pensions, lifted almost one quarter of the population out of being at risk of poverty. Ireland is among the best performing states. We come in slightly behind countries such as Denmark and Sweden. The OECD report of 15 September shows Ireland just after the Scandinavian countries in terms of performance. Our recovery is noted for the level of protection we have had for people on social welfare incomes and this can be seen in the OECD report.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> The Department has a number of programmes to improve access to food for vulnerable people. The school meals programme will spend €39 million this year, which is an increase of €2 million on the last budget. It provides breakfasts and lunches to 1,700 schools and organisations in respect of approximately 220,000 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The Department administers the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, FEAD, which provides food and basic consumer products to people most at risk. Almost €27 million will be available over the period to 2020, of which 65% is for food. The Department advertised this programme in July and the applications process is ongoing. It is progressing very well and is being used by many organisations which provide meals to people.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_57">The response is just not good enough. The Tánaiste stated 220,000 children receive breakfasts and lunches. This is a welcome development for these children, but why is it happening? It is because people do not have enough money. They do not earn enough in their wages. It also affects pensioners. The minimum wage should be increased. People who lost their jobs are still unemployed. The only way to deal with this is to increase people's incomes in order that they might to be able to buy food or else the Government should subsidise food for people on certain incomes, such as a 10% or 20% discount on certain foods which are necessary. This could be pinpointed by organisations dealing with food poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> It was ironic that the Tánaiste spoke about a recovery several weeks ago and then went with a big smile on her face to cut a ribbon to open a food bank in Glasnevin. Many people noticed this irony and they are very angry about it.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I was with people who work and volunteer with Crosscare. It is grand for the Deputy to make snide remarks about them. For her information, people have been involved in this work for generations. What is happening at present is that major supermarkets and other businesses are giving absolutely first-class food, which they would not otherwise be selling, in an organised way to Crosscare, which, in turn, gives it to various organisations which support the distribution and giving of meals to people. This means food and other goods - because it is not just food - which would otherwise go into a dump are utilised by, for example, a local community centre which may provide lunches and snacks for elderly people.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> Not every child who goes to school without breakfast does so because the family does not have money. In a small number of cases, but it is very significant, the parents may have issues which mean that, unlike most parents in the State, they are not perhaps in a position to prepare food at breakfast time. The children feed themselves. When they go to school, they get a breakfast and a social space, which is hugely beneficial for them. It is not for the Deputy to knock all of this.</p>

It is an attack on the Tánaiste's policies and the fact that people must depend on food banks. There has been an increase. Michael McDonagh, the CEO of Crosscare, stated has been an increase in the number of people needing food banks. If it was one in ten in 2013, it could be two in ten.</p>

            <p eId="para_78"> A range of companies have surplus top quality food or goods and the different charitable and community organisations are used as a mechanism to redistribute that to people who want that. That is instead of having it put into landfill. That is a perfectly sensible use of social resources in this country. It is a combination of people involved with charity and community organisations, businesses and the Department of Social Protection and other public organisations. It means we can utilise food that would otherwise go to waste. It is not a measure of additional poverty at all in Ireland; it is a sensible use of food and other materials that would otherwise just be dumped. What is the problem?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_81">Taking the measure of income inequality used internationally by economists such as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, the Gini coefficient, Ireland does extremely well. Ireland has a level of inequality that is below the average in the European Union and the 28 OECD countries, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom. In other words, we have less inequality in Ireland, notwithstanding the biggest economic crash in our history, than the average of European Union and OECD countries. It is far below that of the United States. According to EUROSTAT, the Gini coefficient was 30 in Ireland in 2013, compared with a European average of 30.5. This is a reflection of both our highly progressive tax system and the strength and depth of Ireland’s social protection system.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> Relative poverty is measured through the at risk of poverty indicator. EUROSTAT data indicates that Ireland’s at risk of poverty rate in 2013, the last figures we have from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, and which was based on data from the height of the crisis in 2012, was 14.1%. That is better than the EU average, where the proportion at risk of poverty is 16.6%. Ireland has the seventh lowest at risk of poverty rate of the 28 EU member states. A key reason for Ireland’s low at risk of poverty rate is social transfers. In 2013, social transfers, excluding pensions, lifted almost a quarter of the population out of relative income poverty. Ireland is the best-performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, and this reflects the Government decision not to reduce core welfare rates as part of the troika programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> Looking forward, I believe that growing employment and supporting people back to work will have the greatest impact on poverty. The Government’s twin employment strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work are reaping rewards as Ireland’s recovery continues to strengthen, with more than 110,000 additional people returning to work and unemployment falling by a third. We have much to do in this area but we are just behind the likes of Austria, Sweden and Denmark. That we have the seventh lowest level of inequality in the EU is a very important achievement.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">I did not ask the Minister about inequality or whether we were 0.5% percent above the OECD average. I am asking the Minister about levels of poverty in this country. I accept the latest figures are 18 months to two years out of date but they were produced by the Central Statistics Office, CSO. They indicate that 376,000 people in this country, or 8.2%, were living in consistent poverty, and although the poverty line had fallen by 16%, nearly one in seven people was at risk of poverty. The data also demonstrate that over 30% of the population was experiencing deprivation, meaning they were deprived of the basic essentials of life, such as a warm winter coat or adequate heating. I realise the CSO figures are somewhat out of date but has the Minister any measurement on progress made since the period relating to those published figures?</p>

            <p eId="para_85">We can be clear about the figures. The OECD report of 15 September is in the Dáil library and contains Ireland's ratings. It indicates that we rate really well, particularly given the incredibly destroyed economy that Fianna Fáil left us, together with the figure when we entered office of 330,000 people without work. The biggest element in poverty is people, particularly of working age, not having access to a paid job at a reasonable rate of pay for a reasonable number of hours. That causes more poverty than anything else. I am happy to say we now have 130,000 extra jobs since the Government came to office.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> The at risk of poverty rate fell from 16.5% in 2012 to 15.2% in 2013. Using EUROSTAT data, Ireland's at risk of poverty rate of 14.1% was well below the EU average of 16.6% in 2013. I do not have later data than that with respect to national statistics. That is done by the CSO, based on a very wide range of interviews of significant numbers of people.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_87">From my interaction with constituents, which I maintain on a pretty regular basis, it does not seem that people are very much interested in history. They want to know what the Tánaiste, as leader of the so-called socialist party in Government, has done to combat poverty levels in this country. The latest CSO figures indicate that in rural Ireland - forgotten Ireland - 350,000 people were at risk of poverty. That means the last time poverty risk was measured in rural Ireland, 350,000 people were living on incomes of less than €10,500 per annum. The study also demonstrated that in rural Ireland, 560,000 people were without facilities that would be considered reasonable and normal in a decent society, such as the ability to go out for a night, heat their houses adequately and replace worn-out furniture, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> On 25 September 2012, exactly four years ago - the Government has been in office for that period - the Minister told me that the poverty targets were revised as one of the first actions of the Government. One revised target was to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016. The latest figures for this indicate it is at 8.2%, although they are a bit out of date. Does the Minister believe it is a realistic ambition to achieve that target of a 4% level of consistent poverty by 2016, which is just a few months away?</p>

            <p eId="para_153"> Under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers’ Insolvency) Act 1984, an employer company shall be regarded as being insolvent if the company is placed into receivership, if a winding-up order has been made or if a resolution for the voluntary liquidation of the company has been passed. The Department is continuing to review the position to establish what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals in situations where employers cease trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and owe moneys to their employees. The Department is consulting a range of interested parties, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of these issues. Officials from the Department will continue to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the matter. Given the very difficult legal issues that need to be addressed, I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the review will be completed. We do not yet have a legal solution to it because there are all sorts of consequences that might flow from taking a legal position that was not carefully worked out. It could damage other people as well as addressing the problems faced by some people. It would be helpful if the Deputy sent us the detail of the case to which she refers.</p>

            <p eId="para_154">I am glad to hear there has been movement and that the Tánaiste and her Department are working on resolving the issue because workers find themselves in a very serious situation when a company folds in that way. In the recent case to which I refer, we were told the sole trader should have taken out insurance for insolvency purposes. If that is the position, why are sole traders not obliged to do so when they set up companies, rather than it being a case of finding out after the fact that a sole trader does not have insurance and of workers being left high and dry? Workers must deal with the insolvency payments scheme, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, etc., and they are getting nowhere. Their PRSI payments were not made and right across the board they are not entitled to medical care. It is a very serious issue that should be dealt with in a manner that will resolve the situation for the affected workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">It is a very difficult legal area. I will outline some of the difficulties. We have reformed the insolvency payments scheme. People are now paid their entitlements very rapidly. It has been transformed since the payments were taken over by the Department of Social Protection. However, the law is, in general, not in the remit of my Department but in that of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. A more appropriate approach might be to widen the remit of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement so that proceedings can be taken. However, in the case of a very small firm - and I do not know what is involved in the cases to which the Deputy refers - the sums of money involved may be very small. They might be €50, €100 or a few hundred euro. Both the principle and the sum are very important to the people who are owed money but to go to the High Court for a hearing would cost something of the order of €20,000 or €25,000. In addressing this, we must find a sensible and proportionate approach which does not have negative knock-on consequences for workers' other rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_165">In other words, payment is not subject to residence in the country in which the contributions were paid in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_166"> On the other hand, the non-contributory State pension is a means-tested payment based upon habitual residence in Ireland. It is a scheme to help older people living in Ireland to avoid poverty, particularly those who have no other provision for old age. There is no requirement for this payment to be exportable under EU rules. Indeed, it would be highly unusual to consider that persons living abroad should have entitlement to this pension. Issues that would arise in this regard include who would be eligible for the payment in the first instance, as well as the appropriate rates payable to persons living abroad in view of the varying costs of living in other countries. </p>
            <p eId="para_167"> The State pension is generally not payable while the claimant is absent from the State. However, if someone is going abroad, as the Deputy mentioned, for illness or family purposes, they should notify the Department before their departure because there is an element of flexibility about this. In the case of people who go abroad on holiday for more than two weeks, the pension payment will normally be reinstated and may be backdated for a period of up to 13 weeks on their return to this country. However, payment is not allowed for repeated long-duration absences. </p>
            <p eId="para_168"> I am not considering any changes to the legislation governing this scheme so as to enable a person in receipt of the non-contributory State pension to leave the State for indefinite periods and continue to receive the pension.

However, they could not take the decision to travel, given that without a payment, they would have been unable to pay their rent and other standing charges for a period. They were hoping to go for three to four weeks. Given that so many people have emigrated of late, will the Minister extend the period from two weeks to four weeks and continue the payment, if the proper documentation is presented? I accept the Minister's arguments. I know of grandparents who travelled to visit their daughter, who then gave birth and experienced complications, and they want to extend their stay but have no income with which to pay their bills such as rent. Will the Minister extend the two-week period in the case of documents being presented, not the 13 weeks she mentioned?</p>

            <p eId="para_172">As I said, if the Deputy will give me the details of the case, we can check it. If the people go to their local office and explain the circumstances, we have the capacity to be flexible. I have to be very honest with the Deputy and clear on this. The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland as part of the social welfare system was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit on arrival in Ireland. In many cases, such a person would not be entitled to export it. While I understand the Deputy has a particular set of circumstances in mind regarding Irish people who have been living and working in Ireland, we live in the EU which has habitual residence conditions. Given that our pension payments, notwithstanding the earlier discussion, are among the highest in the EU, the Deputy would be opening us up to a huge number of people coming from other EU countries to claim non-contributory pensions. It would be very difficult to afford it. The Deputy must be very careful about it.</p>

I also asked that it be on the production of certain documents. One could set conditions whereby the standard practice of two weeks is acceptable but people who can show the reason for travel and the duration will not be penalised. This is how they see it. Although people can apply for their pensions to be backdated when they return, there is no guarantee, and this is one of the problems. If one travels for four weeks, one might get payment for only two weeks. For pensioners, this can have a major impact regarding their bills.</p>

            <p eId="para_176">The question relates to the situation that emerges whereby a number of one-parent families, particularly where the mother has been in part-time work and is in receipt of rent support from the Department, are disadvantaged as a result of the transition from the one-parent family allowance to the new system.

            <p eId="para_177">The one-parent family payment scheme reforms aim to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into, or increase their level of, employment. The Department has contacted those lone parents who have transitioned from one-parent family payment, who are working part-time and who may have experienced a reduction. These customers were invited to attend a one-to-one meeting with a case officer in order to discuss their options. The Department will continue to assist these customers in any way possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_178"> Of the approximately 25,500 lone parents who transitioned out of the one-parent family payment on 2 July 2015, approximately 5,000 of them are in receipt of the rent supplement. Where these customers are in employment and have transitioned from the one-parent family payment to another income support payment, their contribution towards their rent may have decreased. The Deputy probably knows this. The amount they have to pay may have decreased. A lone parent who was working 19 hours per week on the national minimum wage, while also in receipt of the one-parent family payment, family income supplement and rent supplement, has seen very little difference in his or her weekly income after transition to the family income supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_179"> If the Deputy has a case in which a lone parent has experienced a reduction, the rent supplement can be reviewed. We are doing this on a case-by-case basis and so far this year, we have negotiated approximately 4,500 cases. I recommend the Deputy bring such cases to the attention of his local social welfare office with a view to having the rent supplement reviewed. We are continuously reviewing all the elements of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">Following on from Deputy Durkan's question - I think he voted for these changes, while I voted against them - the Tánaiste has mentioned some of the figures. She told colleagues last week that, since July, approximately 96% of the 25,500 affected recipients of the one-parent family payment have transitioned. Of those, however - as she just indicated to Deputy Durkan - only 8,100 transitioned to family income supplement, FIS. The Tánaiste made it a big selling point for these changes that she would be helping people into further economic independence and out of State dependency. However, is it not the reality that there is an urgent need to review the position? Organisations such as the National Women's Council and One Family are calling for a pause, so the Tánaiste will have an opportunity in two weeks' time in the budget to do precisely that and re-examine the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">As the Deputy said, approximately 25,500 lone parents transitioned from the one-parent family payment scheme on 2 July 2015. Approximately 13,600 of lone parents moved to the jobseeker’s transitional payment. In fact, as the Deputy knows, they would have had no change in their income from the lone parent's allowance. However, once a parent's youngest child is seven years old, he or she can become involved in education and training opportunities. That is going extremely well in the Department and has been very well received. Some 2,500 lone parents moved to the jobseeker’s allowance scheme because, presumably, their youngest child was over 14 years of age. Some 8,100 lone parents moved to the family income supplement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_186"> A significant number of lone parents would be full-time homemakers and that has always been the case. We are following the example of Scandinavian countries that the Deputy has often said he admires. In those countries, children are settled in school much younger, at one, two or three years of age. In Britain and the North of Ireland, that occurs at five years of age. At that stage, one gives people an opportunity to get involved again in education, training and work. That has the best outcomes for lone parents and their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_187"> There are currently 8,800 customers in receipt of the back-to-work family dividend, of which over 6,500 are former one-parent family payment recipients. The back-to-work family dividend allows parents to retain the child portion of their former core social welfare weekly payment, which equals €29.80 per week per child, for two years, with full entitlement in the first year and 50% entitlement in the second year. This equates to €1,550 per child in the first year and €775 per child in the second year.</p>

            <p eId="para_190">-----we still meet a lot of lone parents who find that the system effectively leaves them worse off. Like most of us in the Chamber, the Tánaiste stood on the picket lines with the Dunnes Stores workers. Despite that fact, however, people on 15-hour contracts still find themselves that much worse off. The overall selling point of these major changes was that women would be encouraged into the workforce, yet the figures for August show that women's unemployment is rising in important categories. Is the Department of Social Protection closely tracking and monitoring the impact that this is having on many families? As regards the new changes, we are hearing about people losing money and being caught being between a rock and a hard place concerning their work and family duties. Is this the case? Will the Tánaiste undertake a review of the system and change it significantly in two weeks' time in the budget and in the new social welfare Bill?</p>

            <p eId="para_191">As I have said on a number of occasions, we want to ensure in the forthcoming budget that out of the additional moneys we will be able to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.5 billion. We want to focus in particular on families with children, retired people and those on long-term social welfare payments. The amount of money we have to spend is significant, although it is not as much as I would like. Obviously, we have not yet finalised decisions but that will be the focus of what we will do in the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_192"> With the back-to-work family dividend, we are providing an additional support in that transition period when people are returning to work. That is to help them because when people first go back to work they may be in entry-level employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_193"> As regards the number of hours, what the Deputy said is very interesting. We have been working with IBEC and other employers' organisations to encourage the development and availability of employment at 19 hours, or above, per week.

I am hoping she might give special attention to a category of women who are experiencing a discriminatory pension as a result of the marriage bar and an overhang from that situation. One of my constituents said recently that a colleague of hers had applied to pay the property tax to have it deducted from her pension. However, she was told she could not do that because her income could not be brought below €188, yet this woman is expected to live on a pension of €150 because she cannot access a full State pension as a result of the marriage bar.</p>

            <p eId="para_199">The marriage bar is a term used to describe a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, whereby women were expected to leave their employment upon marriage. The bar was removed when Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973.</p>
            <p eId="para_200"> Where such employees were in the public service, they paid a modified rate of PRSI. These contributions provided no cover for the State pension and, accordingly, the marriage bar would not have impacted on State pension entitlement. It may, however, have impacted upon their eventual entitlement to a public service pension, which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_201"> The State pension, contributory, is based on the PRSI contributions paid or credited by the person over their working life, and the level of entitlement depends on their yearly average number of contributions. I was the Minister of State who brought this in together with the then Minister, Michael Woods. From 1994, a homemaker's scheme was introduced where time out of the workforce to care for children, or people with a disability, can be disregarded for the purposes of calculating that yearly average.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">Where someone over 66 does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may apply for a non-contributory pension which is based on need and is means-tested. The maximum rate of this pension is €219 weekly. Where it is more beneficial for the person making the claim, they may instead seek an increase for qualified adult payment based on their spouse's State pension contributory, the maximum rate of which is €206.30. This increase is, by default, paid directly to the qualified adult. </p>
            <p eId="para_203"> Supplementary welfare allowance is a means-tested payment. Any person aged 66 or over is entitled to make a claim for the means-tested State pension non-contributory. The pension is in the first instance paid at a higher weekly rate than the supplementary welfare allowance - €219 rather than €186 - and the means test for the pension is considerably less onerous than that which applies for the supplementary welfare allowance. This means that regardless of circumstances, someone eligible to apply for the State pension non-contributory should receive significantly more than he or she would if he or she claimed the supplementary welfare allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">That is something we will explore. The point that was being made was that potentially there were certain anomalies in the system. While welcoming the homemaker's scheme, which the Minister introduced in 1994, she made the point that it excluded people like herself who had to give up their jobs prior to 1973 and that there was an anomaly in the scheme relating to the way PRSI contributions were worked out. I believe that the requirements to get a full contributory pension are that one must have accumulated 500 full PRSI contributions and have worked ten years before reaching the age of 55. This person claims that she meets both of those criteria but that the Department averaged the contributions over a 47-year period which meant that had she never worked prior to her marriage and only worked post-1998, which she did, she would get the full whack but because she worked prior to her marriage, she is being discriminated against. This is certainly an anomaly about which I have not heard an answer but I hear the Minister's point about accessing other revenue somewhere else.</p>

            <p eId="para_209">The marriage bar was done away with when Ireland joined the EEC when a range of measures around equality came into law in Ireland. Ireland has the homemaker's credit, which is quite generous and which I was involved in introducing in 1994. This particular lady is entitled to apply for a non-contributory pension. If one looks for an assessment of what would be her best way of maximising what she is receiving, that could be a non-contributory pension which at €219 per week is a significant payment. If the lady has a spouse, she could look to get a qualified adult payment. Again, this is not as high as a full non-contributory weekly pension in her own right. It is a slightly lower rate if her spouse or partner is already claiming a full pension. Perhaps she should talk to somebody in the local social welfare office, look at the history and see whether she would be in a better position if she claimed under a different heading.</p>

That anomaly needs to be addressed in any case.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">Research shows that being at work reduces the poverty rate for lone parents by three quarters, or 75%, compared to people who do not work. A recent study for the Department shows that lone parent families are particularly vulnerable to living in jobless households. A key way to tackle poverty then is to get parents back to work. The ongoing one-parent family payment reforms and the new back to work family dividend - which I introduced in last year's budget - will support parents to take up and remain in employment, especially people who are the furthest from the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_215"> I have long been concerned about the high levels of poverty experienced by lone parent families, including the children in those families. In 2013, lone parent families had consistent poverty rates over two and a half times those of the general population. This is a consistent trend over time. Indeed, in 2004, when the country was pretty much in the middle of the boom, the consistent poverty rate for lone parents was more than four and a half times that of the general population. </p>
            <p eId="para_216"> Social transfers play a very important role in reducing income poverty for lone parent families. In 2013, social transfers excluding pensions lifted almost a quarter of the population out of income poverty. This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 60% and is the best outcome in that regard in the EU.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_218"> The Government is committed to tackling poverty and continues to improve access to the labour market for lone parents. I am confident that these measures will continue to improve income and living standards, and will be reflected in future poverty statistics.</p>

            <p eId="para_219">Rather than hailing the change to lone parent benefits, working lone parents are actually not benefiting from the change to the lone parent payment, which is an indictment of the policy of this Government and is part of the austerity package that has been persistently implemented in this country. Those who need the most are bearing the brunt of austerity.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">Poverty is something we must fight against and work to eliminate, which is what the Government and I are doing. The critical way to help people out of poverty is to get them into employment and to get good jobs. This is why we will be raising the minimum wage. I know it does not affect a huge number of people but it affects about 75,000 people in work. I hope that we will also look in the budget at ways of making things better for families with children, regardless of whether they are two or one-parent families - whatever kind of families they are. In particular, we are looking at ways of helping people who have retired.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">Along with the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, we have been around the houses on this a few times.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> These amendments seek to shorten the timeframe for the production of the first national mitigation plan from 24 months after enactment of the Bill to less than that. I know that many in the Opposition and in the environmental NGO community were concerned at the original 24 month timeframe, considering it to be too long in the context of our pressing mitigation targets up to 2020. Accordingly, in amendment No. 27, I have decided to shorten this timeframe to 18 months. I did so on the basis of what I heard on Committee Stage, taking on board what Deputies said on Committee Stage. I am not sure if the Deputies opposite were there at the time. While I know this will probably not be enough for them, I feel it is a fair compromise. It is the bare minimum necessary to allow robust mitigation policy measures to be developed and to be made subject to strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment pursuant to EU directives, as well as to statutory body processes.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">The point of the amendment is to overcome the ambiguity in the proposed Bill that seems to imply that the low carbon and mitigation plan will not be put before the Dáil for approval and discussion, but instead will be left to the approval of the ruling party alone. That would be a disaster for transparency, accountability and democracy. It is essential, in light of the seriousness of the situation and the short-term and long-term effects that any such plan would have on the country and the environment, that it would be debated in an open and democratic manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> The Government subsidises the fossil fuel industry by more than €1 billion a year, propping up the development of oil and gas reserves that cannot be exploited if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change. It is presumptuous of me to predict it, but the chances of the next Government most likely also being a neoliberal one are pretty strong and the criminal corporate welfare will more than likely continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">Amendment No. 38 seeks to delete the word "Government" and substitute the word "Oireachtas". This is important because Governments come and go and, as we see in the economics sphere, they take their line from a very small, elusive and distant group of people such as economic management councils. Even within Cabinet a very small group, basically four people, set economic policy. It is important the whole of the Oireachtas has an input and that the whole process is debated in this House. It is important that Departments and sectors are held accountable by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Addressing climate change will take the efforts of all sectors of society and there is no one sector, whether supporters of Government or Opposition, which will change it. Instead, it will be the people we all represent, either as Opposition Members or as Members of the Government benches, as Independents, members of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party. That is the reason I am putting forward my amendment No. 38.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> My amendment No. 52 makes the same point and suggests the insertion of "both Houses of the Oireachtas" after "Government". Very few of us would disagree that the Seanad needs reform but hopefully it will, in the future, be more representative. It is the Upper House and the Chamber which applies checks and balances to what happens in this House. It gives a second view. It is important that both Houses of the Oireachtas have an input and it is important both can scrutinise what is happening with climate change. One might question whether the Seanad represents various sectors, as it is supposed to do now, but hopefully it will do so after the changes brought in by new Seanad proposals. They will not happen before the next Seanad elections but I hope the elections after that will be to a reformed Seanad, which our party fully supports. Hopefully, its Members will then bring the various sectors of Irish society with us. </p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The Government came into power on the promise of a democratic revolution which is now a well-worn cliché but the Minister has the opportunity today to put his words into action and open up the process. He should not feel threatened by the Opposition as the people on the Opposition benches want to play their part on climate change. We want to do that within our own communities and to give leadership in the Chamber by making sure there is legislation in place which is fit for purpose. The Minister does not have anything to fear from the Opposition benches on this matter because, if anything, we are even more concerned about climate change than Government Deputies and Ministers. This is a real opportunity to give a little bit of power to, and to include, Members right across the Chamber by involving the full Dáil in the process of dealing with climate change. I ask the Minister, not in a cynical way but in a very honest way, to accept amendments Nos. 38 and 52. </p>

          <p eId="para_337">The question of climate change is simply too important for there not to be the fullest possible scrutiny and oversight of mitigation plans and of the actions to be taken to reduce CO2 emissions. I do not see why the Minister should resist these amendments, of which mine is amendment No. 50, which all make the same point that these plans need to be assessed and scrutinised by the entire Oireachtas. It is about hardwiring the question of dealing with climate change into the political system so it does not become a decision for the Government of the day which will spin its view of the situation on climate change. Instead, there will be the fullest possible scrutiny of the issue and it will be centre stage in the political system, overseen in the most transparent and accountable way by all the political forces of the Dáil and the public who will be looking in. It is necessary that the entire matter be fully interrogated on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> This series of amendments is fully in line with the promised democratic revolution. I do not really see how the Minister can say with a straight face that he remains committed to democratic reform, Dáil reform, political reform and the high-blown rhetoric of democratic revolution and then resist this. A capital plan has just come out and announcements about dealing with the housing crisis are being made month after month but we never get a real opportunity to scrutinise the detail of these announcements. Instead, we get Government by press conference, press release, photo-op and political stunt where the Government merely appears to be doing something. We have blaring headlines suggesting something big, something good and dramatic is happening on a particular issue but we never get the opportunity to scrutinise the detail. The reason we do not get the chance to scrutinise the detail is that if we did get the chance to do so, the whole thing would unravel and we would discover that nothing was really happening. It is all generalities and any measures are simply rehashed and recycled versions of measures that have been announced previously while nothing is happening on the ground. In fact, in many cases, the situation is getting much worse on the ground, as is certainly the case with the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">It should not be allowed happen with the housing crisis, which is a disaster, but let us not compound that sort of bad politics by doing the same on an issue as important and as vital to the survival of humanity and this planet as climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I do not see why the Minister would resist these amendments and I do not see what is at stake other than a desire by the Government to continue closed and unaccountable government that operates by diktat and spin. If that is not the Government Fine Gael and the Labour Party are, and they are keen to prove they are serious about open, accountable, more democratic government, then they should agree to these amendments. They relate to the most basic reform of democracy that one could imagine. Important plans should be subject to such scrutiny and it would send a clear message that the Government is serious about the issue of climate change and so serious that it intends to hard-wire regular scrutiny of the matter into the political system in order that it cannot be spun, ignored or manipulated by this or that Government now or in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">I refer to my amendment No. 56. The many commitments and promises made by the Government included the putting of a question to the people regarding the abolition of the Seanad. I remind the Government that this wish was rejected by the people and that having been the case, I would have expected legislation to go through the normal procedures in both Houses of the Oireachtas. I concur with previous speakers in this regard. I am anxious for the House to be informed as to why these amendments were not accepted on Committee Stage and for the Minister to reiterate why they will not be accepted on Report Stage. Irrespective of the contention, shared by all of us, that the Seanad is due for reform, it is the will of the people that it be retained. Parties other than that of the Taoiseach have committed to such reform. Following such a recent poll in which the people sought the retention of the Seanad and the additional scrutiny that takes place there following the passage of legislation in this House, the people's decision is being rejected in the form of the proposal whereby the Government wishes to bypass that process, which is constitutionally enshrined. I ask the Minister to respond.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">As I stated on Committee Stage, the amendments call for national mitigation plans and-or national adaptation frameworks to be approved by either Dáil Éireann or the Oireachtas instead of, or in addition to, approval by the Government of the day. I strongly disagree with these proposals, as the Government of the day should be the approving authority and should be held accountable for its approved plans. Delegating approval to the Dáil or the Oireachtas as a whole undercuts the role of the Government of the day to the detriment of accountability and, accordingly, I will not support the amendments, a point I clearly made on Committee Stage. Governments have a mandate. They are elected by the people and they have a mandate to serve. Governments will come and go but all governments have that mandate and, rightly, should have authority in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">The Minister should come on. I thought he was more fair-minded than that. There is an opportunity for him to lay the plan before the Oireachtas in order that the Dáil can scrutinise it. That is our role. When I was elected by the people of Laois-Offaly, that is what they sent me here to do. Opposition Members need to have an input into these plans. The Minister is keeping the Opposition outside the tent unnecessarily on this issue; he is pushing the Opposition outside the door. He can shake his head all he likes but that is what he is doing. He has an opportunity, particularly through amendment No. 52, to allow that to happen. He has nothing to fear and everything to gain from laying the plan before the Dáil and allowing a debate for a few hours on it. Let us consider some of the issues that have been debated in the House over the past four and a half years. Long evenings and nights have been spent on obscure issues that, perhaps, were not that important.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> A national mitigation plan is hugely important. The issue of climate change will be a matter for life and death; it will be a matter of survival for some coastal areas. We have witnessed the effects of rising sea levels along the west coast. We also witnessed the negative effects of climate change on agriculture in recent years, following extreme weather patterns, which were damaging. This is an important issue and I represent those people the same as the Minister. It is important that the Minister addresses this and I ask him to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">The Minister's attitude to these amendments sums up why the political system is so discredited and why people are so alienated from it. I am surprised he is shaking his head because the language the Government parties used when they were elected about democratic revolution was used precisely because they knew that the slaughtering the previous Government received at the polls was at least in part due to enormous disaffection and alienation from the political system and the political establishment, which continues to exist. The Government parties felt the need to use that language because they knew that is what the people wanted. They want more accountability, a more participatory democracy and more oversight of what governments do regarding the decisions that affect them. A democracy which is just about an election every five years with the Government going off to do what the hell it likes in the interim is discredited. It needs to change and this was acknowledged in the programme for Government, but like so many other proposals, the Government parties are busily abandoning it.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">In this case, it is abandoning it on an issue that is of vital importance for the survival of the planet, namely, that of climate change. All that is being asked in these amendments is that the effectiveness of the national mitigation plan to do with reducing CO2 emissions, and the measures that will be taken to do that, would be scrutinised by the Houses of the Oireachtas and not simply spun by the Government of the day in whatever way it feels like so doing. That is extremely important because, as I said, many of these announcements and plans are being made about crucial issues such as housing and capital investment. We get the public relations, the press release and the photo opportunity but we do not get an opportunity to scrutinise the detail. However, that is the point of democracy. That is the point of this House and it is what the people are demanding. The Minister is flying in the face of the demands of the people of this country for real democratic, thoroughgoing reform. He is reverting to type in terms of the way a discredited political establishment has done its business for far too long. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister on this. There is nothing at stake in accepting these amendments except reform of, and improvement in, democracy, which would require that the scrutiny of our efforts to deal with climate change would be hardwired into the political system. That is what we are asking for. </p>

          <p eId="para_352">The Minister was very forthright and almost curt in his response. I acknowledge that what is contained in the Bill will receive the scrutiny it deserves in the Seanad. However, one of the main elements of it is the publication of a climate change plan. It would have targets, proposals and responsibilities and much of what would be contained in it would have to be adhered to by various Departments. The Seanad has the authority to agree or disagree with, and scrutinise and amend, many aspects of the Bill, including the general plan. The Minister believes it is right and proper to discard that collective authority of the Seanad and the wisdom that may be contained within it. If the Seanad is entitled to agree the parameters of the plan, by virtue of amending and eventually voting on this Bill, it is entitled, on a regular basis, to be appraised of it and of its success or failure in order for it to initiate amendments to the Bill into the future. I do not believe it is at the behest, or within the remit, of the Minister to rid it of that authority because, as other speakers have said, the Seanad, as the second or the Upper House, has a role to play and that is provided for in the Constitution. It is very disappointing that the Minister can do this on a whim and in such a fashion so soon after the people disagreed with the Taoiseach who felt it necessary to rid us of the Seanad, irrespective of reforms that might have emanated from whatever parties within this House or outside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> I again ask the Minister to reconsider his decision and to allow for the Seanad, the same as this House, to be appraised, on a regular basis, of the successor or otherwise of this plan, as constituted by this Bill, in order for the Members of the Seanad, like us, to make recommendations for a new Bill or new amendments to address any deficiencies there may be.</p>

          <p eId="para_355"> Deputy Wallace raised what is a wider debate as regards the differentiation between Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas and what goes on between elections.

          <p eId="para_356"> I heard a few comments around hardwiring and transparency. I think Deputies are forgetting the role of the advisory council in regard to this. There is an annual transition statement as part of this process and that statement will be debated in the Dáil with respect to mitigation and adaptation. Every Member of the House will have the opportunity, through that process, to make his or her views on this issue known. However, ultimately, the differentiation here, which I have made very clear on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage, is that the Government, quite rightly, should be held accountable and it should be the approving authority in this and in many other areas. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference of opinion here. It has nothing to do with a democratic deficit but has to do with the fact that the Government should be the approving authority on this issue. We have the advisory council in place, which we will be discussing at a later point in this debate, and its role is quite important too.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I made a number of commitments on Second and Committee Stages to the effect that I would consider various proposals, amendments and options that were put forward by Deputies. As Deputies will note, there are examples of my doing so through amendments I have brought in, based on the earlier discussions we have had. I said on numerous occasions that this was a wider debate that needed to take on board many of the comments made on Second and Committee Stages and a number of the Deputies opposite were present during those debates. They will note from the amendments that have been put forward by me that I have, in many cases, done so.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">I move amendment No. 31:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_457">In page 6, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_458">“(a) this shall include agreed targets of reductions in CO2 emissions through 2050,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The Bill needs to set targets rather than aspirations. Otherwise there is no incentive to design a plan that will bring about any kind of meaningful reductions. Why were other amendments tabled by me and other Opposition Deputies that would incorporate and embody targets within the agreed timeframe not accepted? When discussing the need for this Bill and in its report on what it should contain, the all-party committee was clear in stating that the State needs to have targeted reductions in line with the international agreements to which it has signed up. The absence of such targets means the Bill lacks any real powers to ensure any meaningful steps are taken to address the issues involved in bringing about a reduction in CO2 emissions across the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Will the Minister accept this amendment? I deliberately put this amendment in at the start of this section to ensure the national mitigation plan would be put up in big lights and that there would be agreed targets on reductions in CO2 emissions right through to 2050. We need to deal with this problem on an incremental basis, each year and every five years, right through to 2050. Our children will be adults by then. They may have children of their own. Our grandchildren may be in communities and workplaces throughout the State and they will be the ones dealing with the catastrophe of a carbon cliff. The State will also be burdened with the need to purchase carbon credits, which are not cheap. Apart from the environmental damage, this will place a financial burden on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> I have heard people on the Government's side of the House criticising Fianna Fáil Governments and Governments of other hues for short-termism in the past. This is an opportunity to set out a plan for the next 30 years, which is a relatively short period of time. Any one of us who remembers the past 34 years will realise they have gone quickly; perhaps more quickly than we would have liked. I hope most of us will still be around in 34 years' time, but we must do what we can during that time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We must have long-term plans and we need to move away from short-termism. We have to move away from three, four, five and six-year cycles and look at things over periods of ten, 20 and 30 years. Will the Government agree the targets in the national mitigation plan and set them out for the next 34 years?</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> We have already lost a lot of time on this matter. I am not saying it is the fault of the Minister but time has been lost. I first raised this issue in 2011, if memory serves me well, during my first year in this House. Other Deputies have also raised it. People who were here before us wanted this to be in place in 2008 and 2009. We are playing catch-up. We do not have the benefit of a springboard that will propel us half way towards those targets. We have increased our greenhouse gas emissions and we are not and have not been doing enough to reduce them. We cannot keep playing catch-up. If there is further slippage over the next three, four or five years, we will reach a carbon cliff in six or seven years' time. We will need to meet this challenge by reducing dramatically our greenhouse gas emissions at that point. We will also have the cost, perhaps, of paying for carbon credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Will the Minister and his officials deal with this matter? Will he accept the long-term approach Sinn Féin is proposing? It is not a great vote catcher. It will not result in votes immediately, but many young people see the benefits of looking at things over a 20 or 30 year period, particularly in the area of climate change. We cannot afford to leave the planet worse than we got it. This is an opportunity for us to take a hands-on approach and it is an opportunity for the Minister to leave behind him that legacy he wants to leave.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">It is telling that some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition that were specific in terms of targets for CO2 emissions reductions were ruled out of order on the basis that they would be a charge on the Exchequer. I know it has nothing to do with the Minister, but I find that fact interesting, because that tells its own story. The Government does not want specific targets in the national mitigation plan because they will cost it money. We need to deal with runaway and irreversible climate change. It threatens the future of humanity. We will have rising sea levels, greater levels of flooding, more desertification and threats to food security. There is also the potential of those things already happening in the area of fuel. We have conflict, war, starvation, famine and mass migration. All of these serious things are already happening. If we reach the tipping point because we fail to take concrete, specific and decisive action on climate change, we are facing into a very dark future that is not too far away.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the harrowing accounts in today's newspapers of the incredible trauma that Mark and Emma Corcoran had to endure at the hands of seven criminals who travelled from Dublin to burgle the Corcoran family home in Tipperary. Their daughters spoke of how they thought their Daddy was going to die at the hands of these criminals. The criminals wore balaclavas and had handguns and knives. It was only due to Mrs. Corcoran ringing 999, as she was upstairs, that the gardaí in Monasterevin were in a position to apprehend the gang. There was also the case of John O'Donoghue in Doon, who collapsed and died when he came across intruders in his home.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> In the 12 months from June 2014 to June 2015, there were 28,830 burglaries in the country. That is an average of approximately 80 reported burglaries per day. It is a truly shocking figure. Furthermore, that is not the real figure. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has admitted that many of these crimes go unreported. Indeed, farmer David Thompson, aged 75, has been burgled three times in the past two years, but he has not reported the incidents. He said there is no point as there is no Garda presence. The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, has specifically linked the surge in crime to the human impact of the closure of a total of 139 Garda stations across the country, which saved only €0.5 million. Anybody who has a finger on the pulse of rural Ireland says that was the wrong decision. Tim O'Leary, chairman of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, countryside division, said his organisation is deeply concerned and says it is happening because of the absence of gardaí in localities. When the nearest Garda station is 30 miles away one will not get a response. John Comer of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, says rural people feel the neglect due to the lack of a Garda presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> There is real fear among people across the country, in both urban and rural areas. Due to the lack of a Garda presence it is particularly acute in rural areas, and all of the organisations involved tell us this. Will the Taoiseach accept that he got it wrong in terms of the closure of Garda stations across the country, that the strategy of removing presence in favour of mobility was wrong and that there are dire consequences as a result?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_211">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_477">I agree with Deputy Martin that these burglaries and attacks on ordinary people are deplorable, and I condemn them without reservation. I am glad that many of those involved, although not all of them to date, will be brought before the courts under the law. It is most unfortunate that a death occurred among the cases the Deputy mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> We live in a very different type of society. I and the Garda are aware that a small number of gangs are responsible for carrying out the majority of burglaries. It also appears that many of those who carry out these burglaries and vandalism, including beating up elderly women and so forth, are high as a result of substance abuse and create fearsome damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Garda stations were closed. This is an operational matter for the Garda. Having looked at the situation in so far as the closure of the Garda Training College in Templemore is concerned, where there were no gardaí coming through, that college has now been re-opened and 500 new Garda recruits are going through the college on an ongoing basis and coming into active service. There has been a change in the legislation for dealing with burglary which provides that consecutive sentencing can apply. These are important matters. A sum of €27 million has been allocated to the Garda for vehicles over the last number of years. In particular, finance has been made available for specialist vehicles to deal with high speed chases.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The valid point the Garda can make is that there are an extra 61,000 community hours because gardaí can now be in the community. That is important in respect of communications, intelligence and information. With regard to the capital programme announced yesterday, when the Government looked at the inferior, outdated and inadequate technological systems that the Garda has had to endure, it decided that must change and over €200 million has been allocated for that. One would like to think it could be done today, but obviously that is not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The observations and vigilance of communities are very strong. The community text alert is a valuable instrument for notifying Garda stations and gardaí of incidents, strangers or strange activity in a locality. Obviously, the situation is not as satisfactory as we would wish. In fairness, a number of the very old Garda stations that were in various communities, where gardaí were expected to stay for a couple of hours once or twice a week to sign unemployment forms, would not prevent any crime. However, Community Alert, community information, access, proper equipment, good vehicles and proper technology are essential for gardaí to be able to their job. That is where the Government's focus is. I have been speaking to chief superintendents in their districts and they say the freeing up of gardaí to do community work is an important aspect of the work they must do.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I regret that these burglaries occur and I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner can put a specific plan in place to deal with the gangs that are carrying out burglaries on a nightly basis in various parts of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">That is a very weak response. The Taoiseach is speaking like a commentator who is helpless to do anything about it. His recent interview in the <i>Irish Independent </i>was quite remarkable. In it he declared to the nation that he had been told recently by the Garda that travelling gangs are evading gardaí by driving at high speed and wearing night-vision goggles. The headlines blared that the Taoiseach has discovered that the criminals are wearing night-vision goggles. In addition, the Taoiseach said they could do ten burglaries at any time at any location they choose.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">The Taoiseach might acquire clear-vision goggles.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> This morning I spoke to a young working mother with two children. She works hard and her priority is putting her two kids through school and college. In 2009 one of her dreams came true when she bought an affordable home in Longboat Quay here in Dublin. Last night she learned to her horror that she may be evacuated from her home within a week. Not just her and her two children, but all of the 299 families that live in Longboat Quay may have to move out. Why is that? The reason is that their homes are firetraps. Built at the height of the boom by Bernard McNamara and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Longboat Quay has been plagued with problems for years. Remedial work carried out to date has cost the docklands authority €1.2 million. Owners have now been told they have to pay up to €18,000 each to make their homes safe, or they will have move out. The total cost of the required fire safety works is €4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> The woman I was speaking to and her neighbours paid anything between €250,000 and €600,000 for their homes but they were not built properly. They do not meet fire safety standards, yet the developer, the builders, the architects and the planning authority will not be penalised and it is the owners who are being asked to foot the bill. Bernard McNamara, meanwhile, having run up debts of €2 billion during the boom, is now, I understand, debt free and back in the property business.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">We recall the late Deputy Shane McEntee dealing with pyrite in houses that were built and then became unsuitable for those who paid big money for them. Now, we have a situation like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> As Deputy McDonald is well aware, under the legislation, planning permission is issued on certain conditions. Unfortunately, because of the over-enthusiasm that was being followed with regard to the whole building boom during the so-called Celtic tiger years, nobody policed the quality of the building that went into these houses and estates. I am quite sure that if the planning application and the conditions that applied to the structure of those houses had been implemented properly by a clerk of works or a project manager, this would not have happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">Given the rush to cut corners and the rush to make money, people now find, years afterwards, having paid very good money and having mortgaged themselves for that, the house they live in is a firetrap. This is grossly unacceptable and is not an easy situation to sort out. I would like to find out more about this, in discussion with the city council and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I cannot give a judgment at this stage. The point Deputy McDonald raises is of particular difficulty and I am sure great stress to the people who live in those houses. Unfortunately, it is not the first case. When Priory Hall was raised in this forum, I said I hoped it would be the only case, but clearly it is not and there may be others in the system as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">If the Taoiseach or I walk into a shop today and purchase something, and we subsequently discover that it is faulty, we can return that item, have it exchanged or get our money back. However, if, like the home owners in Longboat Quay, one buys a house that was not built properly, the responsibility for making the property good rests with the purchaser. That is essentially what has happened here and it is, as the Taoiseach correctly says, grossly unfair and unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> The Taoiseach has a responsibility to address this issue. These scenarios have played out before and I fear we will see many more such cases. However, the question that arises for this particular woman, who is from just one of the families affected, is "What happens next?" She has been asked, at short notice, to put her hands on €18,000. She does not have that money nor does she have the prospect of it. Failure to come up with it means that she, along with her young family, will be evacuated. That is the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">The Deputy mentioned the legislation that applies in the case of items purchased in a shop, which can be returned if faulty. Where a person decides to apply for planning permission to build a house or building and does not build it in accordance with the planning permission, the authority concerned is entitled to bring the builder to court to enforce compliance with the regulations. The problem in this country is due to a time when there was a rush to give planning permissions for buildings. I do not know the details of the planning of the buildings concerned but I am sure permission for them was given in good faith and that it was expected the construction would be carried out in accordance with the building conditions and regulations, which would mean they would not be fire hazards.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> We cannot allow a situation where when an inspection says these places are fire hazards, we expect people to live in them. The problem is that there was nobody to police the quality of the buildings that were constructed in those cases. Any good clerk of works would have said the building was not in accordance with the regulations, that he would bring the builder to court, make him knock the building down and rebuild it in accordance with the conditions.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">Does the Taoiseach agree there is no more pressing issue in this country than the housing crisis? Will he and the Government now come out with their hands up and declare it a national emergency? If he does not make that simple admission, the type of emergency measures we need will never be taken. There are homeless women and men in the Visitors Gallery today who have come in hope that the leader of this country may display a modicum of urgency about the homeless nightmare into which they and thousands like them have been plunged. Their children are traumatised with serious physical and psychological effects, travelling miles to school from far-flung hotels and hostels and are unable to get healthy food and so on. The Taoiseach shed a tear for the Magdalens. These are the Magdalens of this generation and in years to come, the Taoiseach will be held to account for his action on homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Let us confine ourselves to family homelessness. The families that are here today would never ordinarily be homeless. In any other decade, they would be in council or affordable housing, but that has been slashed in recent years. The Government keeps telling us that it is spending more on housing than anyone ever spent before. Last week it told the Dáil €4 billion was being invested. However, that €4 billion is to be spent over six years. We need €4 billion in one year to deal with the issue. Does the Taoiseach agree this does not sound like much of an investment for an emergency when we look at the figures? Some 20 council homes were completed in the first quarter of 2015 and some 117 completed by housing associations. If this level of building continues for the year, we will have less than 500 social homes this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">In 1975, the last housing emergency, some 8,794 local authority homes were built. Why, therefore, in the middle of a housing crisis did the Taoiseach see fit to reduce the social housing obligation on private developers, from 20% to 10%? Why, in the middle of a housing and homeless crisis, is he allowing NAMA to sell off hoards of property at a massive discount? Why is he allowing the biggest construction operation in the world not to come into play to provide social and affordable housing? Will he do so or will NAMA continue as a form of corporate welfare to nurse the dysfunctional developers, the people who crashed the economy in the first place, back into business? Will the Taoiseach order that the proceeds of NAMA sales from shopping centres, hotels and office blocks now be used for social and affordable housing?</p>

          <p eId="para_583">The Deputy has raised a number of issues. The remit of NAMA is to make and return a profit to the Irish taxpayer. While NAMA was expected to end its responsibilities by 2020, it may have finished its remit some time before that. As I said, that remit is to return a profit, where possible, for the Irish taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The Deputy said €4 billion is required now. As we meet here, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is meeting with all the chief executives of all the local authorities around the country. They have been given their money and given their targets and objectives and told to get on with the job.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">The Minister has already given an instruction that in regard to social housing, 50% of the allocation should go to homeless people. This year in Dublin, 765 units or apartments that have been neglected or closed up are being renovated and made fit for families and individuals. Dublin was given €37 million last year to deal with homelessness. By August of this year, €33 million of that had been spent. Why is this happening? It is happening because people are unable to pay their rent or they have moved out</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_645">There has been much talk about billions of euro and so on. My office was contacted last night by Respond housing association in order to highlight that on Monday last it announced the closure of its women's refuge in Tallaght at Christmas. There are nine families housed at that refuge right now. Respond has been funding the facility itself for three years at €350,000 per annum. It has now run out of funds and has appealed to various Government Departments. However, it has been informed that it will not obtain access to funding. The families at the refuge, some of which left extreme circumstances of distress and domestic violence, will become homeless. Under the provisions of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, I urge the Government to intervene. Something should be done. An episode such as this illustrates how out of touch all the rhetoric, verbiage and announcements are when, in reality, in places such as Tallaght, very good services are shutting down for the want of meagre funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> I note that in the programme for Government, under the criminal law reform section, the Government commits to enacting legislation by stating, "We will enact legislation to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in relation to forfeiting the proceeds of crime." Given the size and scale of the Project Eagle deal, is the Government absolutely satisfied that there is nothing to be concerned about regarding the allegations of misappropriation of funds, bribes, offshore accounts and pay-offs? Some of this is accepted. The £7 million in an offshore account is accepted in terms of what happened there. Deputy Wallace has raised other serious issues. I have been raising this since July in terms of the establishment of a commission of investigation as a result of the fact that this matter involves taxpayers' money. Is the Taoiseach certain there is nothing in the Project Eagle deal about which to be concerned? When can we expect the proposed legislation? I suggest that the Criminal Assets Bureau requires legislative enhancement and the Taoiseach says he is going to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">That was four years ago, admittedly. It is to be addressed in respect of two matters, the first of which concerns cross-jurisdictional issues in the North and Republic. This would apply to Project Eagle should the Criminal Assets Bureau be involved in that scenario. The second matter concerns paramilitary criminality in terms of fuel laundering and smuggling. The National Crime Agency and MI5 are getting involved in this. Why is there not a proposal by our Government for a joint approach between CAB and the National Crime Agency in terms of tackling what has occurred for years and what continues to occur? Up to £70 million has been lost through smuggling, fuel laundering and many other such activities.</p>

          <p eId="para_648">I can confirm to Deputy Martin that there is a great deal of information shared among the authorities in the Republic and Northern Ireland in regard to criminal activities, money trails and so on. I do not know all the details, obviously, because it is a very specialised business dealing with fuel laundering and other criminal activities. There have been quite a number of seizures of equipment and people brought before the law in respect of those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The Deputy is aware that there are two ongoing investigations in Northern Ireland, one by the police and the other by a parliamentary commission. In so far as NAMA is concerned, the Minister for Finance has answered questions on quite a number of occasions and has agreed that whatever information from this jurisdiction might be required in those investigations will be made available. NAMA itself has responded in considerable detail-----</p>

          <p eId="para_665">NAMA is not actually accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts. That is the Taoiseach's kick and that of his Government, particularly the Minister for Finance. Far from answering questions on NAMA generally and specifically on the controversy surrounding Project Eagle, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has studiously avoided addressing the issue. Therefore, I want to ask when he will make a full statement to the Dáil and explain why a corrupted bidding practice was allowed to continue, why he failed to inform the Executive in the North and why he was happy to allow a process to continue which, in the final analysis-----</p>

          <p eId="para_668"> Second, on the issue I raised with the Taoiseach earlier, I want him to point me to the legislation, or promised legislation, in the programme for Government in which he proposes to remedy the flaws in the law that have left families in fire traps and with big demands of cash made on them. There are no mandatory inspections before fire safety certificates are granted for buildings such as Longboat Quay. He should point me to the legislation in which he proposes to sort that out for people so we will not return to scenarios like this time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The Taoiseach will recall that in December 2014 a Sinn Féin motion on the recognition of the Palestinian State was passed by the Dáil unanimously on a cross-party basis. In light of the fact that today, after a ceremony in New York, the Palestinian flag will be raised for the first time at the UN buildings, when does the Taoiseach propose to move on that motion to give to the Palestinian State and its diplomatic representatives here in Dublin full recognition, full ambassadorial status and everything associated with it?</p>

          <p eId="para_671"> The Minister for Finance has been before the House and has answered questions on numerous occasions about the matter raised. Obviously, the company in question was dropped. Other interests were expressed and the process continued. As I stated, there are two ongoing investigations. They are not in this jurisdiction.

Clearly, it is a matter for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the receiver to the developer, the residents themselves and their management company, in addition to Dublin Fire Brigade, to resolve this collaboratively. I understand that all the authorities are trying to find a solution to this. In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments such as Longboat Quay where concerns are brought to light about non-compliance, particularly with fire regulations, the Minister has directed that a review be undertaken to develop a framework that will apply generally in future cases of this kind. That review will be undertaken by a steering group chaired by Mr. Martin Riordan, who was formerly manager of Cork County Council, and including representatives from Kildare County Council and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The steering group will be assisted by an independent fire safety expert.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">Yesterday, the Taoiseach said the Cabinet had approved the ordering of 150 modular homes on foot of a presentation made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Did he give any background details as to where they might be located, the costs associated with them or the fact that they may or may not have planning permission? NAMA sold 11,000 units in Dublin this year with planning permission. Is emergency legislation needed in order for construction to proceed at an earlier date than the normal procurement or planning process would take, namely, 18 months? This is just another example of the cobbled-together efforts the Government is making in order to make it appear as if it has some semblance over the situation, which it clear does not. Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate whether new legislation is required or whether the planning legislation needs to be amended for these units to be put in place a lot sooner than is normally the case. He announced 7,500 units for this year this year, of which only 493 are available.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I want to ask the Taoiseach about one other point he mentioned concerning the clerk of works scheme and the planning and development (No. 2) Bill. Why does he not just restore the clerk of works scheme? Many of us worked on sites when we were kids and found that the clerk of works system was brilliant, as Deputy Wallace has often said. Why does he not just restore it then? He will not restore it because of the liability to the State and it goes back to finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_742">It is the planning and development (No. 2) Bill, as well. My final point concerns the criminal justice (corruption) Bill. Before the end of the lifetime of this Dáil, would it be possible for us to have a discussion on the Garda investigations into criminality and irregularities that were discovered by the Flood, Mahon and Moriarty tribunals? I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, many times about that issue but she just keeps kicking it to touch. Will it happen in this Dáil at all?</p>

The criminal justice (corruption) Bill is due for publication this session, as is the planning and development (No. 2) Bill. The modular housing units are not meant to be a solution. There is a particularly urgent situation here that needs to be addressed. The modular units that are now available are very different from the ones to which the Deputy referred. These are warm, comfortable, well insulated and have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_746">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about three issues. The first concerns new wind energy guidelines. I have repeatedly asked when these guidelines will be published. I understand through leaked information that there is a disagreement between two of the Taoiseach's Cabinet colleagues about what new guidelines will be published. There is uncertainty out there and the general public needs to know what new robust guidelines will be produced and when we will have them.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> Second, I have repeatedly asked about a new tenant purchase scheme. Many people living in local authority houses wish to have the opportunity to purchase their own homes. There has been no scheme for those people for over 18 months. Councils use this money to reinvest in upgrading other houses, providing grants for people with disabilities and building houses. This has starved councils of much-needed revenue but it has also prevented families from purchasing their own homes. I have asked the Taoiseach about this matter, as well as submitting parliamentary questions to the relevant Minister as to when this scheme will be announced, but we are still no wiser.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Third, the vetting legislation has gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas and we are waiting for the Minister for Justice and Equality to sign the commencement order. When will that be signed? </p>

          <p eId="para_749">I will come back to Deputy Troy in respect of his third question. As regards the tenant purchase scheme, obviously the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government reviews this on a regular basis. It is an important point because once a person is allocated a local authority house and starts to pay rent, a proportion of that money is used as an opportunity to buy out the house in due course. It also provides some revenue, small though the amount may be, to local authorities.</p>

The liquidation of IBRC was done under very hurried legislation at night-time. I also wish to refer to the good work done by Deputy Wallace in regard to NAMA, the legislation relating to which was rushed through on 16 September 2009. These are two dark pools of malpractice. For example, fraud has been revealed with regard to interest rates charged, from the 1990s to date, in the case of IBRC.</p>

          <p eId="para_772"> The other issue is that the people of Ireland are losing about €3 billion as a result of what Deputy Wallace spoke about yesterday and last Thursday. The reason is because NAMA is a dark pool into which nobody can look and see how decisions are made. As a result, foreign funds mostly dollar-denominated as per the chairman, Frank Daly - 95% of them - buy cheap euro to buy cheap assets to make profits that go outside Ireland. In this context, €3 billion is twice the figure of €1.5 billion that the Taoiseach is talking about in the budget adjustments for this year</p>

        <heading>Referendum and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2015: First Stage<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T13:00:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_484">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_783">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_784">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the timely hearing of Referendum Petitions; to provide that appeals from decisions of the High Court in relation to such proceedings be referred directly to the Supreme Court; to provide for an automatic stay on any High Court order appealed to the Supreme Court; to provide that the Court of Appeal has no function in such proceedings and to provide for connected matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The Referendum and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2015 seeks to ensure that the implementation of constitutional change agreed by a majority voting in a referendum is not unnecessarily delayed. It is now a regular occurrence that the outcome of referendums is challenged in the courts. Our current legislation prescribes no specific time-frames within which such challenges should be heard and determined. The Bill published today seeks to ensure that court challenges to the outcome of a referendum are fast-tracked through the court system whilst also ensuring that in the interests of justice, adequate time is provided to hear and determine any such challenges. </p>
          <p eId="para_786"> A challenge to a referendum result under our current law is a two-stage process. First, a preliminary application is made to the High Court for leave to issue a petition challenging the result of a referendum and second, if leave is granted, the petition is then issued and, ultimately, a full trial or court hearing takes place. Until the enactment of the Court of Appeal Act 2014, any appeal taken against a decision of the High Court in respect of the preliminary application for leave to petition fell to be heard by the Supreme Court. By way of example, on 10 November 2012, a majority voted in favour of the children's rights amendment and that outcome was challenged. It was not until almost two and a half years later, on 28 April 2015, that the children's rights amendment was finally incorporated into our Constitution, the Supreme Court having dismissed the referendum challenge four days earlier. </p>
          <p eId="para_787"> More recently, after the marriage equality referendum, the High Court declined leave to petition to two persons challenging the validity of that referendum's outcome. Each appealed, first to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court. While the applications were ultimately dismissed by the Supreme Court, they highlighted that a court challenge to the outcome of a referendum could result in court hearings in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. This would substantially extend the length of time taken for the courts to finally determine such challenges. </p>
          <p eId="para_788"> It is in the public interest that there is a proper and proportionate balance between the rights of the people who vote at a referendum and the rights of an individual or individuals to challenge a referendum's outcome. It is also in the public interest that our courts facilitate applications taken to ensure the proper compliance with our laws in the holding of a referendum while also ensuring that the referendum outcome is not left in a legal limbo for an extended period of time. This is the objective of this Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_789"> The Bill prescribes that all future appeals from decisions of the High Court in referendum matters go straight to the Supreme Court and that the Court of Appeal play no role in such court proceedings. Where an application is made for leave to petition, it prescribes a three-day time frame within which an appeal can be filed in the Supreme Court against a decision of the High Court and that such appeal must be heard and determined within two weeks. Where leave to petition is granted, it prescribes that the High Court trial or hearing must take place within six weeks and that judgement must be delivered no later than two weeks later. A seven-day period is prescribed for the lodging of an appeal to the Supreme Court and such appeal must be heard within the following six weeks and judgement delivered no later than three weeks thereafter. </p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The Bill also addresses an additional difficulty highlighted by the Supreme Court in the recent proceedings relating to the marriage equality referendum. The Supreme Court noted that despite the appeals pending before it, as no stay had been granted on the order of the Court of Appeal, the referendum certificate had already been signed and the marriage equality amendment had already been incorporated into the Constitution. Had the Supreme Court disagreed with the decisions of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal and granted the applications to petition the High Court challenging the outcome of that referendum, an unprecedented constitutional difficulty could have arisen. To resolve this difficulty, the Bill prescribes that a stay will automatically apply to any order made by the High Court for the days during which an appeal can be lodged with the Supreme Court or, where such appeal is lodged, until it is determined by the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> The Bill proposes important changes to the Referendum Act 1994 and our Courts Acts. The timeframes prescribed by it are not set in stone. It is my hope that the principle of the Bill will be accepted by both the Government and Opposition Deputies and that a constructive public debate can now take place on what is proposed. </p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The decision of the people in a referendum is an important democratic act of political sovereignty. It is not tenable that, following the holding of a referendum in this State, for an extended period of time it can be uncertain as to whether or not a constitutional change favoured by a majority may become part of our fundamental laws, that court challenges to such outcomes can take two to three years and that individual citizens are denied the assistance or benefits that might affect their lives by agreed constitutional change coming into effect. Moreover, should the courts determine that, as a result of an illegality, a mistake or other irregularity, the result of a referendum as a whole has been materially affected and that, as a consequence, the referendum result should be annulled and a new referendum held, it is in the public interest that the conduct of any such new referendum is not unduly delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">If this Bill was enacted, we would avoid all of the difficulties that have been experienced to date in this area, including such unnecessary delays occurring.</p>

            <p eId="para_798">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. The issue of dirt bikes has plagued not just my community but communities across the country. People are now being seriously injured because of the reckless behaviour of some youths. During the summer I was contacted by residents of Rossmore Park in Ballyfermot, who expressed grave concerns in respect of the use of dirt bikes by youths in the area in terms of the noise that is generated and, most importantly, the risk to public safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_799"> I contacted the Garda locally to highlight the problem and Sergeant Gwen McKenna of the Ballyfermot Garda station provided a comprehensive response for which I am very grateful. I commend the report which was well laid out and emphasised the problems the Garda is experiencing. The report stated that the Garda is aware of the problems with dirt bikes locally but has real difficulty determining if a person is compliant with road traffic legislation. A licence is required where the motorcycle engine capacity exceeds 49 cc. However, a garda cannot determine the engine capacity without physically stopping the youths, which is nearly impossible in many cases. A number of months ago in Ballyfermot a member of An Garda Síochána was seriously assaulted when trying to seize dirt bikes. This has become a serious issue in the area and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I understand the legal requirement to hold a licence only applies to public places as defined in the Road Traffic Act. However, dirt bikes are mainly used on waste ground, in fields, and, in recent months, on walkways near the canal, which are not defined as public places and, therefore, the legislation does not apply. The sad reality is that many youths on dirt bikes completely ignore the law and have no regard for local gardaí, regardless of whether they are in a public place or anywhere else.</p>
            <p eId="para_800"> Gardaí cannot access places because the vehicles are made to drive over rough terrain, which makes it difficult for officers to follow them. It makes their job twice as hard when they are pursuing three or four of them fleeing the scene at the same time. Gardaí have told me that some of the users are as young as eight and have no understanding of the rules of the road. When gardaí call to their parents, it can be quite difficult to get any response regarding their children's use of these dirt bikes.</p>
            <p eId="para_801"> Gardaí regularly visit local schools to explain the dangers of dirt bikes and to talk about road safety but, unfortunately, their advice often falls on deaf ears. Each year we provide money for youth projects, community development, youth clubs, GAA clubs and football clubs, and yet many of the youths who are involved in riding dirt bikes do not attend any of these projects or are not interested in confining themselves to being involved in these clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> The Garda is doing what it can but its hands are tied because of the limit of legislation governing dirt bikes. That is why I am asking the Minister to consider amending the road traffic legislation to see what might be done to address the problem before somebody is seriously hurt.</p>
            <p eId="para_803"> Last week I witnessed an incident near Blackhorse Bridge in Inchicore where two elderly people were walking home from getting their messages and were nearly knocked over by a youth on a dirt bike entering through the exit to their senior citizen complex. This is a very serious issue and it needs to be addressed. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_804">I thank Deputy Catherine Byrne for raising what I know is an important matter in her constituency. My area of responsibility relates to the legislation concerning the use of motor vehicles in public places. This includes the use of dirt bikes or scrambler bikes in public areas. Enforcement of the relevant legislation, including addressing any illegal use of a mechanically propelled vehicle, is a matter for An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_805"> The use of vehicles is subject to the relevant requirements of road traffic legislation. The Road Traffic Act definition of a “public place” includes any street, road or other place to which the public has access with vehicles, whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge. Based on the definition of a "public place" and a "mechanically propelled vehicle" in road traffic legislation, the Garda is satisfied that it has the necessary powers to deal with the misuse of such vehicles in public places. These powers allow the Garda to stop such vehicles in a public place and demand production of a licence or learner permit. In specific response to a point the Deputy made regarding whether the Garda has the legal ability to stop a vehicle, the view of my Department is that the current road traffic legislation gives it the power to stop such vehicles in a public place and request production of a permit or licence. I accept that having the legal ability to stop a vehicle does not get around the practical difficulty of trying to stop a person who is riding illegally and dangerously in a public place. The Deputy made the specific point on the law in the area and I wanted to confirm that to her.</p>
            <p eId="para_806"> The Deputy correctly pointed out that if the engine capacity of the motor bike is below 50 cc, the minimum age to hold a driving licence is 16 years. If it is above 50 cc, then the minimum age is 17 years. In addition, the Garda may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation. Road traffic law makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, to drive carelessly or to drive dangerously. The Garda has informed me that any of these charges could be brought, where appropriate, in circumstances of misuse. In certain circumstances where the misuse of these vehicles involves criminal damage, a prosecution can also be brought under the Criminal Damage Act, if appropriate. The Garda also has powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and the regulations made under that section, SI 460 of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">It appears to me, but I am happy to clarify the matter further for Deputy Byrne, that the powers do exist to deal with the matter that she has raised. I am not sure at this point if any further change to the law is required, although I would be happy to hear the Deputy's input in the matter. Based on my Department's consideration of the matter and the engagement we have had with the Garda Síochána, the law in regard to licensing, ability to stop and if need be, to remove a vehicle, does appear to be in place, but I do accept there are challenging matters in terms of the enforcement of the law given the behaviour to which the Deputy referred.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">I understand that legislation exists, as was stated in the Garda report, but some of the areas in which dirt bikes are used do not come under the category of roads, streets or parks. They include laneways leading up to people's houses and in the vicinity of senior citizens. Another area where the bikes are used are rough walkways along canals used by people for fishing. They are not designated pathways and that is where the difficulty lies. Access to such areas can be difficult for Garda Síochána vehicles and therefore the gardaí cannot pursue those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> There has been a significant increase in my area in the number of young people who own such bikes and, unfortunately, the children who use them are getting younger. I am concerned that a young person using such dirt bikes will be killed. The bikes are now used by children as young as eight, ten and 12 years. When a garda from Ballyfermot tried to stop some youths recently he was seriously injured. That type of behaviour is part of the problem as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_810"> I accept what the Minister said about his brief and that the issue also comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I intend to raise the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality also as serious incidents are occurring. I fear that the matter will only be further highlighted in the event of a young person on a dirt bike being seriously injured or an elderly person being knocked down and seriously injured. I respect what the Minister said in his reply, but we need to introduce further measures to curtail the use of dirt bikes, whether through his Department or the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

            <p eId="para_811">Much of the legislation to deal with this matter does come under the remit of the road traffic area, which is the responsibility of my Department. One matter which the Deputy has raised and on which I will check up and ask that a response would be provided to her relates to the definition of a public place. She gave the example of laneways. From my constituency work I am aware that frequently it can be difficult to define whether a laneway is private property or who owns it. It is my understanding that based on the definition of a public place in the context of road traffic law, the issue raised by the Deputy would be addressed, given that a public place is defined as an area to which the public has access, as opposed to a more traditional definition of an area owned by the public. The issue relates to access. I will ask for clarification on the matter and I will provide the information to the Deputy, which she might wish to share with the local Garda or others in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_812"> I accept the point made by Deputy Byrne. I can see in the part of the city I represent that there are more such vehicles around and that they present a considerable threat to people when used in an illegal manner. While I am satisfied that the legislation governing the area is adequate, I am also aware that it is very difficult to enforce the law if someone is driving illegally on a vehicle in a public park in which children or families are present. I will revert to the Deputy on a definition of a public place as that falls within my area of responsibility and if I can be of any further help to the Deputy, I will be.</p>

            <p eId="para_813">When Waterford's 147 km coastline was excluded from the Wild Atlantic Way initiative I then sought assurances from the Department that my constituency was not being left behind in what we all know is a highly competitive tourism market. In reply to a Priority Question last April, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Michael Ring, told me that the Ancient East tourism proposition, which is built on an abundance of culture and heritage assets in the south east and midlands, would have a positive impact on overseas tourism in Waterford. At the time the Minister of State highlighted places such as the historic round tower in Ardmore, Ghaeltacht na Rinne, and the unique mining story of the Copper Coast, which is a superb and wonderful geopark, as assets that could be promoted under the Ancient East initiative. The Minister of State said that the Ancient East project could be a game-changer for Waterford. They were his exact words to me in the Dáil at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> The question we are asking in Waterford now is why it is one of the only counties involved in the Ancient East initiative that has not received specific funding in the first phase of the initiative, which totals approximately €1.8 million. Many of us feel that this is a snub to the city and county, in particular to the many people who make their living in the Waterford city and county tourism sector. Many of those people have been most patient after we were short-changed in the Wild Atlantic Way initiative. We were told that we would be looked after under the Ancient East initiative. In the debate on the Wild Atlantic Way, the Minister of State resorted to shouting and screaming like a hyena. That was recorded on local radio in Waterford so the exclusion of Waterford from the Wild Atlantic Way initiative did not do the Government or the Minister of State any good.</p>
            <p eId="para_815"> I understand that only the first phase of the investment has been made. Could the Minister provide a commitment that submissions from Waterford will receive funding in the second phase? Could he also indicate when the funding will be made available? For instance, will the Metal Man project in Tramore be considered under the second phase?</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> At the time, the Minister of State told me that the Wild Atlantic Way was born out of a need to address the dramatic decline in international visitors to Ireland, in particular in the west. However, I pointed out that Bord Fáilte’s figures show a drop in visitor numbers to the south-east region from 1.1 million in 2000 to fewer than 685,000 in 2010. That was one of the most dramatic drops in any region in the State. Accordingly, the Minister can understand why very many businesses and people in the tourism industry in Waterford are aghast that we were completely excluded from the Wild Atlantic Way and that funding was not made available to Waterford for the Ancient East initiative. In addition, the funding might not even be made available until the second tranche, which might only be made available next year. We do not know what Government will be in power then.</p>

            <p eId="para_817">I spent a day in Waterford just before the summer when I had an opportunity to meet many of the people involved in tourism in Deputy Halligan’s county. In fairness to the Deputy, although I was aware of it, I acknowledge that I heard from them about their dissatisfaction and annoyance at Waterford not being able to participate in the Wild Atlantic Way initiative. Deputy Halligan is correct to say that the Ancient East is a new plan that is designed to make the most of all of the assets a county such as Waterford has to offer. From tourism promotion work I have done with Tourism Ireland, I am certain there is a huge appetite for the development and launch of a heritage and arts-based tourism campaign that will attract a new kind of tourist to this country who is not currently coming in the numbers we need.</p>
            <p eId="para_818"> I am aware of the challenge to which Deputy Halligan referred in his region. From my recollection of the figures on the number of people who visit the Deputy's county, the share of the revenue of all the money that is generated in tourism in the country that goes to the county is considerably below what would be warranted by the number of visitors to the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">One of the reasons for that is the low number of bed nights in the county and in adjoining counties as compared to other parts of the country. The Wild Atlantic Way has sought to address that in one part of the country, while Ireland's Ancient East is seeking to address it in another.</p>
            <p eId="para_820"> On the specific point the Deputy made on access to capital, the Viking triangle in Waterford City, which I had the opportunity to visit, received €10.5 million in capital funding alone from Fáilte Ireland. This appears to be very well invested in the centre of the city and I was extremely impressed by what I saw. In total, Waterford has now received just under €13 million in capital investment from Fáilte Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> The Deputy's final point related to the consideration of applications from Waterford. I have discussed this matter with Fáilte Ireland and I learned that no application from the county was successful in gaining funding. As the Deputy will appreciate, I do not play a role in evaluating individual applications but I assure him that Fáilte Ireland is working with interests in the county to look at how applications can be strengthened so that they might be in a position to access funding in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_822">Am I to take it that the Minister cannot give a commitment that we will obtain money for Ireland's Ancient East in the next tranche of funding? Some €10 million in State funding was given to the Viking triangle, which lies on the Ancient East trail. It is interesting that a couple of weeks later the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, suggested the capital would be invested in Youghal rather than in Waterford, which was an astounding statement for him to make. I think the Minister of State is out of touch with what is happening in Waterford at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_823"> The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, referred to tourism figures. The objective of the Wild Atlantic Way was to carry out an assessment of where tourism figures were dropping and where initiatives could be put in place, with the necessary finance, to attract tourism. Ultimately, it is about attracting tourism and one of the ways to do that is to boost tourism initiatives in the area, which means the provision of finance. The visitor numbers, as the Minister will see, have dropped substantially from 1.1 million to fewer that 700,000 in a few years. This is why it was of paramount importance for us to obtain funding for the Wild Atlantic Way. That has not happened and now we are not going to receive any of the €1.8 million, or at least we will not do so now, and the Minister cannot definitively indicate whether in the near future - namely, January, February or next week - we will receive it. This will further undermine job prospects in Waterford, which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has acknowledged was one of the worst-hit areas in the past six years and where, a few weeks ago, he said there was a need to invest in tourism and to create jobs in the sector. One Minister is saying one thing and another tells us there is no money to invest in order that we can have substantive tourism and sustainable jobs in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_824">Deputy Halligan has a better appreciation of what work is under way in his county than I do but I visited Waterford and saw the work taking place in Tramore in the context of the development of surfing facilities to attract tourists who want outdoor holidays. I was hugely impressed by that. I saw the work the local authority is doing, with Government support, to develop the Deise greenway in Waterford and that was also hugely impressive. Regardless of whether the €10.5 million in funding came under the heading of Ireland's Ancient East - which it did not because it happened earlier in our term of office - €10.5 million is still €10.5 million. It is a very significant investment by Fáilte Ireland in the Deputy's city and it is money well spent because it will support the development of tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_825"> In answer to the specific question on whether I could guarantee funding the answer is that I cannot. Fáilte Ireland made the decision. However, I am aware of the need for Waterford city and county to participate in Ireland's Ancient East and Fáilte Ireland is working to see how it can support businesses which put in applications which were unsuccessful on this occasion.</p>

            <p eId="para_826">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter. As the Minister of State will be aware, yesterday was World Heart Day and it was fitting that in Brussels the heart failure policy network launched a policy toolkit to tackle heart failure. The aim of the heart failure policy network is to create a lasting network of politicians working with other stakeholders to lead significant policy changes to improve the lives of people with heart failure in Europe. Ireland has two representatives on the network, myself and Niall Johnson, the chief executive of Croí, the west of Ireland cardiac foundation, an organisation which undertakes excellent work in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> The Minister of State will already know that heart failure is a chronic condition that often requires inpatient hospital treatment. It occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's need for oxygen and important nutrients. The condition affects at least 15 million adults across Europe and one in five people is at risk of developing the condition. In Ireland, over 90,000 individuals live with the condition, which is responsible for between 600 and 700 deaths annually. Most important is the increasing prevalence of the condition, with thousands of new diagnoses each year. In fact, heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalisation among those over 65 throughout Europe and accounts for 5% of all acute hospital admissions. Unsurprisingly, this is a condition which has a huge negative impact on people's lives and on quality of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> For too long heart failure has been the forgotten condition in health policies, despite the economic impact on health care and the terrible burden caused by people with the condition. However, we can change this and the policy toolkit provides ten priority actions backed up by clinical evidence and the views and experiences of patients and it sets out the economic case for change. We need to make heart failure a national health priority. We can do this by establishing a national strategy, increasing public and clinician awareness of the condition and investing in reliable data to support policy decisions. We also need to ensure timely diagnosis, which can be achieved by providing specific training for medical staff. We need to introduce multidisciplinary person-centred care which would include treatment plans that were consistent and available nationally, dedicated follow-up care with specific points of contact for patients and outpatient care to help avoid further hospital admissions. All patients with heart failure should be offered a personalised long-term care plan to help them manage their condition and we need to expand primary care to include medical staff trained in heart failure in order to facilitate care for people in their communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> I welcome the work that has already been undertaken with the heart failure programme. The objectives and aims of that programme readily complement the heart failure networks and the programme is certainly going in the right direction. However, the most recent update of the programme was in 2012 and while some hospitals were taking part, they are mainly located on the east coast. I firmly believe that, with a renewed effort, we can successfully meet the challenges posed by heart failure. I attended the launch of the policy toolkit in Brussels yesterday and a wide variety of politicians and clinicians from across Europe were present. This is not an issue that is peculiar to Ireland but is common throughout European and the condition impacts upon some 15 million people. Patients from Italy and France who had suffered heart attacks and heart failure and who were not given any follow-up or long-term personalised care plans spoke about their conditions. There is a great need to develop the toolkit strategy and we have a marvellous opportunity to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He is correct about everything he said. It is not just an Irish problem, but, indeed, an international problem. Europe does well when member states do things together. World Heart Day was founded in 2000 to inform people about heart disease and its prevention. This year the theme is creating heart healthy environments. The day is intended to spread awareness that premature deaths from cardiovascular disease can be avoided if the risk factors, including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol, can be controlled. I am sure the Deputy heard all about this yesterday. Healthy Ireland provides a framework that supports heart healthy environments. It includes strategies on tobacco and alcohol. The Department is currently revising its healthy eating guidelines and is developing an obesity policy and action plan, which will be finalised this year. The Department's Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019 was launched in 2010. Subsequent to that, the HSE established three key clinical programmes for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and stroke.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> Significant improvements have been made with regard to access to acute treatments for coronary heart disease and heart failure as well as the development of stroke units across the country. Heart failure, HF, is one of the major chronic diseases in Ireland today and is one of the commonest reasons, as the Deputy pointed out, for hospital admission in the elderly, often requiring a prolonged stay. It is recognised that integrated management programmes for heart failure, encompassing primary care and hospital services, can produce significant reductions in the need for hospitalisation and achieve better quality of life and outcomes for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> The HSE's national clinical programme for heart failure aims to reorganise the way heart failure patients are managed. Recent developments include structured services of acute heart failure. Such services have been established in 11 hospitals as national heart failure units. These sites have introduced a structured specialist hospital service for patients presenting with acute heart failure, including post-discharge follow up. They deliver an integrated service through the model of care developed by the national clinical programme for heart failure, which follows international best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> A new diagnostic clinic in the Gorey-Wexford-St.Vincent’s University Hospital Group provides direct access for general practitioners to specialist blood tests and echocardiography in the community with remote specialist advice on echocardiography results and specialist review of patients in the community when required. This improves access for patients to diagnostics and specialist advice. A heart failure integrated care demonstration project in the Carlow-Kilkenny region is planned to commence shortly. It will demonstrate integration between primary care, secondary care and the hospital group. This uses existing e-health technology and will strengthen patient self-care with enhanced nursing supports and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_834"> Co-ordinated care between primary and secondary care will provide rapid access to specialist opinion and will support identification of heart failure patients in GP practice. It will also provide specialist day care advice to general practice for rapid but non-urgent cases. Appropriate use of specialist advice and avoiding need for hospital and outpatient attendance has been a key target of this programme. Recognising that giving GPs access to senior specialist advice in a structured and timely manner will avert the need for OPD and emergency department referral led to the development of a consultation service where GPs, practice nurses and specialist staff interact using web conference technology to discuss and manage cases collaboratively. This also allows simultaneous education for the health care professionals as they discuss relevant cases. I will deal with the Deputy's other questions in my supplementary reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_835">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I welcome the contents, particularly in the context of the national clinical programme for heart failure. The health failure policy toolkit can have a role in this. It has been rolled out across Europe and there should be liaison on this. I intend to follow up with the Department on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> As the Minister of State has acknowledged many times, there is constant negativity around our health services and the negativity is so pervasive and persistent that it often overshadows and ignores the thousands of positive outcomes every day in every hospital and primary care unit. The negativity is bound to affect staff morale, etc. but it cannot be used to detract from the task before us. Ensuring the health service is efficient and provides timely, effective treatment is a mammoth task. I acknowledge the Department's role and the demands it faces regarding all illnesses and conditions. It is difficult to decide on how to allocate resources, particularly when there is constant strain on the national resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> Under the national cancer strategy introduced by a previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in 1996 and its successor, which was published in 2006, cancer services have been transformed and, therefore, I hope a unified approach to heart failure can be adopted throughout the country and across Europe, which takes on board best practice and the best models. The health failure policy toolkit can work and there should be credit where credit is due. The strategy on cancer care under the former Minister, Mary Harney, has worked in many ways and has contributed to improved outcomes. Ultimately, the improvements in cancer outcomes have proven beyond doubt the positive benefits of the development and use of clear national strategies. I hope this can be done for heart failure. I urge the Minister of State to take on board the contents of the policy toolkit and development strategy for tackling this condition in conjunction with that has been planned and rolled out. As our population ages, this condition will become more prevalent and it will cause more serious issues, including financial problems, which will land on the desks of the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">I thank the Deputy for raising this significant issue. Three of the 11 hospitals involved are outside the greater Dublin region - Wexford, Cavan and Sligo. I agree with him there should be services in every significant area of population. I constantly say that the solution to overcrowded hospitals is within primary care and this is where this programme needs to go. This morning, we launched the diabetes in primary care programme, which will be delivered throughout the country in a primary care setting. It is about the management of a chronic disease and this is where the heart failure programme needs to go as well. That is where it is heading and we will increasingly provide for the management of chronic conditions in the primary care sector, of which HF will be one. I do not believe in the doomsday scenario, nor does the Deputy, but one must make one's case. If Healthy Ireland has an impact on how we live our lives and ensures we do not end up with heart failure because of alcohol abuse, tobacco use or inactivity, the future will be much brighter. However, a significant cohort will always end up with HF and we need to ensure they are managed in their communities where they feel most comfortable and where they are best known. The acute hospital should be a last resort.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">What have the HSE and the Government against HSE-employed home helps? There is no doubt that there has been an assault on the hours available to home helps across the country over the past number of years. A total of 1.4 million fewer hours are available now compared to 2010. From a policy point of view, it does not make sense to curtail the number of home help hours available to families that are under huge pressure and stress trying to care for a loved one at home. Home helps are an integral part of the delivery of health care, as patients transfer from an acute hospital setting to a home care setting. However, people are scrounging on a daily basis to access additional hours. They contact local public representatives, including Deputies, to beg and plead for more hours. The number of hours available is not sufficient to cater for the demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_840"> There is a key problem regarding HSE-employed home helps who are being blackguarded to a certain extent. People who have a contract for X hours cannot secure additional hours. I cannot understand the preference for private companies that provide home help hours. When one does the sums, it does not make economic sense to be preferential towards private companies. It must be acknowledged that HSE-employed home helps have provided a critical, integral service in our communities for many years but the notion that they must work a set number of hours and cannot access additional hours is distasteful.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would revisit that policy, which seems to be ingrained on the part of HSE management, to reduce, on a continual basis, HSE employed home helps and preference private companies. If there was a logical or an economic reason for doing that, one could understand it but, by any stretch of the imagination or assessment, there is no benefit gained from operating in this way. I ask the Minister of State to revisit that issue in the broader context.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> There are instances where people are being provided with a half and hour of home help care. What can a person do in half an hour? There is a need for the Minister of State to fundamentally review the number of hours of home help care available across the country. Taking account of the regions, there has been an appalling assault on the hours available. Some 1.4 million fewer home help hours are being provided than was the case in 2010. We have an ageing population; the demographic curve is in that direction. The stated policy is to transfer people from an acute hospital setting to a home-care setting, yet Government policy in this area leads to the opposite being the case. One of the main reasons we have overcrowded emergency departments - and bedlam and chaos in them on a continual basis - is that we cannot transfer people from an acute hospital setting back to a community-based or home-care setting. An integral element in ensuring that people can remain at home is their level of access to home help care.</p>
            <p eId="para_843"> In the context of the budget, I urge the Minister of State to not only review the number of home help hours available nationally but also to ensure that home helps employed by the HSE are treated fairly and with dignity and that they are not be continually blackguarded in terms of their hours being consistently reduced and priority and preference being given to private companies. It does not appear that the Minister of State can inform me as to why that is the practice, whether there is a rationale for it or whether a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out. I have been contacted by home helps whose hours have been significantly reduced from 40 to 15. Their basic original contract was for 15 hours, yet they had been working many hours in excess of that for the past number of years. However, when it came to the renewal of their home help hours or providing care for a new client, those hours have been given to private companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">I am aware of the time constraints and the fact that the clock is ticking. The question the Deputy put down relates to the need for the Minister for Health to improve working conditions for home helps. The Deputy has moved into the broader region and I may be able to deal with that issue in a response to a supplementary question.</p>
            <p eId="para_845"> I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. While there will always be a need for long-term residential care for the older people in our society, it is important that those who wish to stay in their own homes and communities are supported and facilitated to do this and for as long as possible. It is also important that we support the return of those who have required acute hospital care to their homes. </p>
            <p eId="para_846"> In 2015, the HSE will spend €330 million on home care packages and home help services including €185 million to provide 10.3 million home help hours. These services are provided in two ways, either directly by the HSE or by private or voluntary organisations funded by the HSE. Home help services are provided mainly by staff directly employed by the HSE. However, in the greater Dublin area, Wicklow and Clare, home help services are provided by voluntary providers on behalf of the executive. The terms and conditions of home helps have been the subject of detailed consideration. A home help contract introduced for HSE employees in 2014 followed on from a lengthy consultative process on a range of issues that commenced in 2012. The discussions took place between the HSE and the unions under the auspices of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. The annualised contract which emanated and was accepted is fundamental to both parties as it matches the actual workforce to the changing needs of the service. It also gives certainty to employees by way of guaranteed weekly minimum paid weekly minimum paid hours. Voluntary providers are funded under section 39 of the Health Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> The HSE has in place service level agreements with these providers which set out the level of home help service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation and which contain requirements in respect of standards of care. As the home helps employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, the HSE does not determine the salaries or other terms and conditions to apply to these staff, including pension arrangements. Accordingly, the arrangements offered by individual providers will vary. The pay and superannuation terms and conditions of the staff concerned are not subject to the control of the Department of Health and they are not classified as public servants. The granting of any pension entitlement in such circumstances is a complex matter. Access for home helps in voluntary organisations to a pension has been the subject of a number of Labour Court recommendations involving SIPTU, IMPACT and the HSE. Implementation of a Labour Court recommendation on payment of a gratuity to the home helps employed by the section 39 organisations has been hindered in recent years by the budgetary situation and is further complicated by the fact that the HSE is not the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_848"> I am pleased to confirm that the issue was discussed during the recent Lansdowne Road talks and that the parties reached agreement on a process for giving formal consideration to the matter. The parties agreed to establish, in the short term, a working group to examine a number of issues, including gratuity payments for home helps. This process will now be progressed following the recent ratification of the Lansdowne Road agreement. As Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, I am committed to providing the necessary supports and assistance to allow our growing elderly population to remain in their homes and to provide good working conditions for those who can facilitate this.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_849">I am aware that there were long, protracted discussions and negotiations in the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission in the context of trying to find an agreed basis for contracts for HSE-employed home helps. A home help who had X number of hours calculated on a base year - and I understand the number was roughly 80% of that - would have a set minimum contract but they would often have been given additional hours. The difficulty is that their hours in excess of the minimum contract are being pared back and given to private companies. As a result, there is a preference in the allocation of hours over and above those in the minimum contract which the HSE is obliged to honour. In case after case, home helps employed by the HSE are only being given the minimum contract hours. The contract refers to minimum weekly paid hours. There is no necessity for the HSE to deny them extra hours. Home helps across the country are still receiving the base minimum contract number of hours but they have been working extra hours in recent years. When the time comes to review their hours, those in excess of what is stated in the minimum contract are being given to private companies and the home helps hours are being reduced to the minimum. In this way, the HSE is meeting its basic obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> Why is there an obsession among HSE management, and as is evident in policy, to deny HSE-employed home helps extra hours when additional hours are being allocated to an individual? That seems to be the case. I have spoken to many home helps - I spoke to two of them before I came to the Chamber - and they have confirmed that is the case. They are now receiving the minimum number of hours when they would have been allocated many more hours up to now. There is a change in policy and the HSE is only meeting its obligations in terms of the minimum contract for these employees but it should not give preference to the voluntary organisations or private companies ahead of the HSE employees.</p>

            <p eId="para_851">The Deputy will be aware that when the State is the significant supplier of any service, it is necessary, under European rules, to put an element of the contract out to tender. It was not this Government which negotiated that, it was negotiated by a previous Administration. That to which I refer is what needs to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_852"> The home help service funding of approximately €185 million will provide for 10.3 million home help hours in 2015, the same level of service and funding that was provided for in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we also have the home care packages. We do not have an obsession - neither does the HSE - with private companies. I understand that when people wish to remain in their own homes, this is the best possible option for them. I understand that perfectly. It is an option that we would all choose for ourselves. I reiterate that there is not an obsession.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">The difficulty is that, with the collapse of the economy, we had to ensure that not only did we get the best possible value - home helps are extraordinarily good value for the job they do - but we also had to ensure resources were spread as evenly as possible. It will certainly have to be kept under review because at the other end, we are putting people into long-stay residential care at a stage when, albeit in the minority of cases, they do not want to be in it and it is the more expensive option. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which we will keep under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">This amendment relates to the key question of targets so that we can chart whether we are making concrete and tangible progress towards reducing CO2 emissions or whether our mitigation plans for reducing emissions are just aspirational general policy objectives and not really measurable in terms of real improvements and reductions. This goes to the heart of the matter we debated on Committee Stage and are debating again now, namely, the Government’s resistance to the introduction of specific measurable targets which could establish whether we are making real progress over the plan’s period.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> As I said before the sos, although it was not the Government’s decision, it is an interesting coincidence that some of the more specific amendments relating to targets were ruled out of order on the grounds they would be a charge on the Exchequer. This really gets to the heart of the matter because we are going to have to put money into meeting targets and dealing with climate change. This is why the Government does not want to commit to these targets and why it did not want the afforestation targets I proposed in the forestry Bill. Generally, the Government does not like targets because they are measurable and specific. It likes very general targets that can be pushed way out into the future so it cannot be held accountable as to whether tangible progress has been made towards meeting general aspirational targets, and as we know with so many of the Government’s aspirational targets announced a few years out. For example, in response to one of the topical issues of the moment, the Government said it was going to get rid of homelessness by 2016. Here we are approaching 2016 but we are going in the opposite direction in dealing with the problem. It sounded very good when it was initially proposed. That is the problem with general far-out targets. They sound good now but often will not materialise unless there is a clear tangible roadmap towards the achievement of those targets and where we can measure our progress on a yearly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> That is why many of us on this side of the House are pushing for more specific binding targets. It is telling that the Government is resisting these amendments and proposals. Members on this side are merely acting as conduits for those environmental groups campaigning on the whole area of climate change. Those groups are adamant that we must have these types of targets. If we do not, then we are not serious about dealing with climate change. Given its response to those calls for specific targets, it is clear the Government is not serious and this is just window-dressing, as is so often the case with legislation it puts through to deal with matters of critical importance.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">This amendment calls for the inclusion of targets up to 2050. This is a very similar amendment to those on which we spoke last night. Establishing domestic mitigation targets divorced from EU processes is not wise because Ireland is already subject to legally binding greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to 2020. Negotiations are ongoing at EU level to agree mitigation targets for all member states up to 2030 and the process of target-setting is likely to continue up to 2050. Accordingly, putting in place our own statutory mitigation targets would likely cut across and interfere with the EU target-setting process. Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">The Minister of State is concerned we might cut across the EU process which is likely to set targets up to 2030. The whole point of the amendment, however, is that we set out our own targets. We have to take responsibility to put our own house in order. We have neglected this issue for the past several years and now, not just the Government but every citizen must play catch-up on climate change. We should not sit back and wait for Big Brother to tell us when to move with the centre line. This issue is vitally important to the future economic as well as environmental and social well-being of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> It is important we accept this modest proposal to include agreed targets of reductions in CO2 emissions through 2050. I cannot figure out for the life of me why the Government is against a 30-year plan in this regard. The Minister of State may recall that the Dáil sat into the early hours of the morning - the sun was shining when we left Leinster House - when we planned beyond 2050 and crystallised the promissory note into a sovereign bond. We planned then beyond 2050 when we nailed the debt to the backs of our children with a simple IOU note.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> This amendment gives us an opportunity to act positively in dealing with our environmental responsibilities, reduce our carbon emissions and put forward the country’s clean air levels. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government made an announcement on the latter on Monday concerning clean air. This amendment gives another chance to add to that positive development, highlighting Ireland takes its environmental responsibilities seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> We are trying to sell Irish food abroad. Somewhere along the line, we have to improve, and be seen to improve, food quality, not just the food we are consuming here but what we are exporting to world markets. There is much talk about opening up markets in China and, particularly, the high-end market in America. We have to be seen to be green and clean. Our food needs to be seen as safe.

          <p eId="para_987">I move amendment No. 33:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_988">In page 6, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_989">“(c) specify the projected level of emissions once the policy measures outlined are agreed,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">This proposal is an important change. Basically, it provides that the national mitigation plan would specify the projected levels of emissions once the policy measures outlined are agreed. The mitigation plan could be a Walter Mitty plan, in that it could be vague and aspirational but not mean a great deal. We are proposing that we should specify clearly the projected levels of emissions once the policy measures outlined have been agreed. It is the logical thing to do. It is a plan, but it is similar to saying that one has a road map but one is not sure which road one will take. One is putting in many options, yet one is setting out on the journey. Once we have agreed the policy measures we should then outline the projected levels of emissions based on our national and international obligations. It is a logical step forward and it is important that we do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">I will speak on amendment No. 34 which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_992">In page 6, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_993">“(e) specify the projected total national emissions for the period of the plan on the basis of all the policy measures specified in the plan.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">The national mitigation plan should include the projected total national emissions for the five year period covered after all of the policy measures specified in the plan have been implemented. The purpose of this amendment is to embed a little more detail in the legislation. As it stands the Bill does not require that the plan achieve anything at all. There are no targets, measurements or solid objectives, just fluff about the ill-defined low carbon economy. This amendment would mean that, in theory, the plan had some type of objective or at least those drawing up the plan would have to make an argument for the decisions that made some type of logical sense as regards the specific outcomes of individual actions specified in the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> I do not know if people noticed it, although I am sure some did, but yesterday Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of the England, made an interesting statement about this very issue. He outlined in very stark terms the financial risk of global warming and he acknowledged there was a danger the assets of fossil fuel companies could be left stranded by tougher rules to curb climate change. He said the exposure of UK investors, including insurance companies, to these shifts is potentially huge, with 19% of FTSE 100 companies being in natural resource and extraction industries. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_996">The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come. ... once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">He went on to say the carbon budget the world could afford, if it is to meet the 2° Celsius target, amounts to between one fifth and one third of the world's proven reserves of oil, gas and coal. If that estimate is even approximately correct, he said, it would render the vast majority of reserves stranded - oil, gas and coal that would be literally unburnable without expensive carbon capture technology, which itself alters fossil fuel economics. A wholesale reassessment of prospects, especially if it were to occur suddenly, could potentially destabilise markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> Those like Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, have not been the ones we have associated very much with taking strong action on climate change. I think people are slowly waking up. I would like the Government to take his thoughts on board because we seem to be very slow to wake up to what is happening. Scotland was doing things better many years ago than we are doing now. It is not good enough and the Government needs to reconsider its position.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_521">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_999">The response to everything we have raised in terms of projections and targets is that we do not need these things in Ireland because we are already the subject of EU targets. Of course, that is to be completely blind to the reality that, while we may be subject to those targets, we are also on target to miss them and be well off the radar in terms of achieving them in any meaningful way by 2020. This means the Irish taxpayer will be the subject of massive fines, apart from the fact Irish and world humanity is going to be jeopardised by a failure to come to terms with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> As it stands, the Bill does not require the national mitigation plan to achieve anything - that is the reality. What this amendment seeks is that it would be a requirement in the plan to include projected national emissions as a goal. I do not believe that is unreasonable; in fact, it makes perfect logical sense. For the Government to refuse to take this into account shows the same type of mentality we had on the earlier amendment, when the Minister was quite happy for the Government of the day to railroad through whatever was put forward and undermine participative democracy in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> Deputy Wallace is correct. We are dealing here with very serious issues and, in some ways, with the future of humanity. Even those at the higher levels or elements of the capitalist system are coming to grasp that our world is jeopardised by our inability to deal with this. The problem is that while we are talking one thing, the reality of what we are delivering is quite the opposite. We need to be much more radical in our thinking and much more definitive in the plan we put forward. There are some allusions to a way forward in the Bill before us but no meat and no substance. When we weigh up the Bill with all of the other actions the Government has stood over, the reality is that we know this country, far from reaching its targets, is moving further from achieving those targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> That is why we say austerity is contributing to this. In fairness, the group in Canada headed up by Naomi Klein have put forward the Leap Manifesto, which is based on tackling climate change in a serious way. That manifesto, which was put to public representatives, states that austerity itself is a fossilised form of thinking that has become a threat to life on earth. What they mean is that systematically attacking low carbon sectors like education and health care, as the Government has done, starving public transport and forcing reckless energy privatisation demonstrates a fossilised form of thinking which is a threat to life on earth. We can draw parallels here in our system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> The manifesto refers to needing the money for that great transformation in how society is ordered, and we need the right policies to achieve that. Ending fossil fuel subsidies, a financial transactions tax, increased resource royalties, higher income taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, a progressive carbon tax and cuts to military spending - all of these measures are real "producer pays" measures which could tackle the emissions we are seeking to deal with. Instead, we have a waffly, fluffy Bill that does not actually set out to achieve anything and, meanwhile, other policies are being implemented which ensure we will not reach our targets and that we are actually heading in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> I believe this amendment is worthy and should be included because it measures what we should be doing and, in some way, anchors this plan to some form of reality, which would then have an impact on other aspects of Government policy.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_522">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1005">I have made the historical point once before and it is always a point that strikes me very forcefully, so I will make it again as I think it very relevant to the debate about climate change and the future capacity of our society to sustain itself. The historical point is this. The reason the great civilisations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, which were the first great civilisations created by human beings, collapsed was that the people who ran those civilisations failed to invest in and sustain the infrastructure and basis on which those civilisations had arisen. Great advances in technology, in industry and in knowledge which had led to the development of those societies were completely undermined by the myopia and blindness of the people who ran them, who started to use that wealth and resources, not to sustain their civilisation, but essentially to aggrandise themselves. This is symbolised in things like pyramids, where the massive pyramids built were of no use to the society but were just monuments to the power and self-importance of the rulers and Pharaohs. Similar things were done in ancient Mesopotamia. This was instead of investing in infrastructure, both human and physical, and the means through which those societies sustained themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> In those days, it was the question of irrigated canal systems around the great rivers which allowed those societies to rise. That same scenario is now playing out in the world where, literally, the basis of our civilisation is being undermined by the myopia and blindness of the people at the top.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">They have the technological, industrial and intellectual capacity to sustain our civilisation and help it progress and develop in the interests of the whole of humanity, but they fail to do that and instead use all the wealth and resources to aggrandise themselves, spending on wasteful, damaging and dangerous things that threaten to undermine the basis of society. That is what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> We look at the terrifying displacement of millions of people in parts of the world because of what the western world has done in those places and think it is bad now, but we have yet to see the impact of runaway climate change. It is already a major contributory factor to displacement of millions of people in these areas, but displacement will get out of control if we do not take action now. The scenes we have seen in the past few weeks will be as nothing. They will pale into insignificance compared to what is coming down the line unless we deal with this matter. Countries like Ireland, with its reputation as a green country, are deeply implicated by failing to act on this matter which is having a devastating effect in the developing world. Our CO2 emissions are 80 times greater than countries like Malawi, but these countries are suffering the devastating consequences of what we have done and are doing to the environment. Despite this and the consequences being wreaked on these countries, we still think in our narrow self-serving way that we should not do anything that might impact adversely on our short-term, narrow self interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> As Deputy Stanley pointed out, it is not in our self interest. In the whole of Europe, Ireland is one of the countries set to be worst hit by rising sea levels. This will be a mammoth cost to the State. We have already seen the impact of flooding, but the costs we have seen to date will be as nothing compared to the cost that will affect us in the coming years if we do not do something about it now. Yet, the Government sets its face against doing anything concrete. It must be seen to do something, so we get a Bill full of vague, meaningless aspirations but with nothing we can be tied to, nothing that will cost us anything. As Deputy Clare Daly rightly said, this is linked to austerity. Ultimately, our inability to invest in the sort of long-term measures necessary to deal with this is the flip side of the coin of paying out €8 billion in interest to the bankers and the bondholders - modern pharaohs in historic terms. They are the modern version of the pharaohs who dug the grave of ancient civilization. The same gang is doing it for our civilization, while we are on our bended knees obeying their every command and refusing to take any action in a range of areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> Climate change is one of the most important issues, this global question of whether our planet can sustain food production and prevent massive flooding that will put significant parts of the globe under water, including parts of this country. Parts of our country will be devastated, as we have seen from river flooding already. Yet, the Government has set its face against change and seems uninterested. It wants to be able to say it passed the Bill, but it is not really interested.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> Earlier I gave an example of this lack of interest that drives me mad. When I proposed specific amendments to the Forestry Bill when it was going through the House, proposing annual targets for greater levels of afforestation, the Government's answer was "No". It was not interested. A shocking fact that many people in this country are unaware of is that the State forestry company, Coillte, is not allowed engage in afforestation, because of EU rules. That is madness, yet nobody is raising it as an issue. We are talking about dealing with climate change, but the State forestry company which was set up to plant trees is prohibited from planting them by EU state aid rules. It is madness but the Government does not want to do anything about it. Instead, we continually submit to the people who inflict this madness on us or to those whose economic interests or personal or corporate wealth is dependent on us doing nothing. We act as their lickspittles and servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> The culmination of this is a Bill that will do nothing and in four, five, ten or 15 years time, when the crisis has got worse, the Government of the day will blame the previous lot, who are then all retired, and say it is their fault. That Government will then say it will do something and will come up with another plan that will be long on aspiration and short on detail and the same process will continue. It is time to stop this nonsense and be specific and that is what this amendment is about. Be specific and be tied to targets. Any government can be measured against specific projections on CO2 emissions and targets to assess whether it is serious. If we did this now, we would discover very quickly that we are not serious at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1015">By serendipity, I am in the Chamber this afternoon, due to a change of schedule. I am glad I am here because the last few contributions have been valuable. It is a pity there are so few Members in the Chamber to reflect on them but perhaps they are doing so in their offices. However, I doubt it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> What Deputy Boyd Barrett said about the collapse of civilization is correct. It is when the titans of the day build monuments to themselves in their own interest that a greater number of people, the citizens of the world suffer. The pyramids of old were made with blocks of stone, but today's pyramids are the quantitative easing in the financial markets and the credit pyramid. That credit pyramid is controlled by far too few people. These people are getting fewer and that is where the danger lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> It is interesting to reflect for a moment on the great exodus from the Middle East through eastern European countries to western European countries. Rivers of humanity are moving west with only the clothes on their backs. The relevant committees here in the west then try to segregate and grade these people on whether they are true refugees or economic migrants. How absurd. Then, from abroad, the giants of our small country dare to comment on these matters and this grading. They themselves are economic migrants because they do not like paying tax in the country of their birth. I do not want to name these people, but everybody knows that six names pop up in this regard. Sometimes these people pay tax by self-assessment, by way of a charity cheque to their home town schools or hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> The wealth and capital these people have has earned from 6% to 8% minimum over the past 25 years, as authoritative writers and researchers have explained. To make understanding this easy, I invite everybody here to see the easy 50-minute version of what people like Stiglitz, Piketty, Krugman and Carmen Reinhart have put hundreds of hours into writing. They can see it on a home-produced David McWilliams programme - 50 minutes of the truth. The establishment here thinks it can accept what its advisers, who provide little press release snatches of what might sound good for the <i>status quo</i>, say but it is not the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">It leaves maybe up to 2 million people unnecessarily hurt by the unfair divide that has taken place in the so-called recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> The truth is simple. It is simply explained and, as Deputy Daly said, Bills like this are fluffy palliatives, that is all. They do not specify or get concrete but on 15 October, there will be a very concrete formula of algebra to tax the middle, the lower middle and the very low. It will be so concrete that, like the 93 year-old lady yesterday, they will be suddenly snapping out of the hypnosis of fear in court or with bailiffs at the door.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> It is strange, but we are here to talk about these things and to legislate, not to confuse. We can make the laws simpler, less complex. Imagine reading a book when, every now and then, a new page or half page was put in and one was taken out. It would not make sense. The simplest income tax return form is now 26 pages long. The little lady was told, "Well, if you ring up a number, you can get an explanation about the documentation" that came from the department of broadcasting or whatever it is called, but she cannot do so. The truth is that if one rings a so-called lo-call or free 1850 number, one gets a menu which even I, who am fairly okay on the uptake, have trouble understanding. Button one is this, button two is that and button three is the other. One waits and tries to hold but will it be button one or could it be button six? This is for an elderly person - ring up and get it explained. She cannot even get through and, if she does, the call might be sent to a call centre in Scotland or Mumbai. The whole thing gets madder and madder.</p>

          <p eId="para_1026"> In respect of Germany, only a few weeks ago, in regard to the migration of refugees, our papers were full of, "Germany has gone in to overdrive in generosity". The figure of 1% of its population, 800,000 people, is nothing compared to what Greece has had as an actuality on its islands and shores, namely, 310,000 people, first arrivals. The country is on its knees with 24% ordinary unemployment and 50% youth unemployment, and the titans of finance are wondering if it is good for another bailout. It gets madder and madder. The lads will all meet - the powerful, the fewer with the more - in Davos in Switzerland in January for another mutual congratulations bash about how rich and powerful they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> The Government has an opportunity. It has big numbers in whatever months there are left to do a few things rather than to talk about them. It should bring in a gambling control Bill. We now host and accommodate one of the world's biggest gambling organisations, after a so-called merger, or takeover, during the summer. The Government sleeps and sits on its hands and collects only 1% turnover tax. It is absurd. For every 500 jobs in that organisation there are 5,000 families going down the tubes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> This is the climate we live in, the one we feel and the one the 130,000 families on housing waiting lists know. It is the climate the 1,500 children who do not have a home feel. What about the so-called restructured loans? The banks are telling us they have everything under control. That is so Mad Hatter, so <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, it is unbelievable. They fiddle with accounting, dividing a thing up into a split mortgage, one would think it was an ice cream. It is rubbish. A loan to a person or people to buy a home to raise a family is a loan. It is secured by the lender by a mortgage on the property. The sooner we start talking the truthful language, the better we will understand what is happening. Banks enter into loans with people to house and raise a family for up to 30 years, and only a sixth of the way through the original loan term, they say, "We are changing it and splitting it." They say to people they think they can handle part A for the rest of their working lives and that they will freeze part B until 25 years later. By the way, they win all the time, because when people retire on a State pension, if they are lucky, they will activate the other loan with the cumulative hidden interest. That is the climate those families live in. If they cannot honour - listen to the word "honour" - the restructured nonsense, the bank has gone on with-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">This is the "concrete" weather that Irish people live in; two million people unfairly treated in the so-called outcome of the collapse. Do not talk about recovery; it is an outcome at the moment. It is recovery for those few who own the capital and the wealth - the 6% to 8% growth, steady for the last 25 years. Those guys over there in numbers are afraid to write an assessment invoice to the multinational corporations to cough up. Forget 12.5% - say even an 8% effective rate of tax. The Government has not got the guts to send out the invoice. They would pay it. I have done the research. They would not even blink. That is the truth of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> Like the weather and climate change, which the Bill is all about, they are even getting to that point now. When they had their last conversations, these people, the OECD and so on, said, "We have got to recognise realities and it will be happening anyway." In the meantime the open goal was missed. There was a national recovery opportunity to say to the multinational corporations, "Our people are hurting".</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> It is all because boards of banks created a credit pyramid, bringing us back to where we started in this conversation. Nobody else did. It was not the developers, by the way. The papers have got all that wrong. The balance sheets prove where the problem was - it was credit. The proof is that the banks are, by their own admission, correcting their balance sheets to the proper loan to deposit ratios. That means they must have made a mistake, and as they say, they are correcting it. If they made the mistake, why are the people paying for it with the second split mortgages?</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> I have taken a little liberty, but these things are all connected. If the Minister of State does not see that they are connected, then we are missing it. We are being juvenile about things. We have got to get honest. These are the things that should be discussed in Cabinet. These are the big picture responsibilities, not the little selfish things about how to get in and whether we have a good representation and saying, "A few more roads down in Cork to Limerick - that should do it" for this constituency and that. That is not the way to think.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> Anyway, I am glad I came in. I heard very relevant and valuable contributions. If the Government is going to go with this Bill, it should at least make it specific and concrete. It should accept the amendments. To leave it woolly and fluffy is pathetic.</p>

          <p eId="para_1045">The purpose of the national mitigation plan relates to how to achieve emission reductions, not to how much of a reduction should be achieved. It would be out of place, therefore, to include quantified emission reduction figures in the national mitigation plan. Each successive national mitigation plan must abide by our legally binding mitigation obligations. In any event, specifying projected total national emissions after each succession plan is implemented would be redundant. For that reason, I cannot support these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1159">I move amendment No. 36:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1160">In page 6, lines 30 and 31, after “<i>subsection (2)(d)</i>” to insert “, however they may not vary or revise downwards any targets contained in the mitigation plan”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">This amendment provides that when submitting their departmental submissions to the mitigation plan, individual Ministers may not vary or revise downwards the emission targets. The obvious problem with this Bill is that there are no targets. The Government is continuing on the tradition of passing a so-called climate action Bill which contains no binding targets. All 24 amendments that sought to insert targets in the Bill were ruled out of order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> The suggested targets in those amendments all came from the advice of environmental organisations. These were based on targets that are most commonly legislated for internationally and which are based on emission targets some 80% less than the total emission targets in 1990. In the meantime other countries have gone even further than that. In Ireland, however, we are presented with legislation without targets. The plan for tackling greenhouse gases will be presented in two years' time despite examples of what needs to be done being evident across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> The UNIPCC report indicates there is a 95% certainty that climate change is occurring mainly because of greenhouse gases released by human activity, above the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. If the Minister of State is serious about tackling climate change and averting environmental disaster, we need to take rapid action. We know what needs to be done. Greenhouse gas emissions need to be massively cut. The European Commission suggested a cut of 40% by 2030, while environmental organisations and NGOs have said we need a 55% cut by 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">We cannot continue to put the economy, the interests of big business and the profit system above the environment and the planet itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_1165">The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that Ministers responsible for sectoral mitigation measures cannot revise downward any mitigation targets contained in a national mitigation plan. This, unfortunately, is to misunderstand the nature of the national mitigation plan, which is designed to specify how greenhouse gas emission reductions are to be achieved and not the quantum of reductions to be achieved. The latter is set as a result of negotiations at an EU level. Accordingly, this amendment is considered redundant and I cannot support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1379">I move amendment No. 40:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1380">In page 7, line 34, to delete "have regard to" and substitute "comply with and take account of".</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">This amendment requires that the Minister and the Government take account of certain matters when performing functions under this section. The need to have regard to those matters is in page 7 of the Bill but I want to substitute "have regard to" with the words "comply with and take account of". Those of us who have come through county councils will be very familiar with the term "the need to have regard to" in respect of this, that or the other but in actual fact it means very little and we have seen it set aside many times. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 is very important legislation and we have tried to firm it up in this way as it has been described by a number of speakers as being "very fluffy" and not very solid in terms of setting targets in a whole range of areas. It is important we stitch this into the Bill and that it is writ large in this section that the Government must comply with and take account of the matters in question when performing its functions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1382">This amendment calls for the phrase "have regard to" to be replaced with, <i>inter alia</i>, "comply" in section 4(7) of the Bill. With due respect, I do not believe this amendment makes sense as there are competing considerations when developing a national mitigation plan, all of which cannot be complied with fully at the same time. Accordingly, I believe the phrase "have regard to" is the appropriate one in this instance as it requires a balancing of considerations. I therefore cannot support this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1493">The amendment refers to another issue to which the Government must have regard in producing the national mitigation plan and, in particular, suggests that we need to take account of "the management of soil carbon and the protection and rewetting of wetlands", because this is a huge area of potential carbon sequestration, in addition to research on the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation measures. As we develop our understanding of this and its effectiveness in acting as a carbon sink and reducing CO2 emissions, it must be an important element to which to have regard in developing an effective mitigation plan. This is a reasonable and practical amendment and I hope the Government will accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1495">Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 are grouped. These proposed amendments call for the inclusion of a reference to the management of soil carbon and the protection and rewetting of wetlands when the Minister, Deputy Kelly and the Government perform their functions under section 4. In the first instance, I fully accept that both the management of soil carbon and the protection and rewetting of wetlands are proven means of maintaining and developing carbon sinks, which are an important option in reducing our overall carbon footprint as a State. As such, these activities fall under the heading "mitigation policy measures".</p>
          <p eId="para_1496"> The Bill, as initiated, does not make reference to any particular mitigation policy measures for good reason in that the nature and extent of such measures will change over time up to the year 2050, as successive mitigation measures take effect. For that reason, I do not consider it appropriate to single out these particular mitigation policy measures for inclusion in the Bill, rather they more properly belong to the context of the iterative national mitigation plans where specific soil carbon and wetland management measures can be specified. For this reason, I cannot support these amendments.</p>

Accordingly, my amendment seeks to complement the top-down nature of the national mitigation plans with a bottom-up approach from local authorities, which I believe will be to the benefit of both. </p>

This consideration may determine the mix of mitigation policy measures to be implemented at any point in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1543">I move amendment No. 59:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1544">In page 11, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1545">"(c) the need to further develop the tillage sector and mixed farming, in particular crops that have the potential to act as significant carbon sinks;".</p>
          <p eId="para_1546">It is important that we consider the agriculture sector. There are ambitious targets to be met in Harvest 2020, which the agriculture sector has gone a long way towards meeting. The issue that will arise will be that of trying to meet the capacity and keeping within our greenhouse gas emission limits in terms of our international obligations and whatever national obligations we set out. </p>
          <p eId="para_1547"> There is great pressure to increase output. We must be careful how we manage this because if we do not do it the right way, the Government of the day, whatever its composition will be, will have to buy carbon credits to offset any overrun of greenhouse gas emissions if we do not take remedial measures and if we do not diversify. We have very strong beef and dairy sectors and they must be protected and improved. The jobs being created in those sectors are very welcome, particularly the new jobs in the food industry. That is all positive, as is the increase in our exports in that sector. However, there are limits in terms of market demands. Without going into this in great depth, we know from what has happened in America that beef exports have not been the silver bullet that people thought they would be. The beef and dairy sectors have their limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548">Twelve months ago the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, called for a significant increase in dairy output, that there would be no fear of it distorting the market for dairy produce. Many farmers might disagree with that now, with those markets which they are serving showing a downward pull on prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549"> We need to look at other areas in farming where we can produce. We also need to look at those sectors in which we are importing a substantial amount of food produce which could be produced here. The beet sector is one. The indigenous sugar beet industry was closed in 2006. The plan then was to build apartments on the sugar factory site in Carlow on the banks of the River Barrow. The only building on it now is the tower from the old beet plant with the thistles and buachalán buí growing around it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550"> This amendment addresses the need to diversify into more mixed farming. In some ways, it is going back to the future. We used to be a significant sugar beet growing country, a position to which we need to go back. In the context of this Bill, sugar beet is important because it can act as a break crop, as well as a good cover crop in acting as a carbon sink. Those of us who have ever worked in a beet field will know it is a broad-leafed plant for several months, meaning it is a good covering crop and excellent as a carbon sink. It does not emit greenhouse gas whereas cattle do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551"> We need to be looking more at developing the tillage sector and root crops, such as sugar beet. Research and practice on the Continent shows sugar beet can be used not just in sugar but also in bioethanol production, proving it is a viable industry. This State imports about €400 million worth of sugar products every year, a substantial amount of money going out of the State, affecting the balance of payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552"> This is an opportunity to look more seriously at this area. The Minister will be aware of attempts to restart the indigenous sugar industry. We must try to have a plant operating the whole year around. This is a win-win. It does not generate greenhouse gas emissions. Sugar beet is a good cash crop and, for several months of the year, it is a valuable carbon sink crop as it is a broad-leafed covering crop. From June, a good beet field would be completely covered in green right up to when the beet is pulled in October. I have often seen it left in the ground as late as December. It is important we look at that and diversify. I tabled this amendment to further develop the tillage sector, mixed farming and particularly crops that can act as carbon sinks. It makes sense from an environmental, a financial and a social point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553"> Week in, week out, we talk about rural development and developing local economies. The loss of the sugar beet industry had a significant impact on the midlands and the south east. One can blame the previous Government for that and get into the blame game but tomorrow is the first day of the future. Greencore wound up with the bulk of the compensation package for the closure of the sugar factories while farmers got some of it. The former workers and contractors did not get a whole lot, however. I remember being at meetings when the sugar factory was closed and it was like being at a funeral. Farmers were annoyed. Beet is a good sustainable cash crop and very good for crop rotation. Now, farmers are growing other break crops for grain and barley but these are not good cash crops. Farmers and experts will maintain beet is good for the ground in giving back nutrients to the soil. This makes sense from an environmental, economic and social point of view, as well as importantly getting money into our local economies and keeping people working locally. I implore the Minister of State to accept this amendment in the spirit it has been put forward.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1554">I strongly endorse Deputy Stanley's amendment. Monoculture or overdependence on one or two agricultural sectors is a very dangerous game. We need to diversify enterprise and industry generally, as well as agriculture. The idea we would have an ever onwards and upwards beef export industry or we can solely rely on the beef and dairy sector is a mistake. It makes us vulnerable to any sort of serious fluctuations, increased competition, diseases and other factors which could potentially hit a single sector and, therefore, make the entire economy vulnerable. We learned about the folly of overconcentration on a particular sector with the property crash. It would be devastating if we did not learn the same in the areas of agriculture which we have prioritised. One has to have diversity in this sector basically for safety, sustainability and protection of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555"> I do not know as much as Deputy Stanley does about the sugar beet sector and the sugar industry. However, it is an amazing fact that even in Dún Laoghaire, people regularly approach me to decry the collapse of the indigenous sugar industry and that it was a national tragedy to allow it to happen. The passion and conviction with which this point is put, a point echoed by Deputy Stanley, coming from an area very much affected, indicates the need to take the resurrection of that industry seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1556"> Another important sector in which we have desperately underperformed and which we have allowed to decline is forestry. Of course, there were historical reasons it was devastated under British rule. It is an absolute tragedy and shame that in the country in Europe which has the best conditions for growing trees, we have the lowest level of forest cover. This is a perfect crop for addressing climate change, CO2 emissions, as well as dealing with the consequences of climate change and environmental damage and yet we have failed spectacularly to develop the sector. In so far as we have developed it, again it has been on a monocultural basis with one crop being prioritised, which has questionable effects on soil and water quality, as well as making it vulnerable to disease. This is an area in which we should be diversifying and expanding to a significant extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1557">There are many other such areas but a focus on the diversification of crops to develop industry, enterprise and agriculture could be beneficial in terms of meeting our targets. It would be environmentally sustainable and good economically, socially and in every other way. This must be a key part of our moving towards a sustainable future and dealing with climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558"> It is a reasonable and sensible amendment and I see no reason the Minister of State would not accept it. It is very much the direction in which we need to go if we are to think outside the box and widen our horizons. In some cases, we need just go back to things we used to do. This was a forest-covered country. We also had a sugar industry. Both of those have been devastated but there are things in these areas we could do terribly well, realising multiple benefits at every level. The Minister of State should accept the amendment. More important, however, this Government and future Governments need to take the spirit of the amendment seriously in addressing not just climate change but also a sustainable economic and environmental future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1559">I have listened with interest for the past few minutes to my learned colleagues from Dún Laoghaire and Portlaoise speaking about the sugar industry and its benefit to the country over many years, which is true. There is one particular and important point my colleague from Portlaoise omitted, however, which is that his colleagues in the European Parliament recently voted to restrict the production of sugar within Europe. At the same time, we are trying to ensure there is a viable industry here. It is important to make the point that we cannot have it both ways. Either we want it or we do not. In the past it was very important to us to have an industry such as this one but it was taken from us by the people to my left, who seem to forget that fact whenever it suits them. It is important that my colleagues in Sinn Féin are not hypocritical about the situation. They are looking for an industry to return, something we all want, but have a different view on it in the European Parliament. That should not be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560"> It is important that we have diversity. We have diversity at present in agriculture, which has changed considerably over the past 20 or 30 years. That point must also not be forgotten. Beef and dairy farmers are constantly monitoring what their cattle are producing to ensure it can be minimised to best effect. They also have an important role to play in terms of the future. We cannot keep blaming agriculture and farming in general for the current situation. It is important that we move on from that. It would be great to have sugar produced in Ireland again. We all want it back but we must come clean about who wants it back more than others.</p>

          <p eId="para_1561">I agree with Deputies that the loss of the sugar industry was massive for this country, particularly for counties in the south and east, one of which is my county. I recognise the efforts of many Deputies and others, including Deputies Deering and Phelan who are in the Chamber. Another colleague, Deputy Tom Barry, is very active in trying to revitalise the sugar industry, which goes without saying but we should recognise that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562"> The proposed amendment calls for the inclusion of material relating to carbon sinks in section 7, which deals with considerations relating to the national adaptation framework and the sectoral adaptation plans. I reiterate that we are not specifying mitigation measures in the Bill. I recognise what the Deputy proposing the amendment wishes to achieve but it is a matter for the national mitigation plan which will specify actual mitigation measures. There will be, and already is, a full engagement with all sectors, including the agricultural sector, to identify appropriate and sustainable carbon sinks. That will be the opportunity to include these mitigation measures. Accordingly, I believe this amendment to be out of place in its current context and I cannot support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1584">I will be brief. The purpose of these amendments is to enshrine the independence of the advisory council into law. It is very much based on the statutory framework for the Fiscal Advisory Council. The amendment is modelled on a provision in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and section 8(1) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012. If it is sufficiently important to enshrine the independence of the Fiscal Advisory Council in law, I do not see why there would not be a similar logic to doing so for the climate advisory council. We are talking about the future of humanity and I, therefore, think it is sufficiently important. To quote Friends of the Earth on the subject:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1585">The independence of the Fiscal Advisory Council is underpinned by law. The same protection is essential for the Climate Advisory Council, especially with ex-officio members who might otherwise be looking over their shoulders to their Boards and stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586">That is essentially it. I am not sure if it was the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, or the Minister who signalled on Committee Stage a preparedness to incorporate this provision into the legislation. I hope the Minister of State will not oppose the amendment and that I will not need to say anything further on it because the talk on Committee Stage was that it was going to be accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_1587">The point has already been made - but it took an economic crisis for this Government and governments across Europe to recognise it - that we need independent economists to assess budgets, spending decisions and macroeconomic priorities so that there is an early warning signal, so to speak, with regard to mistaken behaviours that could wreak havoc on the economy and our society. Despite the fact that I may have issues with some of the recommendations of the Fiscal Advisory Council, I see the benefit of having an independent group of economists assessing the wider economy, what the Government is doing, its budgets and setting out whether it thinks there are dangers. The reports and figures it produces are very useful. In that sense, it is quite a good model and one which should be followed in this area of equal if not, arguably, much greater importance, which is an area that concerns the management of our environment so that it remains sustainable for human existence and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588">It does not get much more important than that. To have that group independent in assessing our mitigation plans and Government policies and priorities in this area appears to be a no-brainer. As Deputy Daly said, there were positive sounds from the Government on Committee Stage on this front, so let us hope they will be followed through with an agreement on the Government's part to accept this series of amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1589">The proposed amendments call from an explicit statement that the national expert advisory council on climate change shall be independent in the performance of its functions. I appreciate that there has been some concern that the presence of the <i>ex officio</i> members on the expert advisory council will, in some manner, render the council less than independent in its advice-giving functions. However, I do not agree with this assessment. The presence of the <i>ex officio</i> members should not be seen as an impediment to independence; rather, they provide the council with much needed practical experience of policy implementation by organisations which already have a well established low carbon agenda. In short, I believe that they add to, rather than diminish, the standing of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590"> Nevertheless, to address Deputies' concerns and in deference to the wishes of others, I have introduced my own amendment, No. 124, which provides for a statement of explicit independence in section 11. Therefore, I will not accept this amendment.</p>

We do not wish to call votes for the sake of it. We would like to say that the Minister of State's amendment covers the matter and, therefore, our amendments are not required as the Government has listened.

          <p eId="para_1620">I will speak on amendment No. 67. The membership of the advisory council is set out in the Bill. The <i>ex officio</i> members include the director general of the agency, the chief executive of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the director of Teagasc and the director of the ESRI. The key point, however, is what is stated in the report from the all-party environment committee. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1621">To carry out these functions, [that is, to be independent and to submit annual reports and so forth to the Minister] the Expert Advisory Body requires a high degree of independence and to be able to draw on appropriate technical support from the relevant public service departments. The model of the Fiscal Advisory Council is seen as appropriate to achieve this. As with the Fiscal Advisory Council, the Expert Advisory Body requires to be able to publish its own reports independent of government. Its independence [and this is key] also requires that it have no <i>ex</i><b><i>-</i></b><i>officio</i> members, but be supported by a small technical secretariat as proposed by National Economic and Social Council. This 'Office of Climate Change' would include the officials currently proposed in Head 6 of the Bill and be chaired by the Director General of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622"> The difference is that the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, the current Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, have included those people as <i>ex officio</i> members of the council, instead of having the people on an independent panel to advise. The environment committee, which was representative of all parties including Fine Gael and the Labour Party, examined this carefully and there was a long discussion about it in the summer of 2013 down in the bunker, or the committee rooms. That level of independence, modelled on the Fiscal Advisory Council, is required but the Minister has made what should be the expert advisory panel and these people who should be <i>ex officio</i> members all one and the same. That is the issue, and it is the reason I tabled amendment No. 67 - other Deputies have tabled similar amendments - and amendment No. 70, which we will discuss later.</p>

          <p eId="para_1623">Regarding the amendment tabled by me and Deputy Stanley, I acknowledge what the Minister of State said. I had asked that the national expert advisory council should be independent in the performance of its functions, and I note the Minister of State's amendment No. 124 provides that the expert advisory council shall be independent. I accept the Minister's good faith and good intentions in this regard and acknowledge the fact that, in essence, he is accepting the proposal. I will withdraw my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1624">The difference between what the Minister of State is proposing and what we are proposing, and I hope the Minister of State will speak to it and explain as he still has not done that, is that while he is making a statement that it will be independent in its functions, it still will have the <i>ex officio</i> members rather than what was proposed to him by us and the environmental lobby. We proposed that the agencies he wishes to designate as <i>ex officio</i> members would be essentially a secretariat technical support for an independent body of people, similar to the Fiscal Advisory Council. It is not that these people and agencies would not have an input, but that they would not be <i>ex officio</i> members of the advisory committee. They would be technical support to the advisory committee. That is an important distinction. While making some concession to our concerns, the Minister has not gone the full way towards the Fiscal Advisory Council model but has retained some element of the insiders, as it were, being a permanent part of this advisory body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625">The real point is that this is not full independence when that was what was being sought, although with technical support from bodies such as the agencies referred to in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State can persuade us otherwise, but what we are proposing is still superior to what he is proposing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1626">To clarify, the council was announced by the Minister in June. It includes four <i>ex officio</i> members of 11 members in total. We can supply the list to Deputies, if they want it made available. The chairperson of the council is John FitzGerald, who I believe we would all agree is a very experienced and qualified chair, which needs to be recognised. I am not sure where Deputy Boyd Barrett is coming from. He is adopting a cynical approach. The Government seems to have satisfied Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil, given the thrust of our amendment is the same as theirs. The Government amendment states, "The Advisory Council shall be independent in the performance of its functions.” I cannot see how I can be any more explicit or clear. The Government has put into the legislation that this council is required to be independent in the performance of its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627"> I cannot elaborate any further. We listened to the concerns of Deputies on Committee Stage and put forward amendment No. 124. I will move that amendment when we get to it.</p>

I am glad the Minister of State seems to have taken the points on board. The appointment of some of the people to the council has also perhaps reassured people a little in terms of some of the concerns in regard to independence. It is explicitly being put in the Bill, although I am not sure why it is not dealt with in the same group.</p>

          <p eId="para_1644">The make-up of the advisory council is important and I put forward the amendment in that spirit.</p>

          <p eId="para_1645">The amendment calls for the complete removal of the <i>ex officio</i> members from the expert advisory council. I believe that such a course of action would be wholly misguided in that it would rob the council of valuable insights into the realities and practicalities of policy implementation in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1646"> We are all in favour of robust mitigation policy measures being developed and implemented in a timely fashion. The expert advisory council is there to provide advice in this regard. It would be strange, therefore, if the council itself did not have at its disposal, as full members, experts in policy implementation. In addition, the four relevant organisations – the EPA, the SEAI, Teagasc and the ESRI – have a wealth of talent and infrastructure behind them to lend assistance to the council, as and when required, particularly where relevant research is concerned. Foregoing this support around the main table would do a disservice to the requirements and demands of the low carbon transition agenda challenge that we all face. For those reasons, I cannot support this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1647">I refer to my earlier statement in this regard. The section of the environment committee report from the summer of 2013 outlines the reasons for this. I agree with the Minister of State that the council should have that level of expertise available to it. However, where we are divided is that we would see them as advisory to the panel, not included as <i>ex officio</i> members, similar to the position with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_1765">Briefly, this is about shortening the timeframe for the publication of the advisory council's annual reports. We propose the amendment in the view that this is necessary in order to facilitate public debate and ensure transparency in the process. There should not be any lengthy delays in the publication of the reports. The 30 days provided for, one month, is too long. There is no need for a delay beyond ten days. If the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, is expected to produce its report within ten days, this is at least as important and should be on a par with it. This is serious business and ten days is more than adequate. I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1766">I support this amendment. If the Minister has the report, it should be made available. There is no reason not to make it available. It is important it is made available to Members quickly also. The Government, in its last weeks or months in office, must try to move away from the current delaying system. I am surprised by the practice because when information is available in county councils, it is provided to councillors almost straight away. Over the past four and a half years, I have been surprised by the Government's system of making announcements and having launches, but Members have to wait until they get the newspapers the next day to find out what was said. I know this situation is slightly different, but where an annual report is available to the Minister, it should be available to Members and the public within ten days. There is no reason for it not to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1767"> If the Minister wants the public to buy into this, we cannot do it in a semi-secret way or by way of delay or procrastination. The more open we are the better. We have nothing to fear and we want the public to be involved. Perception is sometimes everything. The more open we are, the more we get people to buy into our plans because they have a clearer understanding of what needs to be done. The public appreciates that. In that spirit, I ask the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 131.</p>

          <p eId="para_1768">I am disappointed with Deputy Stanley's cynical attitude towards this. There is nothing semi-secret in this process. It is a transparent process and will stand on its merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1769"> The proposed amendments call for the shortening of the timeframe for publication by the expert advisory council of its annual report, following its submission to the Minister, from 30 days to ten days. By way of explanation for what is already in the Bill, the 30-day timeframe is to provide an opportunity for the annual report to be seen by the Government before it is published. I hasten to add that there is no intention or, indeed, provision for the Government to seek to alter or amend the annual report in any way. The 30-day timeframe is merely to afford this opportunity and courtesy to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1770"> I do not believe that a maximum 30-day wait for publication could be said to constitute any undue or untoward delay. The annual report will be published in full by the expert advisory council and without any interference whatsoever. Accordingly, I cannot support these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1775">I move amendment No. 134:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1776">In page 17, line 29, to delete “18 months” and substitute “6 months”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777"> This amendment is to section 13(1), which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1778">The Expert Advisory Council shall, not later than 18 months after the establishment day, conduct a review (in this Act referred to as a “periodic review”) of—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1779">(a) progress made in meeting the obligations of the State under Decision No. 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1780">Community’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1781">(b) progress made in furthering the achievement of the national transition objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782"> Given that we are so far behind and are not doing very much with this, the idea is to force this Government, the next one or the one after - we might have two elections in a short period - to review it after six months. People might change their ideas. We might have been dragged kicking and screaming into the real world by then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783"> I pointed out earlier that the Governor of the Bank of England only yesterday - there is an article in the <i>Financial Times </i>on it - has been suddenly shouting from the rooftops about the cost of inaction on climate change to big business, which is set to become frightening not too far down the road. If those concerned had any kind of long-term vision, they would do a bit more about it now. The less they do now, the more it will cost in the long term. </p>
          <p eId="para_1784"> It is not a good idea to bring in something which we on this side of the House think is very weak without making it a requirement to review it after it is established. I do not see why the Government should have a serious problem with making the period six months. It will not be costly to get the panel to review it. I do not see it as such a big problem. It would be a good gesture on the Government's side to take this on board.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1785">This proposed amendment calls for the shortening in the timeframe for the expert advisory council to conduct its first periodic review from 18 months after establishment to six months. The first periodic review will, of course, be an important one, in that it is specifically charged with analysing the progress made in meeting our mitigation targets up to the year 2020 under the EU’s effort sharing decision of 2009. Of course, I understand why some would wish to see this timeframe shortened but I believe that we also have to be realistic in what we can expect of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1786"> The council is not a full-time entity, although it will have at its disposal a secretariat to be provided by the Environmental Protection Agency. Moreover, it will require a certain amount of time to bed down the operational structures of the council and then to begin its work of collating and analysing all available relevant information and data. I do not think it is reasonable to expect the council to do all this, and turn around a major review of mitigation policy and implementation in Ireland, within just six months. </p>
          <p eId="para_1787"> We all want the first periodic review report to be a substantive and challenging piece of work, and to genuinely add value to the work being undertaken by the State’s institutions in achieving progress on mitigation. We must, therefore, afford the council a reasonable period of time to do its job effectively and efficiently, and it is important to note in this respect that 18 months is a maximum timeline which allows flexibility in terms of successfully completing the first periodic review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788"> I am afraid that six months is too short a timeframe to make a notable contribution in this regard. Accordingly, I cannot support this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1789">We understand that there will be some good people on this council. If they have a positive approach, they might be glad to review it after six months. The Minister of State is telling me they are not permanent positions. If we are going to do this right at all, and if this body is going to cut the mustard, I do not think it is an irrational request for them to conduct a review after six months. I will be pressing the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_711">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1790">The Minister of State said that we have to be realistic, which is true. In the real world, Ireland is not on track to reach its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. We are committed to a non-emissions trading sectors reduction of 20% between 2005 and 2020. It is widely established that we are going to be well wide of the mark for this. It is reckoned that we will only achieve a decrease of about 3% by 2020. If we provide for an 18-month period we are talking about the middle of 2017, two and a half years away from that end target. It is way too near to be able to take stock of where we are at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1791"> Deputy Wallace is correct. Given the capabilities of some of the personnel on the expert advisory council and the importance of its task, nobody is going to shoot them if they do not produce a biblical version of the council's findings but they should be able to produce a comprehensive body of work. This has been in gestation for some time now. They are not starting from zero, yet we are starting from miles behind where we should be. In that context, six months is a far more realistic and important barometer than 18 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1792">I thank the Deputies. I note their argument and that they have a genuine reason for proposing the amendment. On the other hand, I also believe we need to afford the council reasonable time to allow it to have a deep engagement with all of the sectors for what is a vital piece of work on behalf of the State. As I have already outlined, 18 months is a maximum period. There is adequate flexibility within the legislation to allow the council carry out the work within its scope in an efficient and effective time period. I am fully confident that the council will carry out its work in a very effective way and I believe we should give it that vote of confidence.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1793">We have argued at length on this. It concerns not only us but those who will be on the advisory council. They have thought about all this. If we were happy with the Bill, we would be happy with the 18 months, but we are not happy with the Bill. We would very much like to see this aspect looked at again six months after it comes into effect. It will probably not be implemented for a couple of months as there is paperwork to be done and so on. A Bill does not come into effect overnight after we vote for it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1794"> We do not think the Bill is good enough, therefore, the idea of this six-month provision is a positive one because we want the legislation to be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1795"> The Minister of State sounds like he is sticking to his guns on the issue but he could have given a bit on this. Things do not work fully between any two bodies unless there is some compromise. It is a bit like a marriage, which certainly would not work without compromise. We would get on better if there was a bit of compromise here. The Minister of State should agree to the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1911">The purpose of this amendment is to put more solid terms of reference in the periodic reviews. It is about specifying progress towards the achievement of annual targets, interim targets and the 2050 target. Although there is a certain semblance of <i>déjà vu</i> about the amendment, we are re-tabling it because the terms of reference for the reviews are practically non-existent in the Bill as it stands. There are no references to targets, so the reviews might as well not be conducted at all. They are somewhat purposeless unless one has a starting point. This is especially so, as the national transition objective, which is the current reference point for the reviews' content, is not fleshed out in any detail in the Bill. If one does not know what the starting point is, how does one know what one is reviewing? How does one know the goal that one is ultimately trying to reach?</p>
          <p eId="para_1912"> The amendment seeks to give some purpose and weight to the reviews that we have stated are so important for the advisory council to carry out. While we had a lengthy discussion about who would make up the advisory council, the nature of their independence and so on, we have not given adequate input into what are their objectives. The amendment therefore seeks to make the terms of reference of the periodic reviews more substantial and relevant than the nothingness that exists at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1948">With this amendment, we are looking to flesh out the terms of reference for the periodic review. We are looking to install some guidelines which would make up a more substantial terms of reference position. The amendment states that when providing advice under subsection (1)(a), the advisory council shall express a view as to the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets and the domestic effort target that should be made by the traded sector of the economy and by the other sectors of the economy, and the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets that should be made by energy efficiency, energy generation, land use and transport. The amendment stipulates that when providing advice under this subsection, the advisory council may also express a view as to any other matter that body considers appropriate, including, in particular, as to any sectors of the economy in which there are particular opportunities for contributions to be made towards meeting annual targets through reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, and that when providing advice under this subsection, the advisory council shall also express a view as to the cumulative amount of net emissions for the period 2010-50 that is consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the 2050 target to be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_1949"> The purpose of the amendment is to give more direction to the annual or 18-month reviews with specific reference to the possible contributions by different sectors of the economy and different sources of emissions. Our performance across the different sectors is uneven. We are going in the wrong direction on transport and we are going in a seriously wrong direction on agriculture. There seems to be no stemming of the tide. We are even out of sync with much of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1950"> These ideas are taken from the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. I do not see why we could not do our best to emulate best international practice, which is all we would be doing by inserting these conditions and following the Scottish example. This is not unreasonable given that we are so far behind.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1951">This is a very important amendment because when we are talking about where we are going and where we want to go, we must take account of where we have come from. The amendment seeks to insert specific reference to possible contributions from different sectors of the economy and different sources of emissions. This is critical because performance is uneven. If one looks at the European Commission report on Ireland earlier this year, it graphically makes the point and sets out why we need to specify the different areas. That report stated that agricultural emissions in Ireland were expected to remain stable between 2005 and 2020. Although this was technically accurate, the statement glossed over the fact that agricultural greenhouse gas emissions had fallen by 9% by 2011 but were now increasing because of Food Harvest 2020 due to the expansion of livestock numbers, particularly dairy cattle, which meant that emissions were already up 4% in the past two years and were predicted to rise up to 2025. Clearly, this is one sector of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1952"> The report dealt with emissions in transport which, again, we are trying to specify here. It stated in respect of transport, which is the second largest non-emissions trading system sector in terms of emissions, that emissions are expected to increase significantly between 2005 and 2020 due to the lack of public transport. That has not been addressed. It looked at the continuing use of coal and increased domestic peat use that has meant that domestic heat carbon emissions rose by 2.6% in 2013 over 2012 levels, with no strategy in place to achieve high levels of household insulation and so on that would deal with this and allow us to switch from coal to low-carbon sources. We need to specify by sector. It is very important and contributes to a more bottom-up and meaningful approach to this. It is critical that we would do this and it feeds into the other discussion we had about who decides about this. It is much more democratic and accountable to specify it in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1953">This proposed amendment calls for the expert advisory council to report and provide advice in respect of proposed annual targets - an interim target for 2050 and a final target for 2050. As I have already explained, I do not accept the validity of the inclusion of such domestic targets in the Bill. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. As I said earlier, the national mitigation plan will set out the measures that each sector will implement. This is the appropriate place for such measures to be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_2053">Amendment No. 147 is in the names of Deputies Clare Daly, Mick Wallace and Richard Boyd Barrett. It arises out of Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 148 and 149 are physical alternatives to amendment No. 147 and they will be discussed together. If amendment No. 147 is agreed then amendments Nos. 148 to 150, inclusive, cannot be moved.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2056">“(8) Not more than 10 days after submitting a periodic review report to the Minister in accordance with this section, the Advisory Council shall publish the report by such means as the Agency may advise.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_2057">We had much discussion on the matter already. The amendment relates to shortening the timeframe for the publication of the periodic review. We suggest ten days. As it stands the Minister will have the review on his desk for at least 60 days and up to 90 days before the public can review its content. We do not think that makes sense or is very democratic. In the context of the promised openness and transparency, ten days is adequate.</p>

          <p eId="para_2058">By way of background, the periodic review reports, as the name suggests, are expected to be few and far between and to involve major, substantive issues relating to either or both mitigation and adaptation. In other words, it is anticipated that the expert advisory council will only embark upon a periodic review when it is concerned about some aspect of Government policy or the implementation of that policy, as it relates to climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_2059"> Accordingly, I believe that it is only right and proper that sufficient time is afforded the body politic to examine and analyse a periodic review report, including its formal submission to the Government, prior to its publication. There is no intention, or indeed provision, for the Government to seek to alter or amend the periodic review report: the timeframe in the Bill is merely to allow for full prior consideration of its contents before it is released into the public domain without adulteration.</p>
          <p eId="para_2060"> For these reasons, a ten-day deadline is simply not reasonable in terms of what is required. However, my amendment No. 148 proposes shortening the timeframe to not more than 30 days in the interests of timely public debate, while still allowing adequate time for the report to be noted by Government prior to publication. In terms of consistency, the amendment would also put the publication timeframe on a par with that in respect of the publication of the expert advisory council’s annual reports.</p>

          <p eId="para_2075">This is about guidance to the advisory council. There was some misunderstanding on Committee Stage about the amendment. The Minister understood it to suggest that the advisory council could be interfered with by him, whereas the purpose of the amendment is quite specific, namely, to stop any potential interference by the Minister. It is very clearly stated that the Minister may not give the advisory council guidance as to the content of any advice or report. That is taken verbatim from the Scottish Act of 2009 and its function is to ensure the independence of the functions of the advisory council from ministerial interference, which we spoke about earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_2076"> On one level it is interesting that the Minister joked about the matter on Committee Stage and said that he might like to interfere with the council, which gives us great confidence that we are correct to move the amendment now.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2082">

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2087">(5) The report under this section shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas no later than 31 October in the second year after the target year.".</p>
          <p eId="para_2088">We are seeking to have inserted a requirement for reports on annual targets. The amendment requires that the Minister shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report in respect of each year in the period 2015-2050 for which an annual target has been set. The report shall state whether the annual target for the target year has been met. If the annual target has not been met, the report shall explain the reason for same. The report shall also state whether the domestic effort target has been met in the target year to which the report relates. If the domestic effort target has not been met, the report shall explain the reason for same. The report shall also contain the information mentioned in section 17. Finally, the report under this section shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas no later than 31 October in the second year after the target year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2089"> The detailed guidelines for reports on annual targets also come from the Scottish climate change Act of 2009. The amendments are fairly self-explanatory. They set out the details of the reports that would be carried out if we had national emissions reduction targets. Apart from the fact that it has ambitious targets, what is interesting about the Scottish Act is that it has copious detail as to how its advisory group would operate, the work it would do and the contents of the reports it would compile. There are chapters on the duties of public bodies relating to climate change mitigation, adaptation programmes, land use, forestry, energy efficiency, waste reduction and recycling. In effect, what Scotland did was write the framework for the mitigation plan into law as part of its climate legislation. This begs the question as to why we are here, six years later, discussing a Bill that has no targets and no details of any plan and specifies that the plan, whatever it consists of, does not have to exist for another two years after this Bill comes into force. By the time we have monitored our progress on our first mitigation plan the EU will be knocking on the door telling us to pay up for non-compliance. </p>
          <p eId="para_2090"> We need joined-up thinking on the issue and we need to start taking action as soon as is humanly possible. Never has an issue hammered home the idea that everything is connected so powerfully as climate change and yet here we are shirking our responsibilities to the wider world. Anyone who has read <i>This Changes Everything</i> by Naomi Klein will see how this connectivity is very important because everything is connected. It relates to many areas of how we organise society and the planet. </p>
          <p eId="para_2091"> We are near the end of the debate on this Bill. It is not going to be the Bill we would like to have because it leaves much to be desired. One of these days a group of politicians in government will wake up and see that things need to be different. We do not suffer from severe flooding and do not get huge hurricanes or droughts but the truth of the matter is that many parts of the world do and, sadly, we are not playing our part to change that. We seem to be walking with our eyes closed. We do not even seem to have an appetite for doing anything about it and it is very frustrating for anyone who takes a long-term vision of where we are in the world today.</p>

          <p eId="para_2092">This is the last batch of amendments on what should have been an historic item of legislation for Irish society but which is, unfortunately, a bitter disappointment. We are launching a last-ditch effort to make it a bit better than it is and all of these amendments are designed to work with legislation, such as the Scottish Act on which we based many of them. That would have brought about real commitments to nationally binding emissions targets. The Minister has repeatedly stated over the past day and a half that we do not need to have this at all and it is a complete and utter irrelevancy as we are all right - we are covered by our legislation because European targets already bind us. However, we are already not going to meet those targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_2093"> The Minister's faith in the EU and UN for setting targets is misguided. The 2030 agreements are widely considered to be a climbdown that will make keeping us within the threshold of between 2° and 3° very difficult, if not impossible. There are already reports that the COP21 Paris talks are being infiltrated by dirty energy lobbying groups which have done their best to undermine international agreements. At the COP19 Warsaw meeting, oil and gas companies, which are obviously key players in causing climate change, actually sponsored some of the talks while the President in Poland co-organised a counter-summit with the coal industry. The UN has itself proactively worked to bring business, including fossil fuel industries, into the talks and these big businesses have done all they can to block progress, from undermining the science to proposing pie-in-the-sky technological fixes or straightforward public relations spins such as the idea of clean coal. Everything is being done to ensure they keep profiting regardless of the consequences for the climate. It is true that some of the more far-sighted administrators of capitalism, such as those who spoke at the banking meetings, have seen that this is damaging and destructive to everybody but lobbying is interfering with what people are trying to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_2094"><i> The Irish Times</i> reported recently on a challenge by An Taisce over a planning approval for a €65 million road-widening scheme on the N86 between Tralee and Dingle. Its core argument was that an environmental impact study should have been carried out on the project. There was also a report that found that cuts to bus services would leave areas without any bus services at all. We are building roads without any consideration of the environmental impact while cutting bus services and failing to properly invest in rail. The NRA is allowed to do whatever it likes, whatever the consequences in terms of transport emissions, and we are continuing to give corporate welfare subsidies in the form of oil and gas fields as a present to fossil fuel companies. We have to see the Bill in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_2095"> We are saying we are going to do things, in a waffly way and without much content, but in reality the Government policy is to do the opposite. An indictment of this is our attitude to public transport, which is completely regrettable. We undermine rail transport and the delivery of metro lite all around the garden to the airport will not get us back on track in that area. We have not had any serious rail delivery nor have we had wave energy, offshore wind farms or geothermal stations, all of which we need if we are to seriously address climate change. Not only do we need the political will to invest in renewable energy as a core part of Ireland's public infrastructure, it is also critical to our collective survival on earth. We need the political establishment to stand up a bit more to the fossil fuel giants that are happily burning away, regardless of the consequences to ourselves or future generations just as long as profits can be made. This is all indicative of why we need emission reduction targets. It is not just because we cannot trust the international process, which is currently being undermined by lobbyists. The neoliberal policies implemented by this Government are having a negative impact and binding national targets which are independently assessed on a regular basis are the only hope we have of forcing the arm of the parties that comprise the Government and that support policies of austerity to ensure they give a damn about issues that go beyond one election term to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_2096"> We need nationally binding targets but we also need to look beyond that to what we do next. This Government, like its predecessor, has been incredibly subservient to the unelected powers in Brussels and Frankfurt, enthusiastically embracing neoliberalism, privatisation, undermining public transport and so on. All these issues contribute to climate change. We, therefore, need more than targets - we need a new type of politics in Ireland, which has the foresight to put the good of society as the first benchmark rather than the profits of those who proclaim the benefits of the free market. What free market, private individual will spend money on smart grids, light rail, citywide composting systems, building retrofits, visionary transit systems, and urban redesigns to stop us from spending half or our lives in traffic jams? Private industry will not deliver the type of infrastructure that is necessary if we are to tackle climate change. Ms Naomi Klein stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2097">The private sector is ill-suited to taking on most of these large infrastructure investments. If the services are to be accessible, which they must be in order to be effective, the profit margins that attract private players simply aren’t there.</p>
          <p eId="para_2098">She gave examples from Paris where air pollution meant that the city banned cars for a day and so on. We should have a free public transport system in reality to encourage people out of their cars. The Government is doing the opposite. The cost of transport has increased by more than 60% in the past five years, services are being cut, the rural train system of almost a century ago has been utterly decimated and initiatives that were put forward in the public good have been consumed by for-profit businesses. That is damaging for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_2099"> These amendments are important in salvaging something from the Bill. The Government has allowed Ireland to be used as a laboratory in some ways whereby it is experimenting with treating the population as a national resource to be mined for cash, with wealth transferred from the many to the few and this just cannot go on. Neoliberalism cannot tackle climate change. We need a new way of doing things.</p>

          <p eId="para_2100">I have no doubt that Ireland will very much play its part in tackling climate change. It must be acknowledged that this is historic legislation, as this is the first ever Bill to deal with climate change. I am glad I am part of a Government that has delivered on its commitment to introduced such legislation. I am sure all sectors in the State will rise to the challenge and the national mitigation plan will be the vehicle for the delivery of progress in this area, utilising innovation, alternative energy, new technologies and new work practices. It is only by deeply engaging with the sectors and the stakeholders that we will achieve sustainable progress through this plan, about which I am confident.</p>
          <p eId="para_2101"> The proposed amendments provide for the Minister to lay a range of reports in respect of domestic mitigation targets before the Houses of the Oireachtas. As I outlined in the debate, we do not accept the validity of establishing domestic mitigation targets, which are divorced from EU processes. It is on that basis I cannot support the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_2102">I just want to add a few thoughts that come to mind, having listened to the contributions. It is just not good enough for a Government as strong as this to introduce legislation as weak as this. It is only creating an appearance; it is an illusion; a mirage. The legislation needs teeth and the teeth that have been offered in the amendments by Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly are calibrated and they demonstrate a measurable intent to do something. They are not just wishful thinking or aspirational; they are calibrated. Scotland has given us a working example of how this works. Just because the EU has delivered watered down versions as a result of strong lobbying in these areas does not mean that we should accept proportional watering down. If anything, we should add a little concentrate to this because, as previous speakers said, everything is joined up. It is not only about the physics of the realities around us that apply; the financial obligations of the State and of companies to the people are related and, therefore, they need to be defined, clear and reasonable. That is what is proposed. What are the Government parties afraid of? They should not be afraid.</p>
          <p eId="para_2103"> In a few months, if not earlier, the Government parties will seek to secure a concrete number of seats. They will aim at seats and they will not adopt a wishy, washy attitude of, "We'll do our best". They will number crunch and they will give all their supporters targets. They will make orders for poster, billboards and so on, which will be costed. Yet, they are afraid to do this in this regard for the people, which is extraordinary.</p>

          <p eId="para_2114">Deputy Mathews has emphasised the lack of joined-up thinking and he has made a good point.</p>
          <p eId="para_2115"> In February this year, the European Commission launched its draft country report, Ireland 2015, which said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2116">Ireland is not on track to reach its greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. No progress was made in identifying how Ireland commits itself to meeting its existing binding climate and energy targets for the period up to 2020 in an integrated way and how best to use the earmarked available EU support for the structural development needed in the different areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_2117">The Commission is even insinuating that Ireland is missing out on funding because the Government has failed to go in a certain direction and to take certain initiatives. It is pretty damning.</p>
          <p eId="para_2118"> An Taisce has been heavily involved in this area. Mr. Charles Stanley-Smith of the organisation's climate change committee said: "To be found to be not on track to meet the targets is damning enough but to be reported as not having an integrated way of making the huge improvements will be truly cataclysmic". The Government parties have omitted mandatory targets from the Bill. It is as if they do not want to know. The notion is that we have EU obligations and, therefore, we are fine but it is obvious that we are not given that we are not even meeting a target that was set in 2005 of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020. We are only coming up with approximately 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2119">It is glaringly obvious that we especially need targets. It is criminal that they are not included in this Bill.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_170"> further accepts that, as a consequence of lack of investment, bad planning, property speculation and incompetent governance, combined with successive ideologically similar Governments that have incentivised the private sector to increasingly deliver social housing needs, there is an unprecedented homelessness crisis;</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_237">— a review of the rent limits undertaken by the Department of Social Protection earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients; and</summary>

          <p eId="para_2122">I fully support this motion, which is very important. We have debated this issue in the House on a number of occasions in recent months, all in Private Members' time. That shows the importance the Government has placed on this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2123"> The most remarkable element to remember about this crisis, and it cannot be said often enough, is that it is a totally manufactured one. It has been manufactured through the Government's inaction in dealing with housing as an issue and its inaction in investing in our people and in the people who require support from us as a society. The lack of Government policy has directly caused it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2124"> All during the time when the Government slavishly followed the troika and the EU masters, it refused to have an investment programme. That has led to the current situation where 130,000 people are on the housing list, thousands of children are living in hotels and people are living on the streets across this city and country. That is due to the Government's inaction and refusal to do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2125"> In addition to that, we have a rent crisis. That also comes down to the Government's inaction, its failure to do anything to address it, its failure to introduce a system of rent controls or rent certainty for clients and its steadfast refusal to increase rent allowance limits because it does not want artificially to inflate the market, as it has said, but yet it is quite happy to see people becoming homeless because their landlords have racked up the rent and they can no longer afford to pay it. The Government is quite happy to pump money into the hotels around this city to house families while they are waiting for it to deal with the housing crisis that it has manufactured. It has not taken any action to address this issue and that is the problem. The plan the Minister announced in recent months, which will take years to initiate and which is all back-loaded in terms of funding, will not deal with the issues or the crisis. It is time the Minister got his finger out and did something; he needs to introduce rent certainty and deal with the crisis in hand.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2126">It is unbelievable to think that in 2015 the Simon Community would declare there to be, and use the terminology, "a humanitarian crisis in Ireland". If one heard that description in any other country, one would wonder what the hell was going on, were thousands of people dying or being imprisoned or tortured, but in a sense that is exactly what is going on. If one meets people on the housing list - people whose children and their children are living with their mothers in houses - people who are struggling, with the support of high rent allowance or no rent allowance, to pay the high rent charged by the landlord, one will see that they are close to the edge, on a knife-edge or blade-edge, of living in terrible conditions and then they could find themselves out on the street. That is how close it is. Somebody used the analogy that if a family is in the middle-income category in America, that family is close to being impoverished. The position in Ireland is that if one does not have a reasonable wage, if one cannot pay the rent or if one's landlord is overcharging, one is close to, and on, the edge. The Simon Community was correct in what it said - this is a humanitarian crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2127"> Any Deputy or councillor worth his or her salt speaks to the people who come into their constituency offices and those people may start to cry, may be distressed or, sometimes, they may be suicidal and all for what but the constitutional right to own a house, or have a house or live in a home. It is unacceptable and unimaginable that in 2015 the number of people on the housing list would climb. The Minister can speak about five years of a recession but we must remember that the five years prior to that Ireland was regarded as one of the richest countries in the world and one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. We are now at the stage where more than 100,000 of our citizens are homeless. It is a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_2128">I warmly welcome the debate and I will be strongly supporting the motion. What I want most to happen as a result of this debate is for action to be taken to address the housing crisis. For years we have seen under-investment in social housing. We also have seen the reality that 5,000 people State-wide are living in emergency accommodation, with an estimated 2,298 people living in emergency accommodation in Dublin, 1,275 of whom are children, and an estimated 80 plus families present to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive on a monthly basis. This is the reality of what is happening on the ground. We also have the situation of those who are homeless. The number of homeless people sleeping rough has doubled. The fourth aspect to this debate is the fact that families who are renting are being turfed out of the houses they are in because the landlords want to get them out or want to sell their houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_2129"> I ask the Minister to examine the proposals in this motion. He needs to review Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000, with a view to amending legislation temporally in order to provide social housing in a more timely manner. Second, he needs to increase the direct funding to local authorities to commence a long-term plan of social housing expansion. Third, he needs to provide the legislative framework for local authorities to be able to access Housing Finance Agency loans off balance sheet. These are very important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_2130"> Another important issue that is often ignored is the fact that Dublin is full of empty plots and sites. NAMA is creating a hyped up market in land. This excludes the developers or builders and rewards the speculators. A "use it or lose it" tax could be introduced to force the speculators to sell to the developers. Also, a tax on land hoarding would bring down the price of land. Those are some proposals in this area, and the Minister should have a look at them and get on with the job.</p>

          <p eId="para_2131">The real tragedy of this emergency is that it was perfectly predictable. The families who I have been meeting for the past two to three years, and not two to three months, have been struggling to find accommodation within the rent caps, which were way below market rents. They are no different from other families. They all find it impossible to comprehend that homelessness is something that can happen to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2132"> The crisis has presented even further challenges to charities, which are trying to provide services for homeless people with more complex challenges. They should not be entities that are criticised. The problem is that we are back to making quick-fix solutions. The one statistic that keeps cropping up is that there is a huge need for housing units to meet the needs of single people or couples, and at the same time there is a huge under-use of buildings that could be brought into use. Initiatives on the fiscal side could potentially deliver some of that accommodation quickly and free up larger accommodation for families. The financial contribution scheme, for example, was very popular in the Dublin city area and if that was replicated around the country, it would provide accommodation for older people, which would have the effect of freeing up houses for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_2133"> While there is nothing wrong with modular or system-built housing, it needs a two-staged approach. For example, if accommodation is built near universities, it can then become student accommodation over time and it has a longer lifespan. It does not mean that it is permanent accommodation for the people who are temporarily accommodated in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2134"> Another issue is that the housing assistance payment scheme will cause serious administrative problems for local authorities, but that has not even been thought about.</p>

          <p eId="para_2135">I welcome the debate and generally support the motion put forward by Sinn Féin. The current crisis in social housing provision is as a direct result of this and the previous Government's policy of effective privatisation of the sector, whereby responsibility for the provision of housing for those in need of social housing has been transferred to the private sector to private landlords and subsided by the State. I am dismayed and angry at the Government's response. It is the same response we have seen for the past six or eight months. It is like the child who has his or her finger stuck dyke trying to stop the water coming through. The housing crisis is continuing to get worse. We know the figures involved - 5,000 people Statewide are living in emergency accommodation and an estimated 2,298 people are living in emergency accommodation in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_2136">Of these, 1,275 are children. There are up to 130,000 people on the housing waiting lists. Families are couch-surfing or sleeping in cars or, in the case of one family, sleeping in the Phoenix Park. Yet in the first quarter of 2015, only 20 social housing units have been built and 187 voluntary housing units provided. That is not dealing with the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2137"> The regulation of the private rental sector should include enhanced security of tenure. The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 only provides for four years for security of tenure. That should be raised to at least a minimum of ten years, possibly even 15 years. That can be dealt with in one Bill either tomorrow or next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_2138"> It is also important to address the right of a landlord to terminate a tenancy on the basis that the property is to be sold. More families affected by this provision are attending our clinics every week. It should be changed to simply give a right to a landlord, or to a bank which has repossessed rental accommodation, to sell the property with the tenant <i>in situ</i>. This would not cost the Government any money and could be dealt with in legislation immediately. The rent cap should be introduced for a minimum of two to three years, if the Government is not willing to go all the way with it. The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has rightly called this a humanitarian crisis. It should be described as a national emergency. The Government should request the European Commission to allow it provide the moneys needed to deal with this humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_2140">We have a serious housing problem. The root cause is simple, namely the lack of housing supply. We are dealing with it through the Housing Strategy 2020. When we emerged from the troika shackles and were first in a position to do so, we set out an ambitious housing strategy, costed at over €3.8 billion. We have begun to build social housing units again. In Fingal County Council, local authority houses are again being built in Balbriggan, Balrothery, Lusk, Swords and Ballyboughal. The number of void units in Fingal has been reduced from 201 in December 2013 to 28 as a result of Government funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_2141"> Some local authorities still have a problem with voids, however, which is unacceptable. The planning process and building of homes does not happen overnight. The lag between the announcement of funding and turning the key means we need other emergency measures. The private rental market, as well as rent supplement, still has a role to play in solving this crisis. There are calls from some in opposition and the non-governmental organisation, NGO, sector to raise the rent supplement threshold across the board. I do not believe, however, this would solve the problem as it would serve to further inflate the rental market.</p>
          <p eId="para_2142"> The statutory discretionary power of community welfare officers to set an agreed rent over and above the rent supplement limit is an important tool in tackling the threat of homelessness resulting from rent increases. Community welfare officers are using this discretion in Fingal when they can and it is helping to keep people in their homes. It must be expanded to all areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_2143"> The real tool we need to combat extortionate rent increases is rent certainty. This was a recommendation made by my colleagues and I on the Labour Party’s housing committee. It needs to be brought in urgently as it has been talked about for far too long. It is immoral for a landlord to hike up rent without having to compare it to another measure such as the consumer price index. The scandalous discrimination by landlords against rent supplement tenancy applicants will be outlawed by the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin.</p>
          <p eId="para_2144"> I see the housing crisis at first hand in my constituency clinics and it must be given the urgency it deserves. I have confidence that with Labour in government we can and will solve this problem. We need a strong, sensible and multifaceted approach. What we do not need is what we have seen from Sinn Féin at local level. Its councillors supported a full 15% reduction in the local property tax in Fingal County Council and other areas to the detriment of housing and homelessness budgets. Neither do we need what we had in Fingal and other areas when councillors from People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance voted against the provision of social housing in Balrothery and Balbriggan. Nor do we need anti-tax socialists crying crocodile tears about the housing crisis and then refusing to take responsibility to help when the opportunity presents itself. We need every stakeholder and organisation, be they political party or approved housing agency, to pull together to deliver solutions. Government funding is not a problem in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_2145">Undoubtedly, as the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, said, we are in the middle of a perfect storm regarding housing. It is distressing and heart-breaking when one meets constituents, neighbours, friends and past pupils caught up in dire straits with housing problems. Thankfully, however, we have a housing strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2146"> It amused me to hear Deputy Barry Cowen and his colleagues opposite shedding crocodile tears about housing when his party, Fianna Fáil, presided over a debacle of social housing policy when it was in power for over a decade. It has no credibility whatsoever in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_2147"> What we must see is the implementation of the housing strategy put forward by the Government. When one takes the capital plan announced yesterday and the €2.2 billion already put forward, up to €3.1 billion will be provided for housing policy. However, where has the money for social housing gone over the past decade? Will the Minister provide a breakdown?</p>
          <p eId="para_2148"> We need to see the resources in place and shovel-ready projects approved and fast-tracked. It requires local government and those with vested interests to come together to ensure we put in place a social housing strategy. We have seen an increase in funding for the homeless budget. I commend those who work in the area of homelessness as their work sometimes gets brushed aside by those who do not understand what they do, particularly in Cork city.</p>
          <p eId="para_2149"> I call on Cork City and Cork County Councils to use the millions of euro given to them to fund the provision of social housing. From information I have obtained from parliamentary questions and other sources, allocated moneys for social housing have not been spent in Cork city which Deputy Jonathan O’Brien and I represent.</p>

          <p eId="para_2151">The reason it has not been spent must be answered by the councils. As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien knows - we worked together quite closely when on the city council - there is a need for a joined-up approach between the local authority and central government. Up to €5 million has been allocated to the councils in Cork to support the return of vacant social housing units for use. However, only a fraction of that money has been drawn down. It beggars belief as to why that money has not been drawn down. In 2015, Cork County Council was allocated funding for 71 units and Cork City Council for 122 units. In real terms, that is €3.6 million but not one claim for a drawdown has been processed by the city. That does not make sense to me. Despite this, the councils have got 41 houses back into use, a development which I commend. Cork County Council has got €1.4 million, with a drawdown claim of over 30 units which the Department is processing. Given the demand for and the shortage of housing in Cork city and county, I hope the Minister will expedite this drawdown. I hope the city of Cork is not unique in the allocation of funding not being drawn down.</p>

          <p eId="para_2152">The Acting Chairman is aware of the situation we have in Kildare. The Opposition spoke about finding quick-fix solutions to this problem but there are none. This has been a long-term problem, which started back in 2000 when Fianna Fáil introduced the provision of 20% social and affordable housing in the Planning and Development Act. No houses were delivered under that provision because of High Court cases taken by Fianna Fáil’s friends, the builders and developers. Since the crash, no houses have been delivered under the 20% rule. It is amusing then to hear tonight that Fianna Fáil is looking to bring the provision back, so as to assist its builder and developer friends. Last Friday in Kildare, it was amusing to see among the crowd at a function for a Fianna Fáil councillor, a large contingent of builders. They felt they were back in town again because Fianna Fáil feels it is coming back into power. I can tell Deputy Barry Cowen that there is no way I will let the 20% social and affordable housing rule ruin the social housing structure and fabric again.</p>
          <p eId="para_2153">We, therefore, have a situation in Kildare where not one house is currently being built by the local authority even though the money is available. The authority is not ready because it expected the 20% provision for social and affordable housing to be delivered, but this has not happened. That is the reason I was delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, reduced the requirement to 10%.</p>

          <p eId="para_2160">I would have advocated for 0% but I accept the fact we had to do something. I applaud the fact the Minister of State allowed local authorities to purchase, long-term lease or build houses. The sad fact is that in Kildare no social housing is being built at the moment; it is being purchased. When local authorities are purchasing houses, it makes it difficult for people with families and first-time buyers to buy them. They are in competition with the local authority. I plead with the Minister of State to write to the local authorities and get them to put Part VIII schemes in place on whatever lands they have as quickly as possible so that social housing is on stream.</p>
          <p eId="para_2161"> I also find it extremely difficult to understand the turnaround of houses which have been left vacant. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, will know the housing estate in Derrinturn where there has been three boarded-up houses for the past six months. The local authorities have not moved quick enough. It takes only four weeks to turn around a house in a situation such as that one.</p>

Will the Minister of State to take on board those matters regarding local authorities? The Government has stepped up to the mark and provided funding.

          <p eId="para_2165">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. As we all know, every Member accepts that there is an emergency social housing crisis, which is the result of years of underinvestment. We know that one of the principal ways to address this crisis is to commence immediately a major social housing building programme, but the main reason this has not happened is quite obvious. Five years ago this economy was bust and borrowing money at an unaffordable rate of 15%. Admittedly, during the boom years, the previous Government could and should have done more to deal with this developing crisis but that did not happen. As a result of this Government's goals and management of the economy, as a nation we can borrow money at a rate of just 1%. This is the reason this Government is able to initiate a new building programme. For the past two years, the Department has begun to find new projects through local authorities and voluntary housing associations. It has also introduced the housing assistance payment scheme, which is far less cumbersome and more effective than the rent allowance scheme. This Government is working hard to develop a rent certainty scheme, which must be constitutional first, as well as being fair to the tenant and the landlord. We need all sectors working together to solve this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_2166"> We have a huge opportunity to regenerate our smaller towns and villages. There are 130 ghost estates in Cork. I am sure the people of Cork would be delighted if it was possible to work with the local authorities to get those estates viable and ready for families and homeless people as soon as possible by assisting the local authorities purchase and refurbish these houses. This Government has begun the process. The current improving state of the economy will ensure that progress can and will be successful over the medium to long term. I welcome the announcement yesterday of the €3 billion capital programme. Short-term solutions must be found for the homeless and families who through no fault of their own are about to lose their homes. To be really successful in dealing with the housing crisis, we need both the private and public sectors working together. Many houses are needed not just for people who require social housing but also for families willing to rent or buy houses. A long-term strategic view is the only way to solve this problem.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2167">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I wish to deal with a specific area, which is homelessness and people with serious mental health issues. Our mental health is as important as our physical health and it is essential for Ireland's economic and social recovery. Whether personally or through family, friends or colleagues, everyone is likely to be affected by mental health difficulties at some point in their lives. The next Government must ensure people with mental health difficulties can be assessed for and have access to appropriate social housing with tenancy sustainment services in order to support their recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_2168"> Between October 2012 and September 2013, every nine and a half days someone was discharged into homelessness from the Tallaght mental health service. According to the Housing Agency, nationally 1,034 people with a mental health disability were on the housing lists nationally in 2013. Those are the latest figures I could obtain. Having a home is essential to maintaining one's mental health. People using the mental health services should have access to appropriate social housing, if required, to support their recovery. It is unfair and wrong that people, having been treated, are being discharged from mental health services into homelessness. We must ensure there is an adequate supply of social housing places for people with a mental health disability in order to prevent homelessness and unnecessary long stays in hospital. This may require allocating a number of new social housing units to people with a mental health disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_2169"> We must fund sustainable support for people with a mental health difficulty so that they can maintain their tenure, which will prevent homelessness. We must ensure that rent supplement and the housing assistance payment is provided at a level that reflects the real cost of rental accommodation so that people with a mental health disability can have security of tenure. We know the difficulties people with a mental illness already have in obtaining housing under a tenancy due to the stigma surrounding mental health, although this is a debate for another day. The combination of official rent contribution increases and tight rent limits means that individuals in competitive rental markets such as Dublin are increasingly at the risk of homelessness. For those with a mental health disability living in rented accommodation, the insecurity of tenure can lead to a deterioration in their mental health as can homelessness itself. </p>
          <p eId="para_2170"> There is a higher prevalence of mental health illness among homeless people than there is in the general population. They are also more likely to be alcoholics and suffer from drug dependency. Some 20% to 25% of homeless people, compared to 6% of non-homeless people, have a severe mental illness. Others estimate that up to one third of homeless people suffer from mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_2171"> Studies have found that there is a correlation between homelessness and incarceration in prison. Those with a mental health illness or substance abuse problems are found to be incarcerated at a higher frequency than the general population. Yesterday, I attended and was involved in the launch of a project to look at the level of mental illness in our prison population and young people. A high proportion of our prison population has a mental health challenge. Some 65% of people in prison have a mental health challenge and a further 35% have an intellectual disability. It is unclear how many people within the prison population have both a mental health challenge and an intellectual disability. This is an area that is rarely debated in relation to homelessness but a very serious one none the less. The project, which is based mainly in Ireland and is supported by Trinity College, Dublin and internationally, was launched in the European Parliament yesterday. It is important that this research is supported. We hope the project gets the required support and funding, both nationally and within Europe. At the launch yesterday, there were people from the United States, Germany and Italy who are supporting this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_2172"> We are still dealing with homelessness today.</p>
          <p eId="para_2173">It is probably ten years since I raised the issue of people being discharged from mental hospitals and institutions onto the streets. It has not changed but is still happening. A large proportion of people who are homeless have a mental illness. This debate is about homelessness and we appreciate its importance, but there is another issue that is marginalised, when it should not be, in respect of homelessness and people with a mental health issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2174">I am grateful to Sinn Féin for bringing this issue before the House in this format because it gives us a greater opportunity to look again at the housing issue and the origins of the problems we face at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_2175"> This crisis, and it is a crisis, does not have its origins in the last three and a half or four years, or even in the last ten years. Its origins are in bad planning in the last 20 years. A decision was taken 20 years ago to phase out local authority house building as a project and to shift it instead to voluntary agencies. Voluntary agencies do a great job in general. In particular, they look after special housing needs and sheltered housing better than anybody else and much better than local authorities can. Of course, this was a great opportunity for the Government of the day, which will remain nameless, to wash its hands of responsibility and to hand it over to the private rental market. There was no housing policy, no plan and no provision for the future. All that was done from time to time was a count of the number of people on the various housing lists. They were then counted again, after which people said there were a few things wrong with the application forms and some of the people should be struck off because they were not really in need of a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_2176"> In the meantime it became more obvious that the Department of Social Protection was supposed to fill the housing void and provide the funding over a prolonged period to pay for the houses that the applicants for local authority houses required. Housing policy was handed over to the Department of Social Protection, much to the annoyance of that Department and the various Ministers in the intervening period. It was an appalling disaster and we are now reaping the whirlwind.</p>
          <p eId="para_2177"> Some Members of this House have said in the last couple of weeks that this is a crisis which has only become obvious now and that the Government should have done something about it. Four and a half years ago was way too late to have done something about it, and if any Member of the House thinks that a problem of this nature can be resolved in six weeks, six months or six years for that matter, they are wrong. It requires emergency measures in the first instance and a long-term plan. In fairness to the Government, it has introduced a plan. It might not be sufficient to meet the requirements that are now envisaged by the Opposition, but it was introduced by the Government. Nothing had been done previously. Previously, the issue was postponed from next week to next year to thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_2178"> The problem now is that there is an urgent need to deal with the immediate emerging problem of homelessness, which is caused by a shortage of supply. That is strange when one considers that we had a housing boom just a few years ago and Members of this House were talking about demolishing houses all over the country, saying bulldozers should be used and so forth - so much for that plan and for their insight into the future. The Government's policy is correct. We need emergency housing in the first instance and we need it quickly. We must recognise that people cannot exist without a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_2179"> The last point I wish to make is important. I have listened to people over a number of years expound the theory that Irish people have a predilection towards ownership of their houses which they should not have. We have all heard this debated many times. Why should they not have it? We have a right to own our houses. In particular, it is important that the householder has an opportunity to pay his own mortgage as opposed to the landlord's mortgage. I do not see the merit in paying somebody else's mortgage if it costs the same to pay one's own.</p>
          <p eId="para_2180"> There is another issue, which we have inherited from our history. We have a feeling that we should own our own house. That is built into every person in this country. It has a benefit. The benefit is that the person has an investment, something they wish to retain, improve and work for. They have an incentive to do what they wish to do for themselves and to provide for themselves, and they will do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2181"> Another point I wish to raise has also been raised by other Members. Where have the local authority loans gone? Every effort was made to squeeze them out of the system, and that has succeeded to a great extent. It is virtually impossible to qualify for a local authority loan. The nonsense that takes place to assess a person is laughable. For a ten year period it was made impossible for people in that income bracket to qualify for a loan and they were squeezed out of the market. As they were squeezed out of the market, they became more vulnerable. We should look again at the local authority loans fund with a view to ensuring that it is re-opened.</p>
          <p eId="para_2182"> Finally, under the 1966 Act the local authorities have a function in respect of housing. They have a two-pronged system whereby they build houses with the support of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or they offer loans to people who wish to build their own house. An earlier speaker already referred to the possibility of private sites. This was very successful in many schemes throughout the country. There was great work where people in the relevant income bracket built their own homes. They simply had to qualify under the local authority guidelines and they were able to build their own house on a serviced site. It was an excellent provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_2183"> All of those things happened in the recent past. They were all well capable of being resolved satisfactorily. If they had been addressed, planned for and if provision had been made for them, we would not be in the current position. There would have been an adequate number of houses. A local authority, such as the one of which I was previously a member, must provide 800 houses per annum, either by loan or by direct build. That is the way it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_2184">I welcome the opportunity to speak on an issue that affects all constituencies. It is not just an urban issue, but affects every town and village in the country. People want to hear about possible solutions as well as a plan for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_2185"> I have mentioned something in the House on a number of occasions and I urge the Minister to examine it. In the city of Dublin, within walking distance of this Chamber, there is a university with approximately 16,500 students. I do not have a copy of the register of electors for Nassau Street, Molesworth Street, Kildare Street, Grafton Street and O'Connell Street, but I presume very few people live in those streets now compared to the number that lived there 40 or 50 years ago. If we have building stock in urban, town and village areas that is vacant, is there something we can do to incentivise the people who own these properties to put them to use for people who need to be housed? Of course, there is. As I have said previously, it can be done through an examination of the system of commercial rates and the incentivisation of people to upgrade their existing facilities and convert them into units in which people could be housed comfortably and safely in a modern facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_2186"> There is no need to go 15 and 20 miles from the heart of a large urban centre such as Dublin, Limerick, Cork or Galway to try and solve this problem. Around the world large urban centres such as Amsterdam and Paris are living cities. We have cities in which nobody lives. There are thousands of empty units throughout Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, but no plan to address that. At the same time, Dublin City Council, for example, is reducing the local property tax by 15%, costing approximately €11 million. That €11 million will be taken directly out of services. South Dublin County Council will take out €5 million. One could house a large number of people with those amounts. The Government will take its share of responsibility but county and city councils throughout the country do not have Part 8 provisions ready, do not have sites ready, have not sought planning permission and have no idea where they would put houses if they won the lotto, for want of a better word, and received all of the money they required tomorrow morning. They have no plans in place. The reason is, as Deputy Durkan said, that this problem has been sat on for a generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2187"> The Minister and other Deputies will be aware that not a single rural house has been built by local authorities for probably more than a decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_2188">It is said there is no housing problem outside the 50 km/h speed limit zones in parts of this country, which, of course, is not the case. There are sons and daughters of farmers in smallholdings in the west and south who simply cannot afford to build a house. As Deputy Durkan said, they bring a site to the table. In previous years, the local authority would have financed the construction of a house but those people are now on the same housing list as tens of thousands of others because they cannot access loans because the conditions attaching are so onerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_2189"> There are things that can be done, although I am not for one minute saying there is a panacea. There are problems in regard to housing repairs for elderly people and the situation relating to voids is scandalous. No wonder this is the case if there is a city council that can take €11 million from its budget because it says it does not need it while at the same time it has hundreds - if not thousands - of units that need to be upgraded in order to be let. There is a question of morality. If a local authority such as Dublin City Council can afford to take €11 million from its budget while having thousands of people on its housing waiting lists, then the councillors who voted for this need to take a look at themselves and ask if this is the appropriate use of resources. I do not believe it is. They should have taken that €11 million and, within four weeks, tried to find how many of those void units could house families.</p>
          <p eId="para_2190"> We have all experienced this issue as public representatives. A huge number of people are offered local authority houses and refuse them. They have no choice but to the refuse them because, in many cases, the houses are in areas that are blighted by antisocial behaviour. Local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have failed tenants in those local authority housing estates for years by not looking after them. If we are going to have a discussion in regard to local authority housing and social housing, we need to include the existing tenants who, in many cases, have been abandoned by local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_2191"> As Deputy Durkan said, what we need is a long-term plan. We do not need falsities and pipedreams. We need a short-term programme in the context of modular housing and emergency accommodation. However, as Deputy McDonald will know, NAMA offered 5,753 properties to local authorities and only 1,068 of them were taken up, which shows there is a deep-rooted problem in local authorities when it comes to the housing crisis. It is not just the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_2193">I listened to the debate earlier and it is very clear who is to blame. It is every single local authority in the State, it is every single county manager and city manager and it is the councillors who sit there. The Government has provided everything but, somehow, all of these local authorities have colluded to make sure that no houses are built and no houses which are currently not fit for purpose are being repaired. For some reason, they have done all of that with the support of local authority members. It is simply unbelievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_2194"> I would agree with one aspect - and one aspect only - of what I have heard in the last while from the Government spokespersons, namely, there is no quick-fix solution to this crisis. This crisis will take time to resolve. However, there are things that can be done immediately that will help to solve the situation we are in. We have heard from the Government backbenchers about there being no quick-fix solutions. It is as if they came to office just yesterday when they are in their fifth year of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_2195"> This is a crisis that did not happen overnight. We did not all wake up one morning and find there were thousands of people homeless and hundreds living on our streets. It did not happen overnight. It was pointed out time and again by agencies and by people working at the coal face in dealing with these issues that this was going to happen. At budget time every year, when I talk about those who are homeless, I have stated that the budget measures the Government has brought in will make the situation worse. It is very clear that the policy of this Government is to accept the fact of homelessness. It cannot cut capital spending in the way it has done and pretend there would be no homeless crisis. The Government parties went into this with their eyes wide open.</p>
          <p eId="para_2196"> The Government talks about a six-year plan of €3.8 billion to try to resolve some of this problem, although it will only house a third of those who are currently on the waiting list. I recall one of the first decisions the Government made when it entered office. It was made on 31 March 2011 - the Government did not need a six-year plan then. It was on just one day that it handed over €3.1 billion to the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank, to the poor craters who invested in the broken bank and got paid 100% by the Government. Yet, the Government cannot scrounge up enough money to deal with the crisis that has been happening on its watch for the past number of years and prior to its entry into office. The fact is that the Government has been tolerating homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_2197"> There are things that the Government can do. As finance spokesperson, I see it all the time in terms of how the Government has bowed down to the banks, how it has allowed the banks to evict people from their houses time and again and how it has weakened the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. In recent weeks the Supreme Court ruled that it need only take one part of that code of conduct into account when dealing with repossessions, that is, the fact that there cannot be repossessions within the moratorium period. When I brought forward legislation in this House to put the code of conduct on a statutory basis, however, the Government said it was not needed because the code was sufficiently robust. Again, Sinn Féin has been proven correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_2198"> The homelessness crisis and the housing crisis can be ended. However, politics is all about choices. In the last budget the Government decided to put more money into the pockets of the wealthiest people. At the same time, some Government Deputies, when they come to Dublin, spend the night in hotels where families are now being accommodated. They are aware of the pain and the suffering this is causing those families, and some Members have told very humane stories about how it affects children and will affect children well past the time when all of us have left this Chamber in years to come. It is scandalous that they cannot find within themselves the means to declare this a national emergency. When it is declared a national emergency, we can do different things. We can make sure the funding is found; we can make sure that the NAMA properties are used.</p>
          <p eId="para_2199"> This is the despicable thing. The State owns thousands of houses right across the country but, as the Taoiseach has said, NAMA is there to make a profit. Of course NAMA is there to make a profit; that is why it was set up. However, we can change the law under which NAMA is governed if we so wish and if we desire to end this crisis. Instead of selling those houses to speculators, we can decide to take them into our ownership and provide them for social housing and the needs of the homeless.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_785">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2200">One hundred and thirty thousand citizens across this State are in need of a home, representing an alarming increase of 40,000 from four years ago. That is the Government record. It is estimated there are now 5,000 people, including over 1,000 children, homeless and living in emergency accommodation in this country. Focus Ireland is reporting that homelessness in Ireland has increased by a staggering 76% since January. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Dublin Simon Community recently referred to this horrendous situation as a "humanitarian crisis".</p>
          <p eId="para_2201"> This is not an issue that is exclusive to Dublin, however; it is a national emergency. My constituency office is visited every day by people who are at their wits' end waiting to be housed. Some of these people have been on housing waiting lists for years and they are clearly at breaking point. It was recently revealed that there are 28 vacant council houses available in my home county of Monaghan. It beggars belief and defies logic that these houses are lying idle when there are over 1,300 applicants - individuals and families - on housing waiting lists across the county. In the neighbouring county at the other end of the constituency, County Cavan, there are 68 vacant council houses and approximately 1,146 applicants on the waiting list for social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_2202">In that county, there has been a decrease of €148,467 in the provision for refurbishment funding from 2014 to the current year, 2015. People are on their knees, but it is clear the Government is blind to the reality facing so many vulnerable individuals and families. All we hear time and again is talk of the so-called “recovery” and “stability”, but the reality is that many of Ireland’s families are not feeling any recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_2203"> The Government's housing policy thus far has been nothing short of abysmal. Social housing provision has been grossly neglected, with years of little or no investment. A vigorous social housing construction programme must be a priority. Spiralling rent costs must also be tackled. For families on rent allowance or those on low incomes, it is simply not possible to meet the demand of increasing rents. Therefore, we are calling for an immediate increase in rent supplement and the housing assistance payment. Similarly, legislation is also needed to protect tenants in the private rental sector to ensure they have greater rent certainty and increased security of tenure.</p>
          <p eId="para_2204"> People are on their knees and it is imperative that this crisis is dealt with effectively and as speedily as possible. Urgent and adequate action is needed to address the issue to ensure there is housing for all who need it. People have a right to housing, to somewhere they can call "home". Sinn Féin has outlined a number of additional measures geared towards tackling this national emergency which would be more properly referred to as a national disgrace. In the interests of all those currently homeless or in danger of losing their homes, we hope all parties in the Dáil will support our motion. Accordingly, I ask the Minister of State to consider withdrawing the Government amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_786">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2205">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ellis a chur an rún seo os comhair na Dála ar an ócáid seo. Tá sé rí-thábhachtach go bhfuil muid ag plé an rúin seo, ach is trua go gcaithimid é a phlé.</p>
          <p eId="para_2206"> We are discussing a motion we should not be discussing. The Government is in place four and a half years, yet we have not seen any action taken that has had an effect on housing waiting lists or on homelessness in this and other cities. The opposite has happened. Any effect the Government has had since coming to power has been negative and now we have a greater housing list than ever before. We have an increased number of rough sleepers, in Dublin in particular. I know about Dublin, but other Deputies could speak for their cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2207"> Men and women do not choose to sleep on the street in winter or summer for the fun of it. Sleeping on the street is a cry for help because they have no alternative. If nothing else, I wish that this message got through the thick skulls of Government Members sitting here day in day out without taking action. I have heard statements from the Government saying it will look into the matter. They have been looking far too long at this issue. I heard the claptrap from Deputy Patrick O'Donovan when he spoke about a long-term plan. The problem with the Government is that it has long fingered every plan and action that should have been taken from day one. Some of the plans and actions that should have been taken were cost neutral. Simple steps that could have been taken were not taken, although they might have helped.</p>
          <p eId="para_2208"> The Government could have taken simple steps, such as ensuring local authorities had a quicker turnaround in terms of their voids. It could also have taken steps like the proposals mentioned in our motion. The current and previous Governments have not taken simple decisions. This has meant that the regeneration of parts of my and other areas have never gone ahead. This is not just about sites that are shovel ready, as Deputy O'Donovan proposed. There are a number of sites in places like Ballyfermot where planning permission was given previously, but these sites are sitting idle. There has been no movement on them since the current Government came to power and since the previous Government made a hames of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2209"> Look, for example, at St. Michael's Estate, Cherry Orchard and the likes of Cornamona, where there was a senior citizens' development but it has been knocked down. It is a serviced site and a developer could begin on that site in the morning. Look at a site under the control of the Government - it is an OPW site - in Inchicore. Planning permission was granted for 200 houses on that site, but the builder's business collapsed. That should not stop the State stepping in and going ahead with those buildings. Another site in the locality was earmarked for housing and the owners applied for planning permission, but the HSE bought the site and intends to use it as a builders' depot for the children's hospital, a laudable project.</p>
          <p eId="para_2210"> In my area and other areas of our cities there are sites, houses, homes and buildings which could be easily converted at cost and made available for those on the housing lists. If we walk around this neighbourhood day or night, but particularly at night, we will see people sleeping in doorways. Sleeping rough is now at a level I have never seen before. This is a national crisis. The Government should recognise this, because when it came into power, it produced emergency measures to deal with banking and other issues. However, it never addressed the human or humanitarian crisis. It never produced emergency legislation to deal with a rent cap on private rented accommodation or to purchase compulsorily or acquire property suitable to address homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_2211"> This is madness. It is long past the time for words. We need action and if the Government is not willing to take action, its members should get out of their seats and let somebody else take the action that is required.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_787">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2212">Nothing means more to any parent than the welfare of his or her children. We all want to do the best for them, to care for them and give them the stability they need from the moment they are born. We want to give them the start in life they deserve. That cocoon of comfort, care and stability is not a reality for all children. Homeless children are traumatised on a daily basis at a time when they are at their most vulnerable. Their formative years are being lost to this man-made crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2213"> It has been nothing less than harrowing to listen to this debate, knowing that real people lie behind the stories and statistics. Homelessness touches not just those without a roof over their heads, but those who come into contact with them and none more so than those at the front line of the homelessness crisis, the people who face this reality on a daily basis. Let me tell the Minister of State of the experiences of a primary school teacher in my constituency and about how the plight of Dublin's homeless children has impacted on her, on her school and on the young children attending that school. I cannot overstate the great sense of frustration she feels knowing that nothing is being done for these children or for what seems to her as the hopelessness of her position and these children while she and her fellow teachers try to cope with what seems at times like a tidal wave of despair.</p>
          <p eId="para_2214"> In her school of 345 pupils, 5% of the children are homeless, 17 primary school children in one Dublin school. These young citizens in their formative years should have stability in their young lives, be doing their homework in a secure environment, be playing and developing friendships. Instead, these children face problems that any adult would have difficulty coping with. These homeless children live in hotels, guest houses and B&amp;Bs. The really unlucky ones have been known to sleep in parks in our city and in cars. Like with the old tenements, many families occupy a single room. The children have nowhere to play, they cannot call for their friends and there is no space for toys. Most toys had to be dumped when families lost their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2215">There may be no room for toys because the family's whole life, its worldly possessions, are contained in the bags it carries with it day to day. The homeless child cannot do the normal childish things, like running around and playing or messing, because if he or she does, the hotel might decide he or she cannot stay. Teachers tell me stories of mothers trying to wash the school jumpers in the hotel bath and drying them in the room, as a consequence making everything damp. There are no washing facilities. There are no cooking facilities in the hotel or bed and breakfast either. The possession of a toaster or microwave could lead to the family being thrown out of its accommodation. Families live on cheap takeaways because they cannot cook for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_2216"> All the while, the children worry because they know how precarious their position is. They are tired when they get to school because it is very hard to get a decent night's sleep sharing a room with one's whole family. Their schooling is disrupted. They often arrive late for school because their hotel or bed and breakfast is so far away. They are perpetually insecure and many of them are perpetually on the move.</p>
          <p eId="para_2217"> All of us know how important school is for any child. For the homeless child, it is often the one constant in his or her very disrupted life. We know it is getting harder to find accommodation for families. We know that hotels do not want any more homeless people staying in them and that the idea of "self accommodating" is just not working. </p>
          <p eId="para_2218"> Picture this - parents making the rounds of hotels, begging for a room at the inn for themselves and their family. How degrading and utterly humiliating for any parent and how deeply shameful that any child would witness this. The children are worried and anxious and they feel hopeless. They cannot do anything to help. They see the stress and pressure on their parents and see their desperation. They are experiencing a life no child in Ireland, in any civilised country or modern European economy should ever have to experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_2219"> This is not a crisis; it is a catastrophe. The plight of homeless children in modern Ireland is a tragedy. Is it going to take a greater tragedy for the Government to act? It will not acknowledge this. May I ask the Minister of State, what is his benchmark for a "crisis"? What greater crisis could any country have than to have its young children sleeping on the streets?</p>
          <p eId="para_2220"> I for one am fed up of the Government's finger-pointing and bleating. It is no good to these children. We need a plan and immediate action. I note that none of the Minister of State's colleagues from Fine Gael or the Labour Party are here. What a terrible pity. They need to engage with this issue and do the right thing by these homeless children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_788">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2221">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the catastrophe which Deputy McDonald has just outlined. A number of times earlier this year, the Government made a big play of addressing the housing issue. I received its capital investment plan but there is nothing new in it on housing and dealing with this important issue. The figures we have seen will only deal with a tiny percentage of those who are on the waiting list and would benefit from the new houses that are coming on-stream. While all new houses are welcome, not enough is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_2222"> If it was in Government, Sinn Féin would increase the availability of funding for the local authorities to ensure that long-term solutions are put in place for social housing. The legislation that went through the House before the summer break, which reduced the social housing contribution under Part V in private housing developments, baffled me. I was chair of a housing strategic policy committee, SPC, when that was in operation. Although it was not a silver bullet, it was certainly part of the solution. In the case of County Laois, we were getting 18% of all new builds. They were being bought by the council, not given to them. There was a level of success there. It could have been improved on and not everything was done right, yet I would say it was 80% or 90% successful, which is better than 0%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2223"> In respect of vacant sites, I proposed a Bill earlier in the year and outlined the need for derelict sights to be utilised and for developers and those who are sitting on sites to either use them or lose them. There are 123 such sites in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_2224"> In the short time I have available, I want to outline a few figures for the Minister of State. NAMA has made 6,500 residential properties available for social housing, according to my information and has made that known to the Minister of State's Department and to the councils. However, it has only confirmed demand for 2,500. There are only 1,500 already tenanted. There is obviously a logjam and I would like to know what is happening. This is an issue I have banged on about in the past and will again.</p>
          <p eId="para_2225"> The Minister of State is holding up voids as being the solution. They are a solution. Looking at the list of voids, County Roscommon, with a small council, has 113 houses empty. County Mayo has 145 while in the case of County Laois, there are only four voids out of over 2,000 properties. There would be four houses empty any week, anywhere. The private sector would not have as good a record as that. The voids are not being left empty in County Laois. In the case of County Kildare, there are 39 out of a bigger housing stock, which is not massive. Work is being done filling the voids. We do not want to blame the local authorities for all of this either.</p>
          <p eId="para_2226"> There are in the region of 7,000 households on the waiting list in County Kildare. In the case of County Laois, a much smaller county, there are 1,773 on the waiting list. Going by areas, there are 367 seeking housing in Mountmellick; 419 in Portarlington; and 1,150 in Portlaoise. In the town of Monasterevin in south Kildare, there are 536 households seeking housing and not a social house has been built in that area for over 20 years. The figures are astronomical. </p>
          <p eId="para_2227"> Focusing on solutions, the Government always asks what the Opposition has put forward. We put forward 22 separate measures to solve the problems. I will not read them all out but there are a few which I will highlight. They include: increasing funding to local authorities; reversing the prioritisation of State-subsidised private rented accommodation, its effective privatisation, through the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS and social leasing; bringing this to the attention of the European Commission and have it declared a national emergency; and capping. This needs to be done and I know the Minister, Deputy Kelly, keeps talking about it. For God's sake, he should go and do it. The issue of NAMA needs to be addressed and the Government needs to set up municipal trusts so that money can be borrowed by local authorities off balance sheet to fund houses. The Minister should restore Part V to 20% and bring the legislation to the House in order to do that. We should also examine the feasibility of a rural resettlement scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2234">What makes me angry is being told by people who have lived in this city all of their lives that when they walk around the city centre and see all the shop fronts full of people sleeping, in the pouring rain and freezing cold, that it is the worst they have ever seen - the worst in their lives. What makes me angry is that we paid huge amounts of money to developers for turn-key housing at the top of the market, and although the Minister's Government inherited an opportunity to get a very good deal for the taxpayer by purchasing blocks of housing at the bottom of the market, it sat on its hands and let the opportunity pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_2235">What makes me angry is the fact that there are people working in this city earning a decent wage who cannot afford to pay their rent because rents are going through the roof. It makes me angry that the Minister, who is deputy leader of the Labour Party and sitting in a Chamber with a statue of James Connolly, cannot find it in his heart to take on the vested interests who put up rents in the city and all across the State. I am angry that he cannot confront greed and defend young people and young families who need to put a roof over their heads. I cannot understand how this crisis continues year after year. I have come to the view that it is now a policy, a decision of the Government to leave the market to itself while talking about capital plans and five-year investments. In reality, there is very little more on the table than would have been on it in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_2236"> What is the Minister going to do about it? What is his strategy? What is the Government to do for my county, where almost 200 council houses and a very significant number of private sector houses are empty? There are almost 3,000 on the housing list. They are ordinary people. Sometimes the best wisdom is derived from speaking to everyday people. They ask me how there can be so many empty houses across County Donegal. They ask why the Government does not pull the banks and NAMA together and why there is no strategy to ensure the houses are accessed and that people will have a chance to have a roof over their heads. Why can the Government not ensure that people pay a reasonable rent reflecting what they earn in this city and across the State? How come the Government allocates the housing assistance payment or rent supplement at a level that means people have to find hundreds of extra euro to pay their rent? One will never get a house for the amount of money the Government allocates to people. It tells people it has given them housing assistance and rent supplement and is doing all of that but the reality, which the Minister knows, is that in any town or city across the State, the amount of money allocated does not reflect the rental values. If one goes to the local estate agent to find a property, one will need to pay hundreds of euro more than one is receiving if one is to rent it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2237"> I say to "Angry Alan" that it is time to really find the right people to get angry with. It is time to have a strategy. It is time to go back to what his party is supposed to be about. He has only got a few months to save his bacon. I wish him all the best.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2239">I thank all Members who made a contribution to this debate. There were some very constructive contributions and others that were not so constructive. There is no doubt that this issue extends beyond party politics. We all need to work towards solutions and that is what our people expect and need.</p>
          <p eId="para_2240"> I assure all the Members that the Minister and I are absolutely committed to dealing with housing. Only today, we met all local authority chief executives and directors of housing from all around the country to discuss their plans and ensure solid progress will be made on the implementation of the social housing strategy. We must remember that the local government sector comprises the housing authorities, and they have assured us that they are absolutely committed to delivering on the targets they have been set. These targets concern the projects they themselves submitted to us for approval. These projects have been approved. They are shovel ready in every local authority area in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_2241"> In the relatively short period I have to conclude the Government's contribution to this debate, I will try to focus on the key issues that arose during the Members' contributions over the past two evenings. With regard to homelessness, in the short term while housing supply is being ramped up and while the modular housing and other proposals are being developed further, a range of measures is being implemented to address the current homelessness issue and prevent further cases from arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_2242"> With regard to tenancy protection, the tenancy sustainment protocol, operating in conjunction with Threshold in the Dublin and Cork city areas, continues to provide supports to persons in urban areas where supply problems are most acute. Over 1,200 of the 4,000 cases dealt with were supported with increased rent supplement limits on a case-by-case basis. Plans are actively under way to extend this protocol to Galway city, and officials from the Department of Social Protection are engaging on this with the council in Galway and Threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_2243"> With regard to the allocation of local authority tenancies, the ministerial direction issued by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, which requires local authorities to prioritise the homeless and vulnerable householders in the allocation of tenancies under their control, has been extended and will apply until 31 January 2016. A high-level task force on social housing and homelessness, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, meets weekly to oversee the identification and delivery of properties to accommodate homeless families in the Dublin region. This process has overseen the delivery of a NAMA property recently, an apartment block in south Dublin that is now operating as a 65-unit homelessness facility with a single assessment centre for the homeless families. The acquisition of approximately 100 units, which will be ring-fenced for homeless households, is currently in progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_2244"> With regard to the local authority housing programme, I have already said and repeated today to the chief executives that the funding has been allocated. The project proposals submitted by the local authorities in all areas have been approved, but now we need to see them delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_2245"> I agree with speakers on boarded-up units in local authority ownership. It is not acceptable that they lie vacant when funding is being made available for them. I acknowledge that in the past, local authorities did not have the funding to do up the vacant units and bring them back into beneficial use. The required funding is now being provided and the chief executive officers of the local authorities are now committed to eradicating the voids in their jurisdictions, which voids have been referred to by many Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2246"> A significant programme of returning void local authority units to productive use is now in operation nationally and specifically in the Dublin City Council area, where approximately 500 units have been brought back into use to date this year. A further 180 projects are in progress and another 257 are planned. Over 2,300 void units were brought back into use last year. Funding for approximately 2,500 units is in place for 2015. Therefore, it is not fair to say there is no action on voids. The record speaks for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_2247"> Deputies might want to double-check their figures on voids because the picture painted today by the chief executives of the authorities offers a completely different perspective from theirs. There is a challenge for all of us. Local authorities are being funded. We said to them specifically today that if they have more voids that need funding, they will get it. I encourage Deputies to ask the chief executive officers and their local authorities to make their submissions. We are considering how we can streamline and shorten the local authority project delivery process. </p>
          <p eId="para_2248"> Regarding what NAMA can deliver, 1,400 houses and apartments were delivered to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing use, and they are on track to deliver 4,500 new residential units in the greater Dublin area by the end of 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_2249"> There is much more I would like to say but I am constrained by the time limits. The Government is determined to deal with this crisis. As with everybody else, we understand the challenges that families face. We are representative of the very same families as the Deputies opposite. It behoves all of us, including the Opposition, Government, local authorities, councillors and society in general, to respond to this crisis in a proactive way because the people who need the houses are depending on us to deliver them. We will do all in our power to provide the funding but we need local authorities, approved housing bodies and everybody to get behind the effort to ensure we deliver the houses the people so badly need.</p>

Peter McVerry, pointed out to the Minister last February that what he, the Minister, announced last December following the death of a man not too far from this Chamber was not going to work. Fr. McVerry said it was actually going to fail and increase the number of people who are homeless. Does the Minister recall his response to Fr. Peter McVerry?</p>

          <p eId="para_2283">Do not talk to me about debates. I know very well the effects of homelessness and the Minister knows the reasons why. It affects my family directly and I have spoken about that in the past. The responses I got from some of the Minister's own party colleagues go to show that it is not just he who is arrogant. The whole Labour Party is arrogant when it comes to homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_2284"> In the time left, I want to talk briefly about some of the solutions. There are solutions which the Minister could implement immediately. I have a particular interest in drug addiction when it comes to homelessness. One of the biggest issues for recovering addicts is that when they come out of rehab they do not have step-down facilities. They are being forced back into homeless hostels where drug use is rampant in many cases. That is not the environment into which we should put people who are trying to beat addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_2285"> In addition, some people on the methadone programme may be getting their methadone administered through a homeless hostel. Last week, I met one young girl in an accident and emergency department who, for whatever reason, had a falling out with a particular hostel. It should be remembered that we are dealing with people who have chronic addiction and mental health issues. As she was asked to leave the hostel, she slept that night in a multi-storey car park and missed her methadone that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_2286"> The following day she went to the accident and emergency department in Cork to try to get some methadone. However, due to the delays in our health service and because they would not administer methadone until she had a psychological evaluation and had spoken to a psychiatrist, she missed her methadone for a second day. Anyone who knows anything about addiction will know that if someone does not take their methadone for 48 hours they have to go back to a 20 millilitre dose. This young girl was on 70 millilitres at the time. However, because of a policy failure which forced this girl back on to the streets, she could not access methadone and had to start again at 20 millilitres, which was insufficient. Her only solution, rightly or wrongly, was to go back out and start using heroin again. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_2287"> Over 50% of people on our housing lists are single persons. They have no hope of being housed under the Minister's social housing building programme. He is talking about houses for families, which is all well and good, but not every homeless person is part of a family. There are individuals with mental health issues, drug addiction and other social issues that prevent them from independent living. </p>
          <p eId="para_2288"> The Minister has been talking recently about how we are going to solve the crisis by building 150 modular houses. That is great. The 150 houses will cater for those who will become homeless this month and next month, but no one else will benefit. The Minister says it is an interim measure but unfortunately I do not believe that. Direct provision was supposed to be an interim measure, as was housing people in hostels and hotels, yet they are now becoming permanent measures. </p>
          <p eId="para_2289"> The Minister talks about the RAS and HAP schemes as solutions. I do not know what it is like in the Minister's county council in Tipperary, but I know what is happening in Cork City Council. People come to my constituency office asking to get out of RAS because it is not working for them. They are in sub-standard accommodation. That is the reality. </p>
          <p eId="para_2290"> I do not want to eat into Deputy Ellis's time because I know he wants to conclude the debate. I will therefore finish on this point. The Minister is right to say that we all have to work together, but we can only do so if the Minister is willing to sit down and listen to people like us and Fr. Peter McVerry, and not criticise us. The Minister should not say he has all the solutions while we do not have any. We have solutions and we need to implement them. The first thing the Minister should do is declare a national emergency.</p>

        <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_831">
          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2015-09-30T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2291">I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate. I commend all those who help and support the homeless. Volunteers who deliver meals, hot drinks, clothes and other supports have bailed out this Government, as well as the previous one, by their duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_2292"> It is clear from the Minister's amendment and his response to our Private Member's Bill that he and his Government colleagues are failing to recognise the extent and depth of this crisis. He talks about this crisis using the language of the business world, with an emphasis on Ireland's competitiveness. A more humane approach in his analysis is needed, however, given the extent to which homelessness affects the lives of so many people - men, women and particularly children.</p>
          <p eId="para_2293"> The Minister has conceded that this crisis is a humanitarian one, yet there was little of that sentiment in his response to the opening debate on this motion yesterday evening. He has listened as speaker after speaker called on him to take action in elevating the status of this situation to what is fundamentally needed, which is the declaration of an emergency. In the Minister's speech on this debate yesterday evening there was a complete absence of any reference to our proposal to liaise with the European Commission in declaring an emergency. Over three years ago, the Government announced that it would end homelessness by 2016 but the Minister has failed in this and the Government has repeatedly failed to tackle the crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_2294"> When Jonathan Corrie died last Christmas, the Minister pulled together housing bodies, local authority CEOs, charity groups and politicians for an emergency meeting from which he emerged claiming to have worked out an effective response to the crisis. In this he has failed miserably, however. It is also true that far from ending the crisis, the number of people sleeping rough on the streets nightly has doubled to 130 since Jonathan Corrie's death - a stark reality compounded by the death of another homeless person near Leinster House last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_2295"> I wish to point to the Minister's current allocation of €493 million so far this year to local authorities and housing bodies to construct just 2,900 units. This level of provision is totally inadequate and is far from ambitious. It is clear that given only an average of 400 social housing units have been delivered annually for the last three years, the Minister's entire strategy hinges on the private sector delivering further rental and leasing agreements, with a transition to HAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_2296">The voluntary housing bodies are delivering more due to their ability to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency in addition to other financial institutions. This tells us that the plan the Minister announced a year ago for a six-year programme with investment of €3.8 billion in total - €2.5 billion for the first three years and €1.3 billion for the remaining three - is not delivering. The first year of the programme is already over and there is little evidence to support claims of any great success in social housing provision. Our Bill proposes the renewal of the financial contribution scheme for senior citizens, which would provide a significant contribution to be retained and ring-fenced for future social housing. I call on the Minister to reinstate this scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_2297"> We acknowledge benefits around elements of the Urban Regeneration Bill introduced earlier this year, particularly around ending get-out clauses for developers. However, we call on the Government to restore the original 20% for social and affordable housing under Part V in order to bring the position here into line with other European countries. We see this as an appeasement of the Minister's Fine Gael colleagues and developers in general. Local authority senior management seems have limited its remit to the operation of social housing lists and in general terms, moving away from the issue of social housing delivery itself. Does the Minister believe that the ideological persuasions of some chief executives and senior management could have an influence on this shift of focus? Does he see them as a block or hindrance to the delivery of social housing? If so, what will he do?</p>
          <p eId="para_2298"> Regarding the role of NAMA, we welcome the conversion of office, retail and former residential property space into accommodation but this process needs to be accelerated. We call on the Government to introduce emergency legislation to change the function of NAMA to maximise social gain through the transfer of NAMA properties to local authorities. This would take the function of NAMA beyond the provision of a social dividend and solidify its role in the State's development of social housing, which will benefit the taxpayer in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_2299"> There are several factors feeding into this crisis, as the Minister stated yesterday evening. The staggering increase in homelessness is a result of uncontrolled rent levels, predominantly in large urban centres. Not only are those people on rent supplement and RAS at severe risk of homelessness but those with jobs are absolutely squeezed and forced to live in substandard conditions as they cannot afford ever increasing rents. I welcome any acknowledgement on the Minister's part that rents must be regulated. However, given that the country has slipped into a state of emergency, I call on him to take immediate action to introduce rent control and security of tenure, as this Bill proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2300"> The mortgage to rent scheme has delivered just over 100 units throughout the country, an appalling return on a scheme that has the potential to be maximised, ensuring people remain in their homes. In addition, considering the current rates of mortgage arrears, mortgage to rent, in conjunction with an urgent cap on mortgage interest rates, could be implemented by the Government to help address the difficult situation facing people in mortgage distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_2301"> We believe that every citizen of this country has a right to adequate provision of housing to ensure a quality of life for all our people. We call on the Government to support our solutions to this crisis and to recognise the degree to which this crisis has pervaded our society. With that in mind, we call on the Minister and all Deputies in this House to support our Private Members' motion. We reject any attempts to water down or amend what is a very important Private Members' motion with massive repercussions for our people and their rights.</p>
