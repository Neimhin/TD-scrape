            <p eId="para_1">98. <b>Deputy Michael McGrath</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> the number of banks with which officials of his Department have met which have made a definitive commitment to reduce their standard variable mortgage rate, as distinct from offering new fixed rates to customers; his views on the outcome of these discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2">This priority question relates to the issue of standard variable rate mortgages and, in particular, the issue of the excessive variable interest rates being charged by banks in Ireland to approximately 300,000 variable rate customers. The Minister concluded a series of meetings with the banks about a month ago and they have until 1 July, which is another week or so, to come up with their response to that series of meetings. Is the Minister satisfied with the response so far and does he expect further movement in the next week or so that will result in a reduction in variable rates before 1 July?</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I thank the Deputy for his question. As he knows, I met with senior management of Ireland's six main mortgage providers in May. The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. I outlined my view that standard variable rates being charged in the Irish market are too high. There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers. Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed-rate products and lower variable rates based on loan-to-value ratios for new and existing customers. In addition to the issue of interest rates, I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced advertising campaign by the individual banks, focusing on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p>
            <p eId="para_5"> The position of homeowners who are in negative equity was also discussed, and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks, and a follow-up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the budget. Time should now be allowed for the banks to act on this matter. However, it should be noted that the banks have started to make some welcome changes on this issue which should result in real savings for mortgage holders.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Minister for his response. I am sure it will not have escaped him that, so far, not a single bank has reduced its variable interest rate as a result of the meeting held with him, although there is another week to go. AIB had pre-announced a rate cut before meeting with the Minister, while Bank of Ireland has announced a reduction in its fixed rates. To my knowledge, there has been no response from KBC, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank or ACC.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> Is the Minister going to be satisfied with a situation in which banks come out and announce a reduction in their fixed rates? The whole purpose of this exercise was to bring about reductions in the actual standard variable rates. A fixed-rate mortgage is a different product, as customers are locking in for a period. In the case of Bank of Ireland's existing variable rate customers, if they move to a fixed rate they have to lock in for two years. That comes at a price and has consequences. The purpose of this campaign is to bring down the actual variable rates themselves, which the Minister himself has acknowledged are too high. If the response remains as it is, with a number of the banks not responding at all, what steps will the Minister take to address the issue?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">The purpose of the meetings was to ensure that persons with mortgages would get mortgages at cheaper rates. Whether they are variable-rate or fixed mortgages is a matter of choice with customers. A reduction in mortgage rates was the priority of those meetings. While AIB had announced a variable mortgage rate reduction before this series of meetings, I had previously met the incoming CEO of AIB at the end of the process of his appointment and discussed variable mortgage rates with him. At that stage, I got a commitment from him that he would make an announcement that variable mortgage rates would be reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> The other banks have responded in various ways. There is obviously an advantage for banks to move to fixed-rate mortgages, which are essentially lower rates than variable-rate mortgages. If the banks have fixed rates over time, they can fund against the fixed rate arrangement at a lower rate than they would fund for variable rates on the market. They have until 1 July and we will see at that stage. The Deputy should remember there is a series of follow-up meetings before the budget in September.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">The Minister may not feel he is in a position to get a response because there is still a week to go. However, I can give a response, which is that, so far, the response from the banks has been deeply disappointing. The fact is a reduction in the fixed rate is not a substitute for a reduction in the standard variable rate. While some customers can make cash savings on their monthly repayments, it comes at a price in that they are locked in for a minimum two-year period. If a new entrant comes into the market and offers variable rates at 3%, they cannot switch because they would have to pay a penalty. This is the point that must be borne in mind. If standard variable rates fall below the fixed rate customers lock in at, then they lose out again.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> I do not believe the Minister should accept anything less than reductions in the actual variable rates. The only banks that have responded to some degree so far are AIB in terms of the variable rate and Bank of Ireland with a fixed rate cut, but there is not a dicky-bird - not a word - from the four other banks as to what they are going to do, with just one week to go. We will see what happens in the course of the next week but, on the evidence so far, the response is underwhelming to say the least.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">As I said, significant progress has been made. A number of banks have offered fixed rate products at much lower rates than the variable rate. I draw attention in particular to the new set of fixed rate offers Bank of Ireland has made and the other banks and mortgage lenders will be coming forward in due course with their proposals. I gave them time and space until 1 July and I also reminded them that I would have a second series of meetings in September. I intend to stick to that schedule.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">99. <b>Deputy Pearse Doherty</b> asked the <b>Minister for Finance</b> his plans in Budget 2016 to cut the top rate of tax in view of the fact that the Economic and Social Research Institute has stated that cuts in the top rates of tax or in the universal social charge would have a strong impact on households with incomes in the top 10%, but little effect on households at low and middle income levels. [24786/15]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">A recent Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report was unambiguous in stating that cuts in the top rates of tax or in the universal social charge would have a strong impact on households with incomes in the top 10%, but little effect on households at low and middle income levels. Despite that, this is the Government's stated position in the run-up to this year's budget. It is hardly news and is simply a long-established fact that the ESRI analysis of last year's budget showed that the bottom 40% were poorer as a result of the Minister's measures. Will the Minister take a step back and, in his budget planning, will he instead target policy to reduce and not increase economic inequality?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">I note the release of a number of publications by the ESRI as part of its annual "Budget Perspectives" series, which is a welcome part of the information base leading up to the budget each year. I assume the paper to which the Deputy is referring is "Exploring Tax and Welfare Options". The paper indicates that a reduction in the 8% rate of USC or a cut in the top income tax rate would result in the top decile of households having the largest gains in equalised disposable income. This is unsurprising as the households in lower deciles pay little or no USC or income tax at these marginal rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> The ESRI points out that the estimates of the distributional impact of tax and welfare changes they provide are "static" impacts based on the technical assumption that behaviour does not change. Thus, the estimates only consider part of the benefit to those currently working and do not account for the effect that lower labour taxes can have in incentivising participation in the labour market and increasing employment. Increasing employment has been a key plank of this Government's policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> As I have said on many occasions, a fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation. I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so. Ireland already has one of the more progressive income tax systems in the developed world.  As a result of the changes I introduced in budget 2015, all those who paid income tax or USC in 2014 will see a reduction in their tax bill for 2015, where incomes are equal.  However, to preserve the progressivity of the income tax system, the budget measures were specifically designed to ensure that those with very high incomes would only benefit to the same extent as those with more modest incomes. This was achieved by the introduction of the 8% USC rate for income over €70,044, confining the benefit of the reduction in the marginal rate of tax from 41% to 40% to earnings below that ceiling only. The maximum benefit from the budget 2015 package of tax measures was, therefore, limited to approximately €14 per week for any individual taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The reality is that, because of the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system, those on lower incomes pay very low levels of tax, particularly when compared to their counterparts in Europe. It should also be noted that, as a result of increases to the entry point to the USC introduced by this Government in budget 2012 and budget 2015, raising the entry point from €4,004 to €12,012 per annum, it is estimated that approximately 417,000 individuals have been exempted from the charge altogether. This means that 28% of all income earners are not paying any universal social charge at all. Furthermore, I also reduced the two lower rates at which USC is charged and extended the threshold before the 7% rate becomes chargeable up to €17,576 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The changes announced in budget 2015 were steps in a process targeting low and middle income earners, which seeks to ensure that we continue to have a tax system that is progressive and which rewards employment. I intend to continue to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners in this manner, subject to having the required fiscal space.</p>

          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_22">The Minister said it is unsurprising that the ESRI report states the top 10% of earners in the country are the ones who will benefit most, not just from last year's package but from that which will be promised this year and yet he keeps on dressing the budget up as though it will support middle income earners. Let us call a spade a spade. The top 10% of earners are not middle income earners. Rather, they are high income earners and include people such as the Minister, the Minister of State and other people.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">Yes, it includes people who are above the average rate. Let us be clear and call it what it is. If the Minister wants to introduce a tax measure, he should nail his colours to the mast and be clear that the majority of the tax giveaway in next year's budget will benefit the richest in society. He had no problem doing that with Greece yesterday, when we saw an example of the Minister we have not seen since the days of the hepatitis C scandal. If this is the Minister's agenda, let us call it what it is. He should not dress up the measure as something different. The average personal income in this State in 2014 was €35,000 and the average household was €39,478. This measure will benefit the wealthiest dual income households in the State. Let us call this measure what it is and stop trying to pretend that it will mostly impact middle income earners.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_12" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">Sinn Féin is a high tax party and all of the bombast, rhetoric and personal remarks in the world will not get away from the fact that it is involved in fantasy economics and its proposals on a series of budgets do not add up. It is a tax and spend party and is entitled to take that position. It wants to raise taxes on everybody. Our position is different. We want to reduce taxes, in particular personal taxes. I do not need an analysis from the ESRI to tell me that if somebody pays no tax or USC, he or she does not get relief if I reduce USC or income tax. I do not need someone with a PhD in economics to tell me that. If one does not pay tax, a tax reduction will not affect one. We have taken a lot of people out of USC and are committed to increasing the 400,000 people at work who do not pay it to 500,000 in the budget. If one falls within those levels of income, then a USC reduction does not affect one. It gives one no relief because one does not pay any USC.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The same applies to income tax. If one is not liable for income tax, one does not pay it. To ensure that there is a balanced and even distributional effect we have put a limit on the reductions in personal income taxes of €70,000. Anybody with an income above that is in the same position as someone earning €70,000. That worked out at about €14 a week last year. We will continue with somewhat similar measures on this occasion. </p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_13">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:15:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_27">This Minister can come into the House until the cows come home and peddle his mistruths about Sinn Féin's economic policies. He referred to increasing tax on everybody. That is blatantly untrue and, as Minister for Finance, he knows that to be untrue. Unless he is not reading any of our submissions, he will know that we do not want to increase taxes on low and middle income earners and that we want to reduce the tax burden by scrapping property taxes and water charges. Can the Minister not deal with the debate in terms of facts and figures and what I proposed today, which is that the ESRI did not state that if one has no tax liability one will not pay any tax? It stated the measure benefits strongly the top 10% of earners in Irish society, namely, the richest of the rich.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> In effect, it means that two earners in a household, each earning €70,000, a total of €140,000, will benefit more. An income of €140,000 is €100,000 more than the average income of households across the State. This is the type of measure the Minister wants to introduce. Even the IMF stated that putting money back into the pockets of those who need it most is the best way to achieve economic recovery. This is not just about economic recovery, rather, it is about economic inequality, something to which the Government is completely and utterly blind. The last number of budgets is testament to that fact. </p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_14" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_29">The Deputy always forgets the difference between gross income and net income. A person with a gross income on PAYE at a salary or wage of €70,000 a year, which is using an example of someone who is very wealthy, pays more than €25,000 in personal income tax. Accordingly, the net income is less than €45,000. We are directing it from that level down. It is not from €70,000 down but €45,000 net down. That is where we are focusing in that category.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Above that, people still get reductions in their taxes arising from the measures in the last budget. They do so, however, at the same level as somebody on €70,000. The reason we adopted these policies is that if one taxes something, one tends to get less of it while if one relieves tax, one tends to get more of it. These taxes are taxes on employment. Our strategy has been successful. By reducing personal taxes and VAT from 13.5% to 9% in the hospitality industry, we have created in excess of 100,000 jobs since 2012. The object of our tax policy is to grow the economy and to create jobs. It is a macroeconomic instrument. It is not principally about giving money to certain people.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">At a European level, discussions regarding Greece take place among euro area finance Ministers in the context of the Eurogroup. The procedure for dealing with all programme countries is as follows. The three institutions, namely the European Commission, the ECB, European Central Bank, and the IMF, International Monetary Fund, conduct technical discussions with the authorities. Where agreement is reached, this comes to the Eurogroup for endorsement. Alternatively, the Eurogroup can help provide political guidance and resolve outstanding issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> On the current situation, discussions at a technical level have been difficult. At the beginning of June, progress at a technical level was made. At a subsequent meeting at political level between the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, to discuss the proposal, it seemed like both sides were moving closer together. However, following the submission of Greek counter proposals on 12 June, it was clear there had been a complete rowing back on the Greek side and subsequent negotiations concluded with no agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> As a result, an additional Eurogroup meeting and informal European summit were called on 22 June 2015 in Brussels. The purpose of these meetings was to exchange views on Greece, as well as to clarify the positions and the situation in the ongoing talks between the Greek authorities and the institutions.  A revised list of counter proposals was submitted by the Greek authorities yesterday. The Greek authorities will now work with the institutions to agree a comprehensive list of reforms and a list of prior actions by tomorrow that can be presented to the Eurogroup. The euro area has an obligation to Greece in these difficult times but Greece has an obligation to itself. It needs to reform its economy and return it to sustainable growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Ireland, together with other member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people. This is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new government, while also respecting existing commitments. The situation of Greece's finances is challenging with immediate financing needs to be addressed. In addition, deposit outflows have continued from the banking system. Accordingly, urgent agreement on the necessary structural reforms is imperative to conclude the fifth review and release the associated disbursements.</p>

            <p eId="para_38"> On Greek debt, as I have repeatedly outlined, my view is that Greece should remain in the euro area and that sovereign debt should not be written off. However, there is, of course, some room for manoeuvre in terms of maturity extension and other ways to reduce the burden of debt. This is what we have done in Ireland, in co-operation with our European partners, with the extension of maturities on our EFSF, European financial stability facility, and EFSM, European financial stabilisation mechanism, loans, the replacement of the promissory notes with long-term bonds and the replacement of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding.</p>

The impression that he and other Ministers and Deputies speaking on the matter would like to give is that the Greeks have not done enough and have not brought in reforms. Ongoing IMF and troika austerity regimes have been imposed, which have led to a situation in which domestic violence has increased by 47% and 35% of people now live below the poverty line. The Minister is asking the Greek Government to foist even more so-called structural reforms on the ordinary working people and the unemployed of Greece.</p>

I have also been quite helpful to the Greek authorities in moving to the present position whereby realistic negotiations are taking place. I do not have the strong personal relationship that the Deputy's group and Sinn Féin have with the party of government in Greece because I do not share the commitment to its economic policies which Sinn Féin and the socialist group seem to share. That being so, I have a good working relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> Emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, is entirely a matter for the European Central Bank, and at yesterday's meeting I sought clarification from Mr. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, about how long he thought it was feasible to continue to pay ELA to Greece. The Deputy will recall from newspaper reports that he is already on record as saying it must be reconsidered on a daily basis. The important point I was making is that the new round of negotiations has a very short timeframe in which to be concluded satisfactorily, or there is a risk that ELA will be cut off, because it is bound by legal arrangements in the European Central Bank. It is very important that an agreement with Greece is fully negotiated by Thursday at the latest. That is my position. Anything else is based on leaks, supposition and spin.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">Is it not true that the most important thing for the Minister and the Government is to see that Greece does not get any deal they could not get and that no write-down of debt be given? The Minister stated that he had been helpful to the Greek authorities. I do not think it was very helpful to ask for the noose placed there by the ECB to be tightened around the necks of the Greek people and Government. The Minister obviously does not agree with left-wing politics, and that is fine, but how dare he lecture the Greek Government on what reforms it should implement? I do agree with the Minister on one or two things. I agree that the banks should be taken over and nationalised in the interests of the ordinary people of Greece, and that capital controls should be put in place to stop the attack on the Greek economy from the markets. Hefty wealth taxes should be imposed on the rich, such as the shipping magnates, who have escaped scot-free in the past six years and who are investing their money in property deals in Mayfair in London. Greece should appeal to the workers of Europe to support it in its demands for a change in policy at the top of the EU. On Saturday, at the anti-water charges protest, people showed solidarity with the ordinary people of Greece. They should refuse to take on this monstrous debt burden.</p>

My objective in negotiating on behalf of Ireland at the Eurogroup is to ensure the Eurogroup is preserved and there is no threat to the euro as the currency of the 19 countries in the group. I have stated on several occasions that I want Greece to remain as a constituent of the Eurogroup and continue with the euro as its currency. The present state of play, as I outlined, is that the Government has introduced proposals arising from the <i>aide-mémoire</i> presented after the meeting in Berlin, with which the Deputy is familiar. It has made a number of proposals, principally with regard to VAT increases, increased contributions for pensions, increases in corporation tax from 26% to 29%, and various structural measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">This question relates to inheritance tax. From 2009, the thresholds for the different bands were reduced dramatically. The threshold for parent to child inheritance, for example, fell by almost 60% over the period. That has resulted in an increase of 34% in the number of people liable for inheritance tax. What plan does the Minister have to address the issue?

            <p eId="para_48">This issue has been raised with me by Deputies and others in recent months and I am conscious of the concerns involved. Capital acquisitions tax, CAT, applies to the beneficiary of a gift or inheritance rather than to the person making the gift or inheritance. Whereas the rate of CAT is 33%, each person has a number of lifetime thresholds for gifts and inheritances which they can receive tax-free. These are based on the relationship to the person who has made the gift or bequest.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The group A threshold of €225,000 applies primarily in cases where an asset passes from a parent to a child. The group B threshold of €30,150 applies primarily to transfers between other close relatives. The group C threshold of €15,075 applies between more distant relations and people who are not related. The 33% rate of CAT applies on assets received by a person above the relevant threshold. Gifts and inheritances between spouses and civil partners are exempt from CAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Over the past number of years, the CAT thresholds have been reduced a number of times, while the rate has increased. These changes were necessary in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in a period of falling asset prices so that such taxes would continue to make a contribution to our efforts to consolidate the public finances. Moreover, the views of the OECD, supported by our own economic research, is that taxes on property and other fixed capital, such as CAT, are less harmful and distortionary to economic growth than taxes on work or consumption. As the economic recovery continues to take hold, I began this year to focus available resources on reducing the burden of taxation on earned income and take-home pay where high taxes impact on competitiveness, economic growth and job creation. That will continue to be my main focus. That said, I recognise that recent growth in property values has implications for the liabilities that can arise from capital acquisitions tax. It is for this reason that, as I have said in response to a number of other recent parliamentary questions on this matter, I am reviewing the various aspects of this tax in the context of the preparations for budget 2016 and the subsequent finance Bill.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_52">I am not in a position, nor would I intend to say at this point, what specific changes I may or may not propose. With regard to the Deputy's specific concerns, however, I will make a few general comments.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> When considering the inheritance of a family home, it is worth noting the existence of the CAT dwelling house exemption, which allows for a property to be inherited tax-free when the inheritor is already living in the home. While certain restrictions apply to ensure proper use, this exemption is designed to prevent cases of hardship or displacement for inheritors who are home sharers. The Deputy asks whether I would consider indexing the thresholds. The thresholds were previously indexed to inflation through the consumer price index. This link was broken following the financial crash as inflation was positive while property values were declining considerably. Fixed property makes up a large proportion of gifts and inheritances, especially inheritances. The question of whether it might be appropriate to index the thresholds in the future is a matter I will examine. A number of issues must be considered in this regard, including, for example, the availability of an appropriate index and the current functioning of the property market in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> When a person who receives a gift or inheritance is not in a position to pay the CAT charge arising in one go it may be possible, in certain circumstances, to arrange to pay the tax by instalments. It is appropriate that in such circumstances interest be applied to the payments. However, tax legislation gives the Revenue Commissioners the discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments, where this is not otherwise allowed, on a concessionary basis in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. In cases of hardship, the Revenue Commissioners also have the discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such a period and on such terms, including the waiver of interest, as they think fit. The Revenue Commissioners will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the gift or inheritance involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I welcome that the Minister is reviewing a number of aspects of the inheritance tax regime because we have been through a very fraught and difficult number of years. The fact that the threshold for gifts from parents to children has reduced by almost 60% since 2009 is quite stark. We now have a toxic combination of that drastic cut in the threshold, the increase in the rate from as low as 20% to 33% and, now, rising property values. That has resulted in 34% more people having to pay inheritance tax over the past four years. The yield has increased dramatically from €186 million in 2010 to an estimated €400 million in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> This is an issue as people like to leave an inheritance if they can for a family but neither families nor the people leaving an inheritance like the idea of paying a big chunk of that to the Minister. I am sure he accepts that. The thresholds must be addressed and I would like to see the indexation of the thresholds revisited, along with the interest rate - at almost 8% - which applies when somebody decides to pay the inheritance tax liability over a number of years.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">I am reviewing the whole ambit of the texts in the context of the forthcoming budget. The Deputy asked whether I would consider indexing the thresholds. The thresholds were previously indexed to inflation through the consumer price index, but this link was broken following the financial crash, as inflation was positive while property values were declining considerably. We want to be sure in what direction values are going before we index. The other thing that is not generally known is that there is a capital acquisitions tax dwelling house exemption, which allows for a property to be inherited tax-free where the inheritor is already living in the home. If a son or daughter is the carer, is living in the home and inherits the property, they have no tax liability, regardless of thresholds. The thresholds only apply to people who are not living in the home and who inherit.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">I thank the Minister for his reply. Reading between the lines, we are likely to see some movement on this issue in the budget in October. I hope it is a significant move because the changes made over the last few years have been quite drastic. This situation has been created by the increase in the number of people who are liable for inheritance tax, the significant increase in the rate, the dramatic cut in the thresholds and the rise in property prices over the last couple of years. Elderly people who are in a position to do so like to leave an inheritance to their children and they do not want much of that inheritance to be paid to the State by way of capital acquisitions tax. The issue needs to be addressed. I hope the Minister makes a significant move and examines the issue of indexation and the situation facing people who inherit a home and want to keep it but who find a large inheritance tax liability has crystallised. Under the existing arrangements, they can pay by instalments, but the interest rate is in the region of 8% per annum, which is quite punitive for many people. As part of the Minister's review, we should investigate whether that situation can be eased.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">I have not seen any evidence of a negative impact on Exchequer returns and a change to self-employment in the construction sector and I cannot, therefore, accept the Deputy's assertion in that regard. I assume that the Deputy's reference to ensuring that RCT is "not used in a manner to deny workers in the sector basic rights" relates to the RCT system which is a tax deduction at source system that applies to payments made under a relevant contract in the construction, meat-processing and forestry sectors. As with any contract of engagement in the construction sector, whether a person is engaged under either a contract of service and is, therefore, an employee; or a contract for service and is, therefore, a self-employed person, is determined by the facts and evidence of each case and not by the RCT system of tax deduction. Guidance on whether a person is engaged as an employee or as a self-employed contractor is provided in the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals, which was prepared jointly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, business representative bodies and relevant State agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> Both the electronic RCT, eRCT, system and the PAYE system of tax deduction at source are underpinned by tax legislation and not by employment legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">Neither such system determines whether a person in the construction sector, or, indeed, in any other sector, is engaged as an employee or as a self-employed contractor. On that basis, it is incorrect to attempt to link the RCT system of tax deduction with any denial of workers' statutory employment entitlements, such as rates of pay, holidays, holiday pay or sick leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> As I have outlined in my responses to previous parliamentary questions in regard to the operation of the RCT system, monitoring of the construction sector for abuses of the tax and duty systems forms part of the Revenue Commissioners' ongoing compliance programmes. The Revenue Commissioners commit significant resources to compliance interventions in the construction sector. There were more than 15,000 tax compliance risk interventions in the sector in 2013 and nearly 17,000 such interventions in 2014. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners work closely with the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Agency, including by conducting joint operations in the construction sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">Last year's J.J. Rhatigan dispute, which lasted over six months, brought to public attention the reality of life for construction workers under the so-called recovery. These skilled workers, thanks to a system of subcontracting and bogus self-employment, even if they do not want to be self-employed, are forced to live on an income that does not meet the rates provided for in the registered employment agreements, but, more importantly, does not even meet the minimum wage requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> It is not only the case that construction companies are profiting from exploiting workers; it is also the case that State is facilitating that, and, in so doing, depriving the Exchequer of funds that one would think we would be killing ourselves to bring in. We have seen it in the Department of Education and Skills, in particular, with many school contracts being awarded to construction companies that operate these systems. Thanks to the Construction Workers' Alliance, a number of questions have been tabled by Deputies, which revealed that workers earn so little that they are not liable to pay the RCT and receive rebates, resulting in negative returns for the Exchequer to the tune of €100 million from 2008 to 2014, inclusive.</p>

            <p eId="para_75"> If one examines what the State is losing in tax receipts for directly employed workers in the sector in the period I mentioned - 2008 to 2014, inclusive - it amounts to €2.5 billion. What is going on here is that the Government is encouraging a race to the bottom of a cheap-labour economy to back up the so-called recovery, because the Minister does not seem perturbed that the Revenue Commissioners are losing this money. What is most worrying for the workers involved who pay the price is that the Minister makes it sound as though they have a choice. They show up, and if they do not agree to go along with these conditions they are sacked. That is what happened in Rhatigan's last year, of which we spoke in the Dáil. One recruitment company, CLS Recruitment, which is only down the road, boasts that the advantages for employers of using this system include no PRSI, no holiday pay, no pension, no bank holiday pay and the ability to both hire and "off-hire" - that means sack - staff at one hour's notice throughout the country.

            <p eId="para_88">My information is that the ADM department is being outsourced to India and that skilled IT staff have been told this and will be forced out of the bank. This is a bank that the so-called we own 99.8% of, yet the Government is agreeing not to intervene in any way in AIB's employment practices and job losses.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I thank the Deputy for her question. As she will be aware, under the relationship framework the State does not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks in which it holds investments or their management decisions regarding commercial matters. Hence, any discussion around matters such as outsourcing is a matter for the bank, the relevant staff and their union representatives. Notwithstanding this position, my officials take an active interest in how the bank's cost base evolves to ensure that the State's interests as shareholder are protected and the Government's remuneration policy is enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> The bank has previously indicated that, as part of its restructuring plan to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, the outsourcing of certain functions would be considered in consultation with unions and affected staff. I have been informed by the bank that there have been no compulsory redundancies as a result of its recent outsourcing activities. Any staff who transfer under outsourcing arrangements transfer under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment), TUPE, Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> I have been informed that AIB has not at this stage confirmed any agreement to outsource some of its technology services in ADM teams to a third party provider. Should such a decision be confirmed, affected staff will be informed immediately and AIB will enter into a full process of information and consultation with employee representatives, as required by law and under engagement principles agreed with the Irish Bank Officials Association, IBOA.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I asked a bunch of questions to which the Minister gave the same answer, namely, under the relationship framework, the State does not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or management decisions on commercial matters. We put money in continually, but we are not bothered by jobs being shed. The Government could change this relationship if it wanted to.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> Since we paid to bail out the banks, there has been a loss of approximately 4,000 jobs at AIB. It has also outsourced a number of its functions, including cleaning, catering, IT and training. We are meant to own it. The State could intervene to prevent these job losses and the cheapening of labour.</p>
            <p eId="para_94"> There is a proposal to transfer the ADM section to an Indian company. AIB may keep some of its staff in Ireland, but there is a legitimate concern that it will outsource more functions abroad. It has already happened in the finance sector. The Minister should have an interest in this matter because there have been serious problems with outsourcing IT in other banks, leading to months of delays in addressing consumer complaints.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">The Deputy would have received answers to the effect that the State was at arm's length from the banks and that we did not interfere in commercial decisions. The relationship framework sets out clearly that the political side should not interfere in commercial decisions. Consider when Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised or when, in the early days of this Government, I recapitalised PTSB, AIB and Bank of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">One of the main concerns of Deputies on all sides of the House was that commercial decisions would be commercial and they would not be influenced by political considerations. That was a very strong case advanced by everybody here and it is something that I am convinced was a proper decision, that there should not be political interference in commercial decisions in the banks. As I said in my reply, I have been informed that AIB has not at this stage confirmed any agreement to outsource some of its technology services but should it do so it will follow the agreements it has entered into with the Irish Bank Officials Association.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">That would not be the view of most ordinary people outside. For example, "commercial reasons" was the reason given for not informing the Minister's Department about the sale of Siteserv GMC Sierra. That whole debacle was for commercial reasons. The Minister did not find out about that until a month after it had happened. When the taxpayer is pumping money in, I do not see why the State should not be able to interfere. Banks could be run in the interests of ordinary people for a change. That would be a turnaround, knowing that people could get cheap credit and mortgages, and affordable housing could be built.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> In regard to the particulars of AIB, Ulster Bank saw its systems go down for a number of months in 2012. I think it took three months to have it resolved for some customers. Outsourcing these departments is not a good idea. The other part is that this seems to be a pattern, somewhat similar to the last question. Bank jobs used to be good jobs with good pensions. If he does not intervene, the Minister is assisting in the decline of decent pay and conditions in the financial services sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I could not disagree more with the Deputy than in her policy position that Deputies and Ministers should be enabled to influence commercial decisions of the banks. We had a touch of that in the past and it would lead to absolute chaos. It is not the ordinary people of Ireland who would benefit from that, rather it is the people on the inside track who would benefit again. The policy is no interference with commercial decisions and I will maintain that position. The Deputy is entitled to her alternative view but I think it is very misguided and would lead to corruption of the system if implemented, even on a partial basis, much less a widespread basis. The position is as I have outlined and I do not have anything further to add at this point.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">This question relates to Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and its role. I would like to hear the Minister's view of the recent independent assessment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and to state whether he intends to introduce changes or reforms to the council's work. I wish to raise also the issue of the recent fiscal assessment report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which deals with the spring economic statement. It made some sharp criticisms of the Government's approach to budgetary issues which I would like to thrash out with him.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_54" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_107">The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established in 2011 as part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland's budgetary architecture as envisaged in the programme for Government.  Subsequently, following approval of the fiscal compact treaty by referendum in 2012, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was placed on a statutory basis to fulfil the role of monitoring compliance with the fiscal rules under the Stability and Growth Pact and, following further EU reforms, subsequently given the endorsement role for the macroeconomic forecasts which underpin the budget. </p>
            <p eId="para_108"> In its recent fiscal assessment report, the council has again asserted its independence and produced some interesting pieces of analysis. While it is the case that I do not always agree with the outcome of the council's analysis, I very much value its expertise and its input as an independent voice in helping the Government to adhere to its own fiscal targets. </p>
            <p eId="para_109"> With regard to advice contained in the fiscal assessment report, as I have stated in the House previously, this is being considered by my officials.  As is normal, a comprehensive response to all of the pertinent issues will be published in the coming weeks. I will, however, give my initial views on a significant issue raised by the council.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">As the Deputy will be aware, from 2016 onwards, the public finances in Ireland will be subject to the requirements of the preventive arm of the SGP.  The European Commission assesses compliance with the preventive arm on the basis of two complementary pillars. The first is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark. The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are in theory designed to be complementary, although differences between the two metrics can emerge from time to time.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> The Fiscal Advisory Council noted that the fiscal projections contained in the stability programme update, SPU, did not show Ireland complying with our requirements under the Stability and Growth Pact - in other words, the improvement in our structural balance is below the required 0.6 percentage points in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> However, SPU estimates show that for Ireland compliance with the expenditure benchmark is consistent with delivering a lower suggested quantum of structural adjustment in 2016. This somewhat counterintuitive outcome was explicitly addressed in the SPU, and emphasises the material problems posed by some of the technical aspects of the rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_114"> It should be noted that compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact is ultimately assessed on the basis of analysis undertaken by the European Commission. In this context, the recent assessment of the SPU published by the European Commission as part of the European semester process finds that "on the basis of information in the 2015 Stability Programme Update recalculated according to the common methodology, progress towards the MTO is in line with the requirements of the preventive arm of the [Stability and Growth] Pact." The assessment by the Commission also finds that "the rate of expenditure growth net of discretionary revenue measures, as planned in the SPU, is expected to be in line with the requirements of the expenditure benchmark pillar". In summary, therefore, the projections in the SPU are consistent with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> While I will address other issues comprehensively in my formal response to the Council, I would strongly make the point that when formulating budget 2016, the Government is acutely aware of the importance of adhering to the fiscal rules and our fiscal policy will reflect this.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The Minister described the Fiscal Advisory Council’s recent report as “interesting pieces of analysis”. It is much more than that because it made some very sharp criticisms. It should be possible to establish, as a matter of fact, whether it is accurate. It states, for example, that the SPU the Minister presented and the budgetary projections do not take account of explicit Government commitments to reduce taxes beyond next year. In other words, the €1.5 billion the Minister promised in the budget for 2016 in terms of tax cuts and spending increases is factored in but the Minister has gone on the record as having said we will be in a position for expansionary budgets up to 2020, including tax cuts. The Fiscal Advisory Council claims that is not factored into the numbers and the budget projections. Similarly, it makes a very strong criticism that the likely cost of demographic aging, in terms of pressures on certain areas of public services, health and education are not factored in as well as the delivery of existing programmes. That is not an interesting piece of analysis. The Minister should be able to establish, as a matter of fact, whether it is accurate or inaccurate. The House needs the answers to those questions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Noonan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T14:55:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_117">I admire the work of the Fiscal Advisory Council and am in general agreement with its overall view of the fiscal policy that should be followed. In the SPU, however, I had to use the data to hand at the time and we made it quite clear in the SPU that as the data changed the compliance rates would change. Subsequent to the publication of the SPU, the Commission came out with a new set of figures. I do not know why but the Fiscal Advisory Council does not seem to have factored that in because the Commission has said we comply fully with the fiscal rules. The assessment by the Commission finds that "the rate of expenditure growth net of discretionary revenue measures, as planned in the SPU, is expected to be in line with the requirements of the expenditure benchmark pillar". Rather than our coming in at 0.4% or 0.3% of an adjustment as against 0.6% the Commission has said we will come in at 0.8% in the next budget on the basis of the new data. It is not the Department of Finance or the Fiscal Advisory Council that decide whether one is complying or not, it is the Commission and it is saying we are well within the boundaries of requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> On the Deputy’s other point, we made it quite clear that while we were spelling out the details of what was required for the 2016 budget beyond that we envisage a change of government. Maybe the same parties will compose it, maybe other parties will be in it. We said in the SPU that we were projecting on a no policy change but we did outline the fiscal space. The Deputy may regard that as a criticism but I do not think it would be appropriate for a government in its last year of office to do detailed budgets for the next five years; 2016 is within our remit, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are not. We identified the fiscal space. We said it was on a no policy change. It will be a matter for the next government to fit the policy into the fiscal space available but we did identify the fiscal space. </p>

The Minister should also accept the Fianna Fáil Party's recommendation that, as the general election approaches, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council be given the power to cost the proposals of all the political parties and Independent Members. To do so would be to do a great service to members of the public who will have to work out all the different noises emanating from the political parties about this or that being costed or not taken into account. Let the gospel be as per the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council when it comes to the election manifestos of different parties and the extent to which they are costed.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">Let the general public decide on that issue. The point is that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is essentially arguing that known costs which the State must incur - there is no element of discretion and nothing arbitrary about these, as they are eminently predictable - have not been factored into the projections. I refer to the impact that demographics will have on public services. Similarly, the tax cuts promised beyond 2016 have not been factored into the projections. This is written in black and white in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's report. If the Minister believes the council is wrong, he should say so and explain the reasons it is wrong. The council is independent, whereas the Minister is a politician.</p>

The council operates in very much the same space as the Government and me. There is disagreement about some elements of detail, and much of the detail the council has focused on is due to a misunderstanding of what was in the stability programme update. I do not know the reason the council did not take into account the forecasts of the European Commission and did not acknowledge the Commission's statement that, on current trends, the Government will be entirely within the fiscal rules on budget day. The Commission has stated that we will achieve an adjustment of 0.8%, rather than the 0.6% adjustment required. I will reply in detail, as I am required to under law, and we will deal with all the issues. However, I do not see any great conflict between me and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. The Deputy must appreciate that the council has a difficult job. As it is mandated to give a counter-view, it must search around for such a view, even when it agrees with me.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The Central Bank uses a number of methods to monitor compliance with consumer protection requirements, such as ongoing interaction with financial service providers and industry, themed inspections, general reviews on a particular topic, monitoring of financial services advertising, market intelligence and mystery shopping.  However, where a firm is not regulated, the Central Bank is not in a position to monitor voluntary compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. As a result, the Government introduced the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 to protect consumers. When enacted, this Bill will ensure that borrowers retain the protections they had before their loan books were sold, including the protections of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the consumer protection code.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">  The Bill provides for the regulation of the activity of credit servicing and the credit servicing firms engaged in such activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">This legislation will require all entities dealing with the consumer in this activity to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its codes of conduct.  Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, those who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise, they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. Either way, the entity dealing with the customer will be regulated and this will ensure that borrowers retain the protections they had before their loans were sold. The Bill was passed by the Dáil on 17 June and I look forward to its discussion on Second Stage in the Seanad tomorrow, 24 June.</p>

That was an outline of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill that is going through the Houses but it does not answer the questions asked on the voluntary agreement to participate in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. I can take it that the answer is that it does not make any difference really. How will the Bill apply retrospectively for those mortgage holders who are being moved against now? Will they be able to get the protections of the code when the Bill is passed? That is the critical question the Minister needs to answer now.</p>

The ruling of the Labour Court in the JJ Rhatigan case, where workers were paid €100,000 to basically get lost, suggests that this is happening, and continues to happen, on other sites which I will mention in a minute.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">I thank Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett for his question. Bogus self-employment in the context of the Deputy's question is generally accepted as referring to a practice of employers erroneously describing or treating employees as self-employed contractors.  As the Deputy may be aware, a number of questions have been put down by other Deputies in recent times on this issue, especially as it might relate to the construction sector. Similar to the PAYE system, the electronic relevant contracts tax, or eRCT, system is a tax deduction at source system.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">Neither system determines whether a person in the construction sector or, indeed, in any other sector is an employee or a self-employed contractor.  It is important to be clear, therefore, that the eRCT system does not determine whether a person is employed or self-employed.  </p>
            <p eId="para_148"> As with any contract of engagement in the construction sector, whether a person is engaged as an employee or as a self-employed contractor is determined by the facts and evidence of each case and guidance on that matter is provided in the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of Individuals which was prepared jointly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, business representative bodies and relevant State agencies. </p>
            <p eId="para_149"> In regard to bogus self-employment and the RCT1 system, the Finance Act 2007 placed a statutory obligation on principal contractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry sectors to submit to the Revenue Commissioners the details of relevant contracts entered into by those principals and their subcontractors.  Up to 1 January 2012, such details were submitted to the Revenue Commissioners on a form known as a form RCT1.  Under the eRCT system, which came into effect as and from 1 January 2012, form RCT1 is no longer used but the same obligation on principal contractors remains, albeit the information is now supplied electronically rather than in paper format.  </p>
            <p eId="para_150">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_151"> There are safeguards built into the eRCT system for those individuals who may have concerns that they are caught up in "bogus self-employment". For example, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that when they receive from principal contractors, in real time, the details of relevant contracts in the construction sector, Revenue immediately informs the relevant subcontractor or subcontractors of those details.   If a subcontractor is of the view that those details are incorrect, or if the subcontractor is of the view that she or he is not, in fact, a subcontractor but is an employee, then she or he can notify Revenue of those facts.  Revenue will then investigate the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_152"> As to investigating what the Deputy describes as possibly large losses in tax revenue to the Exchequer because of abuses of the RCT1 system, the construction sector is an acknowledged area of high risk internationally and Ireland is no different.  I am informed by Revenue that monitoring of the construction sector for abuses of the tax and duty systems forms part of its ongoing compliance programmes to which it commits significant resources. If the Deputy has specific information relating to individuals or businesses groups in any sector who are involved in tax evasion, he should send that to Revenue.  Revenue has provided a tailored template on its website which facilitates reporting of tax evasion and the relevant links are provided for the Deputy's information:  <i>http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/shadow-economy/index.html</i><i>  </i>and <i>https://www.ros.ie/online-enquiry-web/goodCitizen</i></p>

            <p eId="para_153">Will the Minister please get off the script and address what is a very serious issue? Currently, approximately 63,000 people are classified as being self-employed in construction, which accounts for about half of all construction workers. Are we seriously to believe that half of all those working in construction are entrepreneurs? I can tell the Minister they are not. If he wants examples, he should go out to the Gannon Homes site in Swords, a NAMA developer, where he will find people being misclassified as self-employed when they are not self-employed. They are not entrepreneurs; they are simply bricklayers being paid €100 a day. Similarly, this practice is going on at the Robswall site in Malahide just as it went on in Rhatigan's. It needs to be investigated but there seems to be no will on the Minister's part to ensure it is investigated. People who are clearly not self-employed subcontractors are being employed by builders in order for those builders to avoid paying PRSI, holiday pay and tax for those employees. The result of this practice is that Revenue is losing possibly hundreds of millions of euro in tax revenue each year because people are being misclassified. This is tax fraud. It is a criminal offence and the Minister has shown no interest in tackling it.</p>

That is the document that decides between employees and self-employed people; it is not a matter for the tax authorities.

            <p eId="para_159">No, I want the Minister to take responsibility for tax fraud. The allegations are that this is rampant in the construction industry and on sites involving big public contracts. We saw this happen in Rhatigan's and it had to pay €100,000. Did it have to pay it because everything was squeaky clean? No, it was because it was abusing the system. This is tax fraud. It is a crime. If contractors and subcontractors are misclassifying people as being self-employed when in fact they are employing those people directly, that is the business of Revenue and it is the business of the Government, collectively, to ensure inspections take place. I mentioned two sites. The inspectors need to be sent to those sites now. This practice is going on as we speak at the Gannon Homes site in Swords, a former NAMA site, and at the Robswall site in Malahide. Rhatigan's, which, as we know, was involved in such practice arising from the dispute in Kishoge, also has four or five other sites where it is currently building schools. This practice is rampant and the result is that €167 million was deducted last year in RCT but €139 million was given back. Therefore, only €27 million is being collected in tax from 63,000 employees. It is an absolute joke.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_167">From July 2015, lone parents with children aged seven and older will no longer be entitled to the one-parent family payment. This has become known as the Burton cut but, more than that, it is a brutal cut that will plunge thousands more children into consistent poverty, on top of all the other cuts that have affected lone parent families. Up to 30,000 lone parent families will be affected by this particular move. Thousands of those will have severe income reductions as a result, with some losing up to €140 a week. Others, for example, a lone parent working 20 hours a week on a minimum wage, will face a cut of €108 a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I do not understand how the Government can even contemplate introducing such a measure at the end of this month. The Taoiseach would know, and Fintan O'Toole put it very well in his article this morning in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that "A lone parent can't ditch a child and go off to work without access to education, childcare and a stable job with a living wage". This cut comes on top of a series of welfare cuts that have affected families, low-income families in particular, and lone parent families. The back to school allowance was cut by one third. The income disregard for lone parent families was cut by €147 a week to €90 a week. Community employment schemes, which were availed of significantly by lone parent families, have been gutted. There have been taxation changes that have impacted particularly hard on separated and lone parent families. The issue of access to education has not improved, and we have no Scandinavian child care model. The result of all of that is that consistent child poverty increased from approximately 6.8% in 2008 to almost double that percentage, 12%, in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> The policy is not working. It is not getting lone parents back to work. It is having the opposite impact and it is driving people further out of work and into poverty. Some 60% of lone parents who were getting the one-parent family payment were working part-time outside the home in 2012. In 2014, that had gone down to 36%. My simple question to the Taoiseach is will the Government will reverse this policy and stop its implementation at the commencement of July?</p>

          <p eId="para_170">It is not intended to reverse it, and I will explain to Deputy Martin why. The Government has a particular programme to make work pay. We cannot allow a situation, in an economy that is recovering like ours, which bypasses thousands of households that are locked into joblessness. That has been one of the real difficulties for so many families. Jobless households with children are at particular risk of perpetuating a cycle of poverty that goes on from generation to generation.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">The purpose of the phased scheme is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency, an aim with which I am sure Deputy Martin agrees.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> From when this scheme was introduced back in 1997 until the end of 2010, recipient numbers increased by 50% and annual expenditure increased by €772 million every year. Despite the significant levels of investment - in excess of €1 billion per annum from 2009 to 2012 - it has not been successful in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty compared to the population as a whole. In 2004, lone parents were at more than 4.5 times greater risk of consistent poverty when compared with the remainder of the population. That is not something we can stand over.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">Prior to the reforms, lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18 years of age, or 22 if the child was in full-time education. The non-conditional nature of the payment, coupled with its very long duration, consigned many lone parents and their children to long-term dependency on welfare, which is not a good position to be in.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">The Taoiseach should put aside those written notes that someone gives to him to read out in answer to Leaders' Questions. He should go out and meet the people who are affected. The Taoiseach is out of touch and completely detached from the reality on the ground. The policy is not working. In 2012, 60% of lone parents on the one-parent family payment were actually at work outside the home. In 2014, the figure is 36%. It is counterintuitive, as those who are actually at work are losing the most out of this. They are being absolutely hammered as a result of this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I put it to the Taoiseach that, not so long ago, the Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, said: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_200">I will only proceed with the measures to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that I get a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of such a system of child care enjoyed by the Scandinavians by the time of this year's budget. If this is not forthcoming, the measure will not proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Recently in the Dáil, when Deputy Willie O'Dea asked the Tánaiste about this commitment she made, she replied, "[T]he delivery and expansion of child care services is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs." I know I cannot use the word "lie", but I will use the phrase "broken promise". Was that not a basic untruth? Would the Taoiseach accept that the Tánaiste has reneged on a cast-iron commitment that she gave to the Dáil, the public and the various lone parent family organisations that she would not introduce the measure she is introducing in a couple of weeks unless there was a Scandinavian-type child care model? We know we do not have that. Is that not a broken promise? Does the Taoiseach accept that the Tánaiste has reneged on her commitment and that the policy is clearly not working?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">In 2012, a very harrowing report by the independent child death review group, which documented the deaths of 196 children in State care, deeply shocked many citizens. The report's conclusions were a serious indictment of child protection systems and maintained that the State had abdicated its duty in respect of some young people and failed to provide adequate child protection support. The Taoiseach will recall that key recommendations of the report included independent reviews into the deaths of ten children and for aftercare to be put on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Three years later, only one of these recommendations has been implemented. The result is that some young people in State care are now being left without adequate support when they turn 18 and these young people are being exposed to exploitation and violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> When the report of the independent child death review group was first published, the Taoiseach said it detailed a litany of shame. The then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs described it as harrowing and promised that an implementation plan would be developed, but it never was. Is the Government's failure over the course of three years to implement the findings of this most shocking report not an indictment of the Government's record in protecting the most vulnerable of our young citizens who are in the care of the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_229">As the Deputy knows, the Government and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs have set up the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which is very well funded. The Minister is acutely aware of the nature of the difficulties and challenges that face many children who are in difficult and vulnerable positions. Clearly, this is an issue that he has worked on, and he is making preparations in respect of the discussions that will take place prior to the budget in October. I accept that not all of the recommendations on the litany of issues that were raised in the report have been implemented. The Minister has prepared his report and, hopefully, the discussions he is to have in the period ahead will lead to some improvement in that situation, which I agree is not satisfactory.</p>

        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_230">As the Taoiseach said, Tusla was established to improve children's services. He said it was well funded, yet Tusla recently cut funding to Rape Crisis Network Ireland and women's centres and said that part of its problem was that it did not have the funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"><i>The Irish Times</i> has a report today about a HIQA review of Tusla inspections last year, and I have read the executive summary of this review. HIQA found inconsistencies in the safety and quality of children's services and said that this caused major concern. It also found significant delays in assessing the needs of children and families where there were reports of suspected abuse or neglect. There was evidence that children at risk of harm did not have timely access to social workers or vital supports, and others who are dealing with children, including teachers, have told me they have the same difficulty in getting timely access to social workers or vital supports. The Taoiseach should read the report, or at least the executive summary. HIQA says it is concerned that management systems may not be adequate to provide consistently safe services. Some services cannot meet the needs of children with challenging behaviour and, as a result, HIQA is to commence a review of Tusla's governance arrangements in 2015, which I very much welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The question is what the Government is doing. It has failed to implement key recommendations of the independent child death review in 2012, a point the Taoiseach did not respond to in his earlier reply. Now, HIQA is so concerned about governance arrangements in Tusla, the very body that was set up following the scandal of the deaths of so many young people in care, that it is to commence a review of these arrangements. Does this not call into question the Government's child service strategy, including the funding of services? Would the Taoiseach not recognise this as a crisis and explain how he proposes to deal with this crisis?</p>

          <p eId="para_235">In the first instance, Tusla, the dedicated Child and Family Agency, has been established. It is chaired by one of the authors of the report, as the Deputy knows. Some key reforms that are being implemented as part of that work include the national service delivery framework and national policy guidelines across a range of areas such as welfare, protection and alternative care. They also include the development of the child protection notification system to secure the safety of children at risk from harm by improving communication and information sharing. There is much greater emphasis on early intervention and prevention, and work is being done through the roll-out of the Meitheal model, the prevention partnership and the family support programme, as well as a dedicated aftercare service to standardise the delivery of leaving and aftercare services. As promised, the Children First Bill has been published. It was recently strengthened and clarified in regard to some of the recommendations-----</p>

          <p eId="para_237">-----and it is currently before the Oireachtas being debated, as the Deputy is aware. A Bill to provide a statutory right to an aftercare plan is currently being drafted and will be published shortly. Since the publication of the review group's report, HIQA has continued its work in reviewing both fostering and child protection and welfare services, and is supporting the aim of continuously improving these. Finally, following the publication of the review group's report, the national panel process for the review of child deaths has been greatly strengthened. Guidance for the national panel review was revised and published last year. HIQA now has a very specific oversight role in auditing the independence of that panel, and the panel reports directly to the board of Tusla under the new arrangements. These are some of the areas of work that are currently under way following that.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">Greece is in a state of humanitarian and economic catastrophe. It is in that state because of the austerity imposed by the troika and implemented by New Democracy and PASOK. Wages have fallen by 37%, public sector employment by over 25% and pensions by almost 50%. The result is an explosion of homelessness, unemployment, suicide, poverty and misery for the Greek people, and an economy that has shrunk by almost a third.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The purpose of this austerity, like our own, was to bail out German and French banks. Of all of the so-called bailout funds that went into Greece, less than 10% has gone into the Greek economy. It is for that reason that the Greek debt truth committee, set up by the Greek Parliament, has found the debt to the troika to be illegal, illegitimate and odious. In response, Syriza was elected to tackle the humanitarian crisis, to end austerity and to demand a debt write-down. The response from the EU authorities has been to try to strangle at birth the hopes of a different Europe, of a Europe that would not be run for the millionaires but instead would be run for the millions. The democratic wishes of the Greek people, expressed in an election, have been casually tossed aside by those authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> A key player in this has been the unelected, unaccountable European Central Bank, which previously held a gun to the head of the Irish Government, demanding that we go into a bailout and that bondholders not be burned. It has a noose around the neck of the Greek economy in the form of restricted access to ECB funding for Greek banks, and it is using that noose to threaten the collapse of the Greek banks in order to demand the humiliation of the Greek Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I reject the Deputy's speculative comments on leaks from the Eurogroup. The Minister for Finance has been consistently very clear in his support for growth-related proposals from Greece. I attended the meeting last night with the Prime Minister and other leaders from the eurozone countries. The feeling at the meeting was unanimous that there should not be, under any circumstances, an exit by Greece from the eurozone. Leaders, as they have done previously, were very clear in their support, encouragement and assistance for the Greek Prime Minister and his Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> The Prime Minister spoke very positively about the current situation and said the new proposals on the table from Greece went very much in the right direction towards meeting the principles, objectives and targets set by the institutions. Clearly, there is a gap between them at the moment but the Prime Minister was very clear that it is his intention to be able to come to a conclusion on these negotiations this week so that the matter can be dealt with and Greece can continue to be a strong member of the eurozone. He referred to pensions, early retirement, reduction of debt and the issues his Government had put on the table. The institutions responded to that in a way that today and tonight, in respect of the both the principals of the institutions and two Government Ministers from Greece, conference calls, as necessary, be put in place so that discussions can conclude on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The outcome of this has to be fair, make economic sense and be sustainable from a financial point of view. The Prime Minister was very clear that he wants his country to be able to pay its way and contribute but under no circumstances to leave the eurozone. The Deputy wants to continue speculating, which is his prerogative. I will give him a direct report from the meeting of all of the leaders of the countries in the eurozone, including the contribution from the Prime Minister of Greece and his summing up afterwards. Everybody hopes that this matter can be dealt with by the weekend.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">The Taoiseach referred to speculative comments. I will quote from the <i>Financial Times</i>, which stated: "Germany's Wolfgang Schaeuble and Michael Noonan, his Irish counterpart, pushed for curbs on emergency liquidity for Greek banks unless capital controls were imposed, one of the officials said." Translated, that means: "Tighten the noose. Make them scream. Bring them to their knees. Humiliate them." I ask the Taoiseach to conform to what he said a couple of weeks ago, that is, answering questions fully and completely. Is that the position of the Irish Government? It is attempting to put pressure on the ECB, a supposedly independent institution, to squeeze the Greeks further in order to pressurise them into doing a deal which is not one they want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I remind the Taoiseach of June 2012 when he and the then Tánaiste, like Chamberlain declaring, "Peace in our time", announced there had been a seismic shift and that we would get a deal on debt. That has since been quietly shelved and instead the Irish Government, along with Germany, has joined the chorus that there will be no debt write-offs. It is in the interests of working people, the majority in this country, that Greece gets a debt write-down and that we join with the Greeks and demand a debt write-down for all of the unsustainable debt. Why does the Taoiseach persist in backing the Angela Merkel pro-austerity line so he can get a few more pats on the head? </p>

          <p eId="para_254">One should not believe everything one reads in the <i>Financial Times</i>. That is the message. The ECB is completely independent of Governments. It has given €87 billion in emergency liquidity to Greece. Mr. Draghi said given its independence, because it is a eurozone, ELA has been continued on the assumption that negotiations would conclude and a deal can be done. That is why, as the programme ends this weekend, it is very important that the principals of the institutions discuss in a rational way with the representatives of the Government of Greece the conclusion that is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The Prime Minister said not everything about his Government is absolutely positive. He said his Government is in a position to achieve social consent, which is an important element given that the consequences of a collapse could be very serious. I do not expect that to happen. All of the leaders at the meeting were unanimous in that regard. I expect there will be another meeting of the Eurogroup Ministers for Finance tomorrow evening, which may go on for some time, and there is a European Council meeting on Thursday and Friday. It may not be necessary to get that far but when arrangements like this are put in place, they have to be endorsed by, for example, the Parliaments of Finland-----</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_174">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_266">Given the two issues that have emerged, I am interested, in particular, in the number of times the sub-committees have met. It seems to me that the issue of child poverty has reached alarming levels. The number of children in consistent poverty has almost doubled in two years under the Government's watch, from about 6% to 12%. It is a shocking statistic which has been commented on by the United Nations and various NGOs with responsibility for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_267">It has been exacerbated by cuts of one third to the back to school allowance, from €150 to €100 for primary school children and €250 to €200 for secondary school children. Up to 138,000 children live in poverty but I do not detect any strategic response to this issue in any shape or form. The latest manoeuvre, or decision, is to take 30,000 people out of the one-parent family payment, which we discussed earlier. When it is all added up, it is blow after blow. Take housing, for example, up to 1,000 children are living in hotel rooms in Dublin alone. I was canvassing last week within a mile of this House and noted some of the conditions in which children had to play were quite appalling and absolutely unacceptable. There seems to be no response whatsoever to this real serious crisis in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> The Economic Management Council has been extremely weak and is not meeting often enough to deal with the social dimension of the Government’s economic and financial policies, policies which the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has stated successively and consistently target low-income families and lone-parent families and, in particular, exacerbate the number of children now in consistent property. Will the Economic Management Council, as well as the other relevant Cabinet committees, such as the child care and health committees, meet more often in June and July to develop meaningful and urgent emergency responses to the various factors that give rise to, and increase, such consistent child poverty? These responses should cover the very basics of access to child care and basic incomes. They should allow children to get back to school without undue cost and for parents to get a roof over their heads without the necessity of sofa-surfing, which many of them have to do, as well as asking relatives to look after their children while they try to get rental accommodation which they cannot afford because the rent cap has been introduced and limits them. The rent allowance is not sustainable. When one adds up all the policies, it is a very sorry story in terms of the Government’s lack of coherence in its response to dealing with children in consistent poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_269"> I also want the Economic Management Council to meet more often in June and July to deal with the crisis in research policy. Back in March, an extraordinary letter was published in <i>The Irish Times</i>, signed by many eminent and highly qualified researchers such as Tom Cotter and Luke Drury, which stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_270">The policy of sustained investment in scientific excellence that helped build a vibrant scientific community in Ireland over the past 15 years has given way to a short-sighted drive for commercialisable research in a very limited set of prescribed areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_271">It is a damning indictment of the Government’s policy on research with its undermining of basic research and its lack of comprehension on the need for a proper balance between basic research and applied research, which will ultimately lead to a proper research environment. As a result of this, our universities are going down the world rankings because of the crisis in the research community. Recently, the general secretary of IFUT, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, Mike Jennings, spoke about the transient, roll-over and short-term nature of research and the crisis in the provision of a proper and secure employment framework for researchers in Irish universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> I am not sure if the Taoiseach is familiar with the Tyndall National Institute. The Economic Management Council, however, would be aware that this institute is being marketed and described as the premier research facility in the country. There has been an ongoing industrial relations problem there, however, simply because these world-class researchers are not getting the same entitlements as those who work in University College Cork up the road. It is quite shocking. As a former enterprise Minister, I was involved in supporting this institute. IDA Ireland brings many multinational companies there to showcase the quality of Irish research. On her visit to Cork, the Queen’s first port of call was the Tyndall National Institute. The problem is that it has been fighting for years to achieve recognition for its status.</p>
            <p eId="para_273"> National University of Ireland Galway recently astonished the Labour Court by stating its policy was that not one single researcher in its employment was entitled to the same job security afforded to all public servants in return for accepting significant cuts in salary. Maynooth University tried to convince the authorities that the researchers it employed were not employees but guests. The Labour Court did not take that on board. University College Cork has begun using the term hosting to describe its relationship with people who enhance the international profile of the college by engaging in appropriate research.</p>

            <p eId="para_275">Research is fundamental to economic policy. I have spoken about it with many people recently. I was involved in it myself when implementing the Science Foundation Ireland strategy from 2006 to 2011. It is the cornerstone of the country’s future in economic potential, competitiveness and capacity to innovate but is going down the tubes under the Taoiseach’s Government because there is no coherent strategy. Will he confirm that the Economic Management Council will meet far more often and have this issue on its agenda, along with the consistent child poverty issue?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_276">The Deputy raised several issues. Dealing with Cabinet sub-committees in the normal structure of the Dáil week on a Tuesday and Wednesday, I found it became impossible to get anything done because of this kind of business, questions, other debates and all of that taking up time. Accordingly, I devote one Monday in the month to Cabinet sub-committee meetings from eight in the morning right through. If necessary, I will try to fit in one that has to be recalled for other reasons during the course of a normal working week, which is not that easy to do. This structure has worked well in that priorities and problems can be identified and one can request and demand that Ministers and Departments respond within specific time limits to these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_277"> One cannot tackle the problem of low-income families and child poverty as effectively as one would like until one has an economy that is functioning strongly and will provide one with the resources to do that. That is why the Government’s mandate was to fix the public finances and put the country back to work. That is why I am pleased that 104,000 new jobs have been created since the action plan was published in 2012 and we expect 40,000 to be created this year and again for the following two years. By 2018, whatever party is in office, we will practically have full employment and anyone who wants a job will get one.</p>
            <p eId="para_278"> Generally, the best opportunity to deal with low-income problems is a job. That is why one of the first decisions the Government made in dealing with the troika was to restore the minimum wage. I was explaining to the Greek Prime Minister last night that when the troika demanded of and dictated to Deputy Martin’s Government that this is what it has to do-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_279">No, that is not what happened.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_179">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_280">In many cases those recommendations were not acceptable to this Government. If they were not, the Government was required to cost alternatives which would achieve the same growth objective. That is why one of the first decisions was to reverse the cut in the minimum wage that had been brought in by the previous Government. Despite economic constraints, there are now 420,000 people who do not have any liability for the universal social charge. That will increase to 500,000 people in the October budget, taking a further 80,000 people out of that bracket.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">The focus of the Government in terms of income has been on earners of €75,000 down to €30,000 who have had to pay for everything. The real priority is in there, hard-pressed working families in many cases. While the situation has improved, I am the first to say it is not yet the way we want it to be and we still have quite a distance to go.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> The Deputy spoke earlier about some of the issues in respect of lone parents. I did not have time to say the single parent child carer tax credit is €1,650 per annum and this has the effect of reducing the claimant's tax liability by €31.73 a week, which is an important consideration for a person in that position. In addition, that claimant may also be entitled to an extension in the rate band of €4,000, which would increase the rate band for 2015 from €33,800 to €37,800 which is an important element. Where income exceeds €37,800, that additional rate band is worth a maximum of €840 or €16.15 per week. These are deliberate changes to impact beneficially on lower-paid people. The maximum value of the credit in the additional rate band is €2,490 or €47.88 a week, and this credit is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full-time education. As well as this, as the Tánaiste has already pointed out, there is the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement which is important. The back to work family dividend is designed to further improve the incentive of taking up employment for people with children. It will allow lone parents transitioning from the jobseeker's allowance to retain their increase for a qualified child if they move off welfare and into employment. There is the re-rating of the family income supplement and enhanced access to the Intreo service, which is now a very different animal than it used to be as people are spoken to and interviewed in respect of their ambitions, motivation, experience and willingness to work. We also have JobsPlus and the changes that have been made in child care, and further work is going on.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> Child poverty is an issue for everybody. It is important that something be done about it. This is why these changes in the welfare area are all positive. The difference in what the Government did in meeting the targets to allow us to move out of the bailout programme was to remain competitive, not increase income tax and have pro-growth proposals which have now led to a point where this country is recognised internationally, as the Deputy knows, as being exceptionally attractive for investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_284"> The Deputy raised a number of important points about the Tyndall National Institute and other areas around the country. We have the major success of the web summit every year and all of the people who work on it. Up to 25,000 people will participate this year. This has all to do with research and innovation to an extraordinary degree. At the other end of the scale-----</p>

            <p eId="para_286">-----5,000 young children presented their particular proposals at a gaming and science fair recently which was quite exceptional. I was at a firm in Sandyford recently and it was interesting to see two ends of the research and innovation spectrum. Some of the brightest students from universities all over the world were at the plant concerned speaking to and being mentored by Irish peers in terms of the research and the innovative work they do. At the lower end of the scale, they had teams of children aged six or seven who are now well ensconced in CoderDojo which is an important voluntary movement. These children mentor their own age group on the writing of code which makes computers work and think.</p>

The Deputy has to make his case, but let me assure him this is one of the real focuses and priorities of the Government. As pointed out by Mr. Ferguson of Science Foundation Ireland, we do not have the money to invest in everything but we do have money to invest in research, innovation and development, and there is a great deal of it going on. Perhaps I can take details from the Deputy later of the problem in so far as industrial relations are concerned. I know Her Majesty went down to the Tyndall National Institute and I was there myself once or twice. It is a fabulous location, no more than many others around the country in universities.</p>

When we ask questions about how often these committees meet and how many of them the Taoiseach attends it is obviously an attempt to try to figure it out, hold the Government to account and ensure there is sufficient delivery for citizens.

            <p eId="para_296">If I try to come to a sense of the efficiency of these committees, it has to be based on the results. I will present very briefly three issues I have raised consistently. I have called for a root and branch fully independent inquiry into all care facilities for citizens with intellectual disabilities. We have had three reports, one on Áras Attracta and HIQA reports on Redwood and, most recently, St. Mary's in Drumcar. These are the most vulnerable people in the care of the State. With regard to the questions I raised earlier, the Taoiseach acknowledged without a blink that the Government had not implemented all the recommendations of a report which reviewed the deaths of 196 children in the care of the State. He said the Government's intention is to do so. He has not done it and he has only whatever time he has left in this term. An issue which has almost become normal is citizens on trolleys, including most recently two citizens who were alive during 1916. Today, there are 397 patients on trolleys, 41 of whom are in my constituency in Our Lady of Lourdes-----</p>

            <p eId="para_302">I will come to the conclusion. Here are three critical issues. There is the business of patients on trolleys. We are in the height of summer with glorious weather and these are figures we normally have at the height of winter. There is a crisis. The Taoiseach talks about a recovery. Do not talk about a fair recovery. It is not a fair recovery if the Government does not implement recommendations and just dismisses a request for an inquiry into the way we treat citizens with intellectual disabilities or if we just ignore the fact that in June 2015, after four years of Government, almost 400 patients are on trolleys and other patients in hospital beds cannot be released because although they have been medically discharged, it is not safe to bring them home because of the cuts made by the Government to protections and the necessities of life. Is this is not how we should judge, not by how many meetings and how many the Taoiseach attends, and this is all important, but by results? On these three issues the Taoiseach batted away a serious question today and has not even responded to the request for an investigation into care centres for citizens with intellectual disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_303">There is ongoing dreadfulness in hospital corridors with people on trolleys, if they are lucky enough to get trolleys. Is that not a way to judge the efficacy of these committees?</p>

            <p eId="para_304">The Deputy will recall that I read out for him the fact that 25 recommendations were made by the report and all of these were not implemented. The Deputy would certainly have a valid reason to say something very different if I said they had been implemented. I pointed out to the Deputy the recommendations where work was under way and it is the intention to implement all of those. Of course, every issue that the Deputy or any other Deputy raises is perfectly valid. With regard to the question of trolleys, he has had this discussion before with the Minister for Health on many occasions.</p>

            <p eId="para_310">The question is how to deal with all these issues. The transition and the work under way in the Department of Health will certainly not be easy to conclude successfully. Every person I meet who has been through the health system and had treatment has nothing but the highest regard for those who work on the front line, including nurses, doctors etc. The problem in our system is getting in to get that treatment. Trolley numbers are not as high as they used to be but they are still too high. Clearly, the issue has been addressed, in part, by the Government in making further funding available in the transition to the setting up of the hospital groups. That is complex because in some areas they are all HSE hospitals and in others, there are private or voluntary hospitals involved. Careful scrutiny is required so that there can be responsibility allocated to each group. This will eventually transition to a trust to make decisions about what services can be best supplied in an area.</p>
            <p eId="para_311"> A senior consultant said to me only last week that we could look at it in the following way. He said that in his hospital, the question is what it does as well or better than anybody else, as if a hospital cannot measure up in the standards of what it does, the hospital fails itself, the patient and the system. Many accident and emergency departments are under pressure but all have escalation plans in place to manage the movement of patients through the system in a safe, controlled and planned way. That supports and ensures the delivery of patient care.</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> The task force convened in December last year had the purpose of providing focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges of overcrowded accident and emergency departments. The Deputy knows from the experience of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital the problems that can cause pressure because of the footprint, the numbers of people coming through and the stress that staff experience. The HSE published the task force action plan in April with a range of time-defined actions to optimise the existing hospital and community capacity, develop internal capability to deal with the issues as they arise and improve leadership, governance, planning and oversight.</p>
            <p eId="para_313"> On top of that and based on that report, there was an extra allocation of €74 million provided in 2015 to increase the number of long-term nursing home care places and reduce the waiting time for the funding in such places, as well as providing additional care, beds and home care packages that would provide viable supports for those who no longer need acute hospital care. I saw reports on that recently and if people are asked their preference, they will of course say they prefer to be at home for as long as possible. The additional funding came on top of some budgetary measures, when the Government provided an extra €25 million to support alternatives to and relieve pressure on acute hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> The number of delayed discharges is reducing steadily to a current figure of 650, or a reduction of over 20% since November last year. The waiting time for funding under the nursing home support scheme has reduced from 11 weeks at the beginning of the year to four weeks at the moment, which is a significant improvement. The numbers waiting for the support scheme funding have reduced to 535 and are stable; the funding is set to support an additional 1,604 people this year. I understand that 1,513 transitional care places were provided in the first four months of this year and that will benefit patients who require a transfer from the acute hospital system. There are 140 from a total of 173 additional short-stay, non-acute beds available in public units across the country, and the remaining numbers will be provided over the next number of weeks. The Deputy knows that Mount Carmel opened on target in April and that will provide a further 65 beds by the end of this month, with 45 currently in place, which is welcome. An additional 400 home care packages have been provided to specific hospitals in the greater Dublin area since January this year, with a further 860 additional home care packages to be provided from June to the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_315"> I spoke to relations of a good lady who was approved for a home care package quite recently and it is extraordinary to hear of the change in her comfort and convenience arising from a good home care package. It can complement their private resources and make for a very comfortable position for the person in question. We need to see more of that rather than having people transition at a very early stage into a long-stay institution, where they may not wish to be in the first instance, until they might have to go because of physical or medical conditions.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_324">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 to 10, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> I was invited by Professor Klaus Schwab to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum and I travelled to Davos for 21 January to 23 January. The annual meeting is attended by political and business leaders and heads of international organisations from across the globe. The theme of this year’s meeting was "The new global context". On Wednesday evening, 21 January, I attended a function hosted by Professor Schwab, executive chairman of the forum, and this was also attended by other heads of government and the business council of the World Economic Forum. On the Thursday morning I participated in a high level plenary session to discuss economic growth and political stability in Europe. The other panellists in the discussion were Sigmar Gabriel, Vice Chancellor and Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany; Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands; Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma of Latvia and the then Prime Minister of Finland, Alexander Stubb.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> For the past four years, I have hosted an IDA Ireland dinner as part of Ireland's participation in the World Economic Forum. Each year, IDA Ireland has secured representation at the very highest levels from both existing and prospective foreign direct investment clients from some of the world’s largest multinational corporations and future technology leaders for this dinner event. There were 23 companies represented this year and these companies employ approximately 24,000 people in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_327">I outlined Ireland's path towards economic recovery and how we are steadily moving up the global competitiveness rankings. I emphasised that Ireland today is a key location of choice for manufacturing, services, research and development and strategic investments, noting also our young well educated and flexible workforce. I acknowledged the vital contribution that many of the companies represented had made to Ireland and to our economy and urged those who were looking at potential locations for investment or expansion to consider Ireland. IDA Ireland is actively following up on discussions regarding potential employment and investment projects with a number of these companies. I firmly support the IDA Ireland view that attendance at this event greatly enhances awareness of Ireland as a potential foreign direct investment location. In addition, I undertook media engagements alongside IDA Ireland, and held bilateral meetings with eight existing and prospective foreign direct investment companies, which employ approximately 700,000 globally and over 7,000 people in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_328"> While in Davos, I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand. I congratulated the Prime Minister on his return to office following the September elections in New Zealand. We discussed the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and New Zealand and ways of expanding trade and investment between our two countries, noting that we both have small, open and vibrant economies. We also noted that our two countries are unique in the world in our agricultural practices and could benefit from information-sharing and expanded trade in this area. We discussed the challenges of hosting the Rugby World Cup and Ireland's bid to host part of the 2023 event.</p>
            <p eId="para_329"> I did not meet with the President of Ukraine in Davos.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> The World Economic Forum provides an exceptional opportunity to interact with key players in the business world and I availed of every opportunity to promote Ireland as a key location for international business and investment. Participation in the World Economic Forum has helped achieve positive outcomes in terms of investment into Ireland in the past and will continue to do so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_205">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_331">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. At the start we should note that most of these questions were tabled over five months ago. The delay is not just because of the nature of Taoiseach's Question Time. The Taoiseach halved the number of Taoiseach's questions periods when he came into government four years ago, taking out one day of Taoiseach's questions. He also does not reschedule when he cancels on a Tuesday. That has allowed a significant backlog to build up. I have asked him to address this, but nothing has been done over the past four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> The Taoiseach spoke about the plenary session on economic growth that he attended and his main message at Davos was that Ireland was open for business and that he was not going to drift into populism. He said that at the time because it was before the general election in Greece. That promise did not last too long. I have noticed in his remarks that he creates a political narrative that suits his own party's situation. It is not today or yesterday that Ireland became a focal point for inward investment, particularly for high-end manufacturing. It is a policy that has been successfully implemented over a 30-year period, if not longer, in terms of both our place in Europe and our low corporation tax, which have been essential ingredients in attracting inward investment. He must accept that when he is talking to multinational companies, as he did in Davos, which employ 24,000 people, as he said, although of course many more thousands are employed than that, key reasons they are here are long-term investment in people, in our education system and research, and the long-term basis of key public policies, such as our pro-European Union position and our low corporation tax. The Taoiseach tends to place the emphasis on a shortened period and he does not talk up the consistency of long-term policy in Ireland, which is the cornerstone. That is what gives certainty to those who invest and have invested over a long period of time, particularly in the life sciences and technology - the Intels and Pfizers of this world. Does the Taoiseach share the view of multinational investors that long-term investment in people and ideas is central to why they are here?</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> That leads me to a further question. If the Taoiseach believes in that, and he knows that was a key theme at Davos, as it has been for many years, how can the disproportionate cuts to third and fourth level education help Ireland's reputation in attracting foreign direct investment? How can we face the chief executives with a straight face and talk up our investment in education and research while in reality there have been significant cuts to investment in third and fourth level education and research? Only a few months ago, an unprecedented letter from some of our most senior researchers across the country was published, which complained about the lack of funding for basic research in science. They said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_334">As scientists in Ireland and Irish scientists abroad, we are committed to making our contribution to Ireland’s recovery by doing the best and most innovative research possible. However, we are deeply concerned about the research policies implemented by the current Government. The policy of sustained investment in scientific excellence that helped build a vibrant scientific community in Ireland over the past 15 years has given way to a short-sighted drive for commercialisable research in a very limited set of prescribed areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_335">I discussed that earlier in terms of the Cabinet committee. I do so now in terms of the key message of Davos. They also said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_336">Along with an investment in research that is below the EU average, steadily decreasing core grants to universities, and a constant demand to increase student numbers, these policies are creating a perfect storm for scientific research and education in Ireland and are undermining our abilities to carry out world-class research, to retain scientific talent in the country and also to educate future scientists and build a real and sustainable knowledge economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_337">What they are saying flies in the face of the official pronouncements, the rhetoric and the political narrative and it is extremely worrying. Well over 100 scientists, both in Ireland and abroad, have put their names to this plea to sort out what is going on in third and fourth level and to change our policy, which is overly reliant on the applied side, ignoring the fundamental importance of basic research both to a proper third level system and to a proper research environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> In addition, I was not just talking earlier about industrial relations in Ireland, but the absence of career pathways in Ireland for researchers. Researchers in Ireland are now expected to spend ten years without any contract or any security whatsoever. It is not sustainable in terms of building a world-class research environment. Many researchers will leave the country if something is not done about it. Many of the presentations at Davos, and the Taoiseach's own comments there, will mean very little if they are not backed up by a sustained, coherent science and research policy, which the Taoiseach currently does not have. That is the reason for the extraordinary situation I outlined earlier as described in an article written by Mike Jennings, who is the general secretary of the Irish Federation of University Teachers. I acknowledge he has an interest in representing his members, but he is saying that "[t]he vast majority of the estimated 5,000 full-time researchers attached to Irish higher-education institutions work on externally funded and temporary, insecure contracts" and the emphasis of the universities is on keeping them at one remove, short term and contractual. That is what is happening. If one talks to any researcher, they cannot get mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> The Government says we want to become the beacon of research and to attract the best and the brightest to research. It says we want people to do PhDs, but it cut the funding for PhDs. I do not know why it did that. It cut the postgraduate research grants. It is an extraordinary, counterintuitive measure, which hardly mattered in terms of its impact on the public finances, yet the former Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, went ahead and did it, aided and abetted by the Taoiseach. It all flies in the face of what the Taoiseach is saying on his plenary panels and at the plenary meetings. There is a contrast between rhetoric and reality. Language becomes meaningless when he reads out the prepared scripts to the great and the good at Davos, but back on the ranch, on the university campuses and in the Tyndalls of this world, the world-class researchers see they are being discriminated against in contrast to employees in secure positions in universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_340">The Government is not serious about research and researchers. If one looks at all of the areas, from the Tyndall to NUI Galway and Maynooth University, right across the board the approach is that researchers are not a permanent part of the landscape. In fact, they are a temporary, insecure and revolving-door type operation, and the turnover is key.</p>
            <p eId="para_341"> This all flies in the face of European policy, the European research area, ERA, approach, the innovation Union and the Horizon 2020 programme that the former Commissioner, Ms Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, outlined last year, all of which emphasised attracting and retaining competent researchers. Giving them security was essential to a long-term impactful research policy. It needs an urgent response from Government because the reality on the ground is a far cry from the kind of high-flowing rhetoric that one articulates and hears at meetings such as Davos. I respectfully put it to the Taoiseach that the Government is living a lie on this one and there is no connection between the rhetoric and the reality on the ground.</p>

            <p eId="para_342">I do not know whether the Taoiseach read the Oxfam report published before last year's Davos conference. It warned against global inequality and pointed out that the richest 1% would own more than the rest of the world's population by next year. At last year's Davos meeting, Oxfam reported that the 85 richest persons on the planet had the same wealth as the poorest 50% or 3.5 billion people. Inequality and the poverty that grows from it, I would argue, is the greatest threat to human progress and stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_343"> Looking at our own place, the Taoiseach should learn from what Oxfam has said. His Government has introduced dreadful policies without any consideration for the social consequences. There is no equality proofing. There is no attention paid to concerns being raised from the Opposition benches and perhaps, for all I know, from within the Government's ranks. The Taoiseach states we are in a recovery. Is that evident in public services, workers' rights, decent work for decent wages, terms and conditions and the eradication of poverty? No doubt these issues were debated and discussed at Davos, but one need only look at our own place, at the treatment of workers at Clerys and other workplaces in recent years during this recovery. One need only look at the plight of the Dunnes Stores workers as evidence of the failure of the Government - the Minister of State responsible is beside the Taoiseach - and Labour to introduce laws as it comes to the end of its term to protect workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_345">The Government's failure to introduce even its own flawed universal health insurance policy is evidence of the Government's failure to address social inequality and poverty, especially child poverty, or clamp down on tax abusers. In April, it was revealed that the breakfast cereal giant, Kellogg's, which routes a significant chunk of its global revenues through the State, paid only €7 million in corporation tax on more than €7.1 billion in sales from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The Ceann Comhairle should think about that in the morning as he pours milk over his cereal. In 2003, this company paid no Irish tax because it stated it made a loss of €101 million on sales of €1.4 billion. There are lots of other examples of multinationals taking advantage of the State's low rates of effective corporation tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_346"> What did the Taoiseach say? The most infamous memory that most Irish people have of the Taoiseach at Davos some years before this was of him stating that "people went mad borrowing" in a system that spawned greed, went out of control and led to the crash. So the people were at fault, not the corrupt bankers, not the corrupt politicians, not the developers, not the golden circle. Those are who the Taoiseach said were at fault. I see no evidence of that in the people who have had to bear the brunt of the Government's austerity policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_347"> At this year's conference, the Taoiseach actually advised European leaders to stick with austerity and ignore growing demands for a more thoughtful and fair way to deal with State and European debt, and on the back of the election of Syriza in Greece, he warned of the dangers of a drift to populism. The Greek people, the very nation that led the foundations of democracy, had voted overwhelming for a government - by the way, as the people did with the Taoiseach's Government - that would stand up for the rights of citizens, and the Taoiseach, who has let the people down in terms of the mandate that he was given, described this as populism.</p>

The people of the State, like the people of Greece, had an unfair debt burden imposed upon them and it would be good, having failed to stand up for the rights of people here, if at least the Taoiseach supported positively the Greek proposals for a resolution to in some way redeem the Government for the way it has treated the people here in the years since he has come into office.</p>

            <p eId="para_350">Ironically, one of the big issues at Davos this year was inequality. This discussion at Davos about inequality in the world was proceeded by the aforementioned Oxfam report that showed by next year the richest 1% of people in the world will own more wealth than everybody else in the world put together. There is a discussion about inequality against a background of obscene and gross inequality where a tiny group of people control the vast majority of wealth in the world while billions of people are starving, without homes, suffering extreme financial distress and suffering austerity. Those discussing austerity, along with the Taoiseach and the other leaders, were 100 billionaires who were invited to this event. They included our old friend, Mr. Denis O'Brien, worth €6 billion. Interestingly, according to <i>The Sunday Times</i> rich list, his wealth has doubled since the recession started. We have persons whose wealth is obscene beyond belief gathering together to discuss the evils of inequality in the world when those who are discussing it are the culprits. They are the ones responsible for the inequality because they, between them, have hoovered up more wealth than the vast majority of the world's population has. Does the Taoiseach agree that is quite obscene?</p>
            <p eId="para_351"> The Taoiseach, as a head of state, gets a free ticket but the tickets for the conference at Davos are $30,000 each.</p>
            <p eId="para_352">There, the super rich - the world's richest people - along with heads of state and royalty discuss inequality. Not many of the victims of inequality will be getting in at $30,000 per ticket. The banquets and partying are pretty sumptuous according to reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_356">Does the Taoiseach believe it is appropriate to attend such a conference when it is a symbol of the gross inequality that has developed in the world? If we are in any way serious about the issue of inequality, we should have an aggressive policy of wealth redistribution. Did the Taoiseach come away from the conference with anything like that? Looking beyond the irony of these super rich people discussing inequality, did the Taoiseach conclude that we should perhaps increase taxes on them and their corporations so that we might have real wealth redistribution and make an impact on the gross gap between the rich and the poor? Has the Taoiseach come away from Davos with any intention of doing that?</p>
            <p eId="para_357"> I have raised the issue of corporate profits and how little corporations pay in taxes.

Aggressive tax avoidance, which we appear to be up to our necks in facilitating, is responsible for the gross inequality that was discussed at Davos despite the irony of hob-nobbing with the individuals who are benefitting from that inequality.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> In all sincerity, does the Taoiseach recognise that this level of wealth inequality results from tax scams like that one and the obscene concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals, the very people who attended Davos? Having heard reports like the one I have just mentioned, has he any intention of radically moving in the direction of redistributing wealth through higher corporate and income taxes on these wealthy people? What does he propose to do about inequality, which is rampant in this country and across the world?</p>

            <p eId="para_368">We have had contributions from three formidable characters here, a Cheann Comhairle. First of all, I would say to Deputy Martin, Deputy Adams and the members of the Technical Group that, if they want and as I said before on many occasions, they can put down a priority question each week and I will answer it if it is an issue that they wish to follow through, and we can deal with the rest of the questions afterwards. There is the offer again for them. If they put down a priority question, I will be happy to deal with it in the ordinary way and follow through with ordinary questions afterwards. It is not good enough that we have to talk about these things five months on.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> Deputy Martin went on about populism, long-term investment, high rhetoric and all the rest of it. I am very happy to attend the Davos conference. It is an opportunity to meet with people who have a real investment in this country, not brass plates but in real workers. I do not accept that from Deputy Martin, even if he were to provide it, as he called it, in high-flowing rhetoric in any kind of passage that he might either read or present. MasterCard, Facebook, Google, Bank of America, JETRO, Lone Star, AT&amp;T, Novartis and Salesforce do not deal in that kind of stuff. What they deal with are facts, opportunity, attractiveness of location and people who provide a real opportunity to grow our economy by providing jobs. One of those companies, Salesforce, for instance, has gone from 100 employees to over 1,000 in the last number of years. It now has to move space again because of its growing workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_370"> Is one expected not to speak to Bloomberg, Reuters, CNN or CNBC about our country and the international view of Ireland now as moving very much in the right direction where the issue of inequality can only be dealt with when one has a growing economy and one can spread the fruits of that throughout, particularly focusing on those who are more disadvantaged or those who are more vulnerable?</p>
            <p eId="para_371"> The fact of the matter is, as I have said to Deputy Martin before, here we are with a clear focus on research and innovation and on science-based activities, which have grown in strength over the last period. Given the colleges of technology, our universities, business and the school system, it has never been more advantageous or more exciting to be involved in the whole area of STEM and science and research and innovation. I do not accept the assertion from all of the scientists that this has gone back beyond where it was many years ago. It has grown in popularity and in strength.</p>

            <p eId="para_383"> I would say to Deputy Boyd Barrett, obviously we have got rid of the double Irish concept because of reputational damage. Ireland plays its full part in the OECD analysis of the base erosion and profit sharing. We got rid of that because there are no brass plate companies here where we just have a plate but nobody employed. Apple, for instance, employs 4,000 people in Deputy Martin's city. There are so many others. Real workers go to work every day. They contribute to the research, innovation and the future. They are changing the frontiers up ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_384"> In that sense, the Department of Finance, at the direction of the Minister, has now concluded its public consultation about putting in place an intellectual property knowledge box, which will be competitive and which will be fair, but which will play to win. We have made that point on so many occasions. We are very much up front about our tax situation. We will play hard and we will play to win in a fair sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_385"> Deputy Adams mentioned all these so-called superior people that he met.

          <p eId="para_403">Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will suspend the revaluation of properties for local property tax until, at least, 2020, so that many thousands of families will not face a local property tax bill bombshell next year? There is huge concern out there in terms of the revaluation that is taking place. Media reports demonstrate a growing awareness of the problem across the country. People are beginning to realise they could face crippling property tax bills as house prices have increased dramatically. Dublin based families and urban based families will be particularly hard hit. Perhaps the Taoiseach will indicate when legislation will come forward? The design of the property tax regime was flawed from day one. The link to property prices makes little sense and it takes absolutely no account of people's ability to pay. There is much hardship involved here and I would appreciate clarity in respect of the Government's legislative programme on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I refer to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, reports today from ALONE and the programme for Government, page six of which states that investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority of the Government, that additional funding will be provided each year for the care of older people and that funding will go to more residential places, more home care packages and the delivery of home help and other professional community care services. It also refers to the review of the fair deal scheme with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long-term care. None of that has happened. I do not think the review of the fair deal scheme has been published. ALONE and Age Action say that older people are extremely disappointed at not getting the supports they need to allow them stay in their own homes. According to ALONE, about one third of older people who live in nursing homes would be able to live in their own homes if properly supported. At the core of ALONE's proposals is a commitment to introduce a social contract for the elderly, whereby the over 65s could continue to live in their own homes, if possible. Will the Taoiseach indicate, albeit he has only about six months left in this Government-----</p>

          <p eId="para_406">One more budget, to all intents and purposes. The bottom line is that he did not provide additional funding to older people but actually cut it back savagely. He did not provide additional supply and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings. He has not, to my knowledge, published the fair deal review. We had the appalling situation last year where people had to wait 15 weeks. When are we going to get some action on the programme for Government in respect of the elderly? What is the Taoiseach's position on the comments of Age Action and ALONE?</p>

The Minister for Finance is conscious of the increase in property prices and has asked Dr. Don Thornhill who did extensive work on the drafting of the property valuations in the first place to present a report to him. That report is in the process of being finalised. There will be ample opportunity for the Government to consider the best options open to it. There will be no change in the property valuations until 2017. The Minister for Finance expects to have the Thornhill report soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> We referred earlier to the fair deal scheme and the extra moneys that were allocated. The waiting period is down from 11 weeks to four weeks. The Minister has received that report and is considering it. Obviously, it will be published in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">Tá dhá cheist agam. One is about the marriage equality Bill and the other is about the Good Friday Agreement and the programme for Government commitment to the free implementation of that agreement. The Taoiseach will recall that last week I raised the issue of collusion and urged him to hold a debate on this important issue. He said he might divide the time for a debate on the North to include a debate on the Ballymurphy motion. He will recall that the Ballymurphy families are seeking a distinct and dedicated debate on the Ballymurphy massacre. They have told the Taoiseach and the Government that is their preference. They recalled to me that the Taoiseach gave them a commitment when he met them in Ballymurphy in March that they would have their own debate. There is also a need for a separate debate on collusion as that is a hugely important issue in its right. I note the Taoiseach raised the issue with the British Prime Minister last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Most immediately, we have a building crisis in the political institutions in the North. Yesterday's decision by Sinn Féin to give conditional support for the budget (no. 2) Bill gives some space to implement the Stormont House Agreement. That is an opportunity which should not be squandered. The Government as a co-equal guarantor has a crucial role to ensure this. I note the Minister for Foreign Affairs acknowledged the crisis facing the institutions if outstanding issues are not resolved. I ask the Taoiseach to give us some indication as to whether the debates I have outlined will be accommodated as soon as possible? </p>
          <p eId="para_415"> In regard to the marriage equality Bill, it is five weeks since that historic vote which saw citizens vote for marriage equality in overwhelming numbers. It was a hugely compassionate decision in favour of equality. We were told it would be enacted by the end of July. The Bill has not been published.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The Bills Office said yesterday it did not expect it any time soon. Why is it taking so long to draft a Bill on the referendum result, given that we have only four weeks before the Dáil rises? Can the Taoiseach provide some certainty about the publication of the Bill and the timetable required to get it through the Dáil and Seanad?</p>

          <p eId="para_418"> Everybody was pleased with the outcome of the referendum on marriage equality. The Bill cannot be published until the court makes its decision. It is before the court. If it was not before the court we would have the Bill before the House to deal with and have it enacted before the summer recess. I cannot comment on how long that will take. I hope there is a speedy and clear outcome. </p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_324">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">Over the last few days, all eyes have been on Greece. Therefore, before I turn to the agenda of the upcoming European Council meeting on Thursday and Friday, I want to report on the special euro summit which I attended in Brussels yesterday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> As the House is well aware, as time has passed, the sense of crisis surrounding the financial position of Greece has escalated. More importantly, the very real strains on the Greek people have only been intensified by the ongoing uncertainty and instability and their knock-on effects on economic activity. I am glad to say that, after much too long a stalemate, there now appears to be a reasonable prospect of an agreement between Greece and its creditors over the next few days. The Greek Government has forwarded new proposals, which are, as I speak, being intensively analysed by the institutions - namely, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the IMF and the Eurogroup - and being discussed with Greek Ministers and experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> These proposals arrived too late for a detailed discussion among finance Ministers at the Eurogroup meeting yesterday afternoon. The euro summit was never intended to be a discussion of technical issues in any case. However, first reactions from the institutions were generally to the effect that there has been an important step forward and there is a real basis on which to work. This very much set the mood at the euro summit, which gave the Greek Prime Minister the chance to set out his approach directly to all of the partners involved, and allowed him to appreciate the sense of purpose and determination among his colleagues. For my part, I stressed the importance of developing trust and implementing policies which can credibly meet the scale of the challenges that arise. I outlined our own experiences in Ireland, including our experience of modifying aspects of our programme which we sought to replace with others to achieve the same objective, but which were pro-growth in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The Eurogroup is now scheduled to meet again tomorrow evening with a view to reaching agreement by Thursday morning, just before the European Council meeting begins. I hope that at the European Council we will be in a position to salute an important breakthrough, even if much work remains to be done with Greece on longer-term issues. Success will be important for the stability of the euro area and of Greece itself and will offer the people of Greece some sense of a return of hope and the prospect of a stable recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I will now address the very full and diverse agenda of the European Council taking place this Thursday and Friday. The Council will continue to work to shape, on the basis of solidarity and responsibility, a comprehensive EU approach to migration, recognising that the situation in the Mediterranean is now at crisis point. We will continue our efforts to boost jobs, growth and competitiveness in the Union, giving strong political backing for the roll-out of a new digital single market strategy. We will consider how the Union can best respond to existing and emerging challenges in both its internal and external security environment. For the first time at the European Council, British Prime Minister David Cameron will outline his thinking on EU reform and the UK referendum on EU membership. I have asked the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Simon Harris, to address security and defence issues in his wrap-up statement. I will now address the other issues on the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Migration looks likely to take up more time than any other issue on the agenda. Instability, conflict and poverty across north Africa and the Middle East have resulted in unprecedented numbers of migrants attempting to enter Europe by sea. It is now estimated that well over 100,000 have made the perilous crossing across the Mediterranean so far this year. Although the EU has for some years now been taking important steps to address the crisis, the large-scale loss of life in April this year made it clear that we needed to do more, and urgently. I understand there may have been in excess of a million people on the Libyan shores over the past period.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> An emergency meeting of the European Council, which I attended in April, identified four areas that required progress to tackle the crisis: fighting traffickers, strengthening our presence at sea, preventing illegal migration flows, and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility. The <i>European Agenda on Migration</i>, published by the Commission on 13 May, also provides an important framework for the future. Tackling the migration crisis requires a comprehensive approach. Our ultimate goal must be to have a stable neighbourhood that provides a secure future and genuine opportunities for its people. This requires us to work closely with those countries from which migrants originate, addressing the factors that drive people to risk their lives on the perilous Mediterranean crossing. While recognising the importance of a longer-term approach in addressing migration flows, however, we cannot ignore the reality of today's immediate crisis. We must be ready to demonstrate solidarity with our southern EU partners who are at the front line. In this regard, I expect the European Council to focus on two aspects: supporting those in need of international protection through resettlement and relocation schemes, and ensuring effective return policies for those irregular migrants who do not qualify for international protection. Tackling the organised criminal networks that profit from human smuggling is also a priority, as is evident from the decision yesterday by EU foreign Ministers to launch an EU mission which will work to disrupt these networks.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> At the European Council, I intend to underscore Ireland's readiness to stand shoulder to shoulder with other EU member states in tackling the crisis. The <i>LE Eithne</i> has already rescued more than 2,100 migrants since it arrived in the southern Mediterranean on 23 May in support of the Italian authorities. In addition, the Government has agreed to resettle a total of 520 refugees in Ireland in 2015 and 2016, 300 more than originally foreseen and nearly double the figure proposed for us in the Commission's <i>European Agenda on Migration.</i> Through our aid programme, Ireland has provided €41 million in humanitarian assistance to people affected by the conflict in Syria. A large proportion of those arriving on Europe's shores have been forced to flee by this brutal conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> The Commission has proposed that, as an emergency measure and to demonstrate solidarity, 40,000 migrants in need of protection who are already in Greece or Italy be reallocated to other EU member states. Discussions so far have shown that opinions are divided on the specifics of this proposal. Some are very supportive; others, while mindful of the need to show solidarity, are afraid that it could establish a precedent which would act as a further pull factor encouraging migratory flows. There is agreement that further action is required, and I am hopeful that a compromise can be reached. Under Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty, Ireland can choose whether or not to opt into this measure. That is why the Commission has not allocated Ireland a relocation quota, as it has done with other member states. We have yet to make a final decision on whether we will participate in such a scheme, and are continuing to examine the proposals very carefully as they evolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> A further focus of this week's European Council will be on creating jobs, boosting growth and improving competitiveness. The growth outlook for the euro area is currently reasonably encouraging. Lower oil prices, appropriate monetary policies and a renewed focus on investment are expected to further boost economic activity through 2015 and into 2016. Member states must, however, continue their efforts, through appropriate fiscal policies and structural reforms, to ensure that recovery is sustainable. In this regard, the European Council will endorse this year's country-specific recommendations to the member states, thus concluding the European semester 2015. The House will recall that there are four country-specific recommendations for Ireland, which reflect continuity with last year's process and align well with policy directions that are already firmly established at national level. They cover public finances, health care spending, jobless households and child care, and restructuring of non-performing loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> There is a general sense that the overall semester process has worked well this year, with better dialogue between the Commission and member states. Significantly for Ireland and for the Union, the European Council will also agree next steps on the digital single market, building from the excellent strategy presented by the Commission last May. I have taken the initiative in proposing to a number of colleagues that we write to the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, this week, pressing for the highest levels of ambition for a fully functioning digital single market that is both open and competitive. My counterparts in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic have co-signed the letter, and I have no doubt that others will agree with much or all of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">We believe there is no greater opportunity at our disposal to make a real difference for investment, growth and jobs in Europe, while delivering a vital boost to the Union's future global competitiveness. We have to make sure our shared market rules are keeping pace with the full extent of what is now possible for digital innovation and entrepreneurship, while unlocking a new wave of European investment in next-generation broadband services, connecting all parts of the Union, no matter how remote, including with the support of the new European Fund for Strategic Investments. If we get it right, I am absolutely confident that the digital single market can underpin a stronger economic outlook for Europe and for all member states. That is why I am pushing for the European Council to provide a strong political endorsement for the new strategy at this week's meeting: concrete measures, ambitious timelines and early results.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The European Council is also likely to note the report entitled Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union, which was published yesterday by the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in co-operation with the heads of the other institutions. Building on measures implemented in recent years to make the economic and monetary union more stable and resilient, the report proposes a two-phase approach to further reform: a first, short-term phase focused on boosting competitiveness, maintaining responsible fiscal policies and completing fiscal union, followed by a second, longer-term phase which would involve changes to the EU's economic and institutional architecture. Much of the detail of what is envisaged would require much further work. It is important to note that this report reflects the personal views of the five Presidents and will, of course, need to be studied carefully and debated in full by member states over the period ahead. I do not expect a detailed debate at this European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Finally, I want to turn to the question of the UK's relationship with the EU, which the European Council is also set to address later this week. Let me begin by restating that this is an issue of real national importance. British membership of the Union matters hugely to Ireland. I think all of us in this House, regardless of our party affiliations or political convictions, understand why that is the case. I very much welcome the publication today of the comprehensive report by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on the UK-EU relationship. This confirms that the relationship is important for our economic ties, for Northern Ireland and for the promotion of Irish interests in the Union. Therefore, keeping the UK within the EU is, in the Government's view, essential, both for Ireland and for the EU as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> I met with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, in Downing Street last week. We had a very constructive and positive discussion about his plans for reform and renegotiation of the UK's relationship with the EU. I made it clear to him how much value we attach to the fact that both our countries are members of the Union. I said that, without necessarily agreeing on all points, Ireland would be as helpful in negotiations as we could be. I also welcomed the fact that he is talking to all of our European Council colleagues in advance of this week's meeting. I believe the Prime Minister fully recognises many of the benefits for the UK of the EU and of EU membership, and I know for sure that he appreciates its importance in the context of the British-Irish relationship. However, he also has a number of concerns, and he has been very clear that he wants these addressed before a referendum is held in the UK on whether his country should remain in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> This week's European Council, which will be the first since the British election in May, will present an opportunity for the Prime Minister to outline his thinking. The purpose is not to have a lengthy debate but to allow him to sketch out the areas he wants to address in terms of reform. Issues already mentioned publicly and raised by the Prime Minister with me last week include the following: competitiveness; questions of sovereignty, including the application of the concept of ever-closer union and the role of national parliaments in the EU legislative process; the relationship between those member states within and outside the euro area; and the relationship between migratory flows within the EU and welfare entitlements. I expect that the European Council will launch a process of further exploration of the various options and possibilities in each area. The indications are that the first phase will be quite low-key and technical before firmer proposals come back to the European Council in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> There are likely to be elements of the UK's proposals on which Ireland and, indeed, other member states can be fully supportive, such as in regard to improving the Union's competitiveness through trade, the digital single market, which I mentioned earlier, and better regulation. There are others which, though complex, may allow for balanced outcomes which meet UK concerns without damaging the interests of the rest of the Union. On the difficult question of welfare reform, much has to be done to clarify what is feasible and achievable both technically and politically.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Like every other Head of State or Government, I will be mindful of the consequences of any changes for our own citizens and for the EU's core values. I want to underline that Ireland is eager to see the question of the UK's future in the Union resolved, and resolved positively. While the exact timing of a referendum is for the British Government to determine in due course, I hope the uncertainty over Britain's place in Europe can be dispelled sooner rather than later. This week's European Council essentially represents the start of the process. The challenge ahead is arriving at a negotiated and consensual basis that will allow for continued UK membership of the EU. I am hopeful that a solution that is satisfactory to all parties - the UK Government, the British people and other EU member states - will be reached. Let me assure the House that Ireland will be playing a very active and constructive role in the negotiations that lie ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">From his earliest days in office, the Taoiseach has consistently refused to be open about fundamental policy issues. The public and media get the spin, but the reality is hidden away, often shielded by the aggressive withholding of documents and the reduction of parliamentary questions to a farce. This is true through nearly every part of Government, but it is especially true of the Government’s approach to vital European discussions. For months, the Government has been claiming publicly that it wants a generous and fair settlement of Greece’s debt problems. However, yesterday, behind closed doors, our Government took a leading role in threatening to effectively cause the collapse of the Greek banking sector unless Greece immediately toed the line.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">As reported extensively yesterday and again this morning, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, argued strongly and repeatedly that Greece should be forced to introduce capital controls before the ongoing liquidity support provided for Greek banks could be continued.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">By every analysis, capital controls have been identified as a first formal step towards a Greek exit from the eurozone and a signal of a dramatic escalation of the crisis. In this, the Minister was the principal supporter of Mr. Schäuble, the German Minister for Finance.  Mr. Schäuble’s position is a clear one, and it is more extreme than that of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.  He is against concessions to Greece and indifferent towards its place in the euro, and he is one of those who took a damaging position towards Ireland’s interests in the past. That our Government would side with him against Greece is a disgrace. At the very moment that the Greek Government was finally tabling significant measures to bridge the gap with international lenders, our Government decided to support a ratcheting up of the crisis. What is even worse is that our Government sided with a small minority of hardline states whose position was decisively rejected by the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> The ECB is no soft touch in the Greek negotiations.  It has an extremely poor and at times disastrous policy record relating to individual support programmes for countries. Yet even the ECB rejected the extreme position which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, took on behalf of Ireland yesterday. Obviously the Taoiseach has been very grateful to the Chancellor for helping him during our last election, and he has refused to ever challenge the German Government’s policies, but this marks a move to a far more craven and unacceptable phase. No doubt the Minister will come up with some homespun way of trying to claim that he was actually doing the opposite of what the record shows. This is an act which is no longer fooling anyone but the most gullible. The Taoiseach has a duty to explain the Minister's behaviour yesterday and to explain why, at such a sensitive moment, his Government supported an escalation of the crisis at the very time when a breakthrough had become possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">I and my party have been very consistent over the past four years in saying that Greece needs some further debt relief if it is to have a credible route back to long-term growth.  This remains the case.  The debt restructuring that was carried out up to now has been enough to kick the can down the road but not enough to deal with the problem. The effort of the Greek Government to secure a reduction in the impact of its debts is reasonable and it is one we should be supporting, rather than joining the hardline effort to say "No" to everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Certainly, it is the case that the new Government in Athens has been unreliable and damaging in the tactics it has used.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Regularly abusing those one is negotiating with, denouncing them as criminals and failing to engage in detailed discussions are not behaviours which serve anyone’s interests. </p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Syriza has a democratic mandate to seek to reduce the debt and austerity. This mandate, however, also includes the contradictory promise to abide by the rules of membership of the eurozone, and it does not remove the right of other countries and international institutions to disagree. "Shut up and give us your money" is a negotiating tactic which has proven disastrous so far. What is also not reasonable is the effort of the Syriza Government to reject any reforms at all or to give any commitments in return for billions in other people’s money.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The indication now is that it has finally tabled a serious proposal. This has survived the Schäuble-Noonan effort yesterday which could have effectively torpedoed it before any real discussions. At the summit on Thursday and Friday Ireland has a duty to stand on the side of giving Greece a chance. Now that there is a real engagement and an effort to provide credible commitments in return for the release of €7 billion in funding, Ireland should speak up in favour of doing whatever is possible to get a deal finalised. The Taoiseach must end the policy of sucking-up to the hardline elements in Chancellor Merkel’s party.  It has delivered nothing for Ireland and nothing for Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> The Taoiseach should be an advocate for sustainable debt relief for Greece. Unfortunately, there appears to be zero likelihood of this happening. Quite simply, the Taoiseach has refused to advocate reasonable debt relief for Ireland, so he will clearly not do anything to help another country. In a four and a half year record of unprecedented spin and misdirection, this Government’s actions relating to Europe stand out. Next week we will reach the third anniversary of the day that the Taoiseach emerged from a summit in Brussels covering himself in praise for having, he claimed, secured a game-changer concerning bank-related debt.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_641">The Taoiseach broke no link. He did nothing, but claimed something that did not happen. He and his Ministers claimed that billions were potentially on the way. At a press conference dominated by the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, during which they giggled about how they had just brought home the goose which would be laying golden eggs, it was speculated that Ireland might get over €30 billion in debt relief. Some three years later, we have got nothing. However, this is not the worst of it. The facts show that our Government has not asked for debt relief and has not even mentioned the topic for the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> Over a lengthy period Fianna Fáil has been working to find evidence of what the Government has done in terms of the Taoiseach’s claimed game changer on debt relief. As usual, no information has been provided via parliamentary questions, so we have had to submit a range of freedom of information requests. It was revealed yesterday by <i>thejournal.ie</i> that under this Government the Department of the Taoiseach has dramatically reduced the amount of information it is willing to release under freedom of information. In spite of this, we have been able to put together the basic picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Government papers reveal that a deadline of October 2012 was originally set for achieving debt relief. The last time the Taoiseach made direct contact with a European leader about debt was in October 2013, when he contacted the then Council President, Herman Van Rompuy. Since then there has been silence and yet the evidence of the justice of Ireland’s case for Europe to share the cost of bank recapitalisation has actually grown stronger. European institutions and member states insisted on a course of action which limited Ireland’s options and increased its cost, about that there is no doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> It is something the Taoiseach has acknowledged, albeit only once in an unscripted comment made in Paris in October 2012. Since then he simply will not say out loud that others should share in the cost of policies which were imposed on Ireland. The only possible explanation for this is that it might get in the way of the party political narrative that Fine Gael wants to keep intact for electoral purposes. The obsession of Fine Gael with the next election can be seen in the newspapers every day and in the Government’s cowardice when it comes to challenging powerful people. That it appears to have stopped it even publicly stating Ireland’s case for justice on its debts is something which is becoming clearer all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The Greek situation will dominate the summit, but the discussion on the long-term governance of the eurozone is just as important. The eurozone is badly flawed, and no one can seriously question that, but the proposals currently under discussion do nothing whatsoever to address the most important flaws. The lack of any ability to transfer resources from stronger regions to regions under pressure is a unique feature of the European single currency. There is no means of addressing embedded structural imbalances. The large balance of payments surpluses in certain countries are to be left in place. They will not be requested to do something about it. </p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Europe desperately needs a form of fiscal compact which is about helping, not just controlling, each other. The approach is too one-dimensional and yet the Taoiseach is enthusiastically supporting a set of recommendations this week which double down on a policy which states structural changes alone are the route to growth. What is extraordinary about this is that at home the Government has a perfect record of ignoring the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. It has undertaken no significant structural reforms and has bet on mass amnesia enabling people to forget that Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted against the majority of budget changes for which they now try to claim credit. </p>
          <p eId="para_647"> This Government’s European policy is incoherent and serves no obvious Irish or European long-term interest. Another example of this is the Government’s policy towards the Tory Party’s demand for a renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union. The Taoiseach has spoken at length about it, but has managed to say nothing. He has held two meetings with Prime Minister Cameron, but we have no idea what he might have said in these meetings other than the most banal generalities, and we heard more of that in his speech. Of course Ireland wants Britain to remain in the European Union, but we should not want this at any cost. </p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Britain’s review of the balance of competencies within the Union showed that the bulk of European powers help individual states to compete on a level playing field and give them fair access to trade. Just as important, it allows guarantees of basic working conditions and social supports. Under no circumstances should Ireland support any proposal to turn the European Union away from these progressive policies which have helped Irish citizens more than most. It also appears that key parts of the UK do not share the obsessive euroscepticism of the Tories in England and the DUP and Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland. The position of the main parties in Scotland and Wales are very much in line with what should be our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> At a minimum we deserve some honesty and openness from our Government. What is Britain seeking and what does our Government support in terms of future changes? On balance, Ireland should always be open to participating in trade agreements which open up new markets for companies based here. While the macro elements of TTIP look positive for Europe and Ireland, we need to see more detail. However, because of recent developments in the USA on the US-Pacific deal it is doubtful that anything will happen on TTIP until after the presidential election.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Everybody in the House should acknowledge the work being done by the crew of the<i> LE Eithne</i> to prevent further loss of life and tragedy in the Mediterranean. It is bringing into a new era the proud record of Óglaigh na hÉireann, especially in international humanitarian work. Its dedication should be commended. There are no simple answers to the current refugee crisis. However, it is obvious that a much more ambitious and generous approach to supporting human rights and growth in certain countries is needed. </p>
          <p eId="para_651"> The Syrian refugee crisis continues to get worse. It is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world at the moment and Ireland should lead the calls for a response which is capable of helping millions of people who have already endured too much. </p>
          <p eId="para_652"> I welcome the decision to extend sanctions on Russia for its invasion, partition and continued destabilisation of Ukraine. I continue to find it amazing how parties which lecture us constantly on freedom and sovereignty continue to pander to the increasingly authoritarian Putin administration. Sinn Féin’s vote against a European Parliament motion supporting Ukraine has been ignored in the Irish media, but deserves closer attention. I find it extraordinary the degree to which the Irish media has not commented on that vote, when essentially Sinn Féin and others sided with the Russian position and against the Ukraine Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The free and democratically elected Government of Ukraine is showing a real commitment to reform, including launching the first credible anti-corruption drive in that country. Debt relief and a credible programme of support are what it now desperately needs. Overall, there needs to be the clear enunciation of the principles of the correct approach to the crisis facing Ukraine, as well as a principled approach to the unacceptable behaviour of Russia in partitioning that country and undermining its efforts to emerge as a stable society and economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_655">The eyes of many in Europe and further afield, as the Taoiseach said, are now on the economic crisis which has been affecting the people of Greece. Both the people of Greece and those of this State have had unfair tax burdens imposed upon them. However, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has consistently taken the side of the EU elite and the ECB against the people and government of Greece. We have seen media reports today, which the Taoiseach denied earlier, of the Minister for Finance’s posturing ahead of the euro summit and heard that he was one of the toughest contributors in talks on the EU's response to the Greek crisis. The Minister reportedly ganged up with the German leaders to argue that the ECB governing council could not keep meeting every day to approve emergency loans to Greece. Effectively, it is claimed that he called for controls on Greek banks but ECB officials told both him and the German finance Minister to stay away from monetary policy. The Taoiseach will remember how the Minister joked once about Greece and feta cheese. There has been little evidence of solidarity or understanding in the attitude of the Government, and of the EU, towards the Greek Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The current crisis is not in the interests of the people of Greece or of other EU states. The Government of Greece does not want the country to leave the eurozone, and the Irish Government must argue against any EU effort to force Greece out. Yet, time and again regarding Greece, as with this State, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have not acted as representatives of the people of Ireland but as representatives of the EU elite in Ireland. What is now needed is firm support and solidarity for Greece from eurozone states, especially from this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> The Greek Government is seeking a fair compromise which does not unduly target the poor and the most vulnerable Greek citizens. Greece is prepared for and has already agreed to a great deal of adjustment. However, it rightly argues that this adjustment must not be of the kind that previously crippled its country. Greece needs more reform, as do other highly indebted eurozone countries, not more cutbacks or destruction of public services and the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> As the Greek finance Minister pointed out in <i>The Irish Times</i> at the weekend, wages in Greece have contracted by 37%, pensions by up to 48%, state employment by 30%, and consumer spending by 33%. He pointed out that Greece’s adjustment was so drastic that economic activity was choked: total income fell by 27%, unemployment skyrocketed to 27%, undeclared labour rose to 34% and public debt to 180% of Greece’s declining gross domestic product, GDP. The awfulness of emigration, with which we are familiar, has been visited upon thousands of young Greek citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> In the face of these realities, it makes no sense for creditors and other eurozone states to demand further cutbacks that will deepen the humanitarian crisis in Greece and push its poorest citizens into even greater poverty. The Greek Government is committed to serious reforms, especially to fight tax evasion and corruption. None the less, Greece’s creditors continually call for cuts to pensions, despite the Greek Government's statement that around 1 million families survive on pensions which have already been cut by up 48% and that further cuts to their meagre pensions would amount to putting them onto the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Why does the Taoiseach not support proposals that would reform Greek’s economy to tackle its humanitarian crisis? Why does he continue to back the types of austerity measure which have failed citizens of EU states and increased inequality and destitution in Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal? Will he support Greece’s calls for a reduction in its unsustainable and unfair debt? Will he make common cause with Greece with a view to reducing this State's unsustainable debt also? That is what citizens in this State want from the Government. Indeed, that was the platform on which he won the 2011 general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> In the course of Thursday’s Europe Council meeting, will the Taoiseach raise the case of Ibrahim Halawa, in light of the fact that his treatment in Egypt is in breach of international human rights obligations, including Article 2 of its Euro-Mediterranean Partnership agreement? I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach on numerous occasions. Mr. Halawa was only 17 when he was arrested and has been in prison for two years. He should now be in college or working, not caged in an Egyptian jail. His family are extremely concerned for his mental and physical health. His trial was postponed for the seventh time earlier this month, a mass trial involving 493 defendants. I have written directly to the Egyptian President calling on him to intervene on humanitarian grounds, not least because Ibrahim Halawa was a juvenile at the time of his arrest. I know the Taoiseach has stated his reasons for not directly intervening at this time with the Egyptian authorities. Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership agreement states: "Relations between the Parties [to the agreement] ... shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement." Without intervening directly in the Egyptian judicial system, this article provides the Taoiseach with an opportunity to raise this matter at the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> I commend the crew of the <i>LE Eithne</i> in rescuing more than 2,100 migrants in the Mediterranean over the past month. Will the Taoiseach urge the Council to tackle the crisis in north Africa and the Middle East as a humanitarian crisis? It needs to be tackled more urgently than we have seen thus far.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Will the Taoiseach take leadership at EU level on the Palestinian cause and to be a champion for peace in the Middle East? He is mandated to do so by the Dáil. We have our own history, respect and goodwill on matters in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Will he provide an opportunity to discuss the report entitled Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union? Sinn Féin envisages a social European Union, a Union of equals as opposed to the neoliberal and two-tier model that has emerged.</p>

Tá muintir na hÉireann ag féachaint ar an Rialtas seo agus ag féachaint ar Syriza agus éad uafásach orthu faoin obair iontach atá á dhéanamh ag Rialtas na Gréige i gcomparáid leis an easpa oibre atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas seo ó thaobh fiach sna tíortha de.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Migrants fleeing war, hunger, poverty and oppression continue to attempt the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean in unsafe boats. Sinn Féin welcomes that the Government has sent the <i>LE Eithne</i> to be part of search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. Just yesterday the <i>LE Eithne</i> successfully located and rescued a total of 519 migrants off three separate vessels 50 nautical miles north-west of Tripoli. Since the <i>LE Eithne</i> set sail from Ireland on 16 May, it has rescued more than 2,000 migrants who have been in trouble in the Mediterranean. Gabhann Sinn Féin míle buíochas le criú na loinge sin - na fir agus na mná atá ag obair sa tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh. Is creidiúint don tír iad na hoibrithe sin. This also puts into perspective the huge need for continued search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, approximately 90,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean this year and almost 2,000 have drowned or been lost at sea. Approximately 200,000 migrants are expected to make the crossing this summer during calm seas. Ireland must be central to the lifesaving actions to ensure no mass drownings occur again. This should be focused on saving migrants' lives and not military offensive strikes.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> I have huge concerns about the EUNAVFOR mission and fear it will only make the situation more dangerous and volatile for people fleeing war, poverty, hunger and oppression. The Irish Government should not play any part in militarily forcing vulnerable people and refugees back to Libya and other areas of conflict. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will ensure that the <i>LE Eithne's</i> mission will remain one of search and rescue, and that Ireland will take no part in any offensive action as part of the recently agreed EUNAVFOR mission?</p>

          <p eId="para_672">EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday officially launched EUNAVFOR Med. The language the EU is now using is about ship "disposal" rather than "destroying" ships. However EUNAVFOR Med is still without UN or Libyan approval. Many believe that when it comes to destroying smugglers' boats the smugglers will simply put migrants on them, even when they are at anchor, to act as human shields. Even the UN-recognised authorities based in the eastern part of the country, do not have control of coastal areas where most migrant embarkations take place. This mission is extremely dangerous and could result in the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of innocent civilians. The record of EU and NATO countries in Libya already speaks for itself. They successfully removed Gadaffi but left behind a country bitterly divided and in ruins, a living hell for the average Libyan.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> We need to examine other options of assistance and increase the number of refugees Ireland is accepting. It was World Refugee Day on Saturday, and while it is welcome that the <i>LE Eithne</i> is saving lives, we cannot expect Italy and Greece to take care of all the migrants. This is a European issue and it needs a European-wide response. There needs to be an EU focus on increasing our collective support and help to southern European countries who are on the front line. One of these initiatives must be to increase our refugee quota.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Ireland can play its part on the front line but we also need to do more at home. Plans to disperse refugees landing in Greece and Italy around the EU look like they will be delayed for months and no decision will be made until September according to reports. Is this true? Ireland should not wait for a binding EU package. I understand that Ireland has offered to resettle up to 300 refugees this year. Considering the work of the <i>LE Eithne</i> will the Taoiseach discuss with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, the possibility of Ireland taking more refugees? In my opinion 300 is far too small in the face of a massive refugee crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> With regard to the remarks made by an Teachta Micheál Martin and the mandate Sinn Féin has in the Six Counties, when it comes to the North unfortunately Fianna Fáil is happy to comment but not stand for election.

          <p eId="para_676">The last few weeks have been another shameful chapter in the period of office of the Government when it comes to solidarity and internationalism with Greece and other people throughout Europe who are suffering under the cosh of austerity. It is really treacherous that the Irish Government has lined up with the austerity bullies of the EU against the Greek people. Last week the Taoiseach said Greece must face up to its responsibilities. What a shocking and ignorant statement to make. The people of Greece have more than faced their responsibilities and at a very terrible cost in that since austerity started 1 million jobs have been lost; there has been a 190% increase in unemployment; 30% of businesses have closed; there has been a 38% average salary reduction and a 45% average pension reduction; there has been a 42.8% increase in child mortality and a 98.2% increase in poverty; and two people commit suicide every day in Greece, a dramatic increase in suicide rates. All of this has resulted in almost one third of GDP being slashed.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> The Greek economy has been devastated. This is as a result of austerity and implementing the troika's programme, not because they resisted but because previous governments implemented the austerity programme. It devastated the society and the economy. The notion the Greeks were overspending is nonsense. Greece has historically underspent in social spending as a proportion of its GDP. It had caught up to some extent only recently, until this austerity was imposed. It still spends three percentage points less, for example, on social spending than Germany, the Government of which is ramming this brutal austerity down the throats of the people and saying they have not given enough. Shamefully our Government played the best boy in the class routine yet again for its comrade in the European People's Party, Angela Merkel. I honestly wonder does the Taoiseach bring an apple to Mrs Merkel every time he goes to see her, like the little teacher's pet sucking up to Angela Merkel and the head of the EU bullies. The irony of this is what the Government gets in reward for sucking up to Angela Merkel and the austerity bullies. We got the answer to this yesterday when the IMF turned around and told the Government to be careful with what it does in the budget as it is not happy with any talk of pay restoration. For all the sucking up and treachery in terms of the Greek people, the IMF is still bossing the Government around.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">There is no reward. It is still being told what it can and cannot do in the budget. This is what the IMF said. It is pathetic and treacherous, particularly when we, like the Greeks, are still being forced to pay billions and billions of euros out in interest to these banks which destroyed the European economy and caused this mess in the first place. The Government should be ashamed of itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">I concur with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the Government's attitude and behaviour towards the people of Greece and the Greek Government in the negotiations with the European Union. There is no need to go back over the statistics he quoted. Last week in <i>The Irish Times </i>the Greek Finance Minister, Mr. Varoufakis, published the same figures. This shows the extent to which the Greeks must go to get the message sent out. They certainly cannot rely on our parliamentarians and Government to bring back the message and speak about what the real situation is in Greece and what the Greek people are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">It was interesting to see the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stepping out of line last week at the ECOFIN meeting when he complained that it was asked to discuss proposals that it had not seen. That reminds me a bit of what happens in here at times, when we are brought in to discuss legislation that we have not seen or that has not been published. That is the kind of attitude that prevails.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> Finance Ministers are supposedly discussing and agreeing on the future of Greece without having seen the proposals or being able to discuss them in a reasonable manner. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, quickly pulled back into line yesterday when he backed up his friend and master, the German finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang Schäuble, by berating Greece about the fact that the governing council of the European Central Bank, ECB, must meet every day to decide on emergency financial measures for the Greeks. I wonder did the Minister, Deputy Noonan, get his knuckles rapped for speaking out of line at the Eurogroup of finance Ministers meeting last Thursday, standing up and saying what everybody else knows to be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> It is absolutely disgraceful that we have reacted in such a way towards the Greeks, and this Government has demonstrated a distinct lack of backbone and solidarity, when the European Union is supposed to be built on solidarity and people working together. We are playing a part in forcing the Greek people to go through what has happened in the past five or six years. We should support the Greek proposals for a debt conference and their attempts to rebuild their economy and taxation system to ensure they can develop, grow and fund themselves. We should be part of building that coalition to change the direction that the European Union has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> The Taoiseach indicated that the crisis in the Mediterranean and migration issues would also be discussed on Thursday. The Taoiseach mentioned the actions discussed last April and how the European Union would deal with the issue, but it is not being dealt with at all. The EU is just trying to plug gaps and holes to stop people getting into the European Union. Does any discussion take place in European Council meetings about the policies and actions of the European Union that have caused this crisis? Two members of the European Union bombed the life out of Libya over the past number of years, causing the entire collapse of civil society there, and that has exacerbated the process. Other actions of the European Union across Africa are feeding into the crisis but we have not seen any discussion of how the European Union will change or develop policies that will allow people to choose to stay in their own countries, so that they would not be forced, through the policies of the West, into seeking to come to the West in order to better themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">I echo the words of my colleagues on this side of the House about the absolute horror and shock at the attitude taken by the Government, and in particular the Minister for Finance, on the Greek crisis recently. Until now, we have been surprised at and condemned the silence of the Government in the crisis and for not sticking with the Greek people. I would have preferred if it had remained silent rather than doing as it has done now. I cannot believe this country, in which so many of our fathers and grandfathers stood up for the rights of small nations in the Second World War, is now taking its line directly from the largest nations in Europe. It is quite extraordinary that a country that has been silent for so long on the great issues of Europe because it is frightened of opening its mouth has decided to openly take the side of those whom Deputy Boyd Barrett quite rightly called "the bullies". What is now going on is nothing short of economic bullying.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> One can understand why large nations might do this, or why the Netherlands, Finland, France or the German satellites might do it, but why is Ireland doing it? I can only explain this through one particular idea, which is not new. It is because the Minister for Finance and the Government could not afford for Greece to get a good deal, or at least a better deal than they got for themselves. They were going to be embarrassed if a write-down came about or if a particularly belligerent attitude worked. That would reflect badly on the negotiations they carried out in 2012 and since. The Minister for Finance and the Government had a choice: they could back the bullies or they could back the smaller nation. They could turn to the high powers, the pillars of the European establishment, by whom they have been captured, or the people of Greece. They opted to go for the big powers. It was a shameful decision and the wrong decision. They could have made a case for the Greek people by standing up and saying "Stop." That would have had an effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> This issue is not what we are getting today about the agreement or elements such as pension ages. The real issue is debt write-off. Nobody in this House believes that the Greek crisis will be solved without write-down, and it will happen. It may not occur this time but it will happen in future. The debt write-off will be granted to the Greeks sooner or later if the matter is to be resolved, and that will acutely embarrass Ireland. The noble action for us would be to admit that we negotiated badly and the Greek people deserve a write-down of debt. We should be supporting them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_688">Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states: "The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law." The reality, as been demonstrated by the past five months of negotiations with the Greek Government, is that it is founded on the principles of debt slavery, dictatorship of the markets and the European Central Bank, denial of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of profit for the 1% above all. The election of Syriza five months ago scared this Government, the bondholders, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and establishments right across Europe because it sent out the idea that there could be an alternative to austerity and that the rule of these people, which has been unchallenged by the so-called social democrats, could be challenged. The idea was that a movement could be built to achieve real change.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> Since that time, the approach of all establishments across Europe has been to achieve one of two aims: either bring down the Greek Government and replace it with a more compliant one, or humiliate it and send a message that there is no alternative, reinforcing the Thatcherite dogma and stopping any further challenge from the periphery or anywhere else in Europe. From day one after the election, the Syriza Government was met with complete disrespect for the choice of the Greek people. Jean-Claude Juncker declared that there were no democratic choices possible outside the framework of European treaties, or outside the framework of neoliberalism and austerity. We know the European Central Bank has played a particularly ignominious role in this and we know that previously it was central in silent coups in Greece and Italy in which elected governments were replaced with governments of bankers for bankers. We know it has sent ransom notes to the Irish and Italian Governments, and we heard last week at the banking inquiry of the role it played in pushing Ireland to a bailout and denying the burning of bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> The disgusting role played yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is absolutely shameful. The denials are ridiculous, as he said something similar in public. He insisted on tightening the noose around the neck of the Greek economy, which is designed to force Greece into signing up to a bad deal. That goes with a campaign of propaganda and terror in the media, financial terror in the markets and a run on the banks. There is also a campaign of political terror.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">It seems they may have had a result, and the deal that is now being discussed may represent a continuation of austerity, particularly through cuts to pensions, increases to VAT and no agreement on debt write-down. If that is the case, this just ties Greece to continuing in the role of Sisyphus, pushing a boulder of austerity up a hill only for it to fall down again. It will not offer a way out. There was a major protest in Dublin on Saturday in solidarity with the Greek people. I appeal to the Greek left and to left-wing MPs in Syriza and in the Greek Parliament not to back down and not to be blackmailed. People across Europe are standing with them. They want to see a fight back. Instead, they should prepare for a confrontation with the 1% in Europe, with the Merkels, with the Junckers. We must join together in a struggle for a real alternative to austerity and for a different Europe.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">I am pleased to have an opportunity to wrap up today's important debate regarding the forthcoming European Council meeting. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, would usually give this statement, but he is in Luxembourg today at the General Affairs Council, where the key focus is on preparations for the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I am confused about the attempted distortion of the comments made and the questions asked by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in both our national interest and the interests of protecting the eurozone at the last meeting of the Eurogroup. I often wonder what questions some members of the Opposition would ask should they ever be in a position to attend such meetings. The question the Minister asked was very straightforward. It was based on comments made by the ECB regarding emergency liquidity assistance and how long it could be continued. In fact, it would have been irresponsible not to ask such a question. If Deputy Paul Murphy thinks we want to go back to the days when Irish Ministers did not bother attending European ministerial meetings, or if he thinks that people attending meetings should stick their fingers in their ears and say nursery rhymes, that is fair enough. The Minister asked prudent questions in the national interests and in the interest of the eurozone. The overwhelming majority of people in Greece wish to remain in the eurozone, which is also the declared public position of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> As the Taoiseach has mentioned, I will address the security and defence element of the European Council. Security and defence issues have been scheduled for review at this European Council meeting since December 2013, when Heads of State and Government adopted substantive conclusions regarding the development of the Union's common security and defence policy, CSDP. The 2013 conclusions addressed three areas: increasing the effectiveness of the CSDP, developing and providing capabilities to support the CSDP, and improving the ability of the European Union's industry to provide those capabilities. Good progress has been made since then. The objective has been to deliver tangible and deployable capabilities so that the Union is in a position to launch a CSDP mission in a timely and efficient manner when and where needed. Since December 2013, four new CSDP operations have been launched, one in Ukraine, two in the Central African Republic and one in Mali. In addition, a maritime security strategy and an action plan for its implementation were agreed in 2014, as was an EU cyber-defence policy framework. In the context of the European Defence Agency, a policy framework for long-term and systematic co-operation was approved by Ministers. </p>
          <p eId="para_695"> This week's European Council is expected to give its backing to further improving the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP. Ireland fully supports this objective. We have been an active participant in both military and civilian CSDP missions since its inception. The European Union's partnership with the UN has made a critical contribution to crisis management globally. We look forward to further strengthening this strategic partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> In addition, the Heads of State and Government are this week expected to approve the preparation by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of a new European foreign and security policy strategy. Since the last European security strategy was agreed in 2003, we have witnessed profound changes in the security environment. The EU is now surrounded by an arc of instability to the east and the south. Technology has brought great progress in people's lives, but it has also opened up new fronts of attack in cyberspace. Competition for scarce resources and the steady creep of climate change increase the risk of instability. Whereas the 2003 strategy focused on the security dimension, the intention is that the new strategy, to be completed in 2016, will cover both foreign and security policy, recognising that both strands of the EU's external action are fundamentally interlinked. Ireland fully supports this comprehensive approach and stands ready to contribute as the strategy is further developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Tragic events in Paris earlier this year prompted a renewed focus on security threats within the Union's borders. The solidarity demonstrated with the Government and people of France after the terror attacks was striking. Heads of State and Government convened an emergency session and committed to working together to ensure the security of Europe's citizens, prevent radicalisation, safeguard our values and co-operate with international partners. The Council is expected to call for implementation of the EU internal security strategy, which was recently renewed for the period 2015 to 2020 on the basis of a Commission communication. The strategy sets out the contribution the EU can make to protecting its citizens from threats posed by terrorism, organised crime and cyber-crime. No EU country is immune from the terrorist threat. We are stronger when we work together, sharing information and expertise and developing counter-narratives to the extremism that foments hatred and intolerance.</p>

            <p eId="para_702">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the issue of rehabilitative care for persons with an acquired brain injury in Ireland, and I thank the Minister of State for being present. Due to the advances in medicine and technology, brain injury survival rates in this country have improved. Advanced imaging and surgical techniques mean that early intervention can lead to long-term survival for persons with acquired brain injury. However, they are often saved and then left, because access to, availability, and funding of rehabilitation services have not matched medical and technological advances.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> Persons who acquire a brain injury frequently occupy a bed in an acute hospital for a protracted period of time and might move from there to a nursing home setting, or home, if they are lucky enough to have support in the family. Persons with an acquired brain injury in many cases cannot access services and rehabilitation on their own behalf. As a result, they often are left with a lack of rehabilitation opportunities and remain in inappropriate settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> At this point, I will discuss the case of Sara Walsh Delaney, who entered hospital for a biopsy for a benign brain tumour in October 2011, three months after her marriage at the age of 28. She suffered a massive brain haemorrhage, could not be roused from a coma and ended up bed-bound in Beaumont Hospital for two years and three months. Her mother, Mary, her father, Martin, and her sister, Niamh, fought for her to have access to treatment when the powers that be saw her as a problem and wanted her to be moved to a nursing home to free up a bed. Sean O'Rourke of RTE championed her cause, and my colleague Deputy Finian McGrath asked questions in this House on Sara's behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> Sara was taken to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, in August 2014, was treated there for a period and then returned to Beaumont Hospital. Later, in December 2014, Sara, then 31, went to the Royal Hospital Donnybrook, in the ward for young patients under 65, under the Fair Deal scheme. Sara's family and friends engaged in extensive fundraising that meant she could travel to Germany for six weeks of intensive rehabilitation. Once there, she made great progress. After her return in April to the Royal Hospital Donnybrook, however, Sara regressed because she was entitled to only two hours of therapy per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">A further scan a number of weeks ago showed the benign tumour to be growing, and Sara was transferred to St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown, where, sadly, she died on 17 June, a few short months after her 32nd birthday.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> I mention Sara's case because it highlights the lacuna in the health services in Ireland. There is no golden ticket that fast-tracks treatment, as long-term care and rehabilitation is specifically excluded from health insurance policies by all providers. For persons with disorders of consciousness for which 24-hour care is needed, there are three beds in the country. Rehabilitation cannot be accessed or paid for in Ireland except through the HSE, and a person with an acquired brain injury cannot bring his or her own physiotherapist into a long-stay hospital in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> This evening I make the case that we need to urgently review the position with regard to the National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">I thank Deputy Keating for raising the issue. I assume he understands that I will not be referring to any individual case other than to express our sympathy to the family of the person he mentioned. It was quite a tragic case. I hope that is accepted.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position in relation to the provision of rehabilitative services to persons with acquired brain injury in Ireland. Brain injury health services are provided across a range of settings, by different organisations and by many health professionals and carers. The HSE clinical strategy and programmes directorate has a number of clinical programmes that are working in the area of the brain, including neurology, epilepsy, stroke and rehabilitation medicine. These programmes are focused on reducing waiting times and addressing specific disease pathways and models of care with a view to developing a national framework for the management of long-term neurological conditions. The HSE also provides services through primary care teams with community-based therapy services and personal social services, often funded through partner agencies in the non-statutory sector. The Government's national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland provides the overarching framework for the development and provision of such services. The strategy made a number of recommendations for services for persons with neuro-rehabilitation needs that covered different types of provision, including clinical, therapeutic, social, vocational and community supports. The HSE has established a steering group which will guide the implementation of the strategy with the development of a framework for implementation and ensure adequate links with the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> An implementation framework for the strategy is being developed by both the HSE disability services division and the HSE clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine. It will be circulated to a wider group of stakeholders for consultation. The development of this framework is the first phase of the implementation planning process. It will establish implementation structures, develop a model of services and supports, map existing resources and review and reconfigure existing services. In addition, the framework will identify requirements to support service delivery, such as information systems, staffing competencies and quality improvement. Communication with stakeholders will take place during the implementation process. A priority will be to establish an implementation structure in order to guide the development of services. Services will need to be determined and informed by clear referral and service protocols which are developed nationally and implemented consistently throughout the health care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_712"> The strategy proposes a hub-and-spoke arrangement between the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire and a network of regional rehabilitation units. Plans to invest in and redevelop the National Rehabilitation Hospital are well under way, and I hope that this will give us greater scope and greater availability of beds. I also understand that a number of proposed developments at regional level are at early design stage. The HSE also provides substantial funding to a number of organisations, such as Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, Headway Ireland, Enable Ireland and Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland, to provide supports and services to persons with neurological conditions. It is important that the continuum of services and supports required are made available by the health system and by those other State agencies to provide specific services consistent with their statutory remit. Waiting times, access, treatment and quality of care continue to be priorities for reform for this Government, despite budgetary constraints. The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and his or her family and impacts on the individual's health and social, educational, vocational and recreational participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> I hope this is of some benefit to the Deputy. The further development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire will give us greater scope for delivery of these services.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">I thank the Minister of State. I fully appreciate that she is not in a position to comment in any way on a specific case, but I am sure she understands that bringing such an example to the Dáil today helps to emphasise the need for progress on an issue such as this. I appreciate the Minister of State's statement on behalf of the Minister for Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> I recognise that the Government's national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland provides that overarching framework for the development and provision of these services. I referred to the 2011-2015 strategy report, and I recognise the importance of this. The strategy sets out a national model for service delivery and a framework for the future based on a continuum of individualised supports and services that are accessed at different stages in the rehabilitation journey, but what concerns me is that this report is still awaiting the development of an implementation plan by the Department of Health and the HSE. There is a large and growing unmet need since the report was introduced in 2011. What I really want is to see that strategy implemented and progress made on it after the number of years that have passed since its introduction. I thank the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_716">As I stated, the priority will be to establish an implementation structure in order to guide the development of services. Services will need to be determined and informed by clear referral and service protocols which are developed nationally and implemented consistently throughout the health care system. I reiterate that on the basis that we know how to implement it. The difficulty is pulling together all of the services that already exist, not only within the Dublin region but throughout the country. Those services were fragmented to a significant degree, but they were there. With the hub-and-spoke approach, which is, I believe, the one that we should follow, one would have the hub, which is centralised within the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, and the other areas would develop on a consultation basis, with rehabilitation consultants in different areas delivering services.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> The most important issue - which, as an elected representative, I am aware that others hear about as well - is the constant cry to get people into an appropriate bed in that rehabilitation hospital. Even when this country was awash with money, that need was there, but it was not given any great freedom to develop. We have decided to allow that development to go ahead and we will be providing whatever resources are necessary to ensure that the hospital is redeveloped, because we need additional capacity and it has the expertise. As I stated, I do not want to refer to individual cases, but in the event that someone in a crisis situation had easier access to a bed within that type of specialist centre, I am not saying the outcome would have been different, but I believe that the security within the family would probably have been different.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, for attending to take this Topical Issue, which is one that has been raised with me by postmasters in my constituency in recent weeks. I am sure that postmasters have been contacting Deputies in other constituencies about it as well. It relates to the revised application form for pensions that was sent out by the Department of Social Protection asking people to consider financial institutions - banks - as their first option for payment. Postmasters believe that this was biased. As one stated, postmasters were being asked to put themselves out of business by recommending that their customers use financial institutions for certain Department of Social Protection payments rather than the post offices themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> The postmasters also pointed to the facts that more than 200 post offices have closed in recent years, approximately two thirds of which were in rural communities, and that Department of Social Protection payments constituted one third of post offices' revenue. That is a large chunk of revenue. If people were to move <i>en masse </i>to financial institutions, the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, contends that approximately 400 of the 1,100 remaining post offices would be put at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> A review of the future of post offices was published recently. It made a number of recommendations on how to expand their services. The Minister of State might be able to indicate where those recommendations lie within Government policy or thinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> We should recognise that the post office network is the largest retail sector in the State, employing approximately 3,700 people. Apart from the employment aspect, there is a social element to the post offices, particularly in rural areas, but also in urban centres. For example, my constituency of Cork North-Central has large urban areas like Farranree, Knocknaheeny, Parklands and Onslow Gardens that do not have a bank. In fact, there is no bank across the north side of the constituency. They are all centred in the valley. Elderly people must travel several miles to the nearest bank even though there is a post office just around the corner.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> We need to examine policy on this matter and take the recent review on board. That review made a number of recommendations that should be examined. Asking people who are reliant on social welfare payments to consider as their first option banking institutions would be unfair. The letters that I received from the postmasters asked for the Government at the minimum to withdraw the application form and return the original, which placed the post office as the first option and made no recommendation as to which institution people should use. Their request could be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_723"> This is a pressing issue. I have spoken to postmasters in other areas. They are raising the matter and there is some lobbying. Will the Minister of State comment on the review and the rationale behind the Department's decision to make banking institutions the preferred option?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection (Deputy Kevin Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_725">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. He was right about the number of post offices that had closed. I have just noticed in my notes that 198 post offices closed between 2007 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> I reassure the Deputy that the Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network, as is clear in the programme for Government. It is a key piece of the social infrastructure in urban and rural areas. A part of the strength of the post office brand and one of its chief selling points is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by everyone. In particular, we support the concept of the post office as a front office of government, in other words, a way by which an array of State services can be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> In that regard, the Department of Social Protection contract is the single most important contract for An Post. Under it, my Department will pay more than €50 million to An Post this year for cash payment services to welfare clients. This is a significant sum and a vital source of business for post offices around the country. This indicates our commitment to the network.</p>
            <p eId="para_728"> The post office network business development group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, has decided that the future of the post office will be best secured through the development of a more sustainable business model, including the development of financial services, which is identified by the group as fundamental to the future of the network. The development by An Post of a payment account will be critical to a more sustainable business model as society moves to electronic payments rather than cash payments, for example, standard bank accounts. This approach was mentioned in Mr. Kerr's report and An Post is excited about developing it.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> Concerns have been raised recently regarding the format of some of the Department's scheme application forms and how they may impact on the post office network. I assure the House that these application forms do not remove the option for clients to be paid at the post office. This option still remains on the forms and clients can continue to receive their payments at post offices if they so wish. Some of these forms were amended in the past year to recognise the general societal trend towards electronic payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_730"> I emphasise that the forms provided by the Department to enable clients to apply for social welfare entitlements are continuously reviewed to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all clients. However, in order to ensure that the Department's forms present payment options equally, I have asked it to update them to contain neutral wording in respect of payment options so that one option is not favoured over another. Changing the wording will take a bit of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> I assure the Deputy that current payment options will remain in place in order to reflect the different circumstances and needs of our clients, as has always been the case, and in the interest of serving our clients in the best way possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> Like the Deputy, I am from an urban area where post offices are as valued as they are in rural ones, but we must change the business model and work with An Post to do so. I am sure that the Deputy has friends and acquaintances who have retired and who, having received their salaries by way of electronic payment, will opt for the electronic payment of their pensions. We must work with An Post with a view to a more sustainable financial model. The Deputy may have read today about-----</p>

            <p eId="para_734">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and welcome his statement that the wording of the application form will be changed as soon as possible so as to provide a neutral option. One of the postmasters' criticisms related to how the new form recommended financial institutions as the preferred option. I understand that some people may want to receive their payments electronically via financial institutions, but the Department's application forms should not cite preferred options.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> I agree that much more work is necessary so as to secure the future of the post office network. This is why I welcome the report of the group chaired by Mr. Kerr. It contained some excellent recommendations that could go a long way towards ensuring that the network's future is guarded as much as possible. Obviously, there will be other challenges apart from this issue involving Department of Social Protection contracts, so we must factor in that possibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> I welcome the commitment to change the application forms. I hope that it will be done sooner rather than later, as this issue is taxing the minds of postmasters.</p>

            <p eId="para_737">The Kerr report comes under the remit of the Minister of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, but as far as I am aware it is open for public consultation. I suggest that all Members and the general public make submissions in that area. We are all used to An Post, but the model of business is moving very quickly. We have only to look at our own offices to become aware of the vast amounts of correspondence that come in by e-mail. I notice that queries come in through social media, so the model has to change and probably has to change quickly. Bobby Kerr will not thank me for calling it the Kerr report. That report lays out a roadmap. There are options from An Post. The standard bank account is an excellent way for it to expand and develop. An Post is anxious to move into that area. I also know that postmasters believe that will play a key role.</p>
            <p eId="para_738"> The Government is developing pilot schemes for microfinance - that is, micro-loans for people on low incomes. Those payments could be made through An Post. We need to be positive about developing a business model that will lead An Post for the next couple of decades. If it remains in its current model it will not survive. Therefore, that model has to grow and expand. </p>
            <p eId="para_739"> The volume of money that flows from the Department of Social Protection to An Post is €53.8 million. That volume will decrease naturally as people go back to work and there is a drop-off in the payments we make to An Post for paying out dole money on a weekly basis. Those numbers have dropped significantly in the past four years. A net total of more than 100,000 jobs have been created in the economy. That represents 100,000 customers An Post had last year that it does not have this year and 100,000 payments it will not receive.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">That is positive for the economy and for society. The unintentional consequence is that there is less business from the Department of Social Protection going through the post office network. Therefore, there is an urgency in developing that business model to ensure that post offices survive the next decade.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_742">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to raise this matter and the Ceann Comhairle for selecting it as one of the items for discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_743"> This is an important issue. It concerns a constituent of mine who agreed to rear and support the children of a family friend and his wife, both of whom died when they were very young. A guardianship arrangement was put in place. The couple who were the guardians do not have a family of their own. None the less, they looked after the children exceptionally well and supported them through primary and second level education. The first girl, a teenager, is going on to third level education. After making a grant application to SUSI, they discovered that the incomes of both guardians are factored in when considering eligibility for same. The teenager is the first of a number of children who will hopefully go on to third level, and the same issue will arise again. Given that the incomes of both parents are factored into the means test, they may not be eligible for a college grant. </p>
            <p eId="para_744"> The reality is that the couple involved did not anticipate this problem. Apparently under a guardianship arrangement the teenager ceases to be in guardianship after the age of 18 years. They looked also at the issue of children in foster care. Apparently children in foster care are fortunate in being able to go on to third level, as the income of the carers - the parents or the husband and wife looking after the children - is not factored in. Clearly, there is a dichotomy in the application of the grants scheme by SUSI. Obviously, it operates under the regulations set down by the Department of Education and Skills, but it is an area that needs to be examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> Guardianship is an invaluable service for HSE and State bodies that would otherwise have the responsibility of looking after children who, when their parents die, are unable to look after themselves. There is a need to have the guardianship outlet available to them as well as foster care. It is an aspect we need to protect. There is a need to ensure it is not made less attractive for the honourable and commendable parents who are prepared to provide care in such a situation. </p>
            <p eId="para_746"> I am pleased that the Minister of State is from the north east. This is a north east problem. I am prepared, on a confidential basis, to provide him with more details of the case. I implore him to consider the case sympathetically. It is a genuine case. There is nothing political about it. I am being up front. I am providing limited details in my contribution in the Chamber as we are restricted in what we can say about individual cases. I appeal to the Minister to go back to the Department and examine the regulations with a view to seeing what can be done to help.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_747">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. As the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, cannot be present, I am taking the debate on her behalf. I am not familiar with the case but I accept that it is a genuine case.</p>
            <p eId="para_748"> For student grant purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances, whether as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students. A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on 1 January of the year of first entry to an approved course, or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years, and is not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the previous October. Otherwise he or she continues to be assessed on the basis of the parents' or guardians' income.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> An objective of the Department's statutory-based student grant scheme is to provide additional assistance to dependent students where the parents' or guardians' income is below a certain threshold and warrants additional assistance by way of a grant. Only in exceptional circumstances where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents or guardians is provided can applicants who are under 23 years of age be assessed without reference to their parents' or guardians' income or address. The difficulty is that parents are regarded as being under the scheme. The Student Support Act 2011 defines a parent as including a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts 1964 to 1997. This definition also provides that a person who has adopted a child under the Adoption Act 2010 or outside the State is considered a parent for grant purposes. I understand the predicament and I can see that this can act as a deterrent for people who are considering becoming guardians. It is not an issue I have dealt with before. I will certainly take a look at the case to see whether in general the regulations are unfair to this particular category. Those are the rules at present. I appreciate that the Deputy is asking if we can have another look at them. I will certainly look at the case and will speak to the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, about it to ascertain whether this is an area we need to examine in terms of the rules. </p>
            <p eId="para_750"> The Deputy raised the issue of foster parents. In the case of a fostered applicant, it is the State that is offering the protection and care in circumstances in which the parents have not been able or are unlikely to provide the care the child needs, so students may be assessed as dependent students by reference to their own income where they satisfy the conditions of article 21.3 of the student grant scheme, which refers to irreconcilable estrangement. It is a little bit different because the State is the person in charge, unlike in the case of guardianship. What the Deputy is saying in general is that this is a deterrent. We will examine the issue to see whether there are similar cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> I am sorry I cannot give the Deputy a better answer or say that we can fix it, but I will certainly take up the case and look at the rules. I understand the point the Deputy is making.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">The guardians did not realise all the consequences and costs involved. The Deputy did the right thing on behalf of the young family. I will examine that but I am afraid the rules as they stand do recognise a guardian and a parent as the same thing. </p>

            <p eId="para_753">I am somewhat disappointed. I am sure it is not the Minister of State’s fault. I am sure the briefing note comes from the section. He quite rightly identifies the fact that guardians are treated in the same way as biological parents. That seems quite unfair to me. I am sure the circumstances will vary from one case to another but there is a great need for a spirit of generosity and humanity and consideration for one’s neighbour to provide the family support that guardianship requires for children whose biological parents have departed this world. The guardians are prepared to step in, support and look after them right up to third level education. There is a problem. I would be more than happy to sit down with the Minister of State, go through the individual case and provide more evidence. The Minister of State understands all the circumstances I have outlined so I implore him to do that and perhaps we can arrange afterwards to meet.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_756"> To say that Gaelscoil Phádraig in Ballybrack has had a raw deal would be a major understatement. It has been in existence for 20 years. In that time it has been in four different temporary locations. Most of that time, and currently, it has been on a 0.7 acre site with prefabricated buildings, many of which are over 15 years old, some of which have recently required emergency repairs. The contractor repairing them cannot guarantee those repairs for any period. Fifth and sixth classes, and first and second classes are thrown together. It has a tiny play area which because it has no assembly hall has to double up for use for school concerts and assemblies. The conditions are completely unacceptable. The classrooms are below the recommended size, yet this school was promised in 2005 that it would be moved to a permanent location in the nearby Archbishop McQuaid school. Ten years on and 20 years after it was set up, it is still in these completely unacceptable conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> The school wants to hear from the Minister of State today that the coming year will be its last year in these temporary conditions. It is shameful that it has been left there so long. It cannot abide these conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> At this stage the parents, teachers and students wonder what they did wrong, that they were allowed to persist in these completely unsuitable conditions. This is a disadvantaged area but despite having applied for Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, status Gaelscoil Phádraig did not get that, although all the children come from the same area as children in other schools given DEIS status. The Minister of State might also consider that. They have been short-changed for 20 years. It is just not good enough. The Taoiseach talked earlier about the priority he gives to investing in the future, education, upskilling our citizens and so on. How the hell can we do any of that or how can that mean anything if we leave our kids in these conditions for 20 years? That is the commitment they want. They really want some hope because they have had enough and are at the end of their tether.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> The Minister of State will probably tell us that the school has been allocated a new emergency prefab. It is even frightened of getting that because it thinks that may be an excuse to put it on the long finger again and it points out that will further infringe on the tiny play area it has and crowd the school out even further. It may have to put up with it for another year but it wants a guarantee this is the last year and that it will be in the school that was allocated ten years ago, which sits less than a quarter of a mile away, and that the new buildings the special school currently in that building requires will be completed by then, and Gaelscoil Phádraig can have the school it should have had ten years ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, and I apologise that she was not able to take it.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the accommodation needs of Gaelscoil Phádraig, Ballybrack.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> The school is currently located in prefabricated accommodation on a site owned by Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown County Council in Ballybrack. The Deputy said it has been there for 20 years. I take his word for that; I did not realise it was that long although I knew it was a long time. It is agreed that the accommodation is totally unsatisfactory. The Deputy is also aware that it is intended that the school will relocate to a premises currently occupied by Ballyowen Meadows special school pending the construction of a new school building for Ballyowen Meadows.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> The major building project for Ballyowen Meadows special school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning. During the course of the project, an appeal was made to An Bord Pleanála regarding the decision to grant planning permission for the Ballyowen Meadows building project. I cannot explain the 20 year delay. I can only say the last part of the delay was caused by the appeal to An Bord Pleanála. This contributed to some delay with the project. In February 2015, An Bord Pleanála upheld the decision to grant planning permission and I am pleased to say the building project is now progressing as fast as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_764"> Specifically, the school's design team is preparing the stage 2(b) detailed design documentation for submission to the Department for review and approval. Assuming no issues arise in the review of the stage 2(b) submission, the project will then be authorised to proceed to tender, with a view to commencing construction late this year, 2015, or early 2016. I cannot say how quickly it will be built, hopefully it will get a good builder but it certainly is the plan to start construction at the back end of this year or early next year. That is the best I can give the Deputy at this stage. I know he wanted a guarantee that it would be in for September 2016. That might be a bit tight. It depends on the construction but the construction should start at the end of this year or early 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_765"> Once the building project for Ballyowen Meadows school is complete, the vacated building will become available for Gaelscoil Phádraig. It will not be possible for Ballyowen Meadows to vacate the building until its new school is constructed. The Deputy understands that and is not asking for that. He is right, in the meantime, the Department has sanctioned a temporary mainstream classroom to Gaelscoil Phádraig for September 2015 to assist with its accommodation needs. I understand from the Deputy that will cause difficulties in terms of space but we also have to have accommodation for the students. The Deputy is looking for a guarantee and the start of construction is probably the best we can give and it looks like that should happen at the back end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_766">There is no news there for Gaelschoil Phádraig. It is aware of all that the Minister of State said. This is the fear, that it will extend beyond this year. The situation has got progressively worse for it after a 20 year saga of moving from one place to another. It was in one room without proper windows, then it had two classrooms in another school, then it had to be bussed to another area, now it has been in the prefabs for years. These prefabs are way beyond their sell-by date and are completely unsuitable. The numbers have increased by 26 this year so there will be more overcrowding. It had to hold last year's school concert in the playground. That is the only place it can hold assembly as well. It is not acceptable. Of course it does not want to be played off against a special school, which also needs to be housed. For this to have gone on for this long is crazy. After all it has gone through, the Department should be able to say it will get it, come hell or high water, by September 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">It would not be fair or right for this to drag on for another year thereafter. Gaelscoil Phádraig is asking the Department to recognise that it has been wronged, not only by this Government but by its predecessors over 20 years. The school has been short-changed and is asking that special care and attention are shown and an effort is made to ensure the new building is completed by the end of 2016. This could be achieved with determination. That is the appeal being made by the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_768"> I also ask that the Department consider the DEIS status of Gaelscoil Phádraig, which will, I understand, apply for disadvantaged status again this year. There is no reason for the school's failure to secure DEIS status given that other schools with students from the same catchment area have such status. Gaelscoil Phádraig has been short-changed at two levels and the Government must recognise the wrongs done to it by showing fairness to the children in the school. </p>

            <p eId="para_769">I understand the frustration felt by Deputy Boyd Barrett and students at Gaelscoil Phádraig having been educated in a prefabricated building for four years. This type of building tends to be too hot in summer and too cold in winter and I do not blame the pupils of the school for wanting to get out of prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_770"> The building project is progressing. I am not aware of any alternative that would shorten the process, nor did the Deputy suggest one. I cannot answer for 20 years of history as I have not been in this position for that long. It is safe to say, however, that the Department will progress this project as fast as it possibly can. This is a priority project to which we are committed. If everything goes to plan, the project will go to tender in the next couple of months and building will start either before Christmas or early in 2016. There is no point stating a school will be completed in a seven or eight months because we must not compromise the construction process. For this reason, it will probably be late 2016 or early 2017 before pupils transfer to the new building. That is the best option available.</p>
            <p eId="para_771"> The building project is proceeding and a new school will be built. The Deputy has asked that everything be done to ensure the school is completed as quickly as possible and I assure him that will be the case. The school will be built and when the special needs school moves into it, a building will be freed up for Scoil Phádraig. I do not expect the project to be delayed at this stage. I cannot answer for the previous planning history, the role of An Bord Pleanála and so forth; I can only explain what occurred in recent years. The project is moving ahead and the Department has a strong commitment to ensure it is completed as quickly as possible. Officials will do everything they can and I hope others on the ground will do likewise.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">I am pleased to move this motion on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party on the subject of the challenges facing the credit union movement at this time. I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of a wide range of members of the credit union movement, including representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Managers Association and the Credit Union Development Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The motion is balanced and realistic. It is the result of an extensive consultation process we have engaged in with the credit union movement and I am grateful for the assistance we have received in drafting it. I place on record the Fianna Fáil Party's unequivocal support for the credit union movement. As a party, we are determined to support the continued development of credit unions. </p>
          <p eId="para_813"> The credit union movement has a proud tradition in communities throughout the country. With expert local knowledge and strong personal relationships with members, credit unions are able to make sound judgments about lending to individuals, small businesses, the self-employed and farmers. Credit unions have a particularly strong presence in rural areas. The significance of this is even greater in the context of branch closures and the decimation of the post office network. This is not to underestimate the importance of credit unions in cities and major towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The unique feature of credit unions is that they are rooted in the communities they serve. With 4,000 employees, almost 10,000 volunteers and approximately 3 million members, no one can dispute that credit unions have served the country well. They have a proud past and the purpose of this debate is to help secure their future.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> The credit union movement is under attack from excessive and disproportionate regulation. The indifference of the Government towards credit unions is underlined by the lack of any clear strategy for their future.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> Much has been made of the high-profile examples of credit unions that got into difficulty. Credit unions are not perfect and many were not immune to the excesses of the Celtic tiger and made mistakes. Some made bad lending decisions and there were examples of poor governance and a lack of robust of internal controls. It is inevitable that further examples of credit unions with serious difficulties will emerge. However, the not-for-profit, volunteer driven and independent nature of credit unions preserved the sector from the worst examples of group-think that prevailed elsewhere in the financial system. This structure reduced the risk of contagion across the credit union movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I will address a number of issues, the first of which is the assistance the State has provided the credit union movement to date. Speaking in the Seanad in October 2011, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated the following. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_818"> If the movement was one large bank with individual branches, it would have no problems because the good ones would balance the bad ones, but individual credit unions have problems that are coming down the road quickly.... Some of them will need to be dealt with immediately, but we will not do it in one big bang. My advice is that this will cost between €500 million and €1 billion. </p>
          <p eId="para_819">The Government frequently points to the €250 million fund available to the Credit Union Restructuring Fund, ReBo, for the voluntary restructuring of credit unions and the further €250 million available for resolution purposes. Let us first consider the €250 million available to ReBo. To date, ReBo has drawn down less than €6 million from the credit union fund, half of which was spent on its operating costs. Moreover, set against the €6 million spent, one must consider that €1.4 million has been collected from the ReBo levy meaning the net cost of ReBo's work so far is approximately €4.5 million. I accept the fund has done some good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> On the resolution side, €35.4 million has been drawn down from the resolution fund by way of expenditure relating to incentives for credit union resolution, Central Bank resolution related expenses and interest expenses. Newbridge Credit Union alone accounted for €27 million of the total. However, over the same period the resolution fund generated income of €29 million, made up of €23.7 million in levy income, €1.4 million in interest income and €3.9 million in income estimated from the Newbridge Credit Union liquidation process. Therefore, the net drawdown from the resolution fund thus far is €6.4 million. Between ReBo and the resolution fund, the overall net cost to the State of supporting credit unions thus far is €11 million. When one considers that the Minister estimated almost four years ago that the cost could be up to €1 billion, one sees how wrong the Government has been on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> Whatever other conclusions can be drawn, it is clear that the credit union sector has not been an undue burden on the financial resources of the State. This is a message that needs to be heard loud and clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> I state unequivocally that our motion is not a call for lax regulation. I commend the work the credit unions have done in recent years by massively improving their internal controls and governance arrangements. The credit union movement has far more professionally qualified people among its employed and voluntary staff that it had previously. The sector has improved its overall reserve ratio without resorting to the types of tactics employed by some commercial banks which raised interest rates and charges at the expense of existing customers. </p>
          <p eId="para_823"> While the regulation of credit unions needs to be robust, it must also be fair, proportionate and based on a proper assessment of where the risks lie. In other jurisdictions, the role and function of credit unions is clearly set out at a national policy level and credit unions have been able to develop and grow the products and services they offer members. The Government has failed to implement a strategy in the past four years to underpin and develop the credit union sector. Reports in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today indicate there are plans to develop a plan to allow tens of thousands of families to avail of "hassle-free loans" of up to €1,000 as part of "Government moves to break the dependence on moneylenders". This has all the hallmarks of a sop to deflect attention from the failure of the Government to support the credit union sector over the past four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> Despite having close to 3 million members overall, the credit union movement is effectively stagnant, with the amount of its funds on loan declining year after year. This is unsustainable. The bottom line is that credit unions can only make money if they are able to issue new loans. In too many instances, the ability of credit unions to do just that is being unnecessarily constrained.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> Credit unions currently have €4 billion in loans to members, which is approximately 30% of their available funds. On paper, the sector has approximately €6 billion available to lend, with the potential for a massive shot in the arm for the economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_826">However, 52% of credit unions are currently subject to restrictions on their lending activity imposed by the Registrar of Credit Unions. When I refer to the registrar, it is not to refer to an individual but, in essence, to the regulator. The restrictions include those on the size of individual loans as well as on overall levels of lending. Of all credit unions, 35% have been operating with lending restrictions for a period of five years or more. These restrictions are impacting the ability of credit unions to earn enough income to pay a competitive dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 restricts a credit union from lending to any member for a period of one year who has altered his or her repayments whereas no such restrictions apply to the banking sector. Credit unions are thereby placed at a disadvantage. This is unfair and is stifling the sector and in my view it must be changed. Section 35 of the Credit Union Act also restricts the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can extend beyond a ten year term, thereby preventing credit unions from engaging in any meaningful long-term lending, including mortgages. There is also a strong case for relaxing this restriction to allow the sector to engage in targeted mortgage lending. This could include such areas as tenant purchase from local authorities or where a family member needs to buy out a share in a home from a sibling after inheriting the home. Section 35 requirements increase the risk within credit unions as the average loan is currently repaid within two and a half years. Longer-term lending is critical to manage risk more effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> Many credit union members have built up their savings with their credit unions over an extended period. In some instances, members will gather large sums of money through pension lump sums and inheritances or through regular savings. While the majority of credit union customers have less than €100,000 in savings, consumers should have choice with regard to their preferred savings institutions. By limiting credit union customers to a maximum of €100,000 in shares or deposits, customer choice is being unnecessarily limited. The symbolism of this proposed restriction is also significant. It is a clear statement by Government and the registrar of their lack of confidence in credit unions. The underlying message is that credit unions cannot be trusted to hold savings in excess of the deposit guarantee limit. This is a ridiculous constraint on credit unions and I seriously question its validity in competition law. The proposed cap on savings, which has already caused reputational damage to credit unions, will drive funds from the credit union sector into the banking sector and distort competition between the banking and credit union sectors for new deposits.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> The current regulatory structure does not support credit unions in developing additional products and services. Not one credit union has received approval for additional services since the banking crisis began. The approval process for credit unions seeking to engage in services such as debit cards is unclear. Credit unions need to be able to offers services such as debit cards if they are to be able to attract younger customers and compete with banks. They also need to be able to offer more products online. The message I get from credit unions is that they simply do not know where they stand with the registrar. I strongly believe that the current credit union regulatory framework is too conservative and is restricting credit unions from modernising their business model, which process is essential to the long-term survival and, hopefully, prosperity of the movement. There are a great many opportunities for credit unions if only they were allowed to pursue them. For example, credit unions have the capacity to play a key role in social enterprise funding as highlighted by Forfás and as is already the case in the USA, Canada and Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> Healthy credit unions are not being told that they are healthy and that they should continue to do what they are doing. Equally, credit unions that may be unviable on their own are not being given clear feedback from the Central Bank. That is a key problem which is raised time and time again. The question posed to me by credit union management is whether the regulator understands the ethos of the credit union movement and whether there is an agenda to wind it down eventually. People are posing that question in private meetings and it should be posed openly here on the floor of the House. Current research by the Credit Union Managers' Association shows that an estimated 20 credit unions have outstanding AGMs of between two and four years because they are not being allowed to hold them. This is despite the fact that section 78(4) of the Credit Union Act 1997 allows the registrar to direct a credit union, under certain circumstances, to postpone an AGM for a period not exceeding nine months. On the face of it, it would appear that the registrar is not complying with the very legislation it is supposed to police.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Despite the relatively poor take up of options under the personal insolvency legislation, including debt relief notices and debt settlement arrangements, credit unions are concerned that the law is weighted in favour of bank loans and results in the cost of losses arising from mortgage-related loans within the banking sector being transferred to the credit union movement. This must be examined and quantified. If the legislation is found to be defective, it must be amended to ensure a level playing pitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> In addition to the items I have touched on, our motion also sets out a number of other practical measures to support the sector including the establishment of an industry-led forum with representation from all stakeholders that examines the future growth potential of credit unions in Ireland; requiring the Central Bank in its consumer protection role to engage directly with credit unions to establish the impact the current legislative and regulatory restrictions are having on communities; and the publication by the Minister for Finance of a White Paper on the role of the credit union movement within the broader financial services sector in Ireland. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply on some of these points.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Since word broke of our motion a number of days ago, I have received many messages from credit union members and those involved in running them. I will provide the Minister with two examples of the responses I have received from those responsible for running credit unions. One person wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_834">To update you on the position of our own Credit Union: we are still in limbo with the Central Bank but at this stage the effects of the restrictions as we predicted have become critical, these restrictions necessary when introduced originally in, are leading us to a situation whereby [our] Credit Union will rapidly be in a very serious state. It is disappointing to note that despite a complete transformation of [our] Credit Union with among other things arrears on new lending for the past number of years averaging just 0.5%, cost cutting policy changes to include a large number of redundancies, changes to management, introduction of a new and vibrant board, it appears that either through negligence or an agenda the Central Bank are allowing this situation to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Another credit union wrote to me in the past 24 hours to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_836">It would appear that the RCU [or registrar] impose these sanctions [the lending restrictions] on an arbitrary basis like some form of sentence or penance for bad behaviour. It's sad to see this credit union 'withering' on the vine as we cannot lend. The demand is there but the restriction limits us. It's time that the RCU's role was reviewed independently. We have no recourse and their word is final in these situations. There must be an arbitration or review mechanism in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Having researched this issue extensively over the past number of weeks, I have to say that unless something changes, I am deeply concerned about the future of the credit union movement. Credit unions need our support now more than ever. The last thing any of us wants to see is the gradual decline of a credit union movement which has served this country so well. What is needed is for the Government and the registrar to work with credit unions in a genuine spirit of co-operation. The Minister could start by postponing the commencement of remaining sections of the Credit Union Act 2012 until the impact on credit unions has been properly examined. Above all else, we need a plan that secures the future of credit unions. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_377">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_838">I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on his very fine exposition of the challenges faced by the credit union movement and the need to treat it differently. If financial difficulties in the credit union movement had been the only financial difficulties facing the financial sector, we would not have had a problem. Taken together, the credit unions in difficulty could have been more than supported by those that had acted prudently. As a sector, credit unions acted in a prudent manner during the boom years and represented a good example for the likes of the major banks as to how to conduct their affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I have noticed that when a problem arises in this society we have a great propensity for imposing more and more regulation and not making a differentiation between big and small and between those who failed and those who did not fail. That is very evident in this case where more and more regulation is being imposed on this sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Coming from a co-operative background, I believe the idea of co-operation and that of community ownership creates a totally different situation from the idea of large corporate commercial ownership. To have the same type of rule for a credit union as for a commercial bank negates the reason that credit unions were set up in the United States in the first place. As the Minister knows, credit unions were set up on a mutual basis. In other words, people saved and the collective savings of all the savers were made available within the community for those who needed to borrow. They were not set up as major financial institutions operating under the normal rules followed by such institutions. They were devised as a mechanism for those at the lower end of society to access cash on the basis of mutual solidarity and trust. In other words, they were the ultimate community organisation. It seems the Minister, the Department and the regulators are trying to change them into something else, namely, major financial institutions with the same type of regulation that is imposed on such institutions, forgetting that the great strength of the credit union was mutual solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> It is interesting to consider the basis on which credit unions throughout the country lend money. I note this Government wants to do everything on paper, whether it be a matter related to community welfare officers or any other sector, requiring an increasing number of forms, and more complicated forms, to be completed. It has taken personal knowledge and discretion out of the equation. That change falls hardest on those who are least well off. I have often pointed out that one of the biggest challenges that those with very limited means face when they hit financial difficulties is their inability to borrow money, even very modest sums. Those on a higher income with more assets find it much easier to borrow because banks are much more attracted to them. </p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Under the credit union tradition, credit unions operated on a common bond basis and personal knowledge of the community and money was lent to people who may not have had major tangible assets on the basis of their record and the lending committee's knowledge of them. If we take that ability away from the credit unions, if we move into having a much more regulated and straitjacketed system and destroy the common bond basis of the credit union, we will be in serious danger of pushing people back towards commercial moneylenders, some legal and some illegal, because people at crisis points in their lives have to access money and if they cannot get it legally, there is always a temptation they will go to people who would not act with the responsibility, solidarity and support shown by a credit union.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> I have always been struck by the success of credit unions in the more disadvantaged communities in our society and their success in encouraging the habit of saving and in lending money to people and getting that money back. One of their incredible achievements has been to create a sense of loyalty among their customers regarding their duty to repay. I am stuck every day of the week when dealing with people in financial trouble by the priority they give to meeting their credit union liabilities and perhaps, at times, they list them above more pressing needs because they feel they have that obligation and they also believe that if they are honourable with their credit union that it will be there for them again in their hour of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> Therefore, we must look at the big picture of why credit unions are different and the reason they were set up to be different and we must reflect on their history and their purpose. I have not been a great fan of the idea of amalgamating credit unions and making them into big commercial organisations because that moves us away from the common bond basis of the credit union and the personal knowledge aspect as those in the credit unions knew the people to whom they were lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> If the credit unions are changed into big commercial entities, as the Minister seems hell bent on doing with all the regulation that has been introduced, that will force somebody to set up a new type of mutual savings and lending club that will fulfil the role that the credit union always fulfilled. Therefore, it is time to stand back and say that we need special rules. It is also time for all of us in this House to reflect that if the building societies had not been changed into public limited companies and had remained operating as mutual societies facilitating people who had saved to buy a house - with one person being given a loan to buy a house and the next person saving and then getting a loan and so on - we would not have run into some of the major problems we have had as a result of people viewing those societies not as a means of helping people to buy a home but as a means of making a great deal of money for the investors. If they had remained operating for the purpose for which they were set up, we would have avoided many of the problems people now face in regard to their home loans. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Coming from a co-operative background, the idea of mutual assistance and of living in a community and the members of it helping each other with a phase of saving followed by at phase of borrowing and then a phase of saving again, makes a lot of sense to me. It is time we moved back to the basic principles and ensure that the structures we put in place are conducive to this. That is in no way to say that credit unions should not be allowed to have new services, including debit cards and so on, which are part of modern living, with such cards being a device for withdrawing money. With the demise of the building societies operating on a mutual basis, the nearest thing we will now get to building societies will be if we allow the credit unions give mortgage type loans secured on assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> There are many more things I could say about credit unions. We need to treat them differently because they are different. If we do not do so, the social fallout of that will cause great hardship for the most vulnerable people at the lowest end of our society.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Browne<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_848">I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on tabling this motion, which highlights the manner in which credit unions are being stifled by lending restrictions and unfair competition from the banks. I was a member of the board of Enniscorthy Credit Union for a number of years prior to being elected to this House. I was asked to leave it then, which was fair enough from a political point of view. The credit union sector has a proud tradition of supporting communities across County Wexford. With expert local knowledge and strong personal relationships, credit unions were able to make sound judgments about lending to individual customers, small businesses, the self-employed and small farmers. We have credit unions in the four towns in the county and we also have credit union offices in rural areas of the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">At a time when banks and post offices are closing, it is important they are allowed to continue on a smaller scale in rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> The credit union was always known as the ordinary people's bank. It specialised in communions, confirmations, weddings, Christmas top ups and car loans, without the bureaucracy and red tape people would encounter if they had to go to a bank. The cap now being imposed by the Minister and the regulator is certainly not going to help credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> I am involved with a GAA club which has a savings club. Approximately €800,000 a year is placed into the local credit union in Enniscorthy. Will the cap of €100,000 affect that? We probably have about 500 individual members. Will they be treated as individual members, or will we no longer be able to put that money into the credit union? Will we have to move to the banking institutions? The Minister might clarify this in his reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Unfortunately, the reality is that the credit union sector is effectively stagnant due to the current Government policy. Credit unions can only make money if they are able to issue new loans. However, in far too many instances, the ability of credit unions to do just that is being unnecessarily constrained by the cap and the restrictions about which the regulator and the Central Bank are now talking. As Deputy McGrath has pointed out, the credit union sector itself has undergone massive change in recent years. Its regulatory framework has been overhauled, and professionally qualified people can now be counted amongst its employed and voluntary staff. The financial position of the credit union sector has also been improved and, without this, credit unions would have to resort to the type of tactics employed by commercial banks that raise interest rates and charges at the expense of the existing customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> We have a concern that various legislative and regulatory provisions collectively threaten the viability of credit unions as they very much allude to maintaining an "as is" format, which undermines the ability of the sector to innovate and expand. These include restrictions on the length of time for which a loan can be issued, the maximum amount credit union members can have on deposit, and the approved process for new products such as debit cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The role of the Central Bank has to be questioned. In my opinion, the way in which it treats credit unions is nothing short of a disgrace. Credit unions are unable to get information or clarification from the Central Bank. There is no dialogue or discussion, just the heavy hand of regulation on a continuous basis. While 100% of Irish banks have failed and have no restrictions, 1% of credit unions failed and that sector has 50% restrictions. I wonder how the Central Bank can justify that.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> In other jurisdictions, the functions and role of the credit unions are clearly set out. Here, that is certainly not the case. We have no national policy on the future role of credit unions. It is important that we look at a new policy and a new way forward for them. We need a review of section 35 legislation relating to restrictions on rescheduled loans and term limits on lending; a streamlining of the process for the approval of additional services; a financial impact analysis to be conducted on the extent of losses incurred by credit unions arising form the personal insolvency legislation; and, as Deputy McGrath has said, a White Paper on the future role of the credit union sector within the broader financial services in Ireland. It is important that we recognise the great contribution the credit unions have made for ordinary people, who go to a bank and have the door slammed in their faces, are on small incomes and are seeking small loans. If they go to the credit union, 90% of the time they will be looked after.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> The Minister should face up to his responsibilities regarding the future of the credit unions. The cap he is now talking about imposing on them should be lifted and he should clarify the position of the many penny bank clubs and saving clubs around the country which save with credit unions. If the €100,000 cap is applied, the credit unions will have no place for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_857">I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for giving us this opportunity to put credit unions front and centre in political debate. They have not been discussed for some time. We should acknowledge their important role in the recovery of the country and, most importantly, in the recovery of trust in the financial sector. No matter how much financial engineering and investment goes on, trust in financial institutions will take a long time to be recovered after recent years. The financial institution model that enjoys the most trust is the local one - the community-owned, community-based organisations that are the hundreds of credit unions the length and breadth of the 32 counties. They have withstood the greatest pressure and the biggest regulation over the last years. As we speak tonight, there are probably tens of people across the country meeting their local boards, making decisions and ambitious plans for the development of their credit unions and communities, yet they are to be handcuffed by regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> The regulator is not thinking outside the box in respect of the role credit unions can and will play, if we are to have an economic recovery that is fair and that is spread. As Deputy Browne said, in order for the recovery to be fair, the credit unions need access to those who will not get bank lending. In order for it to be spread, we need to give the credit unions the resources and power to become an essential part of SME lending. In 2012, we established a structure around Microfinance Ireland, which took a long time to get going. Only in the last 12 months, under the direction of a new chief executive, has it begun to make an impact. During that debate, we pointed out that the credit union sector is ideally placed to start a microfinance scheme to SMEs. It knew local business, local business conditions and the potential of businesses. However, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation dismissed the idea and said the sector was not suited to that role. Despite that, credit unions came together with their local enterprise boards, in Kilkenny and a number of other places, and put together a scheme of assisted lending and support in partnership with the old enterprise board. The intention was to continue this with the local enterprise office, but that, too, in many cases, was hit on the head by the regulator and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> We have had many discussions with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about the need for SME finance, particularly for start-up businesses. Here is an organisation that is willing to come up with ideas and products and that has the requisite knowledge and experience of lending, yet it is constrained from doing so because of a lack of willingness on the part of the regulator and the Government. Despite what the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Bruton, say, it is still a big problem to get funding to start a business, particularly small-scale funding and especially for those not in the business of exports or IT.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> In the last years, the credit union sector has trained up its staff as professional financiers with training programmes that are acknowledged independently as some of the best and toughest on the market. They have the professional and local knowledge. Why is the Government not willing to unlock that knowledge and potential and open up an opportunity not just for the credit union movement, but for so many would-be entrepreneurs and employers?</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> Deputy Twomey will be familiar with the fact that in many rural communities, the abeyance in Leader funding in the past few years has starved many local development organisations of their ability to bring a project to fruition, be it enterprise-related or a community development project. Although Clann Credo, the social financing organisation, does very good work, this is an area in which the credit unions have local knowledge and expertise. Many of those who are on the board of a local credit union are probably also involved with the local community development organisation and have that knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">If we opened up their ability to do that, extended their lending range and gave them the chance to be the local social finance partner, it would open up so much opportunity not just economically but, most importantly, socially for local communities, local sporting organisations and local educational development, and for so many areas that have been starved of resources for so many reasons. However, these resources are sitting in a savings account in the local credit union or in its bank account, looking for investment and for a return on that investment, which would come were it given the opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> There are so many opportunities and so many ways of thinking outside the box, yet what did the Government do? It forced the Irish League of Credit Unions to go to court to try to define what it was doing and what its relationship was with the regulator. That is not as it should be. This is an organisation that, for many decades, has been at the forefront of community development. We should not be dragging and forcing it to go to court to assert its rights and assert its identity. People like John Hume did not get involved in the credit union movement to see it go that way; they got involved in the credit union to keep it true to its community and to community development. That is what it wants to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> While there are a few bad eggs, we do not see credit unions closing down local branches wholesale or withdrawing local services at a day's notice. We do not see them telling businesses or anybody else on what days they can lodge money and on what days they cannot, or how they can lodge the money or how they cannot. We do not see them upping their fees for doing business by 200% or 300% at the behest of shareholders who do not even live in or do business in the country. That is not the ethos. This is an organisation that is willing to do business but one that has been strangled by regulation for the sake of regulation, as Deputy Ó Cuív said. It has been strangled by a system that does not understand or, frankly, does not seem to want to understand the ethos. It does not understand why local people get around a table every month to run their credit union and develop their community, why they give up their time for free to do that or why they travel across the country to board meetings and conferences. They do this so their credit union can grow, so they can drive forward and so they can be ambitious for their community, yet we have a system that is trying to choke that ambition and drive, and nobody in government seems to want to do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> This morning's announcement is typical. This motion was tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath and, suddenly, we get an announcement with no detail and with no timescale for roll-out. The credit unions will be allowed to make available small-scale, regulated payday loans, and I am sure we will tie on the post offices as well to keep them happy. The Minister has had four years to develop a strategy to actually push the credit unions in terms of what they want to bring to the table and to challenge that perception, yet he has failed. So much attention has been given to rebuilding the financial system, yet we have left this very important element out of the discussion. The credit unions have been dismissed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as not having SME experience even though each and every credit union is an SME in its own right. They are small businesses in their own right; they understand what it is like to open the door on a Monday morning and try to get through the week. They understand that pressure, and the people around the table as directors understand it more than anyone else. If we had had a little more of that understanding in our big banks in the past few years, we might not be in half the mess we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The Minister has an opportunity. There is a ball there and what is needed is somebody to take that ball and run with it. This could open up so much opportunity not just for the movement but for communities, for small business, for ambition and for dreams throughout the country. This will result in employment growth, which will result in financial stability growth, which will ensure there are financial services in the many parts of the country that big business and big banks have given up on. We can depend on the credit union as a local organisation to stand by its community, even though our Government may not be willing to stand by the credit unions.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">Credit unions have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities throughout the country. They are an integral part of communities and the Government has put in place a number of measures to ensure that credit unions can continue to provide these vital services to its members and to ensure the stability of the sector into the future. These measures include the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions; the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012; the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, known as ReBo; the availability of €500 million to support the stability of the credit union movement; the introduction of the stabilisation support scheme; and the establishment of the current Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, in September 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> The safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are priorities for this Government. I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the Government's recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy. Credit unions provide a unique and trusted service to their members. The Government has a clear policy to support the strategic growth and development of credit unions in Ireland, as set out in the Commission on Credit Unions report and recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The Government established the Commission on Credit Unions in May 2011. The Deputy will recall we entered government in March of that year, so there was no delay in addressing the issues around credit unions. We asked the commission to make recommendations in regard to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and their community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect members' savings and financial stability. The commission report was agreed and co-authored by key stakeholders, including credit union representatives. The commission worked intensively over a nine-month period to address and deliver on ambitious terms of reference. The process was a participative one, with wide representation from the credit union movement. The agreed commission report sets out the blueprint for the viability of credit unions in Ireland into the future and its constituent elements are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> The commission published its final report in March 2012, one year after we went into government. The Government fully accepted all the recommendations in the commission's report. Over 60 of its recommendations have been implemented in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012. The legislation contains measures which will reform and strengthen credit unions and deals with four broad areas: prudential regulation; governance; restructuring, including the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, or ReBo; and stabilisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> Recognising the vital importance of the credit union sector, €500 million has been set aside to support credit unions in difficulties, to protect members' shares and to keep credit union services in communities. The Government has made available €250 million to the credit union fund for the voluntary restructuring of credit unions being facilitated by the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo. This board was established to work with the credit unions on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis. The Government has also provided €250 million to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund for resolution purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> The Credit Institutions Resolution Fund was established by section 10(1) of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (as amended) - the 2011 Act. Under section 10(2) of the 2011 Act, the resolution fund is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution. This definition includes a credit union. To date, the resources of the resolution fund have been utilised to fund the resolution of four credit unions. In the case of three of those credit unions, the resolution action taken was a directed transfer under the 2011 Act, and the resolution fund funded a financial incentive for the transferee. The remaining case was a liquidation, and no financial incentive was paid from the resolution fund in respect of that action.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">In each of the four cases, the Central Bank discharged its third party resolution related costs against the resolution fund. In each case, I am pleased to say that arrangements have been reached with neighbouring credit unions to maintain credit union services in the area. </p>
          <p eId="para_901"> The European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, BRRD, does not apply to credit unions. A decision was made to apply the directive only to credit institutions which were within the scope of CRD. This was done in order to ensure that excessive demands were not placed on small credit institutions, such as credit unions. If BRRD was to be applied to credit unions, there would be a considerable cost in the form of yearly contributions. There would also be considerable additional requirements regarding recovery and resolution planning which would take up a disproportionate amount of resources which, from the perspective of the proportionality principle, could not be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> Credit unions continue to be covered under our domestic resolution regime and this has operated successfully to fund the resolution of four credit unions. The contributions associated with this are less than would be charged under BRRD. </p>
          <p eId="para_903"> The credit union fund was established under section 57 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, and the Government contributed €250 million to it. Its purpose includes provision of financial support for restructuring of credit unions and to meet the expenses of ReBo in discharging its functions under the 2012 Act. To date, ReBo has drawn down €5.9 million from the credit union fund. Approximately 50% of ReBo's operating costs are recoverable in the form of a ReBo levy on the credit union sector. This levy came into effect in December 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 provides the statutory basis for the restructuring of credit unions and placed the Credit Union restructuring board, ReBo, on a statutory footing from 1 January 2013. ReBo is currently in the process of overseeing and facilitating restructuring on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis, and is working towards the timetable set out in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions, with a view to completing the process by the end of 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> The Government has made available €250 million to the credit union fund for the voluntary restructuring of credit unions. ReBo undertook a high level assessment of all credit unions based on financial data from the Central Bank and engagement with each credit union. To date, 48 credit unions have been assisted in ReBo approved mergers. A further 121 are currently being assisted in ongoing merger projects. Based on these figures, ReBo estimates that it will assist up to 169 credit unions in achieving a voluntary restructuring solution. This represents a significant number of credit unions, given that approximately 376 credit unions are currently in operation. ReBo is continuing to engage with credit unions to provide an opportunity for those credit unions to merge on a voluntary basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> The Commission on Credit Unions in its report recommended the introduction of a statutory stabilisation scheme funded by mandatory contributions from credit unions. In November 2014, I announced the introduction of the stabilisation scheme. The target level of funding for the stabilisation fund is €30 million to be built up over ten years, with the levy rate being reviewed after three years. To be eligible for consideration for such support, a credit union must have a regulatory reserve ratio equal to or greater than 7.5% and less than 10% of the credit union's total assets and must, in the opinion of the Central Bank, be viable as a credit union.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> Deputy Michael McGrath referred to the imposition of lending restrictions, which I will now deal with. It is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions, who is the independent regulator for credit unions. Within her independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in some credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that currently about 51% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions. Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> Almost all credit unions with lending restrictions in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction. For those credit unions with an individual loan size restriction, the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of these credit unions can continue to make loans of significantly more than the average value for gross loans outstanding for the sector of just above €6,000, with the majority of restrictions enabling credit unions to lend amounts of between €10,000 and €30,000. The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that only four credit unions have a maximum loan size restriction of less than €10,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> In February 2015, the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk-sensitive lending practices, may apply for a review of their lending restriction. A communication has been issued to all relevant credit unions outlining the process for the review of lending restrictions and requested them to indicate by 31 March 2015 whether they intend making an application for a review of their lending restrictions. The closing date for receipt of the applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative is 30 September 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> We had a situation where credit unions, like all lending institutions in the country, were under severe threat when we came into government four years ago. We have taken a range of initiatives and have provided funding to reconstruct the credit unions individually and as a movement. We appreciate that lending restrictions can irk certain credit unions and, in their view, inhibit them from doing business to the best of their ability. A review process is now in place, and any credit union that is unhappy with the lending restrictions may look for a review and must submit an application before 30 September 2015. I will ensure that Deputies receive information if they table questions to me in the next session of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> Separately, I have introduced a legislative change whereby, as of 1 August 2013, regulatory directions are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. Some Deputies made the point that the Registrar of Credit Unions was acting in an arbitrary fashion and there was no system of appeal or recourse. Such a system has been in place since the legislative changes introduced from 1 August 2013 and I will repeat regulatory that directions can be appealed to Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. I ask the wider credit union movement that where there is a communications problem to communicate such information to its members. </p>
          <p eId="para_913"> The Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, was established on 22 September 2014 for a period of three years to advise the Minister for Finance regarding the improvement of the management of credit unions, the protection of the interests of members and any other matters that the Minister may seek the advice of the committee on. The committee is chaired by Professor Donal McKillop, the former chairman of the Commission on Credit Unions. </p>
          <p eId="para_914"> The CUAC has met a number of credit union stakeholders, including the ILCU, CUDA, CUMA, NSF, Central Bank, ReBo and individual credit unions. It has carried out a survey of credit unions and over 100 responses have been received to date. I have been informed the responses will provide a profile of individual credit unions in terms of demographics and financial characteristics, and assist in exploring the competitive pressures they face and their views on potential challenges in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I look forward to receiving the findings of the survey in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> The Government has a clear policy to support the strategic growth and development of credit unions as set out in the report and recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions. The commission report was agreed and co-authored by key stakeholders, including credit union representatives. The safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are priorities for the Government. The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and in getting lending going in the economy. I am always open to considering new proposals on credit unions, particularly those that would see the development of the credit union business model and an increase in income for the sector. I have met with credit unions to examine the opportunities for collaboration with An Post. All proposals to date have been at an early stage and we await further details as the projects progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> I note the six-point policy programme from the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, which was presented to us recently. It includes a range of proposals to support credit unions going forward. I welcome ongoing engagement with the ILCU and other credit union representative bodies, including the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, the Credit Union Managers' Association, CUMA, and the National Supervisors' Forum, NSF.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> I recognise the importance of credit unions in the economy. Credit unions have almost 3 million members and nearly 400 offices nationally, employ 4,000 people and have almost 10,000 volunteers. Credit unions have gone through a period of considerable change since the commission report, and the movement has risen to the challenges it posed. The Government has worked closely with key stakeholders in the credit union movement to reach agreement on the report of the Commission on Credit Unions and its recommendations. The Government will continue its ongoing engagement with the movement to ensure the safety of members' savings, to support credit unions in broadening the range of services to members and to safeguard the credit union sector as a whole into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> I thank Deputy Michael McGrath and the Fianna Fáil Party for putting down this motion. There is not much difference in our objectives. I have no problem in taking advice from the Opposition if there are any lapses in our policy approach to ensure we can lend a hand and move forward. Historically, the credit union movement has provided great services in different communities across the country. I hope it can continue to thrive and prosper as well as extend its services as the economy grows.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liam Twomey<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_920">I have met with many representatives of the credit union movement in County Wexford. Like many Deputies, I admire the commitment of volunteers and workers in the credit unions. The support that members give to the credit unions is fantastic.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> Deputies are under no illusion about where we were just before we came into government, when we almost had a total financial collapse of our economy. Significant concerns were raised then about the credit unions. When one considers whom the credit unions represent, one has to be careful about how we deal with this. We did not want to create a crisis in the credit unions, as they are vital to our local economies. They serve an acute need in our local economies, whether it is small loans for small businesses or educational loans for people going to third level. They serve a defined purpose within our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> It has been remiss of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform not to have a more open discussion about credit unions and the role of the Registrar of Credit Unions in recent times. This should be corrected as soon as possible, even maybe as soon as September, with the committee hearing from the ILCU, the registrar and individual credit unions to go through some of the issues raised in this debate. Over the past several years, the committee has brought in representatives of the banks every six months. It might be time to focus particularly on credit unions and how they are managed and regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> As the Minister pointed out, not all of these issues are his responsibility. None of us wants to throw out the regulator or radically change the legislation governing the sector. However, we want to examine how credit unions operate in our communities. It is vital that we take the opportunity to examine this. From my recent meetings with credit unions, it is quite obvious that some of them are very well capitalised with significant assets available to them, and not just for the traditional lending that is associated with them. They have assets that could be pooled together and used on bigger projects. While the movement is keen on what it calls community and social lending, there are other sectors to which it can lend, such as the housing sector. However, we do not want to go back to a situation in which some credit unions ran into difficulties because they acted like banks for major developers. Large numbers of people have made regular savings with credit unions which have accumulated into significant assets that could be used for the betterment of society on a much greater scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The finance committee will have to deal with the smaller issues that have been raised tonight. While this Chamber can often be adversarial, we can trash it out better in the finance committee. Like Deputy Michael McGrath, I have concerns and would like to see them resolved.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekNolan" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_925">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Private Members’ motion, and I thank Fianna Fáil for bringing this important topic to the floor of the House tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> The credit unions are so familiar to people that they are almost like a member of the family. One goes to see the credit union as often as one goes to see one’s uncle. There is a warm personal relationship. Credit unions get to know who people are in the community and understand their trustworthiness and credit risk. When we talk about the credit union, we should be careful to differentiate it from the banks and other financial institutions. While credit unions deal in money, they are often the buffer when the banks will not lend and the other option is a moneylender or someone more grievous. The vital social role that credit unions play needs to be protected and enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> The credit union sector faced its greatest possible threat in recent years, with the possibility of some of them going under. The risk of reputational damage that could have affected the entire sector if one or two credit unions got into trouble was very stark. Over the past several years, financial security and certainty were a concern for people. Any hint of instability could have damaged the sector. It is a credit to the sector that it has managed to pull itself through difficult reforms and still have community support and its reputation intact while maintaining its exceptional services.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> After so much change and adjustment, we need to review how we can best support credit unions. In Galway, I am familiar with several credit unions, such as Naomh Padraig and St. Anthony's &amp; Claddagh. St. Columba’s credit union, based in the east of the city, offers an innovative model for where the credit union movement can go. Having established a subsidiary company called St. Columba’s Credit Union Limited, it has set up an enterprise centre which supports business incubation and mentoring, as well as funding voluntary organisations involved in social work and social care. This is all achieved through the resources and financial assets that come from its members’ savings. This represents a whole new model for credit unions with regard to what they can do with their members’ money. Credit unions do not seek profit but serve their communities, an ethos on which they were founded originally by their voluntary members and which keeps them so grounded in their communities today.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The pioneering work done by Liam Bluett and Michael Smith in the centre and its reputation in the community, and bringing this back to its own credit union and building up such a strong brand, is very powerful.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> I understand we have the credit union advisory committee, but just because we have a regulator and regulations in place it does not mean things are soft. All of these matters need to be kept under constant review to ensure we do not attempt to regulate credit unions into being banks and we do not turn them into places with no flexibility which are completely cold and guideline driven. We must also keep under review the ability of the State to produce an environment in which credit unions can go outside their traditional role and use their pioneering methods, but at the same time never forgetting their incredibly important role of being there when people are in trouble and need a few bob, such as when the car breaks down and there is no money to repair it or when there is an emergency for the kids. It is a lender of resort people can trust which has the flexibility and ability to meet this need in an environment based on the community and the ethos it serves.</p>

        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Social_Protection" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection (Deputy Kevin Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2015-06-23T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_931">I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling this motion because it is overdue. Deputy Liam Twomey suggested sending the issue back to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for a prolonged engagement. I was on the committee the last time the credit unions came before it and Deputy Michael McGrath and I played an active role during the engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> The credit union movement has always been at the heart of the community. My first car was financed through a credit union loan, as was my first election campaign in 1999. I do not know how one would do this now with SIPO. These examples show the credit union has always been ready to help in many different ways. I went through a period of illness and the manager of Sandymount Credit Union at the time was extremely helpful to my wife. I will never forget this assistance, which the credit union movement gives to members of the community who find themselves in difficulty. Credit unions are far more flexible than any financial institution, that is, the banks, we have ever dealt with in this State. As Deputy Nolan said, they know their customers' creditworthiness. They may be going through a particular period of financial difficulty but there is a level of flexibility. I will be a great friend to the credit union movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Sandymount, Pearse Street and Ringsend credit unions are at the heart of sustainable financial support for the people of the area. Children and young adults learn how to save through the credit union. On a Friday evening in my area one sees cars pulling up and families walking up to do their business in the credit union. This social network and interaction used to be found at the post office. The role of the credit unions in financing borrowings for cars, college or for the small businessman looking to get a small loan to get started is one of the key elements and major strengths of the credit union.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> I do not want to misrepresent Fianna Fáil's motion because I do not believe Fianna Fáil is advocating we go back to easy lending. Society and families have learned lessons in a very tough way about unsustainable borrowings. This was mainly through the banks and not credit unions. I accept Deputy Nolan's point there were one or two rogue credit unions, but they were very much in the minority and developed more into banks than credit unions instead of being at the heart of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> I listened to the Minister's contribution on the Registry of Credit Unions and its independence in regulating credit unions. Appealing decisions should be examined. This option is there and was outlined by the Minister. People on this side of the House are not by any means the font of all wisdom which is why Deputy Twomey's suggestion to go back to the committee and have a long discussion has strength. In the last campaign credit unions spoke about microcredit for low and middle income families. I hope we will be able to run a pilot of this scheme in the autumn. The credit union movement has provided assistance and suggestions in this regard as have the Citizens Information Board, Social Finance Foundation, MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The credit union could have a key role and be at the very forefront of microcredit. It is something for which it has campaigned. I hope in the autumn the Department of Social Protection, in partnership with the credit union movement, will be able to put in place microfinance for families who are extremely stressed and often forced to go to moneylenders rather than credit unions with a good reputation which are at the heart of many urban and rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to have this discussion by tabling the motion. The discussion needs to be taken much further and examined in detail by the committee. I look forward to the outcome, if the Deputy is willing to push it there. One group or party in the House is not the font of all wisdom so we need to examine what is the best model. The credit union movement is vital for the Irish economy and local communities. I certainly will be very supportive of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún seo ó Fhianna Fáil. Is eagraíochtaí den scoth iad na comhair chreidmheasa sa tír seo. Tá siad lonnaithe i mbeagnach gach baile agus sráidbhaile sna 32 contae. Is fíor-eagraíochtaí Éireannaigh iad. Is sampla iontach iad den phobal ag obair ar son an phobail agus iad ag tabhairt aird ar mhaitheas an phobail seachas brabús príobháideach. Tá cáineadh le feiscint sa rún seo agus tá sé tuillte ag an Rialtas. Tá cleachtadh leanúnach ag an Aire Airgeadais le fada anois maidir leis an rud seo. Tá sé ina phost le ceithre bliana anuas agus tá easpa ceannaireachta léirithe aige. Tá easpa teagmhálacha leis na heagraíochtaí seo. Feictear é seo arís agus arís eile, go háirithe maidir le IBRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> Níl na polasaithe atá ag an Rialtas soiléir ar chor ar bith. Níl polasaí sonrach ann maidir leis na comhair chreidmheasa. Níl uaillmhian ar bith ag an Rialtas seo ó thaobh a dtodhchaí. In ainneoin an teip uafásach a tharla in earnáil na mbanc, d'éirigh leis na comhair chreidmheasa teacht chun cinn gan an iomarca damáiste a dhéanamh dóibh féin nó dá gcustaiméirí, gan an iomarca fiach á chur ar an Stáit agus gan an iomarca costais á chur ar na híocóirí cáin sa tír seo. B'fhéidir gurb í an fhadhb ná gur coiméad na comhair chreidmheasa go léir a n-aghaidheanna glan agus, dá bharr sin, níl an Rialtas sásta aird ar bith a thabhairt dóibh. Tar éis tubaiste uafásach, tá na comhair chreidhmheasa thar timpeall na tíre seo fós ag tabhairt seirbhísí iontacha dá gcustaiméirí.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> The critique contained in the motion may seem harsh at first, but when one goes into the detail of the experience of credit unions in this country it is well warranted. The Minister has for the past four years become known as the hands-off Minister for Finance with regard to the impact he has made on the credit institutions in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">It is no different with the credit unions. He has a serious lack of ambition with regard to this sector in society. It is an excellent institution and an example of what volunteer communities can do for the good of communities around the country. As I have stated, it is a 32-county organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> Despite the failure of the banking system over the past number of years, credit unions have, through very difficult circumstances, still managed to provide a vital service to people. The Minister has indicated the number of engagements he has had with credit unions around the country. There is no doubt that the Government talks a good game when it comes to credit unions but actions speak louder than words, and it is time that the focus and priority is on these organisations. In our submission on the consultation regarding credit unions, we tried to impress upon the Government that it cannot simply treat credit unions like banks. The Government has argued that it understands this but its actions have not reflected that argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> I hope we are moving to an age of proper regulation of financial institutions. I fear from what I have seen that the Government is being dragged that way instead of leading in that direction. Last year I asked the Minister for Finance for his views on whether the cumulative effect of the lending restrictions on credit unions and the lack of clarity in the use of discretion by credit unions is leading to a negative impact on the credit union movement. The heart of this issue is the cumulative effect on all these lending institutions; these organisations are being disempowered from carrying out their potential function within Irish society. In response to my question, the Minister told me that section 35 limitations are not working. I asked him to allow a common sense approach to discretion afforded to credit unions when they seek to extend or restructure loans or offer further loans to those who can pay. Shockingly, the Minister told me at that stage that I should move along and there was nothing to see here, as everything was fine the way it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> The truth is there are swathes of this country where the talk of recovery is read about in newspapers, listened to on the radio or seen on television. These areas have very little economic activity and very few net new jobs are being added to particular economies. They are experiencing bank closures at the moment, with the flow of and access to credit being reduced in communities. The ability to deal in cash, as well as other activities associated with banks, is also being reduced. Footfall in towns is becoming smaller because the attractiveness of coming to those towns for a customer is lessening because the credit facilities no longer exist in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> These forms of no-man's land are starting to appear around the country, and I know of the likes of Delvin in my constituency, which lost its bank recently. People must now go 15 or 20 miles to the nearest banks. They must travel on bad roads on reducing public transport to get to those banks. They are told to use the Internet to access other banks but many of these places are devoid of basic broadband infrastructure, so people cannot use the Internet to gain access. In many of these areas, however, there are credit unions that are well-staff and energetically managed. They also have capital. In the credit crunch we have seen throughout Europe and especially in this country, the lack of capital has been at the heart of the problem. We have these institutions, many of them rich in capital, but they have not been utilised or leveraged by the Government, which is quite shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> Credit unions present a major opportunity but they are currently being restricted by the Government. Some people argue that they might be hamstrung because the Government is confused about its policy but many others believe the truth is worse, as the Government has an antipathy for the sector because of its historical close relationships to the banking elite in this country. If that is the case, active damage is being done to these communities. Credit unions could fulfil the needs of first-tier microfinance very easily, and, in fairness, the Government has organised Microfinance Ireland, with a location in Dublin. There is no reason these credit unions could not be utilised, in part, to support that. The Government needs to carve out - not in a confused fashion but in a clear way - a sustainable, responsible and dynamic role for these societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> The Government is on its last legs with respect to the length of time it has left in office, and as has been seen until very recently, it is struggling from crisis to crisis. I implore the Government not just to offer platitudes on the issue but to focus on the job at hand, using the credit unions as a catalyst for economic recovery right through provincial Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">The Private Members' motion before us this evening lays out the size and importance of the network of credit unions across the State. With just under 3 million members and 400 offices, it employs 4,000 people and counts 10,000 volunteers among its anchor number. It is instantly comparable to the Gaelic Athletic Association, a very important organisation that exists for the betterment of friends and neighbours, with a strong volunteer effort. Reference is made in Fianna Fáil's motion to the fact that only 1% of credit unions needed State funding since the beginning of the crash. It is most unfortunate that the banks were not prudent enough or controlled well enough to be as wise as credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> I am thankful that our local credit unions represent a more wholesome and helpful body. They are faced with challenges, however, and almost half of credit unions have lending restrictions and lending is decreasing, putting the long-term prospects of the sector at risk. The Irish League of Credit Unions indicates that the sector has approximately €5 billion to lend but that it is unable to do so due to restrictions. We must remember that credit unions are not-for-profit democratic co­operatives. They are governed by the Credit Union Act 1997 and the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012. The Registrar of Credit Unions, Ms Anne Marie McKiernan, registers and oversees the credit unions. Controls such as those that ensure funds of members are protected are certainly necessary but, seeing as credit unions have shown themselves to be mature and prudent when it comes to lending, I and my party feel that they must be freed to achieve more.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> The Registrar of Credit Unions invited those unions that had limits put on their lending to apply to have these removed but according to her, those unions had yet to adopt adequately robust financial practices. I am not<i>
						</i>suggesting that all control be removed but credit unions can and should be given more responsibility. Some credit unions are particularly limited, with five restricted to lending under €10,000 and a further 50 that cannot go above €20,000. This Private Members' motion highlights the 35% of credit unions that have had lending restrictions in place for five years or more. The motion indicates that other countries have improved national policy to set out the role and function of credit unions. I ask the Minister to outline whether he has conducted an examination of these approaches and what he now proposes to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> The credit unions are a good and viable alternative to the avarice and shameless greed of the institutions that brought this State to its knees.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The fact that not a single credit union has received approval for additional services since the banking crisis began is a disgrace. Despite proving their worth and robustness, they have been granted no increased role. Credit unions are also effectively restricted from engaging in mortgage lending due to section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997. This means that anyone who needs a mortgage will have to use a bank. Why does the Government decide to push our citizens only in that direction? Impím ar an Rialtas teacht ar réiteach agus comhair chreidmheasa a cheadú le tabhairt faoi bhreis dualgais. Tá siad tar éis a chruthú go bhfuil siad ann ar mhaithe an phobail. Is gá iad a spreagadh agus cabhrú leo iasachtaí a chur ar fáil don phobal.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> The Private Members' motion calls for a White Paper and a forum, investment in infrastructure, a revisiting of the limits on lending and the provision of additional services. These measures must be examined and introduced in a prudent way to allow credit unions to reach their full potential. Credit unions are a positive force for customers and communities across the State. I record again, as I have done on many occasions throughout my years in this House, that I am hugely supportive of credit unions and believe that they now have, as they have had in recent years, a crucial role in supporting the well-being of people and families as they struggle to emerge from this financial crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Private Members' Business tonight and pay tribute to Fianna Fáil for organising a discussion on a very important issue in respect of the future of our credit unions across the country. It was very interesting to listen to the contributions of Members and of the Minister of State regarding the importance of the credit union movement to everybody across society. There is so much goodwill among Members of the House towards the credit union movement that one wonders why there is no positive engagement or positive policy regarding the growth and development of credit unions. The only answer one can come up with is that the banks call the shots and are driving policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The policy of this Government has been to push big finance over the options the credit unions can provide. This policy pushes the for-profit sector and the banking sector and looks after them. I have no doubt that for many years the banks would have loved to see the end of credit unions, or to see credit unions being forced to become like banks, so that the banks would be in a position to take them over and subsume them into their business model, which would be a disaster. Credit unions have been a lifeline for many communities across the country. Hundreds of thousands of people have depended on them for finance, and the banks pale into significance compared to the trust people have in the credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> We need - although it is belated and probably will not happen in the lifetime of this Government - a positive policy towards credit unions. We need to examine the restrictions in section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to ensure that credit unions can develop and we need to look at how credit unions can provide services for people across the country. There are so many people across the country who are unbanked and who are penalised financially because of that. The credit unions can provide that role. The idea of credit unions and post offices working together has been raised here before. These two institutions are vital across our society and are very trusted. They could come together to provide financial services for citizens that are solely for the benefit of citizens and not the benefit of private equity investors. That is why we have not seen any positive engagement or any move to develop credit unions and allow them to invest in our communities: they are for the benefit of our citizens and, unfortunately, the thrust of Government policy is to benefit the banking sector and forget about the citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">The principal focus for all credit unions is on providing services to their members in their own communities. The onerous burden being imposed on credit unions by the current fitness and probity regime is driving many otherwise relatively strong credit unions into unnecessary mergers, without any consideration, in many instances, for the maintenance of local services into the future. If a credit union becomes part of a bigger organisation, it ceases to be part of the community, and it will be only a matter of time before the local credit union office closes and the services it provided will be lost forever to that community. Currently, there is a drive away from local personal service provision in many sectors of the economy, and the impetus to rationalise credit unions is yet another example of this. If the same energy and resources that are currently being expended by both the regulator and the individual credit unions on the implementation of the fitness and probity regime were diverted into developing and expanding services and assisting credit unions in growing and developing organically, the credit union system would be in a far healthier state.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> Over recent years, credit unions have experienced declines in their loan books, and while this could be attributed to a lack of credit demand generally, it is clear that the economy is slowly improving, which in turn is leading to a growth in loan demand. Many credit unions are not in a position to respond to this increase in demand as a consequence of the imposition of restrictions. It is imperative, therefore, that the Central Bank review its policy relating to these restrictions so as to give credit unions the necessary additional flexibility to deal favourably with new loan applications. Stringent regulation in recent years has meant that credit unions are now extremely reluctant to lend to disadvantaged members who have no other source of credit apart from moneylenders. It is extremely regrettable and, indeed, shameful that the moneylenders' loan books have expanded enormously while the loan books of credit unions have been diminishing at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> The regulator has acknowledged that credit unions are extremely well reserved. However, the issue of credit union viability remains the focus of attention. Write-downs in the value of premises have been used as a mechanism to weaken the reserve position of many credit unions so as to force a merger or a resolution upon them. The not-for-profit ethos of the credit union has been forgotten. </p>
          <p eId="para_959"> The proposal to impose a ceiling on the level of savings a member may hold will have enormous reputational implications for credit unions. Members will be forced to withdraw their savings and place them in rival institutions. Credit unions will also be put at a disadvantage in trying to attract new deposits.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> The regulator is currently advertising information on interest rates and terms of loans. However, there is very little oversight in evidence when it comes to more general advertising, particularly in respect of car purchase agreements. In a recent survey, it was found that many people who had availed of these arrangements were not aware of the interest rate or the amount financed under these agreements.</p>
