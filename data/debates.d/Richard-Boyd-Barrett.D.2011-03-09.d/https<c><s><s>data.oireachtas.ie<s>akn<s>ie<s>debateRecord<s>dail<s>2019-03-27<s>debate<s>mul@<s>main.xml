We understand from those comments that a recommendation will be brought to Cabinet before Easter.

Can the Minister confirm this, and perhaps enlighten us as to what is the overall thinking of the Government and the Taoiseach in this regard?</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> First I will put the Deputies in the picture. They are well aware of the position of the national broadband plan. Since its inception it has driven very significant private sector investment, as it was intended to do. When we entered Government in 2016, 50% of premises had access to high-speed broadband. Over the past five years commercial development has led to investment of €2.75 billion in upgrading, expanding and modernising the networks. We are now in a position where 74% of premises have high-speed broadband. Despite that substantial progress, more than 1 million people and 100,000 enterprises, mostly in rural areas, are unlikely to receive this vital service from the private sector. These are mostly located in the more remote, dispersed and harder to reach areas in rural Ireland, which encompass 96% of our landmass. The challenges involved in providing a high-speed broadband network in Ireland are significant due to the dispersed nature of the rural population.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> As for the present plan, I note we have received a final bid from the tenderer. That is undergoing due diligence in my own Department with the involvement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I intend to bring a recommendation, as the Deputy said, to Cabinet before Easter. What happens after that will obviously depend on the Government's decision, but if a decision is being made one way or the other, we will obviously consult with the Opposition and the House at large. How that will be done will be decided as part of the decision.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">While I accept the Minister's response, the second part of it is somewhat problematic because of the information available to the Oireachtas. We have had no role in this tender process to date, notwithstanding my best efforts and those of many others to elicit information along the way. We understand that the bidders' initial requirement was a clear position that the State would invest €500 million. SIRO and Eir cited their failure to develop a business case on that basis and as such did not proceed with a tender. We now understand from utterances of the Taoiseach that the cost will run to many multiples of that, possibly as high as €3 billion. That raises serious questions about how the Government can proceed with a project with an entity that went ahead and bid €3 billion when others were told that moneys like that were not available and pulled out of the race. There are issues around competency and whether this is the appropriate way to proceed. There are also issues regarding the role of Eir in providing broadband to another 80,000 premises, and perhaps that of Imagine, which has announced plans to cover 400,000 premises. The Minister expects the Dáil to make determinations on a lot of questions but we have been provided with no information along the way.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">It is somewhat disingenuous of the Taoiseach to suggest he will let the Dáil be the final arbiter on a tender process into which we have had no input whatsoever.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">The Taoiseach has been clear that the Government fully accepts responsibility for making a decision, but he has also signalled that a decision of this nature would bind future Governments. There would obviously be a significant period between the appointment of a preferred bidder and the signing of contracts and the Taoiseach has indicated that he would provide the opportunity for the Oireachtas to be consulted on it. I intend, depending on what decision is taken, to make full and extensive information available to Deputies for them to evaluate. As the Deputy knows, we have had debates here during which I have been at pains to point out that the issues being raised by Deputies such as the robustness of the technology, the adequacy of the governance arrangements, the way in which this issue is being scrutinised in view of the fact that there was only one tender left standing have been the subject of immense due diligence and detailed work by the Department. When I am in a position to bring forward a recommendation, one way or the other, it will be after the completion of the work the Oireachtas is very keen should be done. We intend to make information available to the House at that point, but I recognise that it is my responsibility to bring a recommendation to the Government having completed the scrutiny. I am very aware of the concerns the Deputies have raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">My question relates to the completion of the tender process and the options if the State decides not to go ahead with the current tender process. In 2012 Sinn Féin brought forward a proposal that we use the State and semi-State infrastructure already in place, in particular the ESB and metropolitan area network, MAN, systems. A strange thing happened over the weekend. The Taoiseach and leader of the Minister's party said on Sunday that we could not use the ESB pole infrastructure for this purpose. In fact, he said we could not use poles at all, that it all had to be underground, even in rural areas. If that is the case, the ducting will have to be run underground as far the Black Valley in County Kerry, but it is not the case. I do not know who is briefing the Taoiseach. Is he not aware that Eir is already using poles? Is he not aware that the ESB is already using poles to hang SIRO broadband fibre cables? Let us try to put that notion to bed. It raised significant concerns for me when I heard the Taoiseach talking about it at the weekend. There are question marks over whether the Government and the Taoiseach fully understand the entire process. There have been four Ministers involved in this process and it looks farcical from the outside. We have one bidder and costs that have gone from €500 million to €3 billion. The Government has no bargaining power. Does the Minister honestly believe this is still a competitive tender process? Is the real story not that the whole project is in serious trouble?</p>

            <p eId="para_20">The project was opened for a competitive dialogue at the end of 2015. Contrary to what the Deputy said, there was not a financial framework imposed by the State.

The process had been very competitive until the point at which it was decided that the remaining competitors would withdraw. At that point, an additional approach of scrutiny was put in place by the Government to ensure that, even though there were no longer separate bids, the issue of value for money could be properly evaluated. It has been put in place and outside consultants have looked at a range of costs and tested the various assumptions, projections and submissions made by the tenderer. When I come to make a recommendation, albeit there is only one tender standing, it will be on the basis of a tender which has been scrutinised, with all proper due diligence. It has been a robust process. As the Deputy has indicated, the issue is that this is not cheap. We will have to make a decision on whether we want to go ahead with it.</p>

Most big infrastructural projects have the capacity to be a burden on the State which runs beyond one or two Administrations and it is not always necessarily the case that the Government comes back to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">The Minister said it had started out as a competitive process. I was here for all of that time and followed it day by day. That is correct. However, it is not now a competitive process and it does not matter what scrutiny process the Minister's Department puts in place, or what consultant comes in to undertake it. The Government is still at the mercy of that one bidder. That fact seems to be completely lost on it. It will be tied to this one, privatised model and one particular company. The cost has escalated many times over, if the Taoiseach is telling the truth. Britain has found that over one third of its public private partnerships are renegotiated within a five-year period. Will there be a further escalation of cost in the course of the contract if there are renegotiations? </p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The Minister has referred to the number of places, houses and businesses now connected as opposed to the number three years ago. That is in spite of, not because of, the broadband plan. The Department and the broadband plan had nothing to do with it. Eir cherry-picked the households which were easiest to reach throughout the county.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">Deputy Stanley is simply wrong. The previous Government decided that 750,000 premises would be included in the intervention area but Eir decided that it did not want to let it go. Therefore, it committed to making an investment that would deliver a service to 300,000 homes. That was its right under the state aid procedure.</p>

            <p eId="para_30"> To answer Deputy Dooley's question, the period between a preferred bidder being identified and the finalisation of the contract will be several weeks. This is a 25-year contract to build and operate a broadband network. There will always be one operation doing it and part of the contract is to look at a number of costs that will have to be incurred over a 25-year period and the take-up during that 25-year period which will have an impact on the revenue received by the operator. This will always involve the due diligence and scrutiny we have undertaken because an individual company will have to be selected to deliver the process and effective governance will be needed having undertaken due diligence ahead of the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">On 27 September 2016 the Law Reform Commission published its report on harmful communications and digital safety. The report noted that the revolution in telecoms and digital media had some negative aspects. Examples include the intentional victim shaming of individuals, sometimes referred to as "revenge porn". Other negative developments include intimidating and threatening online messages directed at private persons and public figures. To combat this, the Law Reform Commission proposed the creation of an online regulator. Until recently this recommendation had been opposed by the Government. There has been a welcome, though long overdue, change in that position. When does the Minister propose to bring a Bill to this House to establish such a commission?</p>

            <p eId="para_33">On 4 March, I announced my intention to bring forward a new online safety Bill, which will set out how we can ensure children are safe online. There is broad consensus within the House that this is necessary. Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Independents have indicated that they are keen for such a Bill to be progressed. The online safety Bill I am proposing would place new requirements on operators to operate an online safety code that would set out the steps they take to keep their users safe online and to include within that code a number of issues such as, at a minimum, a prohibition on harmful content, addressing serious cyberbullying and providing a complaints procedure whereby people can request material be taken down, with timelines for addressing complaints.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> A regulator in the form of an online safety commissioner with appropriate powers would oversee the new system. The online safety commissioner would have a number of powers, which may include certifying that each online safety code is fit for purpose or requiring changes to it; requiring regular reports from the industry; reviewing the measures which a service has in place, including its content moderation systems; and requiring the removal from an online platform of content deemed harmful.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The new law will seek to protect Irish residents using online platforms based in Ireland with appropriate provisions and to implement EU law in regard to video-sharing platform services, on-demand audiovisual media services and traditional television on an EU-wide basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Although it is impossible to remove every danger from the Internet or from the adaptation of new technology, we need to ensure that parents and children are better equipped, that online platforms take responsibility and that the State can provide regulation and enforcement. I am determined to make progress as quickly as possible and look forward to working with Deputies across the House in that regard. A consultation is currently under way and will close on 15 April. I urge all interested stakeholders to provide their views in order that they can be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach indicated that he would like to see the Bill enacted by the end of this year and that is the schedule to which I will be working.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">I welcome that indicative timeline because the concept and issues surrounding a digital safety commissioner have been well ventilated through various Private Members' Bills and motions in this House. There is a high level of understanding within the Oireachtas of the issues at play and the hurdles to implementing such a measure. Fianna Fáil is committed to completing the process of the introduction of such a commissioner as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> It is important to move away from the self-regulation regime, which has fallen well below expectations. It is obvious that it has not been successful in protecting the vulnerable in the sector. As I made clear in a Bill worked on by Fianna Fáil, it is vital that the regulation has the appropriate teeth and that that is apparent. In that context, I know the Minister previously referred to considering the imposition of fines on companies for any breach of the law. I ask him to set out what he has in mind at this early stage in terms of penalties and deterrents for organisations that fail to meet their requirements under the proposed law.</p>

            <p eId="para_40">I accept the points made by the Deputy in terms of the need for an effective regulator and that the time for self-regulation in this area has passed. Obviously, regulated companies are subject to criminal law. Where they breach criminal law, that is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda. However, the type of offences envisaged under the proposed Bill would involve a company failing to act in accordance with directives from the online safety commissioner. The approach normally taken in law and which I expect will be reflected in the Bill is that there would be an issuing of a notice in the first instance and that a failure to comply with the notice would lead to an offence. We have not yet decided what the precise fines will be, but they will be regulated in accordance with the seriousness of the offence. This is an issue on which consultation is now under way. If the Deputy wishes to put forward ideas regarding the penalty regime, we would be happy to receive them.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">Fianna Fáil certainly will do so because, as the Minister is aware, the technology platforms in respect of which most of the concerns arise have turnovers of billions rather than millions of euro. We have recognised that some harmful content is used by certain digital platforms to attract eyeballs, whether for gratification or in disgust. Regardless of the reason for viewing such content, it retains people on the platforms and provides a mechanism to sell advertising and capture the dollars attached thereto. Whatever code is put in place and whatever laws flow from it to run alongside the digital safety commissioner, it is imperative that the deterrents are commensurate with the size and profits of these companies rather solely being linked to the offence as described because we have seen the capacity of these companies to fail to even meet their own standards. They recognise the value of keeping people online. Fianna Fáil will be happy to contribute to the development of appropriate sanctions in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">It is very important that we have effective penalties. In addition, the industry must recognise that as well as being a legal obligation, it is at the heart of its business to ensure that its users are safe online. Interestingly, in Australia, which is far ahead of Ireland in this area, there are strong penalties but it has not been necessary to use them. It is interesting that there is a growing consensus even within the industry that it needs regulation and that, from its own point of view, the period of self regulation has not been good enough. It is to be hoped that we will get very considerable co-operation from the industry. Notwithstanding that, I agree with the Deputy that where there are abuses, the penalties must be meaningful from the point of view of these very large companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">I refer to the retail and mail delivery services of An Post. A significant amount of work was done to reform An Post. This House passed legislation in that regard and there was cross-party support for ensuring that the company was put in a more secure position. However, there is still uncertainty in regard to the survival of the post office network and, in particular, the mail distribution network and mail centres.

            <p eId="para_45">An Post is a commercial State company with a mandate to deliver a postal delivery service and a viable post office network. It is also designated as the sole universal service provider under the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 which requires it to, among other matters, fulfil the universal service obligation of a five-day-per-week delivery service.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Operational matters and the role of developing and implementing commercial strategies for An Post mails and retail businesses are matters for its board and management. An Post has developed a strategic plan which includes measures such as investing €50 million in growing and modernising the post office network; splitting the company into two distinct business units, namely, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail; relaunching its parcel business following a breakthrough labour agreement; and diversifying and growing its financial service products. It has recently reported strong growth in its parcel business and a much improved financial performance. It is continuing to make good progress in implementing its strategic plan which will see a range of developments across the mails and retail businesses. A refreshed and modernised An Post brand has been launched in recent weeks, alongside a new financial services proposition, An Post Money, and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce. </p>
            <p eId="para_47"> A €30 million loan was provided by the Government to An Post to support the required transformation programme. This helped ensure the continued delivery of the universal service obligation to deliver post to every address every working day - which is a European Union requirement - and to support a nationwide post office network. </p>
            <p eId="para_48">The Deputy raised the issue of the sorting business. In 2017, as part of a Labour Court recommendation the payment of a pay increase was conditional on necessary cost savings being achieved. One of the requirements was the closure of one of the four An Post mail centres. No decision has been made by the company on which centre shall close.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">Although it is a matter for the board and management of An Post, it is also a matter for the shareholder, on behalf of the public, which owns it. The Minister is the representative of the shareholders in this matter. There has been reform in this area. The McKinsey report has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The results of the report were that one mail centre would close. Has the Minister of State discussed this with management of An Post? Has he given any direction to An Post in that regard? What is the Government's preference? What will happen to mail centres such as the one in Portlaoise where 200 people are employed full time and there are hundreds more temporary staff? An additional new facility has been built beside the mail centre and taken over by An Post. It is also available for local distribution. In about two or three months the front door will be on the N80 because of the completion of the orbital route around Portlaoise. It is only 1 km from the N7 and N8 junction and only a couple of hundred metres from a rail connection on the main Dublin-Limerick-Cork railway line. Therefore, it is in a very strategic position. Workers in the company and that centre need certainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">In September 2017 the Labour Court issued a recommendation on a 2% pay increase from July 2017 in An Post. The payment was conditional on the achievement of necessary cost savings. As I said, one of the requirements was the closure of a mail centre. There are four mail centres. There is one each in Athlone, Cork, Dublin and Portlaoise. No decision has been made on which centre will close. Consideration in that regard is ongoing. I re-emphasise that the final decision will be made by the board and management of the company. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, had general discussions with An Post but no specific discussions on what it should do and no direction will be issued to the company. This is an operational issue. Any job losses will continue to be managed in accordance with the industrial relations framework within An Post.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I am aware of the 2% pay increase and on what it was conditional, but there is a new situation in that the parcel business has grown hugely and An Post is short of warehouse space because of it. The growth has given a new lease of life to the four mail centres in terms of the utilisation of space and the demand for facilities. We should not, therefore, be taking an axe to the centre when there is a viable business. I am informed that the parcel business increased by nearly 40% last year. The centre's closure would have huge economic consequences for the whole community and the midlands. County Laois has not exactly been top of the list when it comes to IDA Ireland investments, although there have been a couple of very recent welcome announcements. We have had the Kerr and McKinsey reports. There is a long way to go to reach the strategic position where the centre will be located in all transport hubs, including rail and road and everything else to which I have pointed. There are a couple of hundred workers who have mortgages and families and are trying to get their children through the education system. In many cases, the sole income earner in the family is the worker in the mail centre. It is time to remove the uncertainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">I re-emphasise that this is an operational issue. What the Deputy has said about the increase in the parcel business is good news. With our strategic plan, An Post has turned itself into a company that is moving forward and developing new business. It has been and will be strategic in its approach and the decisions it will make on the mail centre. It will do so in its best interests to ensure it will remain viable and also in the best interests of the workers within it to ensure the business can develop and that any decision it makes will help it to develop. It is good news that An Post is looking for new business and creating new models. It is very good news for rural Ireland. However, any decision An Post makes will be in its interests and those of the workers and the general public.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">In 2018 the European Commission produced a long-term strategy which set out a pathway for the European Union to reach climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest and to align its response with the Paris Agreement. It is now necessary for the European Union to increase its current pledge, principally its 2030 target, taking into account the Commission's strategy and the latest worrying projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC. Just last week we saw the terrible effects of the climate crisis in Mozambique. The Government should ensure Ireland's support for increasing the European Union's ambition. Will the Minister to provide an update on the State's position at the recent Environment Council, as well as at last week's European Council, at which this issue has been discussed in recent weeks?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_56">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Following a mandate provided by the European Council in March 2018, the European Commission published a communication, A Clean Planet for All, in November 2018, which will provide essential analytical underpinning for the preparation by the European Union of a long-term strategy for submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, by 2020. I welcomed the Commission's publication when it was presented to the Environment Council. It sets out a range of scenarios through which the European Union can lead the way to climate neutrality by investing in realistic technological solutions, developing the circular economy and promoting sustainable lifestyles. The Commission's communication has since been examined at expert level and in a number of Council formations, including the Environment and Energy Councils, at which I represent Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The communication presents a clear vision, supported by a detailed analysis, of how the European Union could work towards climate neutrality by mid-century in line with the Paris Agreement objectives, while at the same time contributing to positive economic transformation of the European economy. In the context of the Energy Council on 4 March, Ireland and a number of other member states have also invited the Commission to work towards developing a scenario of 100% renewable energy by 2050. At its meeting on 21 and 22 March 2019 the European Council requested the Council to continue its examination of the proposals ahead of further discussions later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> Ireland fully supports the first commitment made by the European Union under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. With the ambitious 2030 targets agreed to at EU level recently for renewable energy and energy efficiency, coupled with a strong ambition in respect of emissions standards for both light and heavy duty vehicles, the European Union may exceed its agreed targets for 2030. There is currently no formal proposal from the European Commission for the European Union to increase its targets for this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> In order to meet Ireland's target for 2030 that we reduce emissions in the non-emissions trading scheme, non-ETS, sector by 30% and building on the framework set out in the mitigation plan and the national development plan, I am developing an all-of-government climate plan which will set out the actions to achieve it.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">I thank the Minister for his response, but it was recently reported that at the European Council meeting a group of progressive, mainly western, EU member states had backed the Eurpean Commission's strategy for climate neutrality by linking it specifically with the Paris Agreement objective of keeping the increase in global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, other member states refused to specifically link EU climate action with the 1.5 degrees Celsius objective and rejected a reference to 2050 in reaching the climate neutrality goal. Will the Minister confirm that Ireland supported the progressive member states in linking increased EU ambition to 2050 with the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degrees Celsius objective?</p>

            <p eId="para_61">Yes, Ireland supports the ambition of the European Commission. At this point it is working on the various scenarios that could be set out to achieve it. As mentioned in the Deputy's question, there has been talk of a higher target for 2030, but no such proposal has been brought forward at this point. The proposals for the 2021-30 period were only agreed to comparatively recently and, from an Irish perspective, we have a lot of work to do to deliver them. There is no doubt that the longer term need is to aim for climate neutrality by 2050, but it will be on a whole-of-EU basis. We need to have an evaluation of the technologies and the roadmap that will bring us there. That is the work the Commission is undertaking.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">I draw the Minister's attention to the European Parliament's position that in order to reach the European Commission's proposal of climate neutrality by 2050 in a cost-effective manner, the European Union will need to increase its 2030 climate target to at least 55% compared with 1990 levels. Whereas the European Parliament took this position, we learned just before the school strike on climate change last week that all Fine Gael MEPs had voted against the relevant wording.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">Will the Minister confirm that the Government will end this contradictory and regressive approach to EU climate action and support the concept of greater EU ambition for 2030 at the June Council meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I am not going to comment on any decision of Fine Gael Members or any other Members of the European Parliament but let it be said that no proposal has been put forward by the European Commission to change the relatively recently agreed target of 40%. From everyone's perspective, an increase in ambition of the level indicated would require quite significant changes to be made. What the European Commission is doing is exploring how we could achieve climate neutrality by 2050. It has not indicated that it intends to change the relatively recently agreed targets towards which national governments are working. Decisions on this will have to be taken when the roadmap is properly evaluated. As the Deputy will know, it took a number of years to negotiate the various member states' obligations within the previous roadmap in respect of the 40%. It is widely believed that Europe can build on its 2030 targets and still deliver a roadmap for climate neutrality by 2050.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">As I was indicating to Deputy Dooley, I am currently preparing an all-of-government climate plan that will set out the actions that must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. I am working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport, heat and agriculture, in addition to a range of other sectors. The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility. The plan will build on the policy framework, measures and actions set out in both the national mitigation plan and the national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> Section 4 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 requires me to make a national mitigation plan and submit it to the Government for approval at least once every five years. Under section 3 of the Act, when considering approving a national mitigation plan, the Government must endeavour to achieve the 2050 national transition objective through the implementation of cost-effective measures that have regard to a range of factors, including Government policy on climate change. The national mitigation plan remains in place as a statutory plan required under the 2015 Act, and I propose to update this plan in due course in line with the schedule required by that Act. I also intend that the statutory requirements, in relation to reporting on the implementation of national climate policy to the Oireachtas through the annual transition statement, will include reporting on the implementation of the all-of-government climate plan. </p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Under European legislation, Ireland was obliged to submit a draft national energy and climate plan before the end of 2018 and a finalised one at the end of this year. The all-of-government plan will provide the basis for amending the draft plan to have a finalised one by the end of this year. There are two legal frameworks we have to work within.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">We have a bit of a problem in that we can judge future performance only on the basis of what we have done in the past. What we have done in the past has really been non-existent. How can we be sure something will happen? The Secretary General of the United Nations recently said to governments that now is the time for climate action, not speeches. This is vital.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> Our own body that measures our climate performance, the Environmental Protection Agency, shows we have been completely off course in meeting our targets for 2030. Therefore, how can we be sure the Government will be willing to meet future targets and that every Government will be willing to meet them, regardless of who is Minister? It is vital to ensure they are met.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">The Deputy will know that, under the legal framework within which we operate, there are penalties for failing to achieve the targets. The penalties would be paid according to the carbon price of the day. Therefore, if we failed to deliver on the targets, we would be millions of tonnes off and the Exchequer would have to pay. That creates very significant pressure to change.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Significant change will be required. For example, we in the Oireachtas will have to agree a trajectory for carbon prices, which will be a significant element. We will have to agree to have more renewables on our grid, which will require significant investment in change. We will have to have a roadmap for rolling out electric vehicles, improving the fabric of our homes and improving the heating systems. The Government will be able to provide some support but it will require all citizens to become involved. This is not something that can be resolved from Adelaide Road; it will require action in every community in every country, adapting their lifestyles to the new climate obligations. The plan being produced will provide a framework but it will be a framework within which we work with the wider community.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">It does require government. That is the key. The Government can lead by example. If it is committed to making these things happen, the citizens will follow suit. Unfortunately, what is happening in this country is that the citizens are expected to do everything on the basis that the Government will tag along afterwards. That is the problem. We have not met any of our targets because there has been no commitment at Government and national levels. That is where the Government will come in. It has to lead by example.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I take what the Minister is saying about carbon pricing and the potential fines but I wonder what decision will be made at political level on whether we can live with fines if we do not take action. Will this be a factor in the decision-making?</p>

            <p eId="para_78">I absolutely agree that the Government needs to lead by example. We are going to do that. For example, we have already banned single-use plastics, we are requiring every public body to have a resource and waste plan in place, and we are requiring every public body to adopt green procurement. That will be a significant element in helping people. We also have grants. As the Deputy knows, there is a grant of 30% for improving the fabric of one's house or its heating system, €10,000 towards an electric vehicle, and 100% support for low-income families in moving towards more sustainable heating systems. There are 256 sustainable energy communities and they are getting very significant support to make sure they travel this journey. It will require communities working with the Government to achieve the objectives. It is really important that we recognise this is a national challenge that is not all about saying we should wait until the Government has done X or Y; this is something we need to act on now. We cannot say we will have nothing until there is public transport to some very high standard that is deemed necessary. We need to act now on all these fronts and act with the support of the wider community.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">I reject the suggestion that the Government has been lethargic in this area. We have a national cybersecurity strategy in place and we are currently reviewing it. It is out for public consultation at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">If the Deputy has particular proposals, there is an opportunity to improve our cybersecurity plan. The EU directive to which the Deputy refers was transposed into Irish law on 18 September 2018 by SI 360/2018. Under Regulations 17 and 18 of that statutory instrument, operators of essential services in key areas of critical national infrastructure in energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply and distribution and digital infrastructure are required to meet specific security requirements and incident reporting requirements relating to their network and information systems. My Department has drawn up draft guidelines for operators of essential services that are designed to assist operators to meet these security and incident reporting requirements, manage the risks posed to the security of the network and information systems used in their operations and minimise the impact of incidents affecting those systems. As the operators of essential services for which my Department has responsibility are spread over five separate sectors, the changes that need to be made will be dependent on the existing level of preparedness of each individual operator. The proposed guidelines were published for public consultation on 11 January in accordance with Regulation 25.2 of that statutory instrument, which requires that persons be afforded an opportunity to submit written representations relating to the draft guidelines within 30 working days from publication. The deadline for submissions was 27 February. The representations that have been received as part of this process are under consideration. The changes to be made to the guidelines are minimal and relate primarily to some of the controls to be used and to indicative incident reporting levels. The final version of the guidelines will be published and will come into operation in the second quarter of this year.</p>

People are very sensitive regarding any major faults in the electricity sector, for example, the Boeing crashes and various other events that have happened such as what is happening with electricity supply in Venezuela and the powerful and central role IT systems play in the delivery of essential services, particularly health. Can the Minister tell me when he will designate operators of essential services? Who are they? Will there be different sectoral requirements in energy, health and finance compared to other areas? The computer security incident response team, CSIRT, is in the Minister's Department. Why has he designated his Department and himself as the regulators of this vast area that is so central to our lives? Is it intended to introduce legislation in the House so that we get an opportunity to discuss all aspects of cybersecurity and to decide whether or not we need a fully independent regulator? There are so many elements to this, for example, the Internet of things and block chain technology in finance. Many people are very interested in technology and wonder if we are being incredibly lethargic in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">The Deputy likes to dish out complaints but I am not so sure he is aware that a consultation is underway to which he could submit his view if he believes there should be an independent regulator and that it should not be done by having it within the Department, as it has been done in the past. He can submit that view. Clearly, this consultation is open to evaluating whether the structures in place are adequate. I agree with the Deputy that this is an area where there are growing threats. The measure about which we are talking today is not showing delay. We are designating all of the areas I pointed out such as transport, energy, banking, financial market infrastructures, health and drinking water. They will be required to identify means of protecting their infrastructures. That means they must look at human issues, access control policies, technological responses, electronic measures to protect their infrastructure, firewalls and encryption. All of those issues must be addressed. They must also have adequate measures to detect anomalies or events on a system, including how monitoring is to be conducted, the processes in place and whether they are fit for purpose. This is putting in place the protections we need in the banking system, the electricity system and so on. If the Deputy has ideas about the future direction of cybersecurity policy, now is the time to submit them.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">In his original reply, the Minister said the changes that would be needed would be minimal. How does he know that? How does he know that we could not face a significant emergency in the delivery of electricity all across the economy? To some extent, he is prejudging it. He mentioned finance. I know the Department of Finance has produced a paper on block chain technology but what is the approach of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as the Department responsible for cybersecurity? What kind of audits are our organisation and his Department looking at down through the years? Is he concerned about the behaviour of the huge digital companies, the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Instagram, given that there have been more and more complaints about the misuse of personal data? Does he have any views on whether or not Ireland should be more digitally independent? He may have heard me talk about that previously. It is an issue that has been raised by our constituents. We are independent but we are not remotely independent digitally. I notice that the cybersecurity centre is based in Cork Institute of Technology. Is that something the Minister wants to build upon?</p>

            <p eId="para_86">The Deputy misquoted me. I spoke in respect of the statutory instrument following the consultation. The Dáil has passed a statutory instrument. Consultation is required within it. The feedback from those who will be regulated does not require substantial change in what is proposed. That is the only aspect where I said change would be minimal. In terms of the development of a broad-based cybersecurity policy, I recognise that this is a very fast-changing area and that is why consultation is underway to look at whether our structures and systems are adequate and to anticipate the sort of changes that will be needed. Significant progress has been made within my Department in setting up a system for identifying weaknesses, reporting incidences and strengthening cybersecurity that is very well-connected internationally and well-regarded. This is not an area where we can ever be complacent, as the Deputy noted. We spoke earlier about the need for an online safety commissioner, which I hope to legislate for before the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">An application from CNOOC Petroleum Europe Limited, which was previously known as Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd., to drill in the Porcupine Basin was submitted on 14 November 2018. The application was posted on the Department's website for public consultation and no decision has been made. Exxon Mobil has a 50% non-operating interest in the licence. An application is considered against a range of technical, environmental and financial requirements. In addition, the operator must obtain a safety permit from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and approval by the Irish Coast Guard for the company's oil spill contingency plan and the well emergency response plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">On the question of whether this complies with our objective of becoming a world leader in getting rid of fossil fuels, I repeat what I said last night.

We have to make sure we have security of energy supplies in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">I am not sure whether the Minister of State is aware that ExxonMobil faces losing its lobbying privileges in the European Parliament because it failed to show up for a hearing into climate change denial. I think I mentioned this last night, although the Minister of State did not comment on it. ExxonMobil has snubbed the European Parliament as certain MEPs have been attempting to drive forward an understanding on climate change. This large oil giant supports carbon taxes, but at the same time it is renowned for its ability to engage in climate denial. It denies the science. Even though it knows the damage that exploration is causing, it has funded campaigns to block action on climate and is refusing to face up to its environmental crimes. I suggest that because ExxonMobil has a partnership or relationship with Providence Resources off the coast of County Kerry in the south west of this country, we have no chance of saying legitimately that as a Parliament, and indeed as a Government, we are taking seriously the question of action on climate change. I do not think the Government has defended that sufficiently.</p>

            <p eId="para_101">The application has been made and is going through due process at the moment. I reiterate that if we are to transition to a low-carbon economy, it is expected that we will require significantly reduced fossil fuels for some time to come. Until we get there, we will still need to have fossil fuels for our families, farmers and businesses. We envisage that exploration will continue to have a role in the Irish offshore. Banning exploration would not reduce Ireland's emissions and would not help our 2030 emissions targets. It would make Ireland 100% dependent on importing gas and oil instead of using our own natural gas. We know that Ireland's indigenous production at the Corrib field is declining. The Kinsale field is approaching the end of its life. Furthermore, importing our energy over long distances from third countries could have the perverse effect of increasing emissions as energy is consumed in delivering this product to Ireland. We have to transition. In the meantime, we have to protect our energy supply and make sure we have enough energy here to keep our families, farms and businesses in existence.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">The repetition of the words "families, farms and businesses" does not pull at my heartstrings. I doubt that it pulls at the heartstrings of millions of people who support the "keep it in the ground" campaign, particularly the kids who marched recently. It is absolute and utter nonsense to say this would not reduce our emissions. Of course it would reduce our emissions. What the Minister of State really wants to say is that he does not understand what is going on. He thinks our emissions stop dead at the borders around our seashores, but that is not the case. This is a global problem. The emissions that come from any fossil fuels which are extracted affect the entire planet. By allowing licences to take more fossil fuels out of the earth, we are adding to the planet's overall carbon emissions. The Corrib field has 15 years left. That will bring us close to 2035, by which time we should almost be totally dependent on renewables if we are to reach our targets. Given that the Government continually objects to reliance on Russia and other politically unstable areas, why is the Minister of State saying that when the Corrib field is depleted 15 years from now, we will need to rely on ExxonMobil and other related companies that work closely with Chinese and Russian oil companies? The future should be carbon free.</p>

The Joint Committee on Climate Action is considering the options for reducing emissions. I repeat that the Bill about which the Deputy has spoken would not reduce our emissions. Instead, it would make us more dependent on imported natural gas. The Deputy has mentioned that the Corrib field will deplete. It will not keep going at the same volume right up until 2030. It is reducing year by year. We have to understand that we are looking at the security of our energy. We are seeking to make sure we continue to do business as we transition from where we are now to a low-carbon economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">Much of what I have to say in response to this question involves repeating what I said in response to Question No. 57. The challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is well understood by the Government. We are fully committed to moving away from the use of fossil fuels in electricity, heat and transport. We are making progress. In 2017, 30% of our electricity came from renewable sources. We are considering how to increase that to at least 55% by 2030. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is focusing on an all-of-Government climate action plan that will tackle Ireland’s emissions while ensuring Ireland has secure and affordable energy supplies. It is accepted that as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy, Ireland will continue to require some, but significantly reduced, fossil fuels to meet business needs. Banning exploration, as proposed in a Bill that is before the Oireachtas at present, would not reduce our emissions. I repeat that such a ban would make Ireland 100% dependent on importing gas and oil instead of using our own natural resources. I think that is important as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">This question relates specifically to the impact of climate change and the refusal of this Government and other Governments to recognise that we have to leave over 80% of known fossil fuels in the ground. Those are the known ones, never mind going searching for unknown ones. The impact is horrendous. In response to the previous question, the Minister of State mentioned the Citizens' Assembly and the Joint Committee on Climate Action. I am a member of the committee, which will issue its report tomorrow. The committee has been advised by Professor Peter Thorne, who recently wrote about the cyclone in Africa. He said "we can be pretty confident that rainfall associated with such systems has become greater due to human-induced climate change". He pointed out that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water and that if the ocean surface is warmer, there is more moisture going up than coming down. On average, the citizens of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, who suffer from terrible extreme weather events, are responsible for a tiny fraction of emissions compared with their counterparts in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. I will ask the Minister of State a question. How do we take responsibility for what is happening in the developing world as a consequence of our actions in the developed world?</p>

            <p eId="para_111">I remind the House of the actions the Government is taking in respect of climate change. It is important to say at the very start that I do not disagree with the Deputy's assertion that we need to change. It is a question of how we change and how we transition. That is the key to this issue. The Minister is working on the preparation of an all-of-Government climate action plan, which will make us a leader in responding. We are working with our colleagues across the Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and a range of other sectors where we have to make changes. Some of the changes we have to make might not be palatable, but they will have to be made nonetheless. We have to make sure they are made in a way that supports businesses and farms. If we do not do that, I do not know what we are doing. The plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific timelines and steps needed to achieve each action. Clear lines of responsibility will be assigned. The Government is preparing an action plan with action dates and timelines to be fulfilled. The plan will build on previous actions taken by the Government, including the national mitigation plan and the national development plan. It is the intention of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that the new plan which is being drawn up will address any recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">It is remarkable to listen to the Minister speaking about farms, families and businesses as if somehow I do not give a damn about those things, or indeed as if the tens of thousands of children who left school and marched to demand that the Government keep fossil fuels in the ground do not give a damn about their families, their farms or the businesses that surround them.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">They do, of course. Some of what is being done at the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which will report back tomorrow, is very good stuff but it is not nearly radical enough. When we read the stories of what happened in Mozambique and appreciate the suffering of half of the planet, we will realise that this report is not nearly radical enough. One radical measure concerns keeping fossil fuels in the ground. The committee refuses even to listen to another positive and radical measure regarding aiming towards delivering free public transport all around the country. It will not even listen to the suggestion. The committee also refuses to listen to how we might go about transitioning from the type of farming we are doing at the moment to a much more ecological and sustainable type of farming. Forestry has also not been examined. It is entirely insufficient so I ask the Minister of State not to pretend that stuff is being done for farms, families and businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">My question is on the issue of mattresses, couches and armchairs being dumped. Last year, the then Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, introduced an amnesty. It was a great success, by all accounts. Will the Government consider rerunning that programme this year and broadening it out to include other bulky items?</p>

            <p eId="para_128">I thank the Deputy for his question. Bulky household goods, such as mattresses, are a problematic waste stream for local authorities when they are illegally dumped in ditches and green areas. They are unsightly and their presence generally encourages further illegal dumping in an area. That is why my Department provided funding under the 2018 anti-dumping initiative to support a mattress amnesty campaign nationally. Under this initiative, approximately 11,000 mattresses were collected at 40 events throughout the country, with local authorities encouraged to direct these mattresses to the network of social economy enterprises for recycling. On foot of the impact of last year’s initiative, I am considering, as part of the 2019 anti-dumping initiative, to targeting the problem of illegal dumping in a holistic manner. That may also mean addressing bulky waste diversion.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">I thank the Minister for his reply. I want to impress on him the importance of this matter. As he stated, this is a major problem for local authorities. These items are bulky and are not things that can be put into the bin. It not like garden waste that can be put into the green organic bin and moved on to be recycled that way. Last year was one of the worst years for fly tipping and illegal dumping on streets and in back alleys, ditches, bogs, forests etc. My understanding is that the cost of the scheme last year was relatively small. The Minister might tell me what that cost was. When the then Minister announced the scheme, I remember the figure was fairly modest. The scheme, however, was a huge success.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> In County Laois, more than 800 mattresses were gathered up under this initiative. There is a high cost if these items are dumped in ditches or bogs. The local authority has to pull things like mattresses out of drains, ditches etc. Hiring contractors to deal with that situation costs the local authority greatly. The National Transport Authority spent €730,000 picking up litter along motorways. That is another example. We also need to look at side-by-side competition in the collection of waste in an estate. It is not feasible for many households to dispose of a couch, an armchair or a mattress. Will the Minister consider broadening the scheme this year to include such items?</p>

            <p eId="para_131">I do not have the universal cost but I do have the figure for County Laois. It cost €20,000 to collect 822 mattresses last year. If we expand that figure, it probably cost about €300,000 to collect the 11,000 mattresses overall. These projects operate by way of call. It depends, therefore, on local authorities coming forward with credible proposals to deal with this issue. A range of measures can be supported where local authorities feel they can organise an effective programme. We are trying to ensure the money we assign is used most effectively. If good proposals come forward to recycle mattresses, as was successful last year, we will look at those. We will also look at other materials such as couches. We will support whatever the local authorities feel will give the best bang for the buck.</p>

            <p eId="para_132">The Minister is giving some hope with that answer. I am glad to see he is open to considering other bulky items. Couches and armchairs present the same problem. It is not an easy fix, particularly in urban areas where people might not have their own car to dispose legally of couches and suites of furniture in a proper environmental manner. Measures were also put in place to ensure the scheme was not exploited by commercial operators. That was done very simply. The reports I have heard back from councils, in Laois and Offaly, state this initiative was a great success and we should do it again. From what the Minister said, I gather he is open to extending the scheme to couches and armchairs as well. Will he confirm that? We have a major problem with illegal dumping and we need stamp it out. There are many bogus waste collectors picking up these bulky items in the backs of vans. That is where much of the illegal dumping is coming from and we need an all-out effort to try to stamp it out.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">I will fund initiatives again this year, but they will be based on the proposals that come from the local authorities. We will want to see a good proposal that would warrant support. Deputy Stanley is right that 11,000 mattresses were taken in last year. It is a project of real benefit, therefore, and the Department is disposed to doing more in that area. Let us wait, however, to see what proposals come forward when we issue the call.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">This question is relatively self-explanatory. Deputy Ó Cuív is seeking a response on when the national broadband, NBP, scheme was first announced, the progress made to date with same, the amount of funding expended on the scheme to date, the number of properties provided to date with high-speed broadband under the scheme, and if the Minister will make a statement on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">The NBP aims to ensure high-speed broadband access to all premises in Ireland. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State-led intervention. The NBP procurement process was launched in 2015, following a public consultation. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, fewer than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises, had access to high-speed broadband. Today, more than 1.75 million premises, or 74% of premises can access high-speed broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage, as we have discussed. As previously advised, the level of State subsidy for the NBP State intervention is to be determined through this procurement process, and it is my intention to bring a recommendation to Government relating to the NBP in the coming weeks. Expenditure relating to the NBP, including the procurement process and the cost of external advisers, from January 2013 to date is €25.4 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">I thank the Minister. What Deputy Ó Cuív would like to be clear on is the timeframe for the announcement. I know we have addressed some of this in previous questions but it is imperative that we reach a decision without delay. Some premises have received broadband from private operators as a result of the initiation of the NBP. Notwithstanding that, there is still real concern in many parts of rural Ireland as a result of Eir rolling out a service to an additional 80,000 units and the proposals coming for fixed wireless from Imagine that gaps left in the middle will not covered in the longer term.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">There is very considerable concern emerging because of an announcement yesterday that the regulator, with respect to the roll-out of 5G wireless technology, will not require coverage of the geographic land mass and there will be more of a concentration on population densities, as there has been in the past. A previous Minister indicated a willingness to look at the geographical basis rather than the basis of population density or dispersal.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">As we have discussed, the decision on this is imminent. I intend to bring a recommendation to the Government before Easter, as has been indicated in the timeframe from the Taoiseach. I am working to that deadline. With respect to what is happening in the wider area, the Deputy will appreciate that the intervention area is what is left after commercial operators have "put up their hands" to deliver a universal service in certain areas. That is how Eir came to nominate the 300,000 premises. None of the recent announcements, such as that for Imagine, have put forward a proposal to carve out part of the intervention area on the basis that 100% cover would be provided within an area carved out to the minimum 30 Mbps requirement. These wireless technologies are not fibre to the home and as the Deputy knows all of those which submitted tenders under the original proposals indicated the most cost-effective way of delivering cover was fibre to the home.</p>

            <p eId="para_143">The question relates to biogas. The Climate Change Performance Index, CCPI, lists Ireland as one of the worst countries in the world in its attempts to address climate change. We know this and must accept it. We have a very valuable resource when compared to many other countries in Europe as there is potential for the use of biogas. What actions has the Government taken to utilise or stimulate that?</p>

            <p eId="para_144">Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion has the potential to play an important role in Ireland's transition to a low-carbon future. In addition to helping decarbonise the energy sector by replacing fossil fuels, the production of biogas can also reduce emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors. The support scheme for renewable heat has been developed to support financially the adoption of renewable heating systems by non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU emissions trading system. The next phase of the scheme includes support for biogas heating systems. A formal state aid application to the European Commission was submitted last month.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> In the electricity sector, the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, REFIT, 3 support scheme has supported the development of anaerobic digestion facilities via a high-efficiency combined heat and power tariff. This scheme is now closed for new applications. However, electricity output from anaerobic digesters will be eligible to compete for support under the forthcoming renewable electricity support scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> Biogas can also be purified into biomethane and then injected into the gas grid. The draft national energy and climate plan published last December includes the potential to support 1.6 million MW hours of biomethane grid injection by 2030. A key enabler for biomethane grid injection is the development of grid injection points. Gas Networks Ireland is currently developing Ireland's first injection point and the development of a second will be supported by the Climate Action Fund. The principal barrier to the development of biomethane grid injection is the significant cost differential between natural gas and biomethane. My Department continues to examine potential options to support biomethane grid injection, including how to fund this cost differential.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">The first biomethane injection point is coming online, generating electricity and producing biomethane for the grid. It is operational near Athy. I went to look at a facility a couple of years ago that was very impressive. However, there are 8,000 of these in Germany and 600 in Britain, so we are only getting going at this. We need to complement intermittent sources of electricity. We know wind, wave and solar power is all part of the solution but on the coldest nights there is no sun and there may be no wind, so we need to bring in sources that can provide a base loading of power.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> There is also the potential for a bio-fertiliser product from this. We had to go to the European Commission again this year seeking an extension of the derogation regarding the spreading of pig slurry. There is the potential to use this instead to make a bio-fertiliser that would be far more environmentally friendly. There is large-scale potential here. We in Sinn Féin have done much research into this and this has the potential to create up to 10% of our electricity supply. That is very realistic based on what is happening other countries. Will the Minister respond to that in particular?</p>

            <p eId="para_151">The difficulty is in selecting a roadmap to achieve decarbonisation over time, we must identify the route that would impose the least burden on people while creating the most opportunities. Work must be done to see whether various theoretical technologies can be converted to a reasonable cost-effective path. I absolutely agree there is potential in the area but the number of schemes under REFIT 3 was not very substantial. There is difficulty in bridging this cost gap but we are seeing new work emerge. In the Climate Action Fund I supported a particular scheme by Gas Networks Ireland that involved agricultural slurry specifically. This technology has great potential but we must ensure we adopt a roadmap where it can be cost-effective as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">The Minister mentions cost but when we start anything new, there will be a cost differential and we recognise this comes from scale, expertise and everything else. This technology is already up and running in other European countries on a large scale. The lack of facilities for biogas in this State demonstrate a lack of effort to date to drive this on. The focus has been completely on onshore wind, which has limitations because it is an intermittent source of energy. We may also have reached our potential in that regard. We need to start displacing fossil fuels with energy that will be there all the time. Biogas must be part of that plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_153"> The Minister mentioned cost but the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimates there is potential to create up to 3,000 jobs over the coming decades with biogas. That is not just Sinn Féin's argument and it is an important figure to remember. There is also the matter of farm waste. If a group of farmers are to do this, they must include the likes of the fertiliser in the project. Bord na Móna is looking into it.</p>

            <p eId="para_154">I can assure the Deputy there is no lack of vision in this area. We already have four schemes supporting this, including REFIT 3 and the new renewable heat scheme that will shortly have state aid. It relates to anaerobic digestion and it will go live as soon as we are in a position to make that happen. There is also the renewable electricity support scheme and the Gas Networks Ireland opportunities for biomethane in the Climate Action Fund. There is no lack of vision and there are avenues for this to be exploited. The scale will depend on cost competitiveness compared with other available options.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">I raise again the crisis within our Defence Forces. The low level of morale within the rank and file, the shabby manner in which they are treated, the gaps in middle management, and the failure to retain and nurture specialist expertise within the forces all point to a failed policy of the Government and a Minister of State who, with the Government, is completely out of touch with the reality on the ground. In the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service, a consistent message emerges. Members are exiting the Defence Forces at all ranks at a rate of between 40 and 50 per month. We learned last October that ships could not set sail because there were not enough crew members to manage them. The Air Corps operates at 70% capacity. On the rank and file within the Army, Sarah Walsh of the Wives &amp; Partners of the Defence Forces put it eloquently when she said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_162">Our families live in poverty. We suffer from food, income, fuel, and child poverty. Many of us can only dream of owning our home, and some this month are facing uncertainty about their homes, while others are facing homelessness. I personally know these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The current strength is approximately 8,800, which does not take into account 670 members overseas or 450 in full-time training. There has been a blind reliance by the Government on recruitment over retention and on recruiting its way out of the crisis. Recruitment on its own, however, has had no impact on the strength of the Defence Forces in recent years, and the cost benefit of retention over recruitment is indisputable. There has been a removal of initiatives to enhance retention, such as the fixed-period promotion for specialist service officers, which illustrates the lack of creative thinking to support our Defence Forces. It restricted members' career progress and left them with nowhere to go, resulting in people buying themselves out of the Defence Forces and leaving in unacceptable numbers. We have lost much specialist expertise from our Defence Forces. The Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mellett, has stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_164">You are always going to have a churn and a churn is healthy, but I would rather it be down about 5 per cent rather than the 8.1 per cent it is at present. It is that extra per cent that is crippling us at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> The ongoing exit from the ranks of the Defence Forces is just too great and it speaks to a failed policy. Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a crisis within our Defence Forces? Does he further accept, as has been suggested, that the Government, through the Department of Defence, is undermining the case being made by our Defence Forces through the initiatives of their leadership to turn the situation around?

          <p eId="para_166">Before I answer the Deputy's question, I beg the indulgence of the House to take this opportunity to extend my condolences to the family of Laura Brennan, whose service of remembrance is taking place in Ennis today. As Deputies will know, she died from cervical cancer but worked closely with the health service to become a powerful advocate for HPV vaccination and, because of her, we were able to increase its uptake again. While she has lost her life, sadly, I believe her actions will save the lives of many people. As Deputies will be aware, she was not connected with the approximately 221 women who were affected by the cervical cancer audit.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> I also extend my condolences to the family of the former Deputy, John Browne, who passed away this morning. People will know him as a colleague in the House and his son who served in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> To respond to the Deputy's question, the Government and everyone in the House are proud of the contribution that our Defence Forces make, whether through peacekeeping, as an aid to the civil power, intelligence or other operations. We are investing in our Defence Forces and increasing the budget this year, with more than €50 million being invested in barracks, equipment, pensions and pay. While I acknowledge there is a problem with retention in the Defence Forces, recruitment is going well. There are record numbers in the classes being attested and graduating, although many people are leaving because there are now many opportunities in the private sector, as the Deputy will know is the case in his constituency in County Cork, where engineers are leaving the Naval Service to work in the private sector. The Chief of Staff has stated he would prefer to see a turnover rate of approximately 5%, which would be normal, as opposed to the current rate of approximately 8%, and I concur.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I accept that we need to act but we are taking action. Pay restoration is well under way throughout the public service, including the Defence Forces, and almost everyone earning under €80,000 will have full pay restoration by the end of the year. There will be continuous recruitment rather than recruitment in bullets or phases, as happened in the past. We are allowing for the re-entry of people to the Defence Forces, given that, sometimes after people leave, they want to come back and now we will allow them to do so if they so wish. The fourth and perhaps most significant step is that we have asked the Public Service Pay Commission to examine the issues. After holding hearings and listening to the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff and the Department, the commission will bring forward proposals which it believes could improve the terms and conditions of the Defence Forces without having an impact across the public sector. I asked the head of the commission, Kevin Duffy, in recent days whether the report could be expedited, and he informed me he believes that the commission can publish its report by the middle of May.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">I get a sense of the Government and the Taoiseach being detached from the reality of the crisis on the ground. The Taoiseach said recruitment is going well, but the fact of the matter is that the Government cannot recruit its way out of the crisis. It must address the retention issues. Between 1 January and 31 December 2017, for example, the significant recruitment drive by the Department of Defence and the associated burden on operational units and structures yielded a net increase of three personnel to the Defence Forces. We have been telling the Government about the issue for between two and three years. It is not something that has just arrived today. Morale is low at all levels. A recent Amárach Research survey, commissioned by RACO, found that 79% of post-2013 officers are strongly considering leaving well in advance of their retirement age due to the issue of supplementary pension before qualification for the State contributory pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> At all levels, from pension to pay to allowances, there are no initiatives to retain people. In fact, it is in the opposite direction. All the inbuilt structures and so on are designed to incentivise people to leave the Army, the Air Corps and the navy. Even the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment recruits people from the Army and pays higher rates than the Army can. The loss of expertise, from bomb disposal to the Naval Service, has been enormous over recent years, but all we have heard in reply is a studied indifference from the Government and a lack of urgency to deal with the crisis. Does the Taoiseach accept that?</p>

          <p eId="para_172">Recruitment is going well. The biggest classes ever are coming through and being attested. For the first time, we have people moving from the non-commissioned ranks to become officers. There are promotional opportunities that were not available in the past. There is a particular focus on recruiting more women into the Defence Forces and we are seeing some good results in that regard. However, there is a high turnover rate of approximately 8% a year, whereas 5% would be more normal. We are doing four things to address the matter. They include pay restoration which is happening across the public service, with the next tranche to kick in in the next few weeks. We are moving from periodic to continuous recruitment. We are also moving towards a model of re-entry, whereby people who leave can rejoin. That was not allowed in the past and it is a significant change such that people who have left the Defence Forces to move elsewhere in the public sector or the private sector can come back in, which is very positive. I do not know why we did not do it before. Perhaps most significantly, we have commissioned the Public Service Pay Commission to examine the terms, conditions and allowances of members of the Defence Forces. I spoke to the head of the commission in the last couple of days to ask if the report could be expedited. He told me that it could be and that the commission expected to report by the middle of May.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_173">I join the Taoiseach in extending our sympathy to and expressing our solidarity with Laura's family and friends as they remember her today. I am also sorry to hear of the passing of John Browne. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Yesterday the United Nations special rapporteur for adequate housing lists, Leilani Farha, issued a damning condemnation of the Government's record on housing for allowing vulture funds to buy up large numbers of properties across the State, only to let them at scandalous prices. She said the Government was facilitating the financialisation of housing through providing preferential tax breaks for corporate landlords and standing over weak tenant protections. We know from last month's homelessness figures that there are now more homeless persons in the State than at any time in our history. The figure is almost 10,000. There are tens of thousands of people on council housing waiting lists, while social and affordable homes are being constructed at a snail's pace. People in the private rental sector are being hit time and again, with rent increases continuing to spiral, and all the while house prices continue to rise. For many, owning a home is now nothing but a pipedream.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> The response from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has been to stick with the plan and let the market do its thing. It may not have occurred to the Taoiseach yet but his plan is not working. It is failing spectacularly and the housing system in the State is broken. This is not just my assessment or that of Sinn Féin but the verdict of the United Nations that corporate interests are trumping the needs of ordinary people and families in the housing market. In the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis, we have the likes of I-RES REIT and Blackstone making massive profits, paying minimal taxes and fleecing tenants. It is ridiculous, unacceptable and must stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> We need a radical rethink and action to benefit those who are struggling and in need of a much-needed break. Will the Taoiseach accept that there is an urgent need to rein in corporate interests in the private rental market? It is not that solutions have not been offered because there are solutions. The Taoiseach and the Minister have refused to act and listen. True to form, their partners in Fianna Fáil bury their heads in the sand, too. The Government could do the right and necessary things. It could introduce with immediate effect a three-year rent freeze and temporary tax relief for renters. It could support the legislation that will be brought before the Dáil by Deputy Ó Broin tomorrow to prevent buy-to-let landlords from seeking vacant possession. The Government could avail of and implement these alternatives. We need bold and meaningful action because the UN assessment of the Government's failures needs to be a wake-up call. Does the Taoiseach accept the assessment of the UN special rapporteur?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_177">As I have not had an opportunity to hear about or read it in full, I would prefer not to comment on it until I have done so. I cannot argue with the fact that approximately 10,000 people live in emergency accommodation in Ireland. While there will always be a certain number who will need emergency accommodation for different reasons, 10,000 is far too high which I do not deny for one second. It concerns all of us in government greatly. We lift thousands of people out of homelessness every year; we take them out of emergency accommodation and provide them with secure tenancies, but as quickly as we are able to house people, roughly the same number become homeless. That is why we have not been able to get the number down from 10,000 for the past year. The solution is more supply. We need more homes and apartments. Last year 18,000 new homes were built. They are new houses and apartments that did not exist this time last year. There were more new houses built than in any of the past ten years, which is very significant, but we need to do better again. We need approximately 25,000 new homes this year and 30,000 in the year after. I do not see it as ideological, as Deputy McDonald does. I do not see it as social housing versus private housing, people on the housing list versus those who want to buy and the private sector versus the public sector. I do not see it in that way. We need more housing, including more social housing, and are getting it, with 9,000 units added to the social housing stock last year and 10,000 or more this year. We need more private housing that people will be able to buy. That means working with the private sector and the construction sector to deliver them because most people want to own their own home. They do not want the Government to own it for them. It also means having a much better, more regulated rental sector, which is why we introduced things like rent caps and are bringing forward more tenancy rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">The Taoiseach's position could not be more ideological. He is blinded by his own ideology and prevented from doing the very obvious, common-sense, pragmatic and necessary things by a fierce ideology that insists on the market sorting it out and that the State and the Government sitting on the sidelines as observers, crossing their fingers and hoping for the best in trying to talk the issue away. The Government is failing. The United Nations, not Sinn Féin, states the Government is allowing faceless corporations to wreak havoc on the rights of tenants. That is its finding and a damning indictment of the Government which has its ideological position. That is where it sits. I am not here to enter into an ideological debate but to say directly to the Government that it needs to do the necessary things to protect tenants. Its so-called rent control measures have failed. We have made propositions about having a rent freeze and providing tax relief for renters. Critically, a measure will be brought to the floor of the House tomorrow-----</p>

          <p eId="para_212">Today in the Visitors Gallery there are several climate conscious students who travelled from Donegal this morning to attend the launch of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action's long-awaited report, which may or may not be launched this week, as originally planned. These young men and women organised a climate strike in Lifford, County Donegal, just over a week ago to coincide with the global climate strike carried out by students around the world, initiated by Greta Thunberg. Sadly, I was the only Deputy to show up at the climate strike in Donegal despite the scale of protest, which saw more than 1.4 million young people march in over 100 countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> These students will hand a petition, which has almost 300 signatures from students and staff across Donegal, to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, today. I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet them to accept the petition. The petition contains demands from students who say the Government's inaction is killing their future. They demand that the Government ensure that all fossil fuels are left in the ground and call for a ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure. They also want a climate emergency to be declared and for the State to communicate the severity of the ecological crisis to the public, including a reform of the educational system to address the need for ecological literacy. The rapid implementation of the entire Citizens' Assembly suite of recommendations on climate change is also demanded by the students, as well as policy changes to ensure a reduction in emissions from agriculture. </p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I am hopeful that the committee's report will go some way to addressing these demands but its main tenets can only be addressed where there is political will within the Government. I urge the Minister and the Taoiseach to seriously consider the list of demands in the petition and show they will take seriously the needs of this and future generations before it is too late. It is clear that this generation of young people will not be quiet on the issue. They refuse to be the generation that will remain "the voiceless future of humanity", as one student activist says. As Governments like the Taoiseach's continue to fail to respond adequately to climate change threats, climate activism is increasingly being harnessed by the young. Many of today's climate strikers will not even be 30 by the time the 1.5o deadline comes around in 2030. That is the significance of this. Will the Taoiseach commit to acting on student demands for urgent action on climate change? </p>

          <p eId="para_227">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Out of respect to the students and young people who came here to hear my answer, I am going to give them an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> As I said earlier, all of us in this House were very inspired and encouraged by the protests that students engaged in all around the world. They put it up to us, the adults, the politicians, to get more done, not just to talk about climate change or to put forward the measures that are popular but also to get behind measures that may be unpopular or may be difficult and unpalatable for some sectors in society. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and Deputy Heydon attended those protests and spoke with many of the young people involved, as did Deputies around the country and I am glad they did that. </p>
          <p eId="para_229"> The all-party climate action committee is meeting at present. I hope we can get a consensus on the actions that need to be taken when it comes to climate change. We need a consensus on carbon tax, regulation and the type of investments we need to make. It will be much more easy to do if we have a political and all-party consensus behind those important measures so that it does not become a matter of point-scoring but a collective effort across politics. In addition, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on our all-of-government approach and response to climate change, which will be very much informed by what parameters are set by the all-party committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_230"> Things happening this year that will make a big difference include, for example, that we are starting to decarbonise our bus fleet, and from the middle of this year all buses operated by Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus will be low-emission vehicles. The first of those is being tested in Cork at the moment, operating off compressed natural gas. We have committed to taking coal off the grid, so Moneypoint will no longer burn coal by the middle of this decade. We will need a transitional fuel such as natural gas to replace it. I think everyone accepts that is necessary. We are also investing much more in renewable energy and pushing that forward too. They are just three small examples. </p>

I hope this Government will not let the young people down and that we will not look back on the Taoiseach's contribution today and ask where was the inspiration and encouragement. We need to get beyond that now. It is one thing for the Taoiseach to say he is inspired and encouraged by what the young people are saying but when will we actually do things? We saw here yesterday the Government's opposition to the fossil fuel drilling Bill going forward. We need to leave those fuels in the ground. The Taoiseach needs to listen to what the students are saying. That is how the Government can inspire people and make sure we can go forward together, hoping that we will see change. The problem is that we are not getting that consensus or a sense from the Government that it wants to go forward with everybody else on climate change. We owe it to those young people to stop the fancy words now and actually get on with the action and make sure the measures are delivered. I hope that in coming years, the Government will deliver rather than give us the fine talk.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">The Deputy referred to legislation. The Government has already accepted during the term of this Dáil three Private Members' Bills to improve our environment: Deputy McLoughlin's Bill to ban fracking, which has now been banned in Ireland; Deputy Pringle's legislation to prevent the State investing in fossil fuels, that has been passed and we worked with the Deputy on that; and legislation proposed by the Green Party, which we have taken on board, to ban microplastics. Those are three practical examples of Bills that the Government has adopted and accepted to make our environment better.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> We have a difficulty with the legislation being put forward on fossil fuels - the keep them in the ground Bill - because we are unconvinced on four points: the evidence is that this Bill will not reduce emissions at all, in fact one person taking the bus once rather than driving would reduce emissions more than that Bill, so it is largely ineffectual. </p>

          <p eId="para_251">I welcome the men and women from the National Ambulance Service who are here in such large numbers that they could not all fit into the Public Gallery and who are interested in hearing the Taoiseach's answer to my question.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Late last year, the HSE commissioned a polling company to conduct a nationwide survey of HSE staff. One of the questions was as follows: "My organisation clearly demonstrates its interest in staff health and wellbeing." For the HSE as a whole, the percentage who agreed with that statement was 42%, which is not great. The figure for the National Ambulance Service staff was 11%. Some 37% of HSE staff were satisfied with their pay levels. The figure for National Ambulance Service personnel was 6%. That is the legacy of the Government's austerity pay cuts. Some 69% of National Ambulance Service personnel had experienced bullying, harassment or both in the previous two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> These are key workers, they do a stressful job and they work long hours. Many people call them ambulance drivers but they are a lot more than that. They are paramedics, advanced paramedics and emergency medical technicians. They are lifesavers and they deserve to be treated with respect, but they are not being treated with respect by the HSE and the National Ambulance Service. The HSE refused to negotiate with the union chosen by more than 500 of these workers to represent them. The National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, is part of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA. The PNA has thousands of members in the health service and a full negotiating licence, but so stubborn are the HSE and the National Ambulance Service in their stance, that they refuse even to sit down with the NASRA representatives to negotiate contingency plans for public safety on the days the workers' strike. The National Ambulance Service phoned its solicitors, those solicitors phoned the union's solicitors, the union's solicitors phoned the union and the union phoned the picket line and then the whole matter was put into reverse. It would be laughable if it was not for the fact that this ignorant management approach to industrial relations is compromising the health and safety of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> The first national ambulance strike in the history of the State is taking place on the Taoiseach's watch. On 12 March, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, told the Dáil he was confident the dispute could be resolved, but has his Department even sat down with the HSE to discuss resolving it since then? The Taoiseach might tell the Dáil. The men and women in the Gallery will be joined by colleagues outside the gates of the Dáil at 2.30 p.m. to demand their democratic right to be represented by the union of their choice. On 2 April, next Tuesday, they are due to strike again and on 10 April, they will strike again if the matter is not resolved. The Taoiseach should resolve it before 2 April. Is the Taoiseach prepared to take the necessary measures? Is he prepared to instruct the Department to sit down with the HSE before 2 April, instructing it to recognise this union and to resolve this dispute?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_184">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_255">The Government is very committed to continuing to improve, expand and develop our National Ambulance Service. We have increased the budget for the National Ambulance Service every year for four years running. That money goes towards several objectives. It goes towards pay restoration, pay increases, extra staff, new ambulances, improving our existing ambulance bases and introducing new technology ranging from Eircodes to onboard equipment. We have seen a big improvement in our ambulance services over recent years, particularly as staff have been upskilled and as we have more paramedics and advanced paramedics providing emergency healthcare the moment they arrive at the scene, thus providing emergency interventions immediately, long before the patient gets to the hospital and that is the way to go. There will be many more improvements in that regard into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> What the Deputy refers to is of course an industrial relations dispute. It is principally an inter-union dispute. There are a number of unions which represent the majority of ambulance staff, paramedics and others which are already recognised. SIPTU is certainly the main union, Fórsa is the other union and there may be a third union and this is an inter-union dispute. We know from so many other workplaces that it is much better to have staff represented by one union or maybe two, rather than having six, seven or eight unions competing with each other as much as trying to negotiate better terms and conditions for their staff. We have seen that in so many other fields where disputes would have been resolved much quicker to the benefit of everyone had there been only one union or two, rather than six or seven competing with each other and taking members off each other rather than engaging in the work that they should be doing, which is advancing the interests of their members.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> This is an industrial relations dispute. It will be resolved in the normal way and as is always the case with industrial relations disputes, there will not be interference from Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">It is up to the workers to decide which union they choose to represent them. It is not up to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health or the HSE. This is not an inter-union dispute. There are plenty of sections of the public sector where the State recognises four trade unions, not the six, seven or eight that the Taoiseach attempted to distort the facts with. There are plenty of places where four unions are recognised. I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the fact that two of the three unions involved, namely Fórsa and Unite the Union, have less membership combined than NASRA and the PNA. In fact, their combined membership does not even come close to the combined membership of NASRA and the PNA. The rank and file members of the biggest union, SIPTU, support the right of this union to be recognised, as shown by the fact that they have stood on the picket lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> It is an excuse. The real reason is that the Government does not want the HSE to recognise a union which would not accept and which would challenge and fight the Government's understaffing and underpaying of ambulance personnel and the overstretched and overworked workforce. The trade union movement must not allow these workers to stand alone. The PNA has 6,000 members in the health service and there must be active solidarity with these workers if they continue to be denied their democratic right to have a union recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> Is the Taoiseach prepared to try to stop the strike on 2 April by doing a simple thing, namely asking the HSE to sit down and talk to the representatives of the union chosen by more than 500 of these workers?</p>

          <p eId="para_272">Before I speak on the issue, I express my sympathies to the family of Laura Brennan, an exemplar in public health, to her parents Bernie and Larry, to her brothers Colin, Fergal and Kevin, and to her uncle Tommy who was an Independent member of Clare County Council. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. I also mention the former Deputy John Browne, whom I knew well. He was a genial and friendly person and a gentleman to his bones. Again, I express sympathy to the Browne family on their loss and we will probably get an opportunity to make a proper expression of sympathy for the former Deputy Browne.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The context is similar in terms of Laura Brennan. I want to raise the commitments made in terms of the CervicalCheck scandal with the Taoiseach, particularly on behalf of those who are representing those who were affected by that scandal. First, would the Taoiseach commit to an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to cover the independent review of slide costs?</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Many individuals are not in the greatest financial situation and have had to pay up to €2,000 because they are required to hire a solicitor and go through all of the procedure for the review. I ask that this be done expeditiously.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> In terms of legislation and the Meenan report, it is extremely important that we get a timeline for the publication of the legislation establishing the tribunal. Crucially, there is a need to update the terms of reference for the CervicalCheck steering committee to ensure that the Department of Health and the committee stay on board until the Scally recommendations are fully implemented, the backlog in testing has been cleared, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists review is complete and the HPV screening programme has begun to be rolled out. I am saying this because there was an attempt by the Department of Health to close down the steering committee recently. I have the minutes here that confirm this. That cannot happen until those four areas are dealt with. I ask the Taoiseach to commit to updating the terms of reference to ensure that.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">I am sorry, I may not have all the information to hand and will have to ask the Minister for Health to provide a more detailed answer. Only one of those matters relates to promised legislation, and that is the legislation to establish the tribunal recommended by Mr. Justice Meenan. Work on that is advanced. It is one of only six Bills that we have prioritised for this session and we intend to get it done before the summer recess if we can, ideally by June, and I think we can. There have been some concerns expressed by the Judiciary about it but we think they can be resolved and we are keen to have that legislation done to give women an alternative to court to have their cases heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> On the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme, my recollection is that we have approved that at Cabinet already and obviously it is open to anyone who avails of that <i>ex gratia</i> scheme to spend the money they receive from it as they wish. That scheme relates specifically to the issue of non-disclosure, as opposed to the wider issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">The programme for Government commits to targeted improvements in public services with a particular focus on disability issues. It also commits to ensuring that transport service provision for people with disabilities is fit for purpose and consistent with their needs, yet Bus Éireann's brand new, state-of-the-art city buses are actually less accessible for wheelchair users than the older buses they have replaced. My colleague, Deputy Munster, raised serious accessibility concerns about the new single-decker buses last year but her warnings fell on deaf ears. There was no engagement with disability groups in advance of introducing the fleet and we have also learned that the buses have not been built to Irish standards. I commend the campaigning work of a young man called Karl Cretzan, whom I met earlier in the week in Waterford. Karl is a wheelchair user and has been to the fore in highlighting the shortfalls of this new fleet. On Karl's behalf and on behalf of all of our citizens with disabilities who rely on public transport, I ask the Taoiseach what he and his Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport are going to do to rectify the inaccessibility of this new fleet of buses.</p>

The Parliament voted by 410 to 192 to adopt this. The decision now has to be adopted by the European Council. What is Ireland's position on this matter? Under the current system, all 28 EU member states switch to summer time on the last Sunday of March, which is this coming weekend, and back to winter time on the last Sunday of October. Ireland will be in a difficult position as the UK will be leaving the EU. There is the possibility of having two different time zones on the island of Ireland, as the UK has already declared it does not intend to switch from its current system. What is the Taoiseach's intention in this regard and how will Ireland be voting on the matter at the European Council?</p>

          <p eId="para_293">In the programme for Government, it is stated that the Government should be tested on its ability to deal with the housing crisis and provide social and affordable housing. On Friday, the Minister produced a regulation on affordable housing stating that somebody on €45,000 a year should be paying no more than 35% of their income, which would be €998 per month. On the front of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, we have an account of the Land Development Agency, LDA, which the Government set up, proposing affordable housing that would be €1,300 a month for a site in Shankill in respect of which we have been campaigning for five years to get council and affordable housing. That is not affordable, even by the Government's own definition of affordability. Furthermore, there will not be a single council house. The Taoiseach said earlier on that he is not ideological. That is ideological. Under the guise of promises about affordable housing, the Government is privatising public lands for unaffordable rents and preventing the construction of the council housing that we actually need.</p>

The councillors will decide what approach to take. The reference to the €1,300 is one example. While rent could cost €1,900 at the moment on a house out there, it could be provided for €1,300, which is a major improvement. It is a council decision to be taken in the weeks ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">Throughout the country, many communities, schools, boards of management, parents' councils and teaching principals are trying to set up autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units for national schools. I have a situation in Fethard, County Tipperary, in the Holy Trinity national school where two years ago, they got agreement to set up two units and got the go-ahead from the Department of Education and Skills. The school now finds in 2019 that it must go back and retender for the extensions. There is too much bureaucracy. When we get schools that are willing to take these very special classes for very special children, I commend them and support them. I commend the special educational needs organiser, SENO, Ms Belinda Fitzgerald. Working together is what we want but there is too much bureaucracy in the Department and too many delays. This retendering is not work the schools or teaching principals should be doing anyway; it should be done by the Department. Ní neart go cur le chéile. When we get the people who want to help these less well-off children, who are very excellent in many ways but need the special classrooms, when we get the buy-in from the school communities, we need to move ahead with them, not have it so bureaucratic that they are waiting on a string with prices going up and frustration all around.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">I am afraid I do not have the details of the situation in Fethard, but I am sure the Minister for Education and Skills does and would be able to give the Deputy a more detailed reply. We have done a considerable amount of work in the past few years in accommodating and supporting children with special needs. We have more special needs assistants and more special classes than ever before. ASD units are being built throughout the country. I have had the privilege to visit many of them, including in my constituency. They are being built, but obviously they have to put out to tender. Rather than the Department of Education and Skills doing it all centrally, it makes sense to allow schools to do it. It is often done more quickly when it is devolved locally.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">Project Ireland 2040 has ambitions targets for population growth in Cork. To achieve them, significant investment is needed in public transport. Unfortunately, Cork seems to be the land of the missed deadline, whether it is for events centres or the long-promised Cork metropolitan area transport strategy. In January 2018 the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, announced that it would be published in March last year. We have since been promised continually that it will be published in a few weeks. I hope the Taoiseach can give me a more specific answer than simply it will be published in a few weeks or a few months. When will the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy be published for public consultation?</p>

I cannot give the Deputy a commitment on the authority's behalf, but I am sure it will publish it as soon as it possibly can.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Our ambition in Project Ireland 2040 is to see the population of Cork grow by 50% by 2040, twice the rate at which the population of Dublin will grow, allowing it to become a city of international scale that can attract jobs and investment in business. It will be a good place in which to live, work and study. A big part of it will be BusConnects, which will be the major public transport investment for the city and dramatically improve bus times. Obviously, the M20 project will be very important in connecting Cork to Limerick. In addition, road projects will start quite soon, including the Dunkettle interchange project, which will greatly help to reduce congestion in the city. It is important that the light rail reservation be retained. While the project may not be viable at the moment, if the population of the city grows as fast as we think it will, a light rail system will be a real option in the future. </p>

They are representing 9,000 retired ESB workers who have not had a pension increase since 2010. There is no cost of living increase and no linking with current employees' salaries.

          <p eId="para_302">I am not an expert on the particular pension fund. However, I met ESB pensioners some years ago when I was Minister for Social Protection. As the Deputy knows, the State pension is increased every year; in fact, it will increase this week by €5 a week. It has increased by about €1,000 a year in the past year. Pension funds such as the ESB's essentially are company funds and the amount that can be paid is linked with the amount pensioners paid in, the amount the company paid in and the quality of investments made by the scheme trustees in the interim. The Government cannot change this. It is about how much was paid in by the staff and the company and how well the investments have performed.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">The programme for Government makes various commitments to ensure the welfare and well-being of older people. Adequate State support for nursing homes is crucial in ensuring the security of the ageing population. Two weeks ago I met the CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland and a number of representatives of nursing homes in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, including Mooncoin nursing home, Brookhaven nursing home in Ballyragget and Drakelands nursing home in Kilkenny. They seek the immediate publication of the review of the system for setting nursing home prices under the nursing home support scheme. In response to a parliamentary question in December I was informed that the National Treatment Purchase Fund was close to completing the report and aimed to have a draft for the steering group before year end. Two weeks ago I was disappointed to receive an identical response to a further parliamentary question. It appears no progress has been made. Will the Minister of State explain the reason publication of this crucial report is being handled at a snail's pace? Nursing Homes Ireland has been seeking it for some time. It wants equality in the system between public and private nursing homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">We are 58 days away from the local elections. One of the key votes on the day will be in the plebiscite on directly elected mayors. This week we have had reporting of Cabinet Ministers saying the proposal could lead to an over-concentration of control. There is an over-concentration of control; it has continued for 121 years in the Custom House. Even more concerning are the observations of the Attorney General, Mr. Seamus Woulfe, on the transfer of powers from the executive to the elected members and in raising a flag about the loss of expertise, which, if reported correctly, are extremely worrying from the point of view of the suppression of the advancement of local democracy. We all know that there is no loss of expertise or jobs; it is all about who is accountable to the public for policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> The Attorney General also observed that the proposals for the plebiscite should be sent for further legal advice and further policy consideration. Does the Taoiseach share the Attorney General's views on directly elected mayors? What is the timeframe - if the proposals are to be sent for further consideration - for the start of the information campaign mentioned by the Taoiseach yesterday? We are eight weeks away from polling day. If there is not at the very least a very basic understanding of the proposals, they are destined to fail, which would be disastrous for local democracy.

          <p eId="para_308">I am not sure if it was reported correctly. Generally, when the Attorney General gives advice, his advice is on legal matters, not the expertise levels of staff in local authorities, as being a barrister the Attorney General would have no knowledge of such things. However, he has said that even though it is not a referendum in a constitutional sense, we need to treat it as though it was. Therefore a <i>de facto</i> referendum commission will be established. We will not use any public money in advocating a "Yes" vote, but there will be an information campaign funded publicly and run from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> I will explain the proposal in the simplest way possible. It is a real job. There will be a lord mayor for Cork and mayors for Waterford city and county and Limerick city and county, if the people want it. We will see a transfer of power from the chief executive, formerly known as the county or city manager, to a directly elected mayor. It will be similar to the relationship in Departments between Ministers and their Secretaries General. The mayor will propose the budget and development plan. It is a real job with real clout for somebody who can lead his or her city regions forward. The powers to stay with the CEO are those that are most appropriately not dealt with by a politician: individual planning decisions, individual housing applications and human resources matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">On 21 June 2016 I posed the following question to which I received a written reply. I acknowledge that the Tánaiste has been trying to help me with it. My question was:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_313">To ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if there is a protocol in place for British driving licences to be recognised in the State or if they will have to be replaced with European Union driving licences for the purpose of British citizens living and working here who still drive on their British driving licence and in the event of Britain leaving the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I will not go into the detailed reply I received. However, there is an issue which I raised with the Tánaiste last week. I have met constituents who have been informed that when they go to change their licence under which they have cover for a commercial vehicle, they will not be covered for it; they will only have cover for a car. As I cannot receive clarification, I would like somebody to clarify the matter for me because it is causing difficulty. I was told the same would apply to a minibus driver. The last part of the written reply stated: "The Deputy may wish to know, however, that under international road traffic conventions, holders of foreign licences may drive in Ireland for up to a year on a visitor basis". I ask for clarification as to what that means.</p>

If there are more complex cases of commercial licences that may involve multiple vehicles and so on and if the Deputy wants to come back to me, I can get him detailed answers on those cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">Page 70 of the programme for Government states that this Government is committed to improving services and increasing supports for people with disabilities, particularly early intervention and early assessment for children with special needs. I submitted a parliamentary question a while ago to which I got a response from the HSE indicating that 559 children in Laois-Offaly are waiting on an assessment of need. This is appalling in light of the fact that the legal timeframe outlined in the Disability Act 2005 is that an assessment of need should be carried out within three months. The long waiting time is having a major and negative impact on children with special needs. What actions will the Government take to reduce the waiting time for children to have an assessment of need in Laois-Offaly?</p>

We have made significant progress in recent months on establishing disability network managers in each of the areas who are tasked with managing access in this respect, and they are having quite a positive impact where they are in place. I will have to advise the Deputy if there is a disability network manager in place in Laois-Offaly.</p>

Recently released figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund are worrying and disappointing, especially for outpatient waiting lists in excess of 18 months. I will cite two examples. The ear, nose and throat, ENT, waiting list at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, in excess of 18 months stands at 3,437 and for orthopaedics it stands at 1,655. I accept that currently there are 479 vacant consultant posts in Ireland across all sectors in health, a situation which is compounding the issue. What are the specific plans within the Department of Health to tackle long waiters, especially in excess of 18 months?</p>

          <p eId="para_324">We will talk about that another time. To answer the Deputy Butler's question, from the patient point of view, which is what really matters, we have made considerable progress in reducing waiting times for operations and procedures. We lost some ground as a consequence of the nurses' strike, but the number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for an operation or procedure has been falling for well over a year. At the end of last year, it was at a four or five-year low. We lost a little time because of the nurses' strike, but we will catch up on that. We are not making progress on outpatients. We need to see if the approach we used to reduce waiting times for operations and procedures might be applied to some outpatient specialties such as ENT, dermatology and ophthalmology where we could buy in expertise from the private sector if we need to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to provide support to people with disabilities to maximise their potential by removing barriers to access services, education, work and healthcare. However, service users attending Drumlin House, a centre for people with disabilities in Cootehill, County Cavan, were stunned to receive a letter from the HSE last Thursday informing them that as of 1 April their transport service, which is provided by the LocalLink service, will now cost €4 for a daily return, which is €20 a week, and based on the education year in Drumlin House that is a total charge of €960 per annum for a person with a disability. Fortunately, people with a disability are supplied with a medical card and therefore a travel pass, but the travel pass is not accepted on the LocalLink service. When this charge comes into place, if these people cannot afford it, which will most likely be the case, they will be left at home. Will the Taoiseach investigate this letter has come from the HSE and ensure this new charge is abolished? It is a ludicrous charge that will result in people with a disability having to stay at home.</p>

While I respect that is the Government's agenda and that it is in line with Government policy, Commissioner Harris went on to say he envisages increased demand to counter the impact of economic crime leading to further leakage of duties to the Exchequer. What are the Taoiseach's plans to ensure the issue of loss of revenue, regardless of a deal, no deal or no hard border, is dealt with?</p>

          <p eId="para_328">That is a roundabout way of asking a question that I get asked almost every day at the moment. That is really going to depend on what happens in the next few weeks, whether we have a deal, and if we do not have a deal, what shape that takes. We are increasing the size of the Garda force, which is now more than 14,000. Civilians are being brought in to free up gardaí, and we are taking and have taken on more Revenue staff and more customs inspectors. We have the additional staff we may need in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I notice it has become part of the part of the commentary in London at the moment that I, as Taoiseach, have somehow said that special arrangements would solve all our problems and that all of these concerns about a hard border and the need for a backstop do not matter because the Taoiseach has talked about there being special arrangements. Let there be no doubt in this House or in Westminster that when I talk about special arrangements, I mean treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom, and it is the UK Government's proposal to do exactly that, not in four of five years if the backstop ever has to be implemented but in a few weeks in the event of no deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_335">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit employers deliberately designating an employee as self-employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I am happy to introduce the Bill, which is designed to deal with the pernicious and growing problem of bogus self-employment. This is a phenomenon which has traditionally been associated with the construction sector but it has now spread into other sectors, such as healthcare, education, the media and even the retail sector. The consequences of somebody having been declared self-employed in a bogus fashion are twofold. First, there is a substantial loss of revenue to the State, which, according to the latest figures, runs into hundreds of millions of euro, which could be spent on social services in this country. Second, it deprives at the stroke of a pen rights that have been built up and legislated for over many decades, many of them stemming from our membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> The growth of the so-called gig economy and the increased casualisation of work has exacerbated this trend. It can often be difficult to determine what category a person falls into because the choice is becoming increasingly blurred. Make no mistake, however, the argument that it is a free choice for an employee as to whether he or she is to be designated as self-employed is not correct. It is not a free choice in most cases, given the bargaining power between the employee and the employer is totally unequal. I recognise there are many skilled professionals and craftsmen who work for several customers and they deserve to be classified as self-employed. However, there are many among the categories of the self-employed, particularly low-paid and unskilled workers, who are obviously not self-employed but have been forced to declare themselves self-employed in order to get the job in the first place. They are in that position, essentially, because the employer is trying to evade his or her obligations as an employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Among the other consequences for the cohort of false self-employed is the inability to bargain collectively, as was recently recognised by the European Court of Justice. In putting forward this legislation, I am in no way intending to prevent legitimate arrangements unless it is an obvious and blatant tax avoidance measure. The legislation I put forward today contains a defence which allows for that type of situation and if does not, let me make it clear that I will accept any appropriate amendments if the Government progresses the Bill. I understand that atypical employment is growing and there are more flexible ways of working now, and all of that has to be recognised. However, recognising that does not compel us to turn a blind eye to a patently false assertion that some people are not really employees at all, when it is crystal clear that they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> My Bill has been criticised on the basis it contains penalties under the criminal law. This was precisely the same approach taken by the Government under the miscellaneous provisions legislation which we debated recently, where the Government provided for, and the Minister argued cogently for, a section which stated that if the employer does not supply his or her proper name and address or place of business within 15 working days, he or she is facing possible imprisonment. I apply the same logic to my proposal as the Minister used during the course of the debate on that Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> There are a number of other Bills before the House. I understand the AAA has a Bill - it is People Before Profit or the AAA, although I get confused. In any case, the left has a Bill. The Labour Party has a Bill, which is going through the Seanad at present. I am prepared to sit down with the representatives of the parties who put forward those Bills to adopt a coherent approach to this matter. I note the Minister brought a memorandum on bogus self-employment to Cabinet yesterday. From what I know of the contents of that memorandum, it seems to be another gesture to tokenism. Radical action is needed and it is needed sooner rather than later. Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_346">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the establishment of the Pensionable Age Task Force which shall consider and make recommendations on the appropriate level of pensionable age; to provide for the production of a report on the recommendations of the Pensionable Age Task Force; to provide for the dissolution of that Pensionable Age Task Force and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Pensionable Age Task Force Bill 2019 this afternoon. This is not the Bill I wanted to introduce to the House. If Opposition Members were not limited in that no Bill brought forward can involve a cost, I would introduce a Bill that would seek to halt the pension age increases coming down the track. Instead, I am left with no option other than to take a roundabout way of doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> This Bill seeks the establishment of a pensionable age task force with the purpose of considering the appropriate level of pensionable age and to make recommendations to the Minister. Let us be very clear on three issues when it comes to increasing the State pension age. First, decisions on what age people qualify for the State pension should not be made based on cost-saving measures. Second, Ireland is going further and faster than all other EU countries when it comes to setting the pension age. Third, there are major implications for those contractually obliged to retire at 65 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> In 2021, the pension age will be 67 years. In 2028, it will again increase, this time to 68 years. These increases were decided without engagement with trade unions or groups representing older people or employers, without any debate in these Houses and without any consideration of the significant financial implications that increases to the pension age would have for retiring workers. Instead, the Government simply went ahead and implemented the changes. This should never have happened. These increases in pension age put Ireland on course to have the highest pension age in the OECD by 2028. In fact, we will have one of the highest State pension ages in the world despite the fact we currently have the second lowest pensioner-to-worker dependency ratio in the EU 27. This is something the Minister consistently denies yet it is quite clear when one looks at the projected pension age increases across the EU. In 2028, when Ireland would have a retirement age of 68 years, England will only be moving to 67 years, with plans to increase pension age there to 68 years in 2046, nearly 20 years after Ireland. Germany will increase pension age to 67 years but not until 2031. Belgium will increase pension age to 67 years but not until 2030. France will only be increasing pension age to 67 years in 2023. The list goes on and on.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> On the third issue, we are forcing retirees onto jobseeker payments. Workers contractually obliged to retire at 65, as well as workers physically unfit to continue in their job beyond 65, are forced to claim jobseeker’s benefit. The jobseeker’s benefit payment rate is €45.30 per week, or €2,355.60 per annum, less than a contributory State pension. Why should a person retiring at 65, who has worked his or her entire life, never having relied on social welfare, be forced to sign on to receive a jobseeker's payment for a year? The way in which the Government is bridging this gap leads to the question of how it intends to continue this if and when the pension age increases to 67 years the year after next. Will those retiring at 65 be forced onto a jobseeker's payment for two years? That would be a ludicrous situation, seen nowhere else in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> This Bill puts forward a sensible and very reasonable proposal to establish a task force, to allow it to engage with the experts and trade unions, listen to them and set the pension age based on that engagement and based on something more than saving money. I ask Members to support the Bill and to set up a task force to ensure we do what is right for today’s workers and future workers.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_366">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together. </p>
            <p eId="para_367"> I attended the summit between the European Union and the League of Arab States on 24 and 25 February in Sharm El-Sheikh. The purpose of the summit was to deepen and extend the partnership between the European Union and Arab countries, enabling us to tackle our many shared challenges more effectively. The summit was the first ever meeting between leaders from the two regions and marked an important milestone in our efforts to deepen the partnership. Stronger EU-Arab co-operation is required if we are to find effective and sustainable solutions to regional challenges such as migration, terrorism and radicalisation. It is also essential in countering the many threats to regional peace and security, including conflicts and humanitarian crises in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_368"> At the summit EU and Arab leaders agreed a joint political declaration which restated our commitment to resolving regional problems through a robust, rules based multilateral system. The declaration also included important commitments on promoting human rights, countering incitement to hatred, xenophobia and intolerance. It restated our shared position on issues including the Middle East peace process and nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> As well as participating in the summit, I had the opportunity to meet several Arab leaders, with whom I discussed bilateral relations and Ireland’s candidacy for the UN Security Council. I met the Egyptian President, the Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Saad El-Din Rafik Al-Hariri, the Deputy Prime Minister of Oman, the Foreign Minister of Jordan and the Emir of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. I also had a brief discussion with the Palestinian President, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas. I also took the opportunity to discuss EU matters, including Brexit, with my colleagues from the EU Council. I met the British Prime Minster, Mrs. Theresa May, and also spoke informally to Presidents Tusk and Juncker, as I did again at the European Council on 21 and 22 March in Brussels. I did not have specific meetings with Mr. Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, on either occasion, but I did have the opportunity to speak to him briefly on the margins of the EU-League of Arab States summit and at the European Council last week, as I did with many other heads of State and Government.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_258">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_370">In the dialogue with the League of Arab States was there any discussion on the use of Libya in dealing with the migrant crisis? There have been extraordinary revelations of human rights abuses in Libya. The European Union is funding the development and building of the Libyan coastguard to intercept potential migrants crossing the Mediterranean and repatriate or return them to unspeakable conditions in Libya. Was this matter discussed? Will there be EU oversight of the appalling human rights conditions and abuses in some of the holding centres in Libya?</p>
            <p eId="para_371"> Was the appalling and ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen discussed? Will there be concerted action on the part of the European Union to deal with the situation where Saudi Arabia, backed by a number of other Sunni Muslim governments, including Iran, is supporting militia in Yemen? The humanitarian cost of the conflict is an unspeakable tragedy. Will the European Union be taking any initiative to deal with it?</p>
            <p eId="para_372"> The United States recently issued a declaration endorsing the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in Syria. While I welcome the announcement made by the Tánaiste in that regard, will the Taoiseach clarify whether there will be a joint EU initiative on the matter?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_259">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_373">Brexit is dominating discussions here and at EU level, for obvious reasons, but it is important that we do not take our eye off the ball in dealing with a number of other issues. At the European Council summit to be held in Romania in May, a strategic agenda will be prepared for the period 2019 to 2024. What will Ireland's position be in that regard? The pre-Council statements to be made at the time will be very important in order that the Dáil will be fully informed of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> Earlier this month a vision for Europe was outlined by the French President, Mr. Macron, in an opinion piece published in the 28 EU member states. In it he seemed to be suggesting sovereignty should be pooled in new areas and that we should proceed with closer integration. What is Ireland's position on the vision set out by President Macron? While I accept that a more detailed answer is merited than time will permit, I ask the Taoiseach to give some indication of the Government's views. </p>
            <p eId="para_375"> On migration, the Taoiseach has mentioned that the aim of the summit was to improve the partnership between the European Union and the League of Arab States. Some nation states are struggling to promote democracy and economic development and climate change is a big issue for many of these states. It is right that the European Union support them. It is in its interest to do so from the point of view of dealing with migration, the root causes of which we must address. More than 1.5 million refugees came to the European Union from Syria in 2015 and other humanitarian crises have been unfolding since, as mentioned during the course of this discussion. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is important that Ireland play a role in resolving these issues at a humanitarian level?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_376">This time last year, just prior to Land Day, I warned the Taoiseach that the Israelis were preparing to attack the Great March of Return protests planned in Gaza. I do not think he even responded when I raised the issue. In advance of the protests I said it was likely that hundreds of Palestinians would be killed and that turned out to be the case. It is estimated that more than 200 Palestinians were killed and that a further 18,000 were injured. The conflict continued for months. Land Day is coming up at the end of this week and further protests are planned by the people of Gaza to vindicate their right under international law to return to the homes and villages from which they were expelled in 1948. Israel is already giving signs that it is going to do the same as it did last year. More innocent Palestinian blood will be shed as the Israelis seek to deny the Palestinians their rights under international law. At the same time, the US President, Mr. Donald Trump, in defiance of international law, has legitimised the illegal annexation by Israel of the Golan Heights, which is sovereign Syrian territory. Was there a discussion at the EU-Arab League summit on the likelihood of the conflict escalating into violence again because of the justified and legitimate protests by the people of Gaza to vindicate their rights? Was there a discussion on the behaviour of President Trump in legitimising the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and his systematic denial of Palestinian rights? Are the Irish Government and the European Union going to do anything more than they did last year about the likely killing of innocent Palestinians?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_377">As Deputy Haughey said, Brexit is raised in a later question and will also be discussed during statements later. Therefore, I will focus my attention on a number of other matters. </p>
            <p eId="para_378"> The Syrian conflict has had an impact on the Middle East which will last for many years and has directly led to the largest humanitarian emergency of our time. The Assad regime's brutal suppression of dissent and the added ferocity of attacks since Russia began to take a leading role have resulted in displacement which is causing immense hardship for the people involved and exerting real pressure on neighbouring countries. Was there any discussion on providing assistance for countries such as Jordan and Lebanon that host the largest refugee camps in the world and currently see no prospect of helping people to return home, given the attitude of the Syrian regime to its opponents?</p>
            <p eId="para_379">On the issue of the Mediterranean Sea, the Taoiseach will be aware of reports that the number of migrants attempting a crossing on both of the main routes are down on the historic highs, but they are rising again. There are obvious and dramatic failings in the response, particularly in relation to Libya, as Deputy Howlin has alluded to. Did the Taoiseach make any statement about how people are being treated by authorities in some European countries and by European Union funded agencies in North Africa in particular?</p>
            <p eId="para_380"> The move to a security alone approach, which is being pushed by some Governments under the influence of the hard right, is very dangerous. It remains the case that security and enforcement take up 70% of all European Union funding relating to migration and immigration. This means organisations that take the lead in supporting integration are left scrambling for funding and are less able to undertake the type of work that would reduce tensions and help migrants and their host countries. The future regulation and funding of this sector is currently being discussed at European Union level. Will the Taoiseach advocate for a greater emphasis on integration work?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_262">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_381">Since the Taoiseach's visit to the United States of America for St. Patrick's Day I think that President Trump has probably made one of the most profound and historic statements of his presidency so far in a very eye-catching period for his presidency when he made his statement on America's future approach to the Golan Heights. I assume that when the Taoiseach was in Egypt for the EU-Arab League summit, relationships between the EU and Israel must have been discussed at length, and also the relationship of the EU and the Palestinian people. I would like to know the Taoiseach's reaction, speaking on behalf of the Irish Government, to the statement by President Trump. It is certainly an extraordinarily historic move by the Americans and is an area into which they have not previously gone. The statement has come days before an Israeli election. Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss this with his EU counterparts? More importantly, what is the Government's view and what is the Taoiseach's view of what President Trump has done?</p>
            <p eId="para_382"> With regard to the summit at Sharm El-Sheikh, did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to discuss climate change? Each Deputy who has spoken here so far has referred to various dreadful conflicts in different parts of the Mediterranean. Many of these conflicts have come about partly due to the severity of climate change affecting much of Africa, including north Africa. In particular, Mozambique and southern African countries are experiencing the aftermaths of a ferocious storm that has caused massive loss of human life. I do not know at this stage if Irish Aid has formally rendered assistance. I am aware that many of the Irish aid agencies have done so and I commend the Irish aid agencies for the help they are giving to southern Africa in the aftermath of this incredible storm. It has been a bigger storm than any recorded previously in that part of Africa. I relate the two because climate change in terms of wars over resources such as water and carbon resources-----</p>

Both of those acts are unnecessary, dangerous and inflammatory. I acknowledge the response by the Tánaiste but I also want to hear the Taoiseach's response. Is there an agreed EU-wide position on the annexation of the Golan Heights statement and acceptance of that by the US President?

            <p eId="para_397">Ireland has a special interest in this because I understand that our troops are still in the Golan. It is a particularly difficult mission in a precarious place. It is frustrating that in the ongoing debates on the issue of Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza, and on the wider issues in the region, we are constantly told that we must stick with the current policy and it will work when clearly these sorts of developments show that EU and Irish policies need to change. I put it to the Taoiseach that we cannot just sit by and watch the US Administration making changes such as recognising Jerusalem through moving the US embassy there and supporting the complete annexation of the Golan Heights. At some point the European Union must respond and Ireland should have a strong voice in promoting such an approach.</p>

We were very keen that the relationship between the EU and the countries of the Arab League should not all be about migration. A decision was taken to focus on other issues also.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> Land aid was not discussed but there was very strong recognition from Arab states of Ireland's work at the UN and elsewhere in our support for Palestinians, of the role we play in south Lebanon and in other places, and of the funding we provide to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA. There is very strong recognition from Arab countries that Ireland has been supportive, among EU countries, of the Palestinian cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_401"> Yemen was discussed, climate change was discussed and human rights were certainly raised by me and by others: human rights of women, LGBT citizens, individual liberty, democracy and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> The nature of the event was that there was a lot of discussion and views but very little interaction. It was the first time such a summit has been done. There were roughly 50 heads of state and government present and it was one of those events where people were giving their views and statements but not so much interaction - there were no working groups, for example. It was an opportunity to do this. It was the first time it had been done and we will do it again with the EU and the Arab League. It was also a good opportunity for some bilateral meetings, as these events often are.</p>
            <p eId="para_403"> Ireland does not recognise Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights and it never has. We disagree with the US Administration's decision to do so. I understand that there is no joint EU position on the matter, but that may follow. This would happen at the Foreign Affairs Council or at the European Council. Because it falls under the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions, one would have to have unanimity or near unanimity to do so. One of the flaws in the Common Foreign and Security Policy is that it is not done by qualified majority voting and where there is no unanimity or consensus the European Union cannot take a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_404">Moving to qualified majority voting, however, may mean that on occasion we could end up on the wrong side of a decision, which is something we will have to consider into the future. If we want a strong European Union which can take foreign policy decisions, a consequence is that we may on occasion find ourselves being outvoted on some of those decisions. We cannot keep calling for Europe to act together more on foreign policy issues if we do not enable it to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> Deputy Haughey asked a very pertinent question on the Government's view on the future of Europe and the debate in that regard. We must prepare a policy statement on that. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has led a public consultation on the matter, and post Brexit, or post this phase of it, we should provide that statement and debate it in the Dáil. Our working position is that we support further enlargement, the capital markets union for the deepening of the Single Market, the digital Single Market and banking union, and we want to see the delivery of the social Europe agenda based on the Gothenburg declaration. However, we do not support a European army or, at least, would not participate in one nor do we support tax harmonisation. However, that is far too simplistic and probably deserves a more detailed policy statement once we get through our current difficulties on European policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> I was asked to comment on populism but I am not sure I can do it in a minute and a half. However, I can say that I do not like it. Populism has three essential elements. These are the idea that there is a division between the elites and the people and that only populists can represent the people; the proposal of easy solutions, which do not work, to complex and difficult problems, and the demonisation of opponents. In Ireland, we see left-wing populism to the fore rather than the right-wing populism one tends to see in other countries. I see the elements of populism mentioned much more frequently on the far left in Ireland. They claim it is the elites versus the people and that only they can represent the people. There is demonisation of opponents and simple solutions that do not work are proposed. That is very much a feature of far-left politics in Ireland whereas we do not really have far-right politics here. I hope we never do.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> I was asked about Prime Minister Orbán and Fidesz. Obviously, that is a party matter but Fidesz has now been suspended from the EPP. That may result in expulsion down the line or in them rejoining. It will depend on whether the party satisfies the criteria set down and whether the three wise men who have been appointed to analyse whether it has are satisfied. The EPP is an umbrella group and every group includes parties that need further scrutiny. We have now acted. The Party of European Socialists must now consider the situation in Romania where a government led by social democrats has serious corruption issues which are under examination by the European Commission. The Party of European Socialists must also consider the situation in Britain and the increasingly Eurosceptic-led Labour Party which has serious issues around anti-Semitism to the extent that Jewish Members of Parliament are resigning.</p>

            <p eId="para_430">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> There is only one public consultation currently planned by my Department in 2019 and it relates to the Government's annual national risk assessment. Given that my Department is largely concerned with co-ordination across Departments, it does not generally hold a significant number of public consultations on specific policy issues. However, while no other public consultations are currently planned in 2019, it is, of course, possible that this may change during the course of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_432"> It is intended to launch the public consultation planned as part of the annual national risk assessment in quarter 2 to help inform development of the annual national risk assessment report, which is generally published by July. The national risk assessment is an annual exercise which aims to ensure a broad-based and inclusive debate on the strategic risks facing the country. One of the lessons of the recent crisis is that Government did not pay enough attention to dissenting opinions. As such, the national risk assessment provides an opportunity for an open and inclusive conversation on the risks we face. This will be the sixth year the Government has produced the national risk assessment and the process has highlighted important issues since the first report was published in 2014, including one of the earliest official acknowledgments of the risks arising from a potential Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> The development of the 2019 national risk assessment is at an early stage. In addition to interdepartmental and public consultation, my Department plans to hold an open policy seminar in quarter 2. All of these elements will inform the final report, which, as I mentioned, is generally published by July.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">Last year, the Taoiseach organised a public consultation on a new national online strategy. In early March, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment announced that he would belatedly introduce legislation to appoint an online safety commissioner. This is something we support and it will be welcomed by organisations like CyberSafeIreland, the ISPCC and the Ombudsman for Children who have been calling for a commission for some time.

            <p eId="para_436">I suggest that the Taoiseach holds a public consultation on the role of local government. There was a very good presentation today by a number of trade unions organising members in local authorities. It pointed out that we are at the absolute bottom of the European league table in terms of services provided by local authorities, the level of funding local government gets, and the extent to which services that should be delivered by local authorities have been centralised or outsourced and privatised with damaging consequences. If we want to reinvigorate local government and local democracy, we should seriously consider a consultation on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_437">There are a number of public consultations to discuss, but to keep it to 30 seconds I will ask about only one which is very important due to its imminence. The Taoiseach's Department has carried out a consultation on online political advertising. We are now facing into local and European elections and will probably have a general election in a number of months. It is very important to preserve the integrity of our electoral system. The submissions phase of the consultation closed last October and an open forum was apparently held in December. What were the conclusions and how are we going to ensure there is no external interference with our election process in the next eight weeks as we face into local and European elections?</p>

Does the Taoiseach's office propose to have a framework of some kind for public consultations whereby people would be genuinely consulted and listened to on a plethora of issues?</p>

            <p eId="para_441">Absolutely. For most people, the Government's definition of "public consultation" is a marketing campaign where people are invited to listen to presentations on how great the latest action plan is. Given the scale of increased spending last year on advertising and the promotion of the politically determined priorities of the Government, such as the children's hospital, has any work been done to check public reaction to the spending? Last year, the children's hospital, rural broadband and the full Dublin metro were promoted by the Government based on plans, costs and designs which have subsequently changed radically or been abandoned.</p>

            <p eId="para_453">The original MetroLink proposal has been changed because of very strong representations on behalf of Na Fianna from not just me but other political leaders. Accommodations have been made with regard to Ballymun Kickhams and changes have been made in respect of Ranelagh. That is an example of public consultation that was genuine. The NTA went to the public with the plan, listened to people and then changed it. I am sure the same will happen with BusConnects. People's views will be listened to and changes will be made. That is how democracy is supposed to work. I am not sure what the alternative is. Is it not to have any public consultations or to have them and then ignore the people? That is certainly not the model of government I would propose.</p>

            <p eId="para_465"> I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May on the margins of the European Council on 21 March at which we discussed the current state of play with Brexit. The Prime Minister outlined the approach she planned to take at the European Council meeting. Prime Minister May explained that she was seeking an extension of the Article 50 deadline until 30 June, which she hoped would provide sufficient time for her to secure agreement and to complete the legislative arrangements needed to implement it in the UK. I reiterated our wish to see the withdrawal agreement ratified so negotiations on a close, comprehensive and ambitious future relationship between the EU and the UK can start. I also made it clear that we are sympathetic to the case for an extension.</p>
            <p eId="para_466"> Members will be aware that the European Council, after some discussion, agreed to an extension until 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons this week. Absent that approval, an extension to 12 April was agreed, by which date the UK would be expected to bring forward alternative proposals and give an indication as to whether it intends to take part in the European elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> I continue to believe that approval of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland, is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border on our island. I was pleased to have the continued backing of my fellow European Council members on this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> For completeness, I should add that I met the Prime Minister on the margins of the EU-Arab League summit in Egypt on Monday, 25 February.</p>

            <p eId="para_469">Before addressing the wider issue, will the Taoiseach say when we will receive the assessment of no-deal preparedness levels and updates on business preparedness, which he promised me three weeks ago?</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Yesterday, the Taoiseach continued his strategy of aggressive partisanship relating to Brexit, which drove much of his behaviour in trying to bring down his Government last year and was a defining feature of the Fine Gael event last weekend. He has aggressively attacked anybody who has challenged him to be open with the Irish public about what is being planned. Trading on the understandable focus on the national interest by the media and others, the Taoiseach has been desperate to try to paint others as up to no good. Now he has gone even further and said that it is a conspiracy theory to suggest that anything has been discussed about what would happen at the Border if there was a no-deal scenario. Anybody who raises what was discussed is engaging in conspiracy theories, yet the Taoiseach has been forced to admit on the record of the House that talks with the Commission have been happening at official level. He went on to say yesterday that there are no papers or documents and there is nothing to share. For months he has said there are no talks and that it will only be necessary to have talks if there is no deal, but now he admits there are talks and expects us to believe that these talks are taking place without anybody saying or sharing anything.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> Businesses throughout the country are desperate to know what scenarios to plan for, and the Irish people have a right to know what is being discussed. Every country in Europe, except Ireland, has informed its people what will happen if there is no deal. Will the Taoiseach confirm what he said yesterday, that while talks are being held with the Commission, these talks are without papers or documents and nothing has been discussed that needs to be shared? What instruction, if any, has been given to officials for these discussions?</p>

            <p eId="para_474">-----and we do not know how it will conclude or whether through a series of indicative votes we will get any clarity to replace the chaos we have seen over recent years. There is a withdrawal agreement in place and there is still a possibility that Theresa May will put it to the House of Commons at some stage and get it passed, but it is also possible that she will not. If she does not and through a series of indicative votes there is some proposition relating to a softer Brexit, a customs arrangement, a Norway plus arrangement or the like, how much clarity on that will be necessary, from the Taoiseach's understanding of the European Union's perspective, to enable a long extension to occur? What we must avoid is a further nine months, year or two years of more uncertainty, more game playing and more unreasonable and unworkable solutions being put on the table by politicians in Britain. We must get to a point where businesses, farmers and citizens on the island of Ireland and across the European Union have some certainty about what is going to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> The Taoiseach said that his comments in the past regarding a no-deal scenario and what would happen at the Border have been taken out of context by politicians in Westminster. Perhaps he will take this opportunity to make it clear that if there is a hard crash, it will be a disaster for the Border and for Ireland and that while some solution will have to be put in place through a negotiation between the British Government and the European Union, it would fall far short of the protections the backstop currently provides.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">Obviously we hope that a deal might be done to resolve this matter, but we do not know if it will be done. Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with Theresa May about her view of what Britain intends to do in the event of no deal? The Taoiseach has said he is not making preparations. I welcome that because he should not. I am not so sure about the EU's intentions in that regard if there is no deal given its desire to protect the Single Market. Did he have discussions with Theresa May on what Britain is planning for the Border if there is no deal?</p>
            <p eId="para_477"> The other matter I wish to raise has particular pertinence given the possibility that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his gang might throw the DUP under the bus, as it were, and that their solidarity with the DUP might disappear for their own parochial English reasons. Is it not time, as Professor Colin Harvey and others are saying today, to point out that the single lesson from this debacle is that it does not make sense to have administrative, political or economic divergence between two parts of this island and that it is time to open a discussion on a united Ireland in a serious way?</p>

            <p eId="para_480">For some time now, the Taoiseach has been exhorting us all to be very careful in what we say and the language we use about the ongoing discussions in the British Parliament, yet today he gratuitously had a go at the British Labour Party, the votes of which will be pivotal in deciding the outcome. I put it down to a lack of experience, but it was very unhelpful. The British Labour Party has announced that in the indicative votes it will be whipping its Members to support the holding of a second referendum. That is in Ireland's interests in that it could help to reverse the situation. For Prime Minister May's deal to be passed, it will need a substantial number of Labour Party Member votes. The Taoiseach's reference to anti-Semitism and so on runs counter to the sensitivities he implores everybody else to have regard to in the ongoing discussions happening in the United Kingdom. It seems that there are parallel processes. For instance, there is the preferendum in the multi-choice ballot Members will have. This morning I asked a question of the Tánaiste who indicated to me that, as far as he was aware, the Theresa May deal was not one of the options being put; therefore, there will be a twin-track approach, whereby the Prime Minister will try to build support for her deal separate from it. As I said, if there is not to be a second referendum, in my judgment, it would be a better outcome for us. The most recent opinion poll yesterday showed that 54% of people in the United Kingdom - it is not a huge majority, but it is still a majority - would like to remain part of the European Union. We need to be careful to ensure we will not allow a situation to occur such that there will be a fall-out in a disorderly way. The Tánaiste also promised this morning to brief privately the parties represented in this House on preparations. Will that happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_483">I do not think those concerns should be dismissed. They were sufficient to cause Jewish MPs to resign from that party, or at least it was among the reasons people like Luciana Berger and others gave. There are sufficient concerns for the Board of Guardians and the Council of Guardians that represent Jewish people in Britain. Deputy Howlin is right that the support of Labour Party MPs, or at least their goodwill, may well be needed in the votes that will take place in the House of Commons. The goodwill of Fidesz MEPs may also be needed in the votes that will take place in the European Parliament or at the European Council which, of course, have to be unanimous when it comes to a Brexit date extension. I am aware of this, but I do not think it is a good enough reason to turn a blind eye to anti-Semitism or issues surrounding the rule of law.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_359">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_511">I attended a series of meetings of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, 21 and 22 March. Our discussions on Brexit took place on the Thursday, first with Prime Minister May and, subsequently, in Article 50 format without her. On the Friday we met the Prime Ministers of Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The regular meeting of the European Council then took place to discuss issues related to jobs, growth and competitiveness, as well as external relations, particularly with China, and our ongoing efforts to combat disinformation and election interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> I attended two preparatory meetings, the first being the EPP summit which was attended by President Juncker, Chancellor Merkel and Chancellor Kurz, among others. In advance of the first session on the Thursday, I attended, for the second time, a Nordic-Baltic group meeting, with Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands. The group includes Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and on many issues across the EU agenda we are of like mind. It is a very useful opportunity to strengthen our co-ordination in this way, particularly as we look towards a post-Brexit future. I also had a short bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May on the Thursday afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> I will focus in my remarks on Brexit and also outline our discussions on jobs, growth and competitiveness, climate change and relations with China. The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will speak about the other external relations items discussed, as well as our efforts to combat disinformation and secure free and fair elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> Brexit was the main focus of the European Council. Our discussions began on the Thursday afternoon with an exchange with Prime Minister May. She made two main requests, including for a formal endorsement of the agreements reached at Strasbourg the previous week and for Article 50 to be extended until 30 June. We listened very carefully to her and used the opportunity to discuss recent developments in London and her intentions in the period ahead. I had discussed these issues with her during our bilateral meeting earlier that afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The 27 EU leaders then had a detailed and constructive discussion on the best way forward. As one would expect, there were different views on how best to achieve the right outcome, but there was overwhelming consensus on our shared objectives and priorities. We stayed firm in our view that there could be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, and that any unilateral commitment the United Kingdom might make needed to be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the agreement. We endorsed the two documents agreed by Prime Minister May and President Juncker in Strasbourg on 11 March which provided further reassurances for the United Kingdom. We also agreed to extend Article 50 until 22 May, if the withdrawal agreement is approved at Westminster this week. If it is not, we agreed to extend Article 50 until 12 April, an important date in the context of the European Parliament elections. The United Kingdom has to indicate an alternative way forward before this date, which would then have to be considered by the European Council. The United Kingdom now has a short space in which either to endorse the withdrawal agreement, which is still our preferred outcome, or to present a credible alternative way ahead. We always said the joint political declaration on the framework for the future relationship could be amended, for example, if the United Kingdom were to decide to stay in the customs union, align itself closely with the Single Market or join the European economic area, EEA. Today, the responsibility lies in London with the UK Government and MPs at Westminster. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the European Union, a no-deal outcome is a real possibility. Therefore, the European Council also agreed that contingency planning and preparations should continue at both EU and domestic level for all scenarios.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> From Ireland’s perspective, we have been working intensively to prepare for all eventualities, including a no-deal scenario. The Brexit omnibus Bill was enacted last week and other initiatives to prepare ports and airports and help business are well under way. A no-deal outcome would cause serious disruption for Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union. We will be as ready as we can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">However, as I said over the weekend, Brexit will define and consume the UK for many years to come but it will not define us. We are in control of our destiny, and have the power to build a better future for all of our citizens, and that is what we will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Turning to other issues, we met the leaders of Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein on Friday morning, and marked the 25th anniversary of the European Economic Area. This partnership demonstrates the flexibility of the European project and the European family. These three countries are outside the EU but still participate in the Single Market, a reminder that it is possible to create forms of mutually beneficial co-operation with non-member countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_519"> EU leaders then met the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi. He outlined his views on the current economic outlook, and we discussed how best to prepare the EU for increasing global economic competition, including by strengthening the Single Market, a policy Ireland strongly supports. The European Council called on the Commission to present a long-term vision for the EU’s industrial future by the end of this year. We also said that we would continue to update our European competition framework to take account of new technological and global market developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> On trade, we said that the EU should continue to push for an ambitious and balanced trade agenda through the conclusion of new free trade agreements, promoting EU values and standards and ensuring a level playing field with more choice and better value for consumers. On climate change, we reiterated our commitment to the Paris Agreement and emphasised the importance of the EU submitting an ambitious long-term strategy by 2020. We will return to this issue in June. </p>
          <p eId="para_521"> We formally appointed Philip Lane to the six-person executive board of the European Central Bank as its chief economist. He is the first Irish citizen to be appointed to such a position. He is an outstanding economist, and I am confident that he will make a contribution at the ECB. </p>
          <p eId="para_522"> We also had a good discussion on our priorities for the EU-China summit on 9 April, and our overall relations with China in the global context, including on issues relating to trade and industrial policy, human rights and competition. The upcoming summit is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to co-operating closely with China within the existing rules-based international order and multilateral institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, will report on the other issues we discussed in her wrap-up remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> In addition to participating in the formal discussions over the course of the two days, I also engaged informally with many of my EU counterparts in the margins of the meetings, using the opportunity, as I always do, to promote Irish interests. While Brexit is still a priority, it is important that we also play an active role in shaping our future as we move towards a Union of 27 member states.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_525">Two days before the date on which Brexit was scheduled to take place, it has been delayed. This is undeniably good news. There is more time to try to ratify the withdrawal agreement and its essential transition period and even more importantly, there is some prospect that a move towards a less damaging Brexit will be supported by the House of Commons.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Today’s votes in Westminster will not bring finality and they may not even bring clarity as to what will happen, but the combination of these votes and last weekend’s march in London have put the focus back on where it should always have been, which is the permanent relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The chaos in British politics which has been caused by the negative and destructive agenda of the fanatical anti-European Union fringe is a tragedy. In a short period relationships of trust and co-operation built up over decades have been smashed. The deep and sincere attachment to a shared European identity felt by those who marched on Saturday and the millions who stand behind them is something we should never forget, and it should always remind us that anger with a political elite should never be allowed to stand in the way of solidarity with those who are still, at least for a short time, our fellow European Union citizens. </p>
          <p eId="para_527"> The outcome of the summit was a reasonable compromise driven by the sincere commitment to avoiding a no-deal scenario by key European leaders. I wish to acknowledge the continued interest and support for Ireland I found during the meeting of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, leaders on Thursday, and indeed their understanding that frustration with the British Government was no justification for being inflexible. Yesterday the Taoiseach came up with the entirely novel argument - for him - that he would never divulge anything discussed at a Council meeting. Anyone who takes the time to review the coverage of past Council meetings will find the Irish media full of accounts of who said what – accounts clearly coming directly from an Irish perspective. </p>

          <p eId="para_529">Equally, he has had no difficulty in the past in going into some detail when discussing the Council with the Dáil. Of course, the point is that the Government has no difficulty briefing on matters which it believes might reflect well on it and clams up when any information might be challenging. This is, after all, a Government which had no problem spending much of last year promoting a project while at least one member of the Government already knew it was massively over budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> According to accounts in a range of European media outlets, direct questions were put to the Taoiseach about Ireland’s policy towards a no-deal scenario and what Ireland was prepared for. The fact that no such information appeared in the Irish media confirms that the Taoiseach and his staff decided not to brief on this. This is the first time in seven years that Ireland was a substantive topic of conversation at a Council and our Government has refused to detail the conversation. </p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The Taoiseach will remember that his predecessor had no difficulty describing his exchanges with the German Chancellor and French President, and the Taoiseach himself has repeatedly characterised and explained what has been said. Why this matters is that the refusal to share basic information or to allow an informed debate means that the levels of uncertainty here are high and rising all the time. Every day, Members of this House meet business owners desperate to know what they need to do under different scenarios, yet nothing is being clarified. </p>
          <p eId="para_532"> For the past year the position of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste has been that the North-South Border under a no-deal scenario would be discussed only if it arose, that nothing was being contemplated and that it both threatened a hard border and there would under no circumstances be a hardening of the Border. Yesterday, for the first time the Taoiseach stated that there had been discussions. On Leaders’ Questions he stated “Talks with the Commission have been happening at official level”. An hour later, during Taoiseach’s Questions, he said, “I am sure there have been discussions about what might be done” and that they are “preliminary discussions”. Yet the Taoiseach then went on to make the extraordinary claims that even though there are discussions “there is nothing to share”, and, “there are no papers or documents”. Using his new favourite political attack, he then said it was a conspiracy theory to say that anything was discussed or to question the idea that there could be meetings without papers or documents. This is his equivalent of the Trumpian habit of attacking any inconvenient question as fake news. From December 2017, it has been Fine Gael strategy to try to engineer an election where the party could try to present Brexit as a defining division between the parties. </p>

          <p eId="para_535">Last year, ours was the only government in Europe seeking to promote its own instability and last weekend we saw this cynicism enter a new phase. The Taoiseach should remember that he has been handed a unique situation of guaranteed stability through Brexit. All Opposition parties have held back in Brexit-related debates even in the face of extraordinary provocation, such as the habit of members of the Government to claim that even the mildest challenge is against the national interest. Fianna Fáil took a decision not to use the demonstrable failures of the Government in critical issues like health and housing to force an election during these critical months and has lobbied extensively in Europe to promote the idea of a secure national consensus on Brexit even though we have very significant issues with the approach the Government has taken. I refer especially to its refusal to advocate special status for Northern Ireland in 2017 and the enormously damaging campaign of messianic self-regard in which the Taoiseach and many party members have engaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> This nonsense and partisan posturing has to stop. We need basic transparency about what is being discussed. The situation at the moment is that if the withdrawal agreement is ratified, and its prospects are improving by the day, then Ireland will have a legal obligation, with the European Union, to offer credible proposals to whatever the United Kingdom proposes for the Border. In fact, the backstop is only guaranteed if the EU meets the requirement to negotiate in good faith, so the position of the Taoiseach, that no proposals should be made, becomes irrelevant on the day the withdrawal agreement is ratified. The only change since November has been a legally relevant assertion by the EU that the backstop is intended to be temporary and that the EU will negotiate in good faith and quickly to find an alternative long-term arrangement. The withdrawal agreement, if ratified, is not the end of Brexit. It is the opening of a new phase of Brexit. </p>
          <p eId="para_537"> When it comes to the Border, the hard work will actually only begin once the agreement is in place. We need a bit more openness and a lot less partisan positioning. We must also constantly remind ourselves that Northern Ireland’s positioning has been dramatically weakened by the absence of the Assembly, a body collapsed two years ago because of a heating scheme which was already reformed and appears to have lost nothing like the amounts claimed at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">At a time when Northern Ireland most needed a voice, this voice was taken away and the damage gets worse by the day. It was confirmed in Westminster this week that the United Kingdom Government is considering imposing direct rule in Northern Ireland. Why have we received no details about this? At a moment when the entire Good Friday Agreement is under threat, the impasse in Northern Ireland and the lack of basic co-operation between the two Governments is about more than just Brexit. If we truly want to protect the Good Friday Agreement, we have to understand that Brexit is only one threat among many, which need to receive proper attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Brexit will not be complete on 12 April, 22 May or any other date announced for a withdrawal agreement to come into effect. It will go on for a number of years at least and its long-term impact on Ireland will be permanent. We need to widen our focus and start paying much more attention to the fundamental challenges facing communities and businesses throughout our country. We have to show much greater urgency in trying to revive contacts and practices which delivered peace on this island but which have been undeniably undermined in recent years.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_366">

          <p eId="para_540">It is an incredible achievement by Deputy Micheál Martin that he could read that speech with a straight face. There remains massive uncertainty surrounding Brexit. We are just under 60 hours from the original deadline but the House of Commons is only now starting the process of deciding what type of Brexit it wants. It will not decide today which option to choose but rather will merely vote on a range of options. It is incredible that we are in this space today. Although a hard crash is the most unlikely outcome, it remains an outcome in which we could find ourselves because of the lack of solutions coming from Westminster. It is also possible that Britain could instead end up with a long extension to allow it to do what it should have done two years ago, namely, decide for itself what Brexit means. It is incredible that two years later, following all the negotiations and having negotiated a withdrawal agreement, Westminster still does not know what Brexit means, and a series of indicative votes that may provide some way forward will take place today.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The reality is that there will be more uncertainty, which is why we in Sinn Féin hoped for a deal and hoped that the withdrawal agreement would be passed. We need to remove the uncertainty that has existed since Brexit was made a reality for us more than two years ago. The uncertainty affects businesses, farmers, citizens, people who use the all-island economy, people who are involved in transport and logistics, people who use the Border for commerce and travel and many other people throughout the island of Ireland. We know that the Government's plan in the event of a hard Brexit is to implement the omnibus Bill that was passed to support different sections of the economy. We in Sinn Féin, however, believe that the Government should go further and, whether there is a hard or soft Brexit, we have called for more contingencies, investments in the economy, supports for small and medium-sized enterprises and a Brexit stabilisation fund of €2 billion. The Tánaiste has stated in previous debates on the issue that if there was a hard crash, the Government would consider such a proposition and borrow money if necessary to ensure that the proper investments were made. Notwithstanding what might emerge from Westminster or that at the end of a long two-year extension we could face either Britain staying in the European Union or a softer Brexit, there remains much uncertainty and we are putting off the inevitable in respect of what the eventual agreement will be. That will create problems through the currency fluctuations that affect many businesses, exporters and others in the agrifood sector, who need supports now. The Tánaiste has put that on the record, which I welcome. I accept that some of the Taoiseach's comments on the Border can, and will, be taken out of context by people in Westminster who wish to undermine the backstop.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> The United Kingdom cannot take an <i>à la carte</i> approach to the Single Market or just take a decision to opt into it. If there is a hard crash, and if the North leaves the customs union and Single Market, the rules of the Single Market will have to be protected. That is legally the case. it cannot be opted out of. The Single Market is a legal mechanism and legal protections are built into it to ensure that the integrity of it, that is, of the Common Market or Internal Market, is protected. That will mean some form of checks and disruption, and we need to be honest with people, especially those in Westminster who believe that such checks would be a substitute for the backstop. They cannot be because the backstop ensures that the North of Ireland will remain in the customs union and elements of the Single Market to protect the all-island economy. Anything short of that is a disaster, a step backwards for the people of this island and in contravention of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">With every passing day, we lurch closer to a British exit from the European Union without a deal that safeguards the interests of Ireland North and South. That is not something which anyone in the House wishes to see because we all know the dire consequences that it would entail, namely, the return of a hard border, severe economic difficulties on both parts of our island, the erosion of the Good Friday Agreement and the weakening of citizens' rights. Despite nobody in the House desiring such an outcome, however, it is regrettably a real and distinct possibility which we must face up to. It may well happen by accident or design. Instead of staring blindly into the abyss, I challenge the Taoiseach to look beyond it and stand up and be counted as a Taoiseach for the whole island of Ireland. Will he state loudly and clearly that if a no-deal Brexit happens, he will put forward the case for Irish unity? Will he state he will call on the British Government to take the only step it should in that scenario, namely, put the constitutional future of the North to the people in a referendum? If the people of our island are to be disregarded and have their futures upended by a political establishment in Britain that does not care for them, they must have their say.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> In a series of polls, a majority in the North have indicated that in a no-deal scenario, they would vote for a united Ireland, while polls indicate a similar sentiment in this part of our island. It is time for the Taoiseach to grasp the gravity of that and articulate that he, too, would like to see a unity referendum held in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It is a more than reasonable proposition which all of us in the House should support and there is sound rationale for so doing. In 2017, the European Council agreed that our entire island would be afforded membership of the EU in the event of national reunification. While none of us wants a no-deal situation to transpire, if that is not possible, a referendum on Irish unity, which is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, must be called as the only sensible, logical and rational response which could provide a pathway for the entire island, North and South, to retain membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> This conversation is happening anyway, regardless of Brexit. The great upheaval, however, that a crash out will cause could well be the catalyst that accelerates the demand for Irish unity throughout our island, and we need to be prepared for that. We are already behind the curve in respect of preparing to facilitate constitutional and political change, but there is an imperative for such preparation. A momentum is building, as can be seen every day by anybody who has any inkling of what is happening in the North of our island. It is building for Irish unity and we need institutional and legislative arrangements in place to manage that change. The Taoiseach and his Government need to prepare for change and that preparation should include convening an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity without delay, deal or no deal. The onus on the Government must always be to defend and promote an all-Ireland view.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I appeal to the Taoiseach to say that if a no-deal Brexit transpires, he will call on the British Government to hold a referendum on Irish unity in the North. I call on him to say that he will organise a referendum on Irish unity in this State in line with the provisions set out in the Good Friday Agreement. There is nothing radical about what I am asking the Taoiseach. A referendum on unity is expressly provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. It is an agreement that was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of our island, North and South, over 20 years ago. Instead of staying silent on this issue, defending the agreement and doing right by it in a no-deal scenario requires sticking with the agreement and its provisions. It must be our ultimate backstop and our mission statement in finding a way forward for our country where all 32 counties will be respected and can stay within the European Union if a no-deal Brexit transpires. That means that a referendum on Irish unity needs to be held and an all-Ireland forum on Irish unity needs to be convened without delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">When it comes to our statements on EU Council business, we might be better served in this House by having separate Brexit statements and statements on the actual business of the EU Council. Naturally, we all have a significant interest in the latest Brexit developments. We have to keep one eye on our phones because the landscape changes with such alacrity and regularity. It is equally important to keep up to date with a number of important policy developments that are taking shape at EU level. Our understandable focus on the impact of Brexit on Ireland has often diminished our focus on other fundamentally important issues that are happening in the European context. We may need to have separate time to debate these issues, which I think the Taoiseach has acknowledged previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> With that in mind, and having regard to the other opportunities we have to speak on Brexit, I will make a few remarks on Brexit developments before I focus on other EU policy issues. We are, as other speakers have said, facing a very real prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Hopefully we can still avoid that. As I have said before, we need to keep our focus on the long-term goal of ensuring no hard border on this island. That has been the consensus in this House from day one. With the fear of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, there will be pressure from business when we come to the last minute to allow some level of border infrastructure in order to minimise the disruption of trade and commerce. We should not do that. If we allow any border infrastructure after a no-deal Brexit, whatever we allow to be put in place will be there forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> We need to hold the British Government to its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. It has said that it wants to retain an open border, and that commitment still applies whether the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal. Its solemn international commitment to the Good Friday Agreement endures. The Government cannot allow any future EU-UK trade deal to be agreed if that long-term relationship does not include an open border on the island of Ireland. In the meantime, the UK can and must choose trade policies that eliminate the need for a hard border. In that context, we in the Labour Party support the Government's continued insistence that there can be no return of the old borders of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> We already have a form of non-physical border control in some specific areas and it is important to talk about these technicalities. People from outside of the European Union need permission to enter this State. Someone from outside the EU could be legally visiting or resident in the UK and he or she could walk across the Irish Border but that would be unlawful, and just like many other breaches of the law, we enforce it through the normal operation of An Garda Síochána and the public agencies that we charge to do that job. Similarly, we continue to control the movement of diesel fuel across our Border. Fuel transports must be registered and we have a system of administrative controls and checks to ensure that those systems work. I cannot imagine that we cannot deal with these matters but I am mindful of the point that the Taoiseach has repeatedly made and that the Tánaiste made again today, that there are Brexiteers who would immediately seize upon the points that I am making to claim that this means we could use some form of administrative controls to maintain an open border even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. We need to be clear that the answer to that is, emphatically, no. We do not have technological solutions to cover the movement of livestock, the quality standards of food and consumer goods, and so on, let alone trans-border services.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The rules of the Single Market and customs union exist to allow trade to be as free as possible and we should not accept anything less when it comes to continued open trade on the island of Ireland, in line with the hard-won, hard-fought, hard-negotiated and publicly endorsed principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Meanwhile, when it comes to east-west trade between Ireland and Britain, we know that any kind of Brexit will be harmful to levels of trade. To be clear on the threat to jobs, the ESRI report from this week claims 80,000 fewer jobs would be created in the coming years in a no-deal scenario. That is one problem but there is no doubt that there is a serious threat to current jobs should our access to the British market for beef, dairy or other products be affected by tariffs or other barriers to the free trade that we now enjoy. Euro-pound exchange rates risk becoming less stable, which is bad for businesses. Their ability to plan and to make long-term investments would be compromised. Imports from the UK may become more expensive due to time delays, tariffs or more paperwork. All of these things pose a threat to thousands of jobs. Notwithstanding that reality, we made a conscious decision as a Parliament and a people in the Brexit negotiations to make only one red line for Ireland. Alongside that, as we come to the finale of the Brexit process, we also want open trade on an east-west basis and we should not be shy about promoting the closest possible trade with the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> In the time I have remaining, I want to make some comments on the direction that the EU is now taking based on the other matters discussed at the most recent Council. I warmly welcome the fact that the European Council has reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement and all the climate change targets. It is particularly timely, given that the all-party Joint Committee on Climate Action will hopefully be reporting tomorrow on how we can make real changes to reduce Ireland's emissions from 60 million tonnes of greenhouse gases today to 33 million tonnes by 2030 and effectively to reach zero emissions by 2050. This is effectively the 60 million tonne challenge and it is incumbent on all of us to study the details of the report to be published and all of its recommendations to see how we can ensure that future generations are well-served by this generation and those targets are achieved. I note that the EU will have its ambitious long-term strategy for climate neutrality and we have to be serious about ensuring that its Irish component will achieve our part of those targets because failure to do so is frankly not an option.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I would like to mention the tripartite social summit that took place in advance of the EU Council meeting. The summit discussed new ways to strengthen social dialogue within the EU. Will the Government comment on the extent to which its deliberations informed the council's conclusions? I would like to hear the Government's view on how we can improve collective bargaining rights for workers in this country and across the Union, and strengthen social dialogue on the future of our economy. Labour is also pleased to see the creation of a new European labour authority. I note that member states may not be required to work with the authority as I understand that it will be introduced on a voluntary basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The Minister of State, in her response, might make it clear that we are committed to working within the guidelines and recommendations of the new European labour authority. If that is not the case, maybe she will explain why not. We also should seek to have that agency based in Ireland. Is that a bid that we have made? We came close to having one of the dislodged agencies from the UK come here. In fact we had an equality of votes, the Taoiseach may recall. Why not make a bid for this authority? I note that the authority will have a role in mediating on cross-border employment disputes. That should be of particular interest to Ireland, as the continued existence of the common travel area and the shared labour market between Ireland and Britain could lead to all sorts of new legal loopholes and disputes and it would be useful to have a mechanism to address those issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_555"> All roads seem to lead always and inevitably back to Brexit. When we discuss shared EU laws and regulations we are reminded of the body of shared rules that we have taken for granted that we built up over more than four decades, rules that we have shared up to now with Britain. I very much hope that the current political chaos in Westminster may yet deliver a sensible outcome, because a disastrous no-deal would be in the worst interests of the citizens of the island of Ireland and of the UK and of the EU as a whole. </p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_556">Before I make some remarks on Brexit, I want to start with Fine Gael and the Taoiseach's relationship with Viktor Orbán and Fidesz, the far right populist party in Hungary. The European People's Party, EPP, has taken some action. It is far too late and far too little in being only a suspension rather than an expulsion. The rhetoric of Orbán and Fidesz in Hungary is one of extremely right-wing, racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Roma language, speeches and so on. It is very consciously whipping up hate, for example, saying about refugees:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_557">We don't see these people as Muslim refugees. We see them as Muslim invaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">He uses similar rhetoric against the Roma people, suggesting that they are not really from here, and do not belong here. This does not stay in the realm of rhetoric but is put into action through the building of a fence more than 500 km in length on the Hungarian border to keep migrants out and through plans for a so-called immigration special tax, with 25% extra tax on aid groups that support migration. Until recently the response of the Taoiseach and the Irish Government, and Fine Gael, a sister party of Fidesz, has been to turn a polite blind eye, saying that while they do not agree with him on everything that is how it is. In 2018 the Taoiseach said, "Viktor's [note, "Viktor"] view is that he wants Hungary to stay Hungarian." He also said "I don’t agree with Viktor Orban's views on immigration; I don't agree with him on lots of things but you have to respect the fact that other countries come [from] a different perspective". That reflects and illustrates the absolute failure of the so-called centre of politics, in reality the orthodox right, the extreme centre, to challenge the ideology of the right and the far right. Far from being a bulwark against the rise of these right, far right and populist right forces, it is a gateway and by legitimising discrimination against oppressed minorities and authoritarianism, it lays the basis for the rise of these sorts of forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> On Brexit, I note and thought it was interesting that the Taoiseach made a point at the Fine Gael event at the weekend criticising Corbyn's proposal for a customs union without any state aid or neoliberal rules. He said that was trying to have your cake and eat it. That seemed to illustrate and expose that the EU as a whole, but also the right-wing Irish Government, places avoiding a hard border on this island second to maintaining the neoliberal rules of the European Union because that is what Corbyn's position potentially offers. The Irish Government, however, seems to be saying no, it must insist on maintaining the neoliberal character of the customs union and the rules as part of that. </p>
          <p eId="para_560"> In terms of preparation for Brexit, there is much that is unknown at this stage. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report published yesterday was interesting and very worrying because of what it indicates about the quite severe impact of a no-deal or a disorderly Brexit in terms of wages, disposable income, consumption etc. That raises the need for trade unions and workers’ organisations to prepare to resist a potential onslaught of attacks on workers by companies saying that because of Brexit they have to cut wages, conditions and jobs etc. That poses the need for workers to come together throughout this island but also with working-class people in Britain in a conference of trade union activists to discuss how those attacks can be resisted to say that no burden for Brexit should be paid by ordinary workers. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> At governmental level, the Government's programme focuses primarily on giving aid and grants to private companies to assist them through Brexit. Unfortunately, it is not focused primarily on the interests of workers. We need a programme to defend the interests of working-class people in Ireland in the event of a hard, a disorderly or a Theresa May Brexit. The starting point for that must be to say no job losses, to say that companies that threaten redundancies or attacks on workers' conditions should have their books opened and should be inspected by workers' representatives and if necessary, rather than bailing out private companies, they should take them into public ownership under the democratic control of the workers and be used to pivot and turn the economy in a different, sustainable direction away from our current unsustainable reliance on finance and the nature of agribusiness and so on. </p>

          <p eId="para_567">The Taoiseach again today took an opportunity to raise the spectre of populism and particularly had a go at what he described as "the far left populists" in this country. This common theme is repeated and has become a theme throughout Europe. This term is being used as a way of failing to understand the very serious political dangers and threats arising in Europe. It was not an amorphous thing called "populism" that led to the rise of fascism in the 1930s and the Holocaust.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">This failure to distinguish extreme right-wing politics with racism at its heart and what it did to Europe in the 1930s and to throw that accusation at others comes at a time when our own Government is in a political alliance with the most dangerous manifestation of crypto-fascist extreme right racist, Islamophobic politics in the entirety of Europe, in the form of Viktor Orbán, a person who has spewed out anti-Muslim filth of the sort that legitimised the massacre in New Zealand. That is what is going on. The Taoiseach then had the audacity to attack the British Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and somehow equate him with Viktor Orbán. Jeremy Corbyn does not have a racist bone in his body. He has fought his entire life against racism, anti-Semitism and anything even remotely like it. The people who are attacking Corbyn are those who say that if one criticises Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians, one is anti-Semitic, which is the most dishonest accusation imaginable because what Israel is doing to the Palestinians - Europe stands idly by while it does it - is the absolute vicious persecution of the Palestinians and the denial of their most basic rights and the right to return to some sort of self-determination and sovereignty.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">It locks up hundreds of Palestinian children without trial. The European Union ignores what Israel does and ignores the fact that today, in defiance of international law, Donald Trump is legitimising the illegal annexation of Syrian territory and that Israel is planning another assault on peaceful protestors in Gaza as they prepare to protest for their rights under international law and for the right to return. Europe stands idly by. The Taoiseach stands idly by and then pops out allegations against the left when he is conspiring with or failing to challenge the political forces that visit death, destruction and illegality on the people of Palestine and colluding with obnoxious political forces in Europe such as Viktor Orbán. The hypocrisy of it is absolutely stunning.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> It is that kind of hypocrisy, playing around with these political forces and appeasement of those sort of political forces to use the terminology of the 1930s, it is appeasement of the fascist far right, racism, authoritarianism and all that goes with it that led to the horrors of the past and that is the very real danger that is growing right across Europe. Instead of playing petty politics to have pot shots at Members on the other side, the Taoiseach should start to show a little bit of a moral compass when it comes to the very dangerous far right political threat that is emerging across Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">I may be. I re-echo Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments about the Taoiseach's attack on Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party and the notion of anti-Semitism. It is the height of inaccurate populism on the Taoiseach's part. It is totally inaccurate and he could serve himself better.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The Government's decision and the decision of 23 governments of the EU to recognise Guaidó as the interim President of Venezuela is shocking. It walks roughshod over international law. There is no basis in international law for the position that our Government took on Venezuela. There is absolutely zero basis for it. In 2013, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, FAO, included Venezuela in a group of 18 nations that had cut their number of hungry people by half in the preceding 12 years. We could not blame them for that. The FAO said that Venezuela reduced the number of people suffering from malnutrition from 13.5% of the population in 1990 to 1992 to less than 5% by 2012. Some 19% of the children in Dublin are at risk of poverty. Similarly, the United Nations Economic and Social Council published a report in 2015, two years into the presidency of Maduro, that said the council: "Takes note with satisfaction of the progress made by the [Venezuelan Government] in combating poverty and reducing inequality". Some people think that Venezuela was a better place when inequality was thriving and the income per head of population was going through the roof because of oil, but only a few people had it. The crime of Maduro and Chávez is that they spent a fortune trying to reduce poverty. Does the Minister of State know that they have built 2.5 million social housing units since 2015? Maybe the Government should get them over here. Even Deputy Durkan would agree with that because we are refusing to build social housing units in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> International pressure on Venezuela will not help the crisis in Venezuela. Venezuela had loads of problems. Is the place well run? No it is not, no more than Ireland is not well run and France is not well run as far as I am concerned. The Government is not raising a word about the economic sanctions from the US. The Government is saying it does not support military intervention but US sanctions are an intervention that is just as vile as military intervention. The so called humanitarian aid that was orchestrated on the Colombian border turned out to be a total sham. As that has failed, what the US will carry out now is the same as what it is taking part in in Yemen. It will starve the population into submission. The Government should be calling for an end to US sanctions at EU level. The Government should be calling for mediation between the different parties out there. We are not saying that Maduro is brilliant, no more than we will not say that the present Taoiseach is brilliant. The Government and the opposition there should be brought together. There should be a neutral entity from Europe involved and there should be mediation. The US should stop what it is doing because it is totally in breach of international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I do not have an awful lot of time but I want to make a point on Iran. Our factories are stocked with beef. They are packed with it and we cannot sell it. Why will the Government not open the embassy in Iran? Every western European country worth talking about has opened its embassy in Iran. We are saying that we will not go there because of US sanctions. Does the Minister of State know that the soya bean sales from the US to Iran have increased under Trump? The soya bean sales from the US to Iran have increased because they do what they like. The US has sold umpteen Boeing jets to Iran in the last four years. Does the Minister of State know why? They do so because there is money in it. The Government is cowering under them and it will not reopen its embassy. The Government should cop on to itself. The Government would do the agricultural sector a favour by reopening the embassy.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> As for the Golan Heights, how bad does it have to get? The Government has no problem dealing with Saudi Arabia, which has put 13 million people at risk of starvation in Yemen. It has no problem dealing with the US, which has created untold havoc all over the planet and it has no problem dealing with Israel. Now the Government is actually complaining about Israel annexing the Golan Heights. Was it not an awful pity that the Government abstained at the UN vote last year when that subject came up? Why did the Government do that? Where is the logic in it? What is the sanity of it?</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The Government is incredibly damaged at the moment because of its refusal to deal with the children's hospital properly. It is insane. The Government is refusing to save €400 million or €500 million by revisiting the contract because it is politically expedient for the Government to ignore the problem and hope it goes away. The Government is seriously damaged by that project.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">When international law is ignored, the slippery slope starts and there is a certain irony in the fact that hot on the heels of the attempts of the US State to gift Venezuela to itself against all precedent in Venezuelan and international law, it followed it up with a claim to gift the Golan Heights to Israel. I welcome the fact that on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's website there appears a statement where the Irish Government says that it upholds its position that the territory of the Golan Heights is Syrian territory and any territory seized through military acts of aggression cannot be recognised and that is the case with what Israel has done in the Golan Heights. However, as Deputy Wallace has just said, why did the US feel secure to be able to sign that nonsensical, illegal declaration on the Golan Heights? It was probably in part as a result of the sitting on the fence of so many nations last year in the UN resolution calling on Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights. The fact that Ireland abstained in that as one of 66 countries that abstained, is absolutely reprehensible because if the Government is saying an act of aggression is illegal, which it is, then they should withdraw from there. Contrary to what the Minister for Defence says, that is has not destabilised the Middle East, it is quite clear that Trump's actions here have already destabilised the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The turning point here in the evasion of international law is the situation in Venezuela. What we have in Venezuela now is a stalemate. There was clearly a belief on behalf of the US about putting forward their puppet, Juan Guaidó, who has no basis of support whatsoever in Venezuelan society, whose group is the minority of the right wing opposition groups and many people on the right wing do not even respect him. The fact that our Tánaiste telephoned this individual, who in his lifetime has probably got fewer votes than I have, to say that the Irish Government supports him as President of Venezuela, really is the slippery slope.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The Tánaiste should account for his actions in making that phone call. It is quite clear now that he has no support in Venezuelan society. The so-called effort to bring in humanitarian aid was a big sham event, and how could it be otherwise when they were supposed to be bringing in $20 million of aid? The US has already seized $500 million belonging to the people of Venezuela. That has been handed over without any democratic accountability to individuals linked with Juan Guaidó. Why have the international community and Ireland not stepped in to say those assets belong to the Venezuelan people? In other jurisdictions such as Brazil and so on, a process was embarked on so that any proceeds from corruption or whatever were given back to the country and the people. In Venezuela, none of this money is going back. It is going to be used to finance guerillas on the border, for illegal mercenary armies to come in and destabilise the situation in Venezuela. It is only the ordinary people who are suffering. That is what we have now.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Last night, the power went out again in Venezuela. It was not the Government of Venezuela that put it out. At best, it is the creaking infrastructure that is a result of the sanctions. At worst it is deliberate sabotage to undermine support for the Government. It is not a perfect Government; nobody is saying it is. There is not one anywhere in the world that I know of. However, what the Government could be doing as a neutral country in the heart of Europe is to say that the idea of winner takes all, which is being promoted by Guaidó and the US, cannot solve anything. Dialogue of all parties is the only way forward. We cannot have dialogue with the gun of starvation being held to people's heads or with the sanctions that are in place. All we are looking for is recognition of international law. The European Union has disgraced itself in being so quick to come behind the US in this illegal manoeuvre in Venezuela. The Government has a chance now to pull back and I am begging those at the heart of the EU to use their position to argue for the adherence of international law and dialogue involving all sides for a resolution in the interests of the Venezuelan people without sanctions and without military intervention.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">I am sharing time with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae. I note that President Tusk has just appealed to the European Parliament to be open to a long extension, if the UK wishes to rethink its strategy. This is very welcome. It is a different mode of language from when England first decided it was leaving. We need that kind of conciliatory tone and reflection. We must not box the UK in if progress can be made at all. We need to give it that latitude. Prior to this meeting, the Council met and, as we know, it discussed several vitally important matters and adopted conclusions on the multi-annual financial framework, the Single Market, migration, external relations, climate change, security and defence, misinformation, the fight against racism, and citizens' consultations.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Of course, there is only one issue preoccupying all of our attention here and that is Brexit. Why would it not? I come from a rural constituency where there are several meat plants and there is rich production of beef, lamb, poultry and pigs. We are greatly worried about the numbers of employees in all those plants, the spin-offs and service people and the farmer at the farm gate. All these people are greatly concerned. We are fed up to the high teeth with the uncertainty at this stage. At the moment it feels like we are just waiting for the blow of the hammer and nothing is going to prevent it. What a heavy hammer blow that would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> We read reports today that the European Commission says it has started to implement its preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Hey presto, it is about time they announced this because we had to have a dual strategy of trying to avoid it but also to be ready for it. According to these reports, the Commission has announced temporary measures to try to reduce the impact but says it cannot counter all the problems it expects. That is a fairly big statement. The European Commission says its measures will not and cannot mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario. We have been warning them of that for the past couple of years. "This is an exercise in damage limitation," added the Commissioner in a news conference, saying a contingency plan was necessary "given the continued uncertainty in the UK". The Commission then laid out 14 measures to cover legislation that will aim to ensure some continuity. They include a very welcome provision for road hauliers to carry freight by road into the EU for a nine-month period without having to apply for permits. That is a tangible step and I welcome it. It is vital to have that reassurance for road hauliers and their employees, for the products they carry and the industry they service.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> With respect to our own Government's preparedness, I acknowledge that it has introduced a range of measures to support the agrifood sectors, including the introduction of measures to help reduce farm gate business costs such as a €150 million low-cost loan scheme. Accessing this is difficult, however. The Government has also introduced new agriculture taxation measures and increased funding under the rural development and seafood development programmes. However, we were debating a fishing issue here yesterday and the Government was trying to steamroll it. I also acknowledge the dedicated measures announced in budget 2018, including €25 million allocated for the agrifood sector. However, €25 million would not fix the hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza. Fix it, dear Leo. That sum would not fix anything in this context. There is a big black hole in the bucket and no point in trying to fix it. It is blown wide open.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Budget 2018 also provided additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, all amounting to more than €50 million. I do not think Bord Bia is up to the job. It is not active enough. There is a fair investment in it and I do not think we are getting value for money. We need to be more aggressive selling our excellent quality products that are produced by excellent farmers here within a serious regime of regulation. While these budget measures are welcome and necessary, they are looking increasingly insufficient in terms of the scale of the damage that could materialise in a no-deal scenario. That would be quite obvious to a student in second class. At this point it could be argued that even if the worst-case scenario did not come to pass, it will take business and the agriculture sector years to stabilise following such a prolonged period of uncertainty as that which we have currently endured. We must have the delivery of far more specific contingency plans from the Government. We must get the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, to wake up, meet the farming organisations and listen to them. We need the Government to meet the fears of the communities and sectors that are going to experience enormous shock and volatility in the coming months and years.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">It is obvious that Brexit is going to have serious consequences for all sectors of our community. We have all mentioned agriculture several times. Then there are small businesses and hauliers. Fishermen are also going to be affected. I am very disappointed that the Government, supported by Fianna Fáil, is rushing the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill through the Parliament in the coming days to the detriment and loss of the inshore fishermen of Ireland. There are 14 coastal counties and I represent one of them, which is Kerry. I am very disappointed that this Bill is being rushed through to satisfy the Northern Ireland fishermen and the British Parliament, just to please them, even though England has said that if she leaves the European Union, she will be taking back her fishing waters. What is the hurry to rush this Bill through the Dáil tomorrow? What is the hurry until we see what Brexit throws up? We all hope that England stays but with this day-to-day way they are running, we do not know whether they are coming or going. It is time for them now to make up their minds. If they are going to postpone or delay Article 50, it should be postponed for two years to give them plenty of time to make up their minds. We need to be allowed to continue our work and ensure that our people can survive in the meantime and that their job opportunities remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> The Government is saying now that it met the organisation for the big trawlers that fish outside the six-mile limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">My phone in the office downstairs is hot, with inshore fishermen ringing from all around my county and others to ask us not to support the Bill tomorrow. It is premature until the United Kingdom decides what it is doing and we see what it will do within its waters. Why are we trying to satisfy the British and letting them fish up to our door on the mainland? In doing so we will clean out whatever fish small fishermen along the coast can catch. From Kenmare Bay, along by Blackwater, Tahila, the Oysterbed and Sneem pier and all the way to Reenard, small fishermen continue to try to put food on the table for their families. Are we going to blow them out of existence? Is that what Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are going to do to small fishermen to satisfy Northern Irish fishermen, even though we do not know what we will have after they leave the European Union? This is totally unfair. The United Kingdom has stated it will take back all of its waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The Government is to introduce a Bill next year to require 50 ft. boats to stay outside the six-mile limit. However, it will be easy to get around it by making a boat 48 ft. or 49 ft. long which will be able to operate inside the six-mile limit. What is the reason for the hurry with the Bill the Government is rushing through? It has not been in such a hurry to deal with other things that are vital to people in dire straits. What is the hurry to deal with the Bill to be taken tomorrow? I ask the Government to postpone it. The inshore fishermen have copped on and know what the Government it is at. It is only a ruse to please some Minister in the UK Parliament at the expense of small fishermen in Kenmare Bay and Dingle and all the way along west Cork who are barely eking out a living from our waters. It is totally wrong. I do not blame the Minister of State personally, but I do blame her as part of the Government. I also blame Fianna Fáil for backing the Bill. I cannot understand what it is at.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">I welcome the commitment on the Paris Agreement given at the European Council meeting. We have seen the movement started by Greta Thunberg and the demands of the younger generation on climate change. It was timely that the European Council reiterated its commitment to the Paris Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Earlier the Taoiseach informed the House: "I also engaged informally with many of my EU counterparts on the margins of the meetings, using the opportunity, as I always do, to promote Irish interests ... It is important that we also play an active role in shaping our future as we move towards a union of 27 member states." I refer to new alliances as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. I presume the Irish delegation took the opportunity at the summit to continue the efforts to secure new alliances in the European Union now that the United Kingdom is leaving. The United Kingdom was a close ally of Ireland on a number of issues, including tax and social policies. It will be a big challenge for us. We need to forge new alliances in dealing with a number of issues such as farm subsidies, corporation tax, security and defence, eurozone integration and EU integration generally. Dr. Catherine Day who was a special adviser to President Juncker will address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs next week to discuss the issue of alliances. Will the Minister of State update us on the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Earlier the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, asked the Taoiseach about discussions that had taken place at official level on the Border in the event that there was a no-deal Brexit. I am sure my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, will pursue that question in more detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">I know that the Minister of State and I have had the opportunity to have this conversation at the stakeholder meeting, but I would like to have the issues dealt with in the Dáil. Will she clarify reports carried on RTÉ two days ago that EU officials were talking about checks being carried out far away from the Border, if at all possible, and that it need not be visible infrastructure. It indicates that certain conversations have taken place. Will the Minister of State outline to the House what the conversations have entailed in so far as she possibly can?</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> Will the Minister of State outline the timeline for the financial aid package that will be available from the European Commission in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit. How quickly would we be able to access funds? What level of negotiations has she had and what stage have they reached?</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I highlight the chilling impact Brexit has already had on business. There has been positive feedback on the training provided by Revenue and the Customs service. However, a lack of consumer confidence, with people holding off on investments, in hiring staff and agreeing to new contracts, indicates that damage has been done. What plans does the Government have to conduct an assessment of the impact of Brexit on business, even in getting a deal over the line?</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_610">My question is related to the situation in Venezuela. It is incredibly significant and could be a real game changer in world politics. The Irish Government and the European Union have the potential to play a positive role. I appeal to the Government to start that role in a positive way. It was a big mistake for it and the European Union to support the unelected Juan Guaidó, who is a little far right-wing thug with very little support in Venezuela. He was educated in the ways of the Chicago school of economics in the hope that one day he could implement US neoliberal policies in Venezuela.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> The position the Eurpean Union took was totally in breach of international law. I plead with the Minister of State to revisit the issue. The European Union should withdraw its support for Mr. Guaidó as interim President. It is absolute rubbish because he is not the President of Venezuela and never will be, bar a military intervention to impose him and him becoming a dictator, but he will never receive the support of the Venezuelan people. Do the Irish Government and the European Union have an appetite to play a positive role? Will they withdraw their support for Mr. Guaidó and act as intermediaries? The Government in Venezuela has done some great things in reducing the incidence of poverty and inequality, but it has also made many mistakes and is far from perfect. We would like it to sit down with the opposition, with intermediaries from Europe, to allow for dialogue between the different factions. What is required is mediation, not conflict. Supporting Mr. Guaidó and US sanctions will lead to polarisation and, at worst, bloodshed. Will the European Union play a mediation role in Venezuela? However, it first needs to withdraw its support for Mr. Guaidó as interim President.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">I know that it is difficult having everybody ask a series of questions in one go and the Minister of State answer them in one go. It is not the best way to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">First, in terms of the Golan Heights and any discussions that have taken place regarding the impact on our troops going back out there as a result of the US's unilateral declaration and decision that it has decided that it is in its gift to give Israel the Golan Heights against any precedents in international law, it is an incredible situation. I note the Minister of State at the Department of Defence has said that this does not make any difference to Ireland's troops and it does not change the position in the Middle East but will the Minister of State comment, in more detail, on that because it does change the situation in the Middle East and it has acted already as a destabilising factor? I note the Syrian Government asked today for the UN Security Council to convene a meeting on this legalised illegality the US is attempting. What is the position of the Irish Government in the context of the European response? I put that forward genuinely in the spirit of the points I made earlier that I recognise and was glad to see the very clear statement on behalf of the Tánaiste condemning what the US has done, which clearly stated that what has happened here is a de facto effort to recognise illegality, which cannot be done. Given that the Tánaiste has said that, what will the next step be in terms of trying to change that situation because the US has ratcheted this up a gear?</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> In that context, my second question relates to the issue of Venezuela and some of the points made by Deputy Wallace. There is a major problem there now, and it is not about scoring points, but the EU made a fundamental mistake in quickly coming out and recognising Juan Guaidó, an individual who has virtually negligible support inside Venezuela and that is a problem. Clearly, in January when the US nominated him the tactic was that there would be a quick coup, he would be imposed, an effort would be made at the border to bring in humanitarian aid, the Venezuelan Government would fall and the US puppet would be put in place. That has not happened. It is now six weeks since then and the situation has moved on and we are in a bit of a stalemate. It is clear he does not have the support but it is also clear that if the current situation is to continue for the Venezuelan people, that it will be unsustainable. We returned from Venezuela the week after the attempts to bring in humanitarian aid. We saw the impact of the some of the economic sanctions, for example, the power cuts and the impact that would have on closing the metro. Workers are stranded on one side of the city who cannot get home because of those power cuts, which are a direct result of the interference. What is the Irish Government's attitude to how we can save face on this? This is not about anybody winning. There needs to be dialogue. The Venezuelan Government has said it wants dialogue. Until very recently there was dialogue. The Spanish Government was talking and the Vatican was talking but has the Minister of State any information on that? The Vatican has now become a point of attack by the US and the Guaidó forces, which are saying that the Vatican is supposed to be a puppet for the Maduro regime, but I do not believe that for a second. What is the Government's attitude towards brokering talks where all the parties would get together and resume talks in the context that the only alternative is hardship and interventionism?</p>

          <p eId="para_616">A number of issues were raised by Deputies who have left the Chamber, specifically Deputy Howlin with respect to the social agenda. It was not discussed at the European Council this weekend or last weekend but it is very much continuously on the agenda. We have 25 different initiatives currently in force. Moving on from the discussions that took place in Stockholm, the introduction of a European labour authority was part of that. A question was asked as to whether we are putting ourselves forward for that but we are not. Three countries, namely, Slovakia, Cyprus and Latvia, have already put themselves forward to seek that. Our opinion is that we should allow member states that do not have such an authority to seek to host this agency. We are engaging with them and we will make a decision on that as soon as we possibly can. On the question of whether we would support it and work with it, the answer to that is "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> A number of people raised the issue of Fidesz, which was not necessarily on the agenda. Whether it is Fine Gael politically, myself individually, MEPs or others in this country, we have always been very clear that there have been decisions made and movements by the political party in Hungary with which we are not happy and do not agree. I have raised this numerous times, as have the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste at various meetings. The suspension was supported by our political party. Whether it is in terms of the Central European University, the implementation of new legislation which would directly have a negative impact, or whether it is with respect to voluntary or community groups or charitable organisations, we have raised all these issues as well as the impending Article 7 process, which is due to come before the General Affairs Council, at which I sit. We continuously raise these concerns but we need to and want to work with our colleagues within the European Union. Dialogue is always the best way to try to address many of these concerns but it has now got to the stage of a suspension and I hope we can engage on these issues to try to find a solution to all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> In terms of Brexit, and the programme and aid, two suggestions were made by Deputies, who have left the Chamber, to the effect that we are not providing enough support to those who need it, particularly that we are only providing direct grant-in-aid to private companies, but that is not true. I would point to the supports that are being provided particularly for the agrifood sector, where more than 90% of companies in the sector are small and medium enterprises based in our constituencies and rural areas. Most of the grants and the support we have been providing is to try to assist those, whether by way of the €300 million scheme, and a second scheme was launched today by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or by way of the additional support for Bord Bia or Enterprise Ireland to help those companies not only to examine their structures but to try to restructure and look beyond the UK as a trading partner, which, for many of them is their key objective and goal. Unfair comments were made about Bord Bia and the work it was stated it is not doing. It is doing a massive amount of work. Only this morning, as Deputy Lisa Chambers would attest, we had an update from one of its representatives, Tara McCarthy, who has consistently engaged with the Government to make sure we understand what its members and their companies are going through and the types of supports they need. It also has been actively engaged in an outreach programme to try to ensure that its companies are as supported as possible. Again, these are the small and medium enterprises, people employing one or two people in communities in our rural towns and villages. Almost 70% of our companies and employment that is created is through small and medium enterprises. There are supports for the larger companies but much of it is focused on those who need it, particularly in the rural and the agricultural communities and sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> In terms of new alliances, there is a great deal of work ongoing. Many have acknowledged that the UK has been our nearest neighbour, ally and friend on many issues and we have had very similar agendas for the past 47 years, but obviously we are looking further afield. I think some students from Denmark are still in the Gallery. Part of our outreach is with our Nordic, Baltic and Dutch colleagues. Something that started off as an invitation to not only the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, but also Mark Rutte has now turned into something of a more of a formal arrangement. For example, I meet my European colleagues at the European Affairs Council meetings but also the Minister for Finance meets those colleagues on a regular basis as does the Taoiseach. We have a number of various groupings that are not specific to countries but specific to issues on which we are working. The D9 or the D9 plus specifically focuses on the digital agenda and the digital Single Market economy, which we are pushing and perceive as being significant to our economy and implementation of the Single Market. In terms of agriculture, it is a major issue for us. </p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Stepping away from Brexit, there is a matter of the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the possible proposal from the Commission of a 5% cut, which would have a major and detrimental impact on our farmers. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is engaging, and has been for some time, and has led some discussions on the next MFF. He is trying to ensure our farmers and farming community are protected. That engagement is part of his discussions with the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan. Other discussions are taking place involving our Minister for Finance and Ministers of State at the Department of Finance with like-minded groups, whether it be on taxation, open competitiveness or other key issues. A massive amount of work is ongoing, whether it is specific to countries with which we would not see eye to eye on everything but which are very like-minded, as well as with specific groups focusing on specific issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_621"> With regard to the Good Friday Agreement, the protection of the Single Market and the customs union, the Border issue and what was or was not said by RTÉ, given there were many different comments last week, there has been a lot of speculation based on things that were said by the Commission and by Michel Barnier, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron when entering and leaving the Council. What was very clear and what has been consistently repeated to us is that there must be protection of the Single Market and the customs union, and we support that. What was also made very clear is that we must find a way to protect the Good Friday Agreement. Obviously, we know it is extremely difficult to do that in the absence of a closer trading relationship with the UK and the EU, or in the absence of the backstop. That is why we are doing everything within our power to ensure there is a withdrawal agreement and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and that, no matter what, we can protect the invisible border that currently exists. However, there is no detailed discussion ongoing at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> As to what might happen in a no-deal scenario, there were of course conversations that suggested this would have to be discussed. However, we are not at that stage and we are still hoping that, either today or in the next week, the Prime Minister will be able to find a new way forward through a closer relationship, a new referendum or an extension towards something more significant or, indeed, that she can get agreement on the withdrawal agreement. We would welcome any of those developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I agree that damage has already been done. There are a huge number of companies and individuals who are not making plans and I would go so far as to say people are not even buying houses because they are unsure of what might happen and what the environment might be. We need to make sure we are doing as much as we can now, as we have been in the past three budgets, whether that is through financial supports, putting new plans in place through our infrastructure programmes and financial services programmes, or the new action plan for jobs which the Minister has been working on. The fact that three out of five jobs created have been created outside of Dublin in the last year has not been by accident but is part of trying to ensure that any ongoing implications of Brexit are addressed before it even happens. Obviously, our no-deal planning forms part of that. Without knowing exactly what the outcome will be, we can only do our best to engage with people and provide financial support where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> With regard to the timeline and our engagement with the Commission, as I have said a huge amount of support has already been put in place which people can access. The Minister for Finance has been working with the Ministers, Deputy Humphreys and Deputy Creed, with regard to specific packages for businesses and the agricultural sector. It is likely this can come to Cabinet, if and when needed, in a very short space of time. We have been engaging with the Commission for some time and we have been told that if funds were needed, they would become available when needed, whether in regard to flexibility on state aid rules, direct payments to farmers or business, or otherwise. Of course, we know that the timeline set out and agreed last week by the European Council and agreed by the UK in terms of the extension means we will not have that 24-hour cliff edge which we could have been facing this week if the UK did not come forward to say it is running European elections with an agreement on the withdrawal agreement, or with a possible way forward. It is within the remit of the Council and the Commission to set a date, possibly 22 May, on which the UK would leave with no deal, so we would have time to plan. I assume it would be within that period that the Commission would indicate the figures and timelines and the ways in which it would be able to support us.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> On Venezuela, there was a question of whether we have the appetite to play a positive role, which we absolutely do. When we support Mr. Juan Guaidó, we see this as an interim measure which is not meant to be permanent. That was our intention, along with the other 24 member states that have supported this action. The EU's international contact group is there to try to deliver urgent humanitarian aid, although I accept it is not getting through and this is something we need to try to address. We need also to initiate a credible electoral process. The only way we can do that is by getting people to engage and to talk, as the Deputy rightly outlined. What the exact process within that contact group is I am not sure, but I can get that information for the Deputies. Another way is through the rapid responder deployment to assist the UNHCR, which is trying to support the Colombian Government's efforts to try to enhance the asylum system and to respond to the humanitarian issues that are ongoing and which have been ongoing for some time. Again, I will try to get clarity as to the international contact group's priority and agenda. We are working with EU colleagues to try and address, first and foremost, the humanitarian crisis which needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">We need to provide humanitarian aid. It is a humanitarian crisis, particularly when millions of people are leaving the country at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> As the Taoiseach indicated, I will focus my concluding remarks on external relations and on our ongoing efforts to combat disinformation and to secure free and fair elections. Under external relations, in addition to the broad-ranging discussion on our relationship with China, in advance of the EU-China summit on 9 April leaders also discussed the situation in Ukraine. Last week was the fifth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol, and this remains a cause for concern. The EU remains absolutely committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and does not recognise this violation of international law. From Ireland’s perspective, we fully share this position and believe that we must continue to call on Russia to observe the fundamental principles of international law and restore Ukraine’s internationally agreed borders. Unity at EU and international level must remain the cornerstone of our approach to Russia. Ireland fully supports the five principles agreed by EU Foreign Ministers in 2016 that guide our interaction with Russia. Of these, we attach particular importance to the idea of increased people-to-people contact. A strong and stable relationship between the EU and Russia is desirable as a long-term strategic goal. Unfortunately, however, we see little evidence currently that Russia is seeking to improve its relationship with Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> With regard to the recent tropical cyclone in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, Ireland contributes to the EU humanitarian response mechanisms, which include an initial emergency aid package of €3.5 million, as well as €250,000 in initial humanitarian assistance. In addition, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, have confirmed that Ireland will contribute over €1 million to the affected countries, and this includes €400,000 to be released by the embassy of Ireland in Mozambique to the World Food Programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> Ireland has been proactive in countering disinformation, including through the establishment of an interdepartmental group on security of the electoral process and disinformation, which has been working since December 2017. The current EU Presidency places a huge emphasis on this, particularly given the upcoming European elections. We are doing everything we can to work with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I want to reiterate the Tánaiste's earlier points in regard to the Golan Heights. We see this as Syrian territory under Israeli occupation and we have no plans to change that position. What we are trying to do is engage with our international counterparts to highlight the serious concerns we have and to continue to try to support those people. The Tánaiste is working with us and will engage further with Deputy Daly.</p>

            <p eId="para_635">The Rebuilding Ireland home loan was launched in February 2018 to replace the existing local authority mortgage schemes. Waterford City and County Council received an allocation of €2 million under the scheme which allows first-time buyers to borrow up to 90% of a property's value from the local authority. Figures show that Waterford City and County Council has provided mortgages to half of all of the applicants that have applied, which tallies with average approval rates nationally. So far, so good and the Minister of State may well ask me what is the problem. Waterford City and County Council has paid out €2.6 million to date, approving 15 mortgages. It currently has another €1.5 million worth of successful applicants, equating to 11 mortgages but it does not have the finances to fund these mortgages under the Rebuilding Ireland scheme as it has already exceeded its allocation. I spoke to the director of services yesterday who told me that the council is currently reviewing these applications and that some of the applicants are in dire straits.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> I wish to refer to one specific case to illustrate the reality of the situation. A family living in Waterford who had been renting for the past nine years successfully applied for a Rebuilding Ireland home loan from Waterford council. The family then engaged a solicitor, agreed the purchase of a house, including furniture and contents, gave notice on the house they were renting and sold some of their own furniture which would not suit their new home. However, when the solicitor applied to draw down the funding, as approved, the council could not provide the money as it had well exceeded its allocation. As I said, the council was allocated €2 million but has already spent €2.6 million. As reported in a local newspaper, all of the necessary reports were supplied and almost three weeks ago, the family reached the sale agreed stage. They had a pre-mortgage meeting with Waterford council, engaged a solicitor and were told that they would receive the money within two to three weeks. Now they have been told that Waterford council has run out of Rebuilding Ireland home loan funding. This is only one story among many. This family is currently in limbo. The whole chain of events is now held up, with several parties affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> It is clear that there has been a much greater demand for the loan scheme than initially anticipated. As a result, the scheme will require a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency if it is to continue. I ask the Minister of State to provide some positive news on the question of additional funding for Waterford City and County Council. Will a second tranche of finance be provided and if so, when? Is the future of this scheme secure? Can applicants continue to apply, sure in the knowledge that, if successful, they will receive the necessary finance? This scheme is a good news story. There are lots of people in this country who are not in a position to get a mortgage from the normal lenders but who are also above the income limits to qualify for social housing or HAP. I know a few people who have secured Rebuilding Ireland home loans and they are very pleased with terms and conditions, including competitive rates of interest over 25 to 30 years. The scheme is a perfect fit on paper for some, particularly first-time buyers, those who cannot get a mortgage from the main lenders and those who do not qualify for local authority housing. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation with regard to the scheme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_638">I will try to give the Deputy as much information as possible but I will have to revert to her with some specific details at a later date.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> Following a review of the two existing home loan schemes, namely the house purchase loan and the home choice loan, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, introduced a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, in February last year to replace the existing schemes. When the new scheme was initially being developed, it was estimated that the draw down of loans under the scheme would be approximately €200 million over three years. However, as outlined by Deputy Butler, the scheme has proven to be far more successful than originally anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has been closely monitoring the progress of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme and has been engaging with officials from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on the scheme since October 2018 when it became clear that the rate at which loans were being approved was higher than originally anticipated. The Minister made a commitment on launching the scheme that he would seek further funding at an early stage, if necessary, given his belief in the scheme's potential. By the end of January, €106 million had been drawn down, which accounted for 53% of the available funding. At that point, €66 million would have been more consistent with the expectation of funds being drawn down over a three year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> The Minister informed the Dáil on 29 January 2019 that the scheme had proven to be more successful than initially anticipated and would require a further tranche of funds. He further indicated that the Department was in discussions with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on an extension to the scheme. A meeting with the Minister for Finance was scheduled for 4 February but had to be deferred until 5 March. At no time was the first tranche of funding depleted and following the meeting on 5 March, the Minister informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that local authorities could continue to accept applications, as discussions had commenced on further funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> As of the end of January, €106 million had been lent, supporting 575 individuals and families to buy their first home. The Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform regarding further funding for the scheme. The Central Bank is also being consulted. Specific allocations to local authorities for 2019 will be finalised when those discussions have concluded. In the meantime, the scheme remains open and applicants can be confident that this will continue to be the case. All local authorities should continue to receive and process applications, up to and including draw down of funding, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> The Deputy outlined a specific case and many Members have come across similar cases. I will endeavour to get a more specific timeline on the extra tranche of funding for Deputy Butler. I hope I have provided some solace for families in similar situations. I accept that this is a very difficult time for the family referred to by Deputy Butler but I will try to get as specific a date as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_644">I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I am delighted to hear that the scheme is still open but unfortunately Waterford City and County Council has well exceeded its initial allocation of €2 million. The council has actually used €600,000 of its own money at this stage. The Minister of State knows well that local authorities must balance their books and in that context the council needs to have some idea of the timeframe involved here.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> Some local authorities have been more successful than others in terms of processing Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications. Would it be possible to redirect funds from those local authorities that did not utilise their full allocation to those which have exceeded their allocations? I urge the Department to look at those local authorities that have loaned a lot of money and exceeded their allocations to determine why this happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> The focus must be on building houses and moving people into them. We are all agreed on that. That is what is important to every local authority, every Senator and Deputy in these Houses and every councillor on the ground. We need clarity on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme although I accept that the Minister of State cannot provide it today. I welcome the fact that the scheme is still open but the situation is very difficult for the local authorities. If Waterford City and County Council goes ahead and allocates the aforementioned 11 mortgages that it has approved, will the Department guarantee that the council will be reimbursed?</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_653">I thank the Minister, Deputy Ross, for coming to the Chamber to discuss this issue and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting it. Deputy Sherlock has also put this matter but he is attending a committee vote currently.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> Deputy Sherlock has encountered the same issue, as have other Deputies around the country, especially in the last week. We are being inundated with calls from people who have UK driving licences and are having difficulty changing them over to Irish licences. I understand there is a walk-in service advertised on the website but unfortunately there have been hours of queuing for many of the people who have gone in to the centres to apply. There is not enough staff, but in fairness this is probably because the service is under pressure. People are taking time off work to go in to apply to change their licences and now panic is beginning to set in. I believe that 12 April is the deadline for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> Conflicting views are given when one goes in to change a licence. People are stating that if an application is made then the person is okay to drive but others have heard that a driver cannot drive until he or she has the new licence. Deputy Sherlock has heard the same. Some people have said that if a driver does not have the licence in time then he or she may have to resit a driving test.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> Many Irish people have made their lives in England. They go over on a Monday and come back on Friday evening. There are many people whose lives are intertwined between the UK and Ireland. We need to make sure that this is facilitated. In the spirit of partnership and in the context of the common travel area, I put it to the Minister that we should not ask people to change over their driving licences. There was a common travel area long before the UK or Ireland was in the EU. If the Minister cannot do that perhaps he could tell the House who is making up these rules. Is the EU pushing the Government on this? What part has the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in it?</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> If the Minister cannot solve this issue under the common travel area can we give a breathing space of a three month period? We need to put out a very clear message to people that if they do not have their licence by 12 April they should not panic because there could, for example, be a grace period of a month or so and they would not be put off the road. We need to make clear to people that they would not have to resit a driving test if they already hold a UK licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> The situation is unusual. Over the last week in constituency offices Deputy Sherlock and other Deputies have seen the beginnings of panic as people are ringing up. The situation is causing a lot of frustration for people who have UK driving licences and especially for people who live and work in the Border counties, from Donegal over to Deputy Adams's county. There are others who may have worked in the UK years ago, who came back to Ireland and have always had a UK licence. Some civil servant needs to bring a bit of common sense into this matter rather than this growing frustration. People who are working cannot take time off work to spend three or four hours queuing for this. This is what Deputy Sherlock and I have been told. The queues go on so long that people are not getting to make their application as they have to leave. We need to solve this. I understand the application cannot be done online, but I am open to correction on that. I ask the Minister to bring clarity to the situation.</p>

          <speech by="#ShaneRoss" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_415">
            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_659">I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice for raising this very important issue. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, people resident in Ireland will no longer be able to drive on a UK driving licence. At present, we recognise other EU member state driving licences, but when the UK leaves the EU the UK will no longer be a member state and so the driving licence will not be recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_660"> The Road Safety Authority, RSA, through the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, is informing people to avail of the exchange facility in place to swap over the UK licence for an Irish licence before that facility extinguishes in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Legislation exists to allow for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes in section 23A of the Road Traffic Act 1961. If there is a no-deal Brexit, the UK becomes a third country and the potential then exists for arrangements to be made under section 23A. Ireland will be pursuing this option. This may take a little time to complete as it involves the signing of a formal agreement with the UK and the introduction of secondary legislation here in Ireland. People who are not resident in the State, such as those visiting or on a temporary stay from the UK, do not need to exchange their licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to the waiting times. The NDLS is experiencing significantly increased demand and extra resources are being put in place to maintain the current ten days application processing time. Many NDLS centres have extended their opening hours by opening an hour earlier at 8 a.m. and closing at 6 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. instead of 5 p.m., resulting in a total of 220 extra opening hours this week across the network across the country. The extra opening hours are helping to meet demand. Priority is being given to UK licence exchanges with 38 staff working on UK licence exchange alone. Up to 600 licence exchanges are being processed daily. When attending any of the 36 NDLS centres nationally to apply for a learner permit, a driving licence, to exchange a driving licence or for any other reason, it is recommended that an appointment be made. Due to the demand for UK licence exchanges, it may not be possible to make an appointment in time before the 12 April deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> The NDLS also provides approximately 1,300 slots per day for walk-in appointments. There will be a longer wait time for walk ins, which Deputy Fitzmaurice referred to, but I am informed that no-one has been turned away from a centre and that the queues are not too long. The walk-in slots equate to about 50% of the total slots available. Walk-in visits are encouraged before 11 a.m. and after 3 p.m. to avoid peak times. Details of the centres’ opening hours are available on <i>www.ndls.ie</i> along with all the necessary application forms and frequently asked questions. It is not practical to add more online appointment slots for booking as this will take away from the walk-in slots. There is no way to differentiate between a normal licence renewal and an exchange licence when booking an appointment online. This could cause significant queues if the online slots are taken up by less urgent renewals versus the exchanges. As a consequence, booking availability has been increased from four to six weeks ahead to facilitate those who may be renewing a licence or learner permit and are not in an immediate rush. This has helped to reduce the pressure and allow more walk-in slots for exchange applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> It is not possible to hand in a UK driving licence at a NDLS centre and walk out with an Irish licence. Due diligence must be completed to make sure the licence holder is entitled to the category of licence that is on their licence and this could require contacting the original licensing authority to ensure that there are no endorsements or disqualifications on the licence. Ireland, as an EU member state, is obliged under Directive 2006/126/EC to carry out such due diligence when giving consideration to exchanging a driving licence for an EU member state licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_664">That is not the reply people are looking for. That is a by-the-book response written by some civil servant. I wish to drill down further. The Minister has said some legislation could be introduced on this. If the Houses are able to bring through Brexit legislation in one week I am damn sure we could bring through some legislation, on which we would be ready to press the button, to make sure there is agreement on this matter between Ireland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> The Minister referred to some numbers in his reply, but if we consider the number of centres in the State it equates to barely one person in each centre who is looking after this. If a driver has applied will the Minister clarify whether or not he or she will have to re-sit the driving test? Can a driver drive if he or she does not have the new licence? I want these points clarified. Deputies have listened to the people who have been going to these centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">We have heard that people had to wait three and four hours in a queue but the place then closed. The Minister indicated the opening hours. My understanding is that 11,000 licences have been issued and that 4,000 are being processed. There is a huge number of people looking for licences. Will the Minister bring a little common sense to this scenario and give until the end of April or a similar period to ensure there will be no panic among those looking for licences? The reality on the ground is very different from what some civil servant wrote for the Minister to read in the House. Will he clarify whether he can give a grace period for the month of April to ensure people will be in line? I am hearing that they will not be able to drive to work if they still have an English licence or have yet to get back their licence. I need to have that matter clarified. Can we bring the legislation through the Dáil quickly before that date to ensure there will be no problem? Will one have to sit a test if this is not done by the end of April? Can the Minister extend the period, which is the most important aspect?</p>

            <p eId="para_667">I thank the Deputy for his passion. All I can state about the accusation that there are vast queues and great difficulties is that that is not the report I am getting. It is absolutely the case there has been a build-up, as the Deputy said. There are numbers building up at peak hours as one might expect when a dramatic event like this happens. There are more people turning up for walk-in slots, while more people are applying for appointments. However, the figures I have for yesterday are as follows. In Castlebar four people were turned away, while in Cavan one person was. In Ennis, Roscommon, the Deputy's county, and Athlone no one was turned away. In Carrick-on-Shannon two people were waiting, while in Clarehall three were waiting and the centre was open until 6 p.m. In Drogheda, Cork and Galway there were no one waiting. I could keep going, but I guess that the Deputy does not for one second suggest the figures I am getting have been falsified or are in any way misleading. They do not, however, accord with the image he has built of vast queues of frustrated people at doors. He is right - some people have to wait, but we are in an unprecedented situation. I would have thought that instead of making wild accusations about civil servants who are producing accurate figures, he would have congratulated me on the fact that-----</p>

            <p eId="para_670">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt faoin ábhar seo anocht. Táim an-sásta an tAire a fheiceáil anseo. I raise with him the growing level of extortion with violence and threats by drug gangs in County Louth. They are demanding that the families of those they claim owe them money now pay the alleged debt. I am told by party colleagues that this is also a serious problem in Dublin and elsewhere. Last week I visited a family in County Louth who were living in terror. In the space of six months they had paid a drug gang a total of €3,700 to pay debts allegedly owed by their son. The drug gang has targeted the family in a sustained campaign of intimidation, threats and attempted extortion. It is now demanding a further €8,000. However, the family are demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of threats and standing firm by rejecting the drug gang's latest demand. When I visited their home, clearly they were very anxious and their fears were well founded. Over St. Patrick's weekend, their home was petrol bombed while they slept in their beds. Luckily, the impact of the bomb breaking a window woke the family who extinguished the fire before anyone was hurt. They are working closely with An Garda Síochána and have praised gardaí highly. </p>
            <p eId="para_671"> Other families have also been targeted and other homes attacked. Cars have been destroyed, while families have fled their homes. Last Friday I spoke to the chief superintendent of the Louth division. I commend An Garda Síochána on its actions and efforts to date. Unfortunately, it is starved of the resources it needs to deal with this threat. During my last meeting in Dundalk Garda station in January the officers informed me that the Louth drug crime unit was up and running, with three extra staff in Dundalk and five in Drogheda. While that is a good start and something for which we have campaigned and lobbied for some time, the resources are still far too low to deal with a problem of this scale. Other cases have come through my office and I have kept the Garda informed of all of them. No doubt, there are many more of which I am not aware.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> Most of this intimidation can be traced to two drug gangs in Drogheda where local families are subjected to similar threats over drug debts allegedly owed by family members. I commend the neighbours and friends of the family I visited. I commend the family on taking the stand they have. It is no mean thing to do. It demands huge courage to stand up to these thugs. While the people of County Louth will not be intimidated by these gangsters, it should not be left to the community and An Garda Síochána. Does the Minister agree that the State has a duty to support and protect the family in question? Will he look urgently at the provision of additional resources for the Louth division of An Garda Síochána to support the work of its drug unit? Will he consider introducing or supporting legislation to ensure proof of identity will be required in the purchase of mobile phones? As he is well aware, mobile phones are used in the illegal drugs trade and many of the threats issued to the family being victimised in this case are made by mobile phone. I ask the Minister to imagine what would have happened had they not been alerted to the fact that the petrol bomb had been thrown. I ask him to imagine the case had members of the family been killed in that attack. We would be treating it as a national crisis. Will the Minister support the family and those standing against the drug gangs and ensure An Garda Síochána will have all the support it requires?</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_673">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. As the House will be aware, both the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and I have addressed both Houses on the situation in County Louth in recent months. The Minister of State updated the Seanad in February on the steps being taken by An Garda Síochána to neutralise the ongoing feud there. My party colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, has also been monitoring the situation closely. As the Deputy will be aware, I visited Drogheda Garda station last December when I was very impressed by the robust response that had been put in place by the Garda authorities in the region. There is a dedicated policing operation in place, Operation Stratus, which specifically targets the ongoing feud in the Drogheda area. The operation consists of high visibility patrols and check points, days of action and covert policing initiatives to target specific individuals. These operations are supplemented by personnel from the regional armed support unit, the drug units and divisional road policing units and have resulted in the seizure of considerable amounts of cash, firearms and controlled drugs. The Garda will continue to tackle this problem head on to ensure the safety of all citizens in County Louth.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> Drug-related intimidation is an extremely serious issue which impacts greatly on communities and society as a whole but especially families. I am advised that An Garda Síochána has strict policies and procedures in place to deal with the issue of drug-related intimidation and tackles the supply of drugs by supporting local communities through various preventative and detection initiatives, including engagement with local and regional drug and alcohol task forces, the Garda youth diversion programme and other projects, the Garda schools programme, the joint policing committees and community policing fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">I am further advised by the Garda authorities that the drug-related intimidation reporting programme has been implemented nationally since 2013. An inspector has been nominated in every Garda division throughout the country, including County Louth, to act as the single point of contact as part of the inspector's portfolio in each division. These inspectors are at management level within An Garda Síochána and have great expertise, knowledge and vast experience. They will liaise directly with the local superintendent on each individual case. As part of the implementation process, all regional assistant commissioners nationally and their senior management teams have been briefed on An Garda Síochána’s responsibilities and commitments under the national drugs strategy in the context of drug-related intimidation and the drug-related intimidation reporting programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> For its part, the Government has provided the Garda Commissioner with an additional €100 million in 2019, bringing his total budget to almost €1.8 billion. This substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deployment of new and leading edge technology to support front-line gardaí in carrying out their work of delivering a visible, effective and responsive police service to communities across all Garda divisions, including the Louth division, in 2019 and future years. I will be very clear. The intimidation outlined by the Deputy will not be allowed to continue. Gardaí in County Louth are tackling this issue head-on and will continue to bring those engaged in any illegal activity to justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">The family have been told to pay an extra €8,000 or they will be killed. Their home is barricaded in a makeshift way. They are receiving the support and attention of An Garda Síochána, on which they commend it. They also have the support of their neighbours. The selling, distribution and use of drugs present a major problem in our society. Some addicts engage in criminality to raise the money needed to feed their habit and once they are hooked, they are used by gangs in a scurrilous, cynical and clinical way. There is a need for a well resourced, an holistic and a multi-agency approach. It would bring all stakeholders together, including in the community and the voluntary sector, as well as the Garda and other agencies, to tackle the scourge of drugs and the associated health and criminal issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> I have submitted a number of parliamentary questions about the ongoing evaluation of the drug-related intimidation reporting programme by An Garda Síochána and the work of the family addiction support network. The programme was operational under the 2009 to 2016 national drug and alcohol strategy. The current strategy - Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - runs from 2017 to 2025. Last year the Minister told me that the evaluation would be completed by the end of 2018. As we are now well into 2019, has is it been completed? If it has, when will it be published? What lessons are drawn from it? Is the drug-related intimidation reporting programme working? An Garda Síochána is the lead agency in the campaign against illegal drugs and the people at the coal face are doing their best, but does the Minister accept that they need him to resource them financially and draw lessons from the evaluations?</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> It is unique for the family to take this stand. I know many families who will not make it and do not blame them. Are we going to let the family down?</p>

            <p eId="para_680">I acknowledge the seriousness of the issue and the facts outlined by the Deputy. I do not disagree with them. When dealing with any complaint of drug-related intimidation An Garda Síochána makes sure to afford the person or family who may be subject to threats the best level of advice, support, guidance and security. The confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda Síochána when dealing with reports under the drug-related intimidation reporting programme. In conjunction with the national family support network, An Garda Síochána has hosted a seminar on this theme specifically for the divisional inspectors involved in the drug-related intimidation reporting programme. Other Garda personnel were also in attendance, including Garda personnel from County Louth. While liaison within and between regional and local Garda management teams is ongoing, the seminars and training days provide an appropriate platform and opportunity to bring relevant personnel together for sessions that might be particularly focused which, in turn, inform the reporting programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> On recent criminal activity in County Louth, An Garda Síochána has put in place a policing operation to prevent, detect and mitigate any further escalation of violence between the groups involved. The Deputy referred to a multi-agency programme. I agree and liaison is ongoing with the appropriate stakeholders, including the local authorities, Tusla and the HSE. Every Member wishes them well in their endeavours. I want this issue to be resolved. The Garda will make every effort to ensure issues such as those outlined by the Deputy are brought to a halt and that those responsible for criminal activity, be it extortion, intimidation, threats or otherwise, will be brought to justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_688"> Small businesses are under significant pressure. Foreign direct investment is seen as the glamorous part of the Government's enterprise policy. Micro businesses and small enterprises are seen as worthy elements of that policy, but they are the poor relations when it comes to effort and investment. Many small businesses are in serious danger. This week and in the next two weeks a number of profitable businesses in the children's soft toy sector are due to close. These businesses are being killed by insurance industry dysfunction. They are profitable in every way and provide a great service, but they are being stuffed owing to the dysfunction in the insurance industry. The Government has been defeated by the vested interests in the sector, but these are good businesses that give people a livelihood. People have invested in them, but the businesses will disappear silently this week, next week and the week after and little is being done about it. Would it be possible for the Minister to come up with an emergency package to help these small businesses to get over the hump owing to the lack of an insurance function in order that when the sunny day arrives when the Government gets things together, they will be able to get insurance cover for their businesses?</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> Things are not looking well for small and medium-sized enterprises. In the last quarter of 2018 nine of the 12 confidence indicators showed a decline from the previous year. Labour costs are increasing owing to the dysfunction in the housing market, as workers are being forced to pay higher rents. There is the same problem of rent inflation in the commercial property sector. Congestion is nearly at crisis proportions throughout the country. Legal costs here are significantly higher than European comparators.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The appreciation of the euro-sterling exchange rate is hitting hard on small businesses throughout the country. As the Government has created a banking duopoly here, two banks have 85% of the market and they determine the price and availability of credit to small businesses. This morning, it was reported that there has been a significant reduction in credit to small businesses since 2016. Business rates are still ignoring whether a business is profitable. Businesses are really stuffed with regard to the infrastructure around the country. The infrastructure is missing in areas where small to medium-sized enterprises are more important to the economy: for example, the midlands, the Border region and the western part of the country. Retailers are migrating online at a fierce rate. The Irish are the biggest online shoppers, with Irish consumers having spent over €6.5 billion online in 2017 and online spending set to rise to €10 billion in 2020. Most of this money is leaving the country. Not only is it leaving the high street, it is also leaving the country and shops are being closed as a result. </p>
            <p eId="para_691"> We heard this week from the ESRI that the domestic economy is likely to lose approximately €100 billion of turnover and 80,000 jobs over the next ten years. We know that SMEs are by far more exposed with regard to Brexit than the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector. We know that SMEs in the regional parts of the country are far more exposed. The Government has been involved in the development of some level of mitigation with regard to this area but I would contend, as I believe would most people in small to medium-sized enterprises, that it is nowhere near enough to deal with the challenges they are facing.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">I thank Deputy Tóibín for raising this important issue. I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for small business in 2016. My responsibilities have increased significantly since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> My Department and the agencies have developed a suite of advisory and financial Brexit supports for businesses. We are very conscious of the importance of small businesses. I will address some of the questions raised by the Deputy in my follow-up reply. For now, I will focus on Brexit. Exposure to the UK is likely to mean customs procedures, duties and consequent delays in moving and receiving goods, which is critical for SMEs. This is likely to impact business cashflow. As stated by the Deputy, for some businesses the impact of currency fluctuation is already being felt. To alleviate some of the cashflow impacts, the Government is introducing a number of measures, including a system of postponed accounting for all traders for a period after Brexit in order that businesses will not have to pay VAT at the point of import of their goods from the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_694"> The €300 million Brexit loan scheme provides working capital funding to businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to Brexit-related challenges. Once sanctioned, these loans can be drawn down if and when needed giving businesses peace of mind to focus on navigating their business through Brexit. Beyond this, my Department and the agencies are fully engaged in preparing for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events throughout the country. As part of awareness-raising activities, Enterprise Ireland continues to roll out regional Brexit advisory clinics. The 31 local enterprise offices, LEOs, and InterTradeIreland offer a range of Brexit-focused supports to businesses, including those engaged in cross-Border trade with Northern Ireland. The LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the LEO network nationwide, including tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges. Additional business advisers are being recruited to the 31 local enterprise offices to work with businesses to develop and implement a Brexit contingency-growth plan which will incorporate job and export market growth. Businesses should contact their nearest local enterprise office, Enterprise Ireland, EI, office or InterTradeIreland, ITI, office where they can find out more detail about a voucher worth €2,250 to help businesses navigate their way through Brexit and which can be used towards professional advice on Brexit issues such as customs, logistics and financial issues such as currency management. Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland also offer vouchers worth up to €5,000 and £5,000, respectively, which will enable companies to implement a change as identified in their Brexit plan. Some Members will have heard from local and national radio about the Enterprise Ireland PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the <i>PrepareforBrexit.com</i> website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and allows businesses to self-assess their Brexit exposure. </p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Turning now to some of the questions raised by the Deputy, the InterTradeIreland Brexit advisory service provides advice to SMEs on dealing with changes in cross-Border trading relationships. As part of the service, InterTradeIreland has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. Businesses can also avail of customs training through Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and the local enterprise offices where they can learn about customs concepts and procedures that will prepare them for trading with and through the UK post Brexit. </p>
            <p eId="para_696"> As the Deputy rightly said, the retail sector is undergoing an exciting but also challenging transformation as the digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and the EU. As chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, launched the online retail scheme in September 2018, which arises out of the forum working group on the issue of the digital economy. My Department has worked closely with the forum over the past two years to develop this scheme in line with the needs of the sector. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work being done by the forum. </p>
            <p eId="para_697"> I will respond to the remainder of the Deputy's questions in my follow-up reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">The Minister of State will forgive me if I am concerned about the gravity of the loss of €100 billion and 80,000 jobs to the economy over ten years versus a €300 million loan scheme; loans at interest rates of 4%, if sanctioned; a voucher scheme here and there; a diary of Government events and public meetings around the country, a website, some online courses, a series of information talks around technical matters and an InterTradeIreland body that is capped with regard to the number of staff it can employ in this time of crisis. If one juxtaposes the gravity of the situation and the Government's response to it, one finds it is nowhere near good enough. The Government should seize this opportunity to create a step change with regard to how it deals with small to medium-sized enterprise in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> Business functions via the path of least resistance so the Government needs to identify the elements that are resisting development around the country. Anyone involved in business knows that real insurance reform is radically needed, as is real banking reform that allows for natural credit to flow within society. Infrastructure is also important. We are losing services from Rosslare into France, which is ludicrous. The Government should be looking to invest in Rosslare, Cork, Waterford, Drogheda and Shannon-Foynes ports. It should be investing in the road and rail networks. Two weeks ago in this House, the Taoiseach spoke about €25 million being withdrawn from the Derry-Dublin motorway project, at a time when the North-South infrastructure should be developed. We should be looking for real North-South convergence across the business world and additional lorry parking and inspection posts in Ireland, as well as in places like Cherbourg. </p>
            <p eId="para_700"> My party, Aontú, wants to see the Government take small to medium-sized enterprise seriously into the future. We believe small to medium-sized enterprises should have a representative at the Cabinet table, rather than being dealt with by a junior Minister. </p>

            <p eId="para_701">Small to medium-sized enterprises are an integral part of the Irish business network. Only this morning, I launched the small to medium enterprise and entrepreneurship, SMEE, consultation group, which in conjunction with the OECD will draft a report on the SME sector in Ireland. The report will be an important one. I will also attend a working group dealing with this issue in Paris next week. I expect the report to deal with the past, the present and the future of the SME sector. It is hoped it will be published by the OECD with recommendations in the third quarter of this year. There was a huge turnout of businesses, SMEs, agencies, including Government agencies, at the event this morning, all of whom are very active in this area and want to get involved in the consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> As the Deputy rightly pointed out, SMEs are important to the economy because they are located in the regions, the counties and the communities. The purpose of the local enterprise offices is to provide mentoring and training to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">On the €300 million loan scheme, today the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, launched a future loan scheme to help SMEs and the farming sector to prepare for the future. There is a lot happening in this area, and we will continue to act in this way in the future as well, irrespective of Brexit, because we know that the indigenous industries and SMEs will be affected by Brexit in the future. We allocated approximately €1.8 million to the Craft Council recently. Enterprise Ireland got an additional €2.5 million. This is all part of an effort to help the SME sector, because it is really important.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">I welcome the many people in the Public Gallery, which is entirely full for the motion this evening. In particular I welcome the very large delegation from the IFA, led by its president, Mr. Joe Healy, and its livestock chairman, Mr. Angus Woods, accompanied by its general secretary, Mr. Damian McDonald. It has a very strong representation from throughout the country, including from my county, led by the Donegal chairman, Mr. Brendan McLoughlin. I also welcome Mr. Patrick Kent, president of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, and its general secretary, Mr. Eddie Punch, and, from the Beef Plan Movement, Mr. Eamon Corley, Mr. Mick Rafferty, Mr. Conal Tiernan and Mr. Seamus Scallon.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Our motion contains 14 key policy points, and we want the Minister, Deputy Creed, to act on them immediately. We are now in an immense crisis for the beef sector and the agrifood sector in general. It comes against the ever-changing backdrop of Brexit, the massive threat it poses to our agrifood sector, and the vista which has emerged in recent months of beef farmers losing money hand over fist in beef production, and finishing animals in particular. If not for the performance of the Government we would not have to move this motion tonight. It has demonstrated that it is totally tone deaf and has a lack of understanding of the pressure that many in our agrifood sector and many farmers are under. It has taken a very stiff-legged approach in reacting to the difficulties in this area. That is no surprise. The Taoiseach's instinctive response a few weeks ago, in a discussion on climate change, was to indicate that he would be eating less beef due to the issue. That is the kind of leadership offered by the Taoiseach, despite the fact that he is charged with leading the promotion of the agrifood sector internationally, along with Bord Bia, using the €50 million budget in place for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> Unfortunately, the record of the Minister, Deputy Creed, has been poor over the past couple of years in terms of responding to the needs of farmers. This was clear during the grain and tillage crisis a couple of years ago. It took a motion from Fianna Fáil to make the Government put a compensation scheme in place. The same is true of last year's fodder crisis, where it was clear that the Minister was not listening to the difficulties farmers were experiencing. It took another motion to make him move on that occasion. We are now facing the same in our attempts to convey the difficulties the beef and suckler cow sectors are under. A motion, opposed by the Minister and the Government, was passed by a large majority.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing our motion. However, accepting the motion is not enough. We have to see action, which is something which we have not seen in the past. The measures called for in this motion have to be taken seriously. Our 14 points range from the urgent need for clarity on the funding that will be made available in the event of a hard Brexit, but also the need for immediate aid for farmers, particularly our beef farmers, because of the massive pressure they are under. Unfortunately for farmers, Brexit is not just something that will happen in a couple of weeks but something that has been happening for months, and it has been hitting farmers directly in the pocket. There must also be a relaxation of state aid rules. The motion also calls for clear, serious action from the Government to improve the route to market for our live calf exports, especially by increasing capacity for lairage at Cherbourg port. Unfortunately, over recent months the Minister has been asleep on the job in terms of his responsibility to ensure that there is a proper route to market and that there is no cap imposed on the viable trade in live calf exports to Spain and Holland. The Minister has belatedly turned his attention to that, but it is too late. As a result, the chance to take one clear measure which would have resulted in the removal of some animals from the country at calf stage and avoided an oversupply in months to come was missed.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> The motion also calls for more transparency for our food chain and the transposition of the unfair trading directives recently brought in at European level. It also calls for the Government to work towards an increase of €200 per suckler cow and makes a clear call for the introduction of the Brexit loan scheme. I note that, just a few hours before the Minister was due in the Chamber to deal with the motion and almost 18 months after he initially promised to introduce the loan scheme, it was introduced, a few days ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 12 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I hope that the Minister, for once, will act on the motion which will pass tonight. I look forward to the contributions of others in this House and support across the floor for the 14 commitments and policy actions we are demanding today.</p>

          <p eId="para_746">I welcome my fellow farmers to the Public Gallery. The numbers present tonight show the huge depth of feeling around the crisis in the beef industry. All sectors of the beef industry are in serious trouble. Whether suckler farmers, calf-to-beef producers, store producers or finishers, everyone is losing money. The number of animals going through our processing plants at the moment is too high to provide a viable return for beef farmers. We have to look again at Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025. When a viable return is not given to primary producers, there is no point in producing beef for foreign markets. No initiatives have been taken to attempt to improve the situation of the beef farmer. We suggested a couple of months ago that more research should be carried out in the area of sexed semen. Nothing has been done in that area, but it must be addressed if cross-breeding is to continue into the future. Processors are now talking about dairy calf-to-beef systems and how profitable they can be. A number of years ago the same processors pressed people to go into Friesian and bull production, yet 18 months later left them high and dry. The way bull finishers were treated by the processors was despicable. Age limit and weight restrictions were used to put the final nails in the financial coffin of bull finishers.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> Articles are now being written which suggest that a dairy calf-to-beef is more profitable than suckling. The point is being missed. Nobody is making money. It is a question of losing as little as possible. Weight restrictions mean that fewer animals qualify for quality assurance. These are all things that the Minister should have made sure to address at the beef forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> We have not yet discussed the hazardous road of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Post Brexit, the EU will be 116% self-sufficient in beef production. Even with that scenario staring us in the face, the Commission has made concessions for Mercosur that will allow up to 100,000 tonnes of beef into an oversupplied EU market, which will be another nail in the coffin of the Irish beef industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> On umpteen occasions, we have heard fanfare about the number of open markets for our beef. We hear of 170 markets worldwide and live exports open in this market and that market, but very few cattle over 12 months of age are exported live. Mere wheelbarrows of beef are exported to markets outside the EU. My colleague has spoken about calf exports. The opportunity to return the market to a state of equilibrium and reduce the numbers available for slaughter in 18 to 20 months has been missed. The Minister's Department and Bord Bia have not risen to the task of putting the infrastructure in place to increase the number of calves exported from this country this spring. While the Minister will tell us that calf exports have increased, not enough have been exported. One can say anything about the percentages, but the markets for our calves exist yet we have not put the infrastructure in place to get calves out of this country in the numbers that are needed. Some weeks this spring, farmers had to accept poor prices for calves because lairage was not available on the Continent and ships were not available to take our calves.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is well able to tell us as farmers what to do and what we can and cannot do. Has it examined how beef factories operate? In January and February of this year, 54,000 cattle from factory feedlots were killed, which accounted for 17% of the kill, although it did not include contracted cattle. In 2018, 295,000 cattle from factory feedlots were killed. Factories operate a monopoly on price and manipulate the price with the number of cattle that come from factory feedlots, but the competition commission has not addressed this or refuses to examine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Farmers are making the decision to close the gates for the last time. Despondency is rife in our beef industry. We need concrete facts about how the Commission will manage Brexit and figures on the commitments. We need to know what financial aids will be put in place to try to salvage the industry. Farmers are turning their backs on the industry and we must reverse that trend now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_753">The Government must take urgent action to safeguard the livelihood of farmers in the beef sector. The motion features 14 policy actions which we believe the Government must accept immediately, including seeking market disturbance aid from the EU as outlined under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP; opening the Brexit loan scheme, which was first announced in 2017, to farmers; increasing live exports of calves by enhancing lairage capacity, as has been mentioned twice; ensuring that the next CAP is fully funded; and providing a €200 suckler cow payment, as well as the introduction of a beef market index. We also call for a full review of the quality payment system grid and more robust measures for carcass trimming and grading, including publishing details of on-the-spot fines for factories breaching carcass trimming rules. It is also my party's view that a new independent authority is required to enforce the new EU directive on unfair trading practices to ensure that farmers will buy in.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I received a response to a parliamentary question from the Minister yesterday which was full of terminology about the Department's acute understanding of the situation in which we find ourselves, bilateral discussions with the European Commissioner, Phil Hogan, and the position that the UK has taken on this and that, which presents various challenges for A, B or C. I read an awful lot of rhetoric but nothing by way of concrete Government action. We should be better placed than we are to absorb the potential hits to the beef sector, given that we have a man who is Irish, a member of Fine Gael and from Kilkenny in the position of European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, but the Government is failing to take advantage of this. This wait-and-see approach and the conveyance to the public via soundbite that it is a UK problem, which has been adopted by Fine Gael in the past two years, will not wash with the beef sector, which is all but obliterated. The beef sector and suckler farmers are at their wits' end. They can take no more from a Government that has shown only ambivalence to their challenges. Hard Brexit or soft Brexit, both scenarios are bad for the farming sector, although a hard Brexit could decimate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> It is an indictment of the Minister and the Government that farmers in this country, who produce the best beef in the world, having fed the cattle grass and reared them for between two and two and a half years, cannot make a profit from the animals. There is something wrong with the system in this country when farmers do not receive fair pay for what they produce. The Minister must wake up and see the wrong in that regard. Factories and cartels are creaming off but the man or woman who produces the animal for fillets of beef is being left behind. Something needs to be done to change the system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_756">Article 39.1(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that one of its objectives is "to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture". What are we doing to achieve that? What is Europe doing to achieve it? We are nurturing a system that has anti-competitive practices. The four movement rule, the 30-month age limit and a series of BSE-era restrictions throughout the world are hampering our marketing and our search for other markets. We have only three agricultural attachés in embassies outside Europe. We must get up to speed with the situation, stop talking the talk and represent farmers' interests. There are many measures in place, such as supermarkets selling products effectively below cost to bring in customers and make their margins on other products. There needs to be some form of food regulator or food ombudsman to ensure that farmers can meet the cost of production and earn a profit. There are issues with factories, multiples, anti-competitive practices, unnecessary restrictions and the need to sell to new markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> I have heard no talk of market supports. In theory, a hard Brexit could happen on 12 April. What is the situation with introducing intervention or aids to private storage? Has the Minister discussed the matter with the Commissioner in Brussels? What is the position? Can something like this be introduced overnight? We need to talk about it now, not when the horse has bolted. The payment of €200 per suckler cow for the first 20 cows in the herd is vital, as my colleague has outlined. Under Pillar 2 in any reform of the CAP, we should consider a viability grant for small holdings for farmers. These are the kinds of measures that are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> I welcome the various organisations in attendance, particularly the newest of them, which is the Beef Plan Movement. I appeal to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and other established organisations to listen to it and take on board the 86 issues that it has highlighted to improve the situation. It would be remiss of me not to welcome to the Gallery the newest female member of the national council of the IFA, Kathleen Henry BL. I ask the Minister to listen to this person because she has the expertise and knowledge of what small farmers in the engine room of the suckler cow herd in the west need. I hope that he will act on her recommendations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_759">The suckler cow herd of almost 1 million is pivotal in supporting the local economy in rural Ireland, with every €1 of support provided to suckler farmers generating more than €4 of economic activity in rural parishes. We need this badly because our villages and towns have fallen to rack and ruin. If not for rural farming people, many of them would have closed completely. Farming families underpin annual beef exports worth €2.4 billion, but these farms generate average incomes below €13,000 and fully depend on CAP to maintain their livelihoods. Average cattle-rearing farms earn an average income of €12,680 when suckler cow production is the dominant farm enterprise. I do not need to tell the Minister about the cost of beef production, and he knows well that beef farmers feel the squeeze. The average beef price is hovering at €3.75 per kilogram or lower and the average cost of production is €4 per kilogram. This is not sustainable, as the Government has heard over and over again. It had to be pulled kicking and screaming to bring in the allowance for the suckler cow and it brought it in at a rate of €40, but that is no good.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> My colleagues and I have only a short time during the debate to put forward our case. I am passionate about the issue because I was reared on a small farm. We will stand with the farming communities in attendance and fight for them in order that they might obtain a better deal. They cannot and will not survive on what is currently available. The president of the IFA recently stated the beef forum has not worked for the farming community, that it was a talking shop and that it is not achieving what it was supposed to achieve when it was set up by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">Let us get moving on this issue, give the people concerned a fair deal and back the Irish Farmers Association and the Beef Plan group which have put a significant number of people together to fight for a good, honest deal for the farming community.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">There is a crisis in the beef industry. Beef farmers are at the pin of their collar in selling their produce below cost. We know that no business is sustainable when selling below cost. We have heard false promises about the loan scheme which has taken almost two years to come to fruition. Meanwhile farmers in counties Cavan and Monaghan and across the country are going under. The Government has ignored the plea of farmers and been asleep at the wheel, while profitable untapped markets such as Holland and Spain have been completely ignored. Brexit has already affected farmers and factories are exploiting the critical situation in which beef farmers find themselves by manipulating the crisis and using Brexit as an excuse for putting farmers out of business. </p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The Minister has failed utterly on the issue of calf exports. Options are available to him to put in place infrastructure to address the issue, but he has been asleep at the wheel and done nothing to help hard-pressed farmers who are struggling to survive. He must secure additional funding for the CAP programme and achieve a suckler cow support programme, with €200 per cow. There is severe market disturbance afoot for farmers who are not even breaking even. Instability exacerbates the situation and the Government is doing nothing to secure or create a stable future for the industry. We are on the cusp of D-Day for Brexit and it is unforgivable that, at this late stage, there are no supports in place for farmers. Brexit poses one of the biggest ever threats to the beef sector, suckler cow farmers, exports and related jobs, given that almost 50% of our beef exports go to the United Kingdom. Farmers are losing money hand over fist and losing heart in the industry.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_764">I welcome the chance to contribute to the debate. As a beef farmer and Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I am keenly aware that beef farmers are going through a difficult time. A sustained period of low prices, following on from additional costs last year arising from the unprecedented weather events, has presented challenges for the sector. The prospect of a hard Brexit also presents a significant challenge, giving rise to continuing uncertainty. Given the scale of the challenges, I hope the debate will be constructive. It is very easy to criticise low prices and call on the Minister to condemn beef factories, but where will that get us?</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> As public representatives, we need to work collectively to consider how we can strategically support the beef sector to secure the future of beef farmers and their families. While the Government cannot determine commodity prices, it can support farmers through a range of schemes. These supports are critically important, especially for beef farmers. Ireland has established a major scheme for suckler cow farmers in its rural development programme. The beef data and genomics programme will provide beef farmers with some €300 million in funding in the current rural development programme period. It is aimed at improving the environmental sustainability of the national suckler cow herd by increasing its genetic merit and efficiency and reducing input costs on beef farms. In addition, the Minister, Deputy Creed, recently launched the beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme, a targeted support of €20 million for suckler cow farmers which is specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production. Beef farmers are beneficiaries of the €23 million in additional funding provided this year for the areas of natural constraint scheme, in addition to the delivery of the programme for Government commitment to provide €25 million. A legal framework and funding have been provided for the establishment of producer organisations. We are committed to the promotion of these groups across the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> The Minister is firmly committed to ensuring suckler cow farmers will continue to receive strong support under the next CAP. Critically, Ireland has called for the protection of the CAP budget and the Minister has engaged extensively with other member states to seek support for this position. The Taoiseach has indicated that Ireland is prepared to increase its net contribution to the EU budget but only if core policies, including the CAP, are protected. The motion calls on the Government to support low income farmers under the CAP. The current CAP is directing €100 million in payments from farmers on higher payments to farmers on lower payments and has introduced a cap on payments for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> On Brexit, the Minister and his officials have been working hard for quite some time to sensitise other member states and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors. The work undertaken has included a detailed analysis of the possible impact of the proposed UK tariff schedule in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit. It is clear that the imposition of such a regime would have serious implications for the beef sector in Ireland. With this in mind, the Minister held further bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on the issue on the margins of the Council of Ministers in Brussels just last week. The Minister stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and the exceptional aid provisions under the CAP's Common Market organisation regulation, as well as increased flexibility under state aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan has indicated that the European Union is ready to support Ireland and contact on these issues will continue as the situation evolves. The terms and conditions of any aid package will be announced in due course in the event that a disorderly Brexit occurs. We continue to hope this outcome can be avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> The value of Irish agrifood exports increased by 73% between 2009 and 2018, from €7.8 billion to €13.6 billion. This growth was driven by the strong reputation of Irish product in meeting the highest standards of food safety and animal welfare, quality and nutrition. Live exports are part of this dynamic and provide a critically important alternative market for farmers. In 2018 the volume of live exports increased by some 30%. The provision of lairage capacity at Cherbourg, an issue raised in the motion, is, of course, a commercial matter. However, the Minister has spoken to his French counterpart about the matter on a number of occasions and officials have also been in touch. Recently, the French authorities have approved an increase in lairage capacity in Cherbourg for approximately 400 bovines.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">Market development and diversification are also key responses to the challenges Brexit poses for the agrifood sector, especially the beef sector. In 2018 a number of additional markets were opened, including the Chinese beef market, following years of sustained effort. The economic partnership agreement recently signed between the European Union and Japan provides very welcome preferential access to the lucrative Japanese market. The other side of the coin is the protection of Irish interests in the context of international trade negotiations. Nobody has done more than the Government to protect vulnerable Irish sectors in international trade negotiations, including with Mercosur countries. The need to ensure Irish beef is protected will continue to inform our engagement in all such negotiations.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important motion. I speak not just as a Member of the Dáil but also as a farmer who has always championed the cause of agriculture and farmers in rural Ireland. It is an important sector which supports thousands of farmers in rural Ireland. I listened to Deputy Eugene Murphy speak about the demise of rural Ireland. It is unfortunate that we keep talking it down. Many good things are happening in rural Ireland, even though this is a difficult sector in which to be involved. It is important we realise the difficulties as it is easy to come up with motions and talk. Talk can be cheap, but it will not put an extra shilling in anybody's pocket. In the past fews weeks the committee which I chair, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, decided to put together all of the stakeholders involved, including the farm organisations and Meat Industry Ireland, to try to find out what the issues were and where things could be developed to make sure there was a successful outcome. We have received 22 submissions so far. In the coming weeks we will invite stakeholders to make their presentations to the committee. We will then produce a report which will I hope highlight what the challenges and strengths are.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> There are a couple of key points which I would like to make. The biggest challenge in the future will be presented by the CAP. In the past we engaged in very successful consultations and discussions on the CAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">A total of €12.5 billion will be delivered in the present CAP. It is important that we maintain that budget in the future. In any discussion on beef and agriculture we have to be honest with ourselves. It is very easy to talk about what can and cannot be delivered. I hear talk about a €200 suckler cow premium and I do think the suckler cow needs to be protected but we have to have an honest discussion about where that money will come from. Is it going to be taken from pillar 1, which would be detrimental? Pillar 1 is important for farmers to have certainty about where their money is coming from in future. Will money be taken from pillar 1, with a payment coming out of that with a negative effect on farmers' payments in future? Or will it come out of pillar 2, which would be challenging as well? We have to have that honest discussion. It is important to do our best to maintain that budget. Much work has been done already in that regard to make sure that when the multiannual financial framework, MFF, is decided later this year we at least maintain that budget. I compliment the Minister on bringing as many European countries as possible on board. Hopefully over the next few months we can have more unanimity to make sure we can get the cuts that have been proposed reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> We have heard much talk about live exports this year. We have seen them increase for dairy calves in particular. We need to nurture and manage these because if we do not we will have difficulties. We can keep talking about live exports in a negative way which could have a very negative effect on what will happen in the future. We need to be careful. Exporters need to come together to make sure they have a common plan. It is disappointing that has not happened. There have been many moves made to try to get them together. I welcome everybody who is here tonight in the Gallery and I ask them why they are not working together. If I was a cynic I would suggest they have an agenda because it suits them to pay €5 or less for a calf in the marts. It suits certain people to keep that price down. We need to see more action to ensure live exporters work together in a constructive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> On unfair trading practices, the decisions that have been made in Europe in recent weeks have been an important first step but we need to see more developments at local level in that regard. In these difficult times for agriculture we need more joined up thinking between all farm organisations working together with a common bond.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_445">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_776">Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I thank the sponsors of this motion. Sinn Féin is supporting it and I am glad to see that the Government will not oppose it. There have been many Private Members' motions passed here over the past few months which are sitting on shelves, going nowhere. It is up to the Government parties in particular to seize the nettle and push this motion forward and make sure its content is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> We could not emphasise strongly enough the crisis in the beef sector. It is probably the most neglected side of agriculture in this country. The crisis is probably at its worst insofar as those of us who come from rural Ireland know first hand the difficulties the beef farmers, particularly those in the more rural isolated areas are enduring. It would be remiss of me not to say that the control of the beef sector is in the hands of a cartel. This has been going on for years, unchecked. This cartel can decide when it wishes to reduce the price of beef and use it for its own very selfish reasons. The cartels are supported by feedlots. The feedlots are there for one purpose alone, to ensure that the price is suitable to the cartels. There is no way of dealing with this upfront. Brexit will create further problems unless they are confronted face on.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I doubt very much whether there would be such an interest in the beef sector were it not for the Beef Plan Movement and its work over recent months. I have attended approximately five of its meetings where many farmers turn up at cattle marts in the cold and dark of night to outline their grievances and what they hope to see happening. It is very encouraging for those of us who are active in trying to do better for people who live in that situation. It has forced this onto the agenda and I applaud them for it but it needs to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> We need to tackle and break these cartels. Part of doing that is a beef market index, as mentioned in the motion. There is a way to do this through legislation or something similar to what was brought forward in the United States. That means we know what the farmer gets for his beast and we know what the consumer pays for it but we do not know what the processor is selling it on to the multiples for. That is where there is a huge gap. If we could get all-party agreement on legislation to make it mandatory for the processors to declare weekly what they are selling to the multiples for and the discount the multiples are getting from them, then we would see the massive gap between what the consumer pays and the producer gets. That is something positive we can do together, if the political will exists to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> The expanding dairy sector is a big problem. In any mart around the country, it is almost invariably Friesian calves that are coming on the market. I have seen fine bull calves bought for €30 and €50. Mother of God Almighty, that is just giving them away. Someone has to try to do something to ensure there is a sustainable quality of calves coming through so that we can get the best value internationally for our beef.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Another fierce worry I have is what is happening within the EU and the Mercosur initiative. Apparently 99,000 tonnes of beef will come into the European market, which will put extra pressure on the farming community and the beef sector even this side of Brexit. This is coming in because Germany wants to sell car parts to South America and it is pushing the deal for its benefit. That will affect our little island. That is why we need the Government to do everything in its power to ensure that this market is protected and that no animals can come into the EU unless they are subject to the same stringent checks and balances, health and safety measures and traceability applicable to animals produced within the EU. I saw a fantastic TV programme made by the IFA in South America which showed the type of beef that will have access to the European market. Certainly after Brexit - if the Brits bow out - it will go into the British market and inevitably will find its way in here and into Europe. There are wild herds with no traceability whatsoever which could bring in foot and mouth and other diseases. I am glad everybody is on board here tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> The 70-day retention period for quality assurance, the 13 months for steers and heifers, the 16 months for bulls, the grading machinery and the excessive trimming: all of that was very well explained by the Beef Plan Movement to everybody present.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The situation in that regard also needs to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> The 125 km transport restriction is causing great problems owing to the trimmings that are being taken. It is almost inevitable that this is profit for the cartels and the beef factories. It is not going back into the farmer's pockets. They are at a loss again in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> I again welcome everybody from the farming sector and the beef sector here tonight. We need to try to assure them that all of us will work collectively together for their interests. I assure them, on behalf of my party, that I am not one bit afraid to tackle Larry Goodman or his ilk for what they have done to the Irish market and the way they have controlled it, manipulated it and used it for their selfish interests. We need to stand together with each and every farmer here today to ensure they will get a fair and decent price and that they will get the justice to which they are entitled and deserve.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBuckley" eId="spk_446">
          <from>Deputy Pat Buckley<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_786">I also welcome the opportunity to speak here tonight. For the people who are looking in from outside the Pale, I want to educate those who are looking on and to paint a picture of the position of members of the farming community and how much pressure they are under. We all know that farmers are getting very low prices for their beef, which is not covering the cost of production, especially not at this time. More importantly, we know that Irish beef is probably the finest quality beef in the world. Some countries may not agree with that but we have the grass production and we have everything going for us here. It is a product and we cannot expect beef farmers to sell their product below cost. We are aware that it is roughly working out at €3.75 to €3.85 per kilogram for this product and that surely is well below the cost of production. We also know there are more than 950,000 suckler cows on approximately 66,000 Irish farms, and suckler farmers continue to depend on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, direct payments for their average income, which is just below €13,000 a year. More startling than this is that at present, approximately 13% of Irish beef is exported outside the EU, but with the current Brexit situation, what is more worrying is the fact that 50% of Irish beef is going to Britain. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, the British have threatened tariffs on Irish agrifood, which would spell absolute disaster for the sector. Again, a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for the Irish beef sector with World Trade Organisation tariffs of 70% on exports entering the UK, which in turn would result in an additional cost of nearly €780 million, while the price of beef produced by our farmers would fall to an estimated €2.50 per kilogram. This scenario is potentially a major disaster waiting to happen and many livelihoods will be lost and more and more families will be facing very tough times ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Something that is being lost in this debate is the effect of what is happening on families. Farms could potentially shut down. People who have families will not have an income. People will struggle with houses, mortgages, debts and loans. There is obviously a knock-on effect there where that feeds into family life. There is the potential for marriage break-ups and it goes on and on. Mental health problems are also possible due to the stress and strain. Another problem is that many of our young farmers will possibly emigrate. One thing that could help struggling farmers at present is the Brexit loan scheme for farmers, fishermen and food businesses. Members mentioned that it was announced in October 2017 and we found out in the past hour or two that this proposal has been approved by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, which I welcome. That is a positive start but maybe it is a little too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Another matter I want to address is what we should be doing about working toward a fully funded and fair CAP after 2020. We need to safeguard these direct payments and this in turn would support all low-income farmers, including beef farmers. It also would protect the beef sector and suckler farmers in all upcoming European Union trade deals, which is something to which we must look forward in our forward planning. I urge our Commissioner in Brussels to get the finger out, open his mouth and start shouting on behalf of the farmers of this country. It is another heartbeat here, we have a fabulous reputation and it was not built willy-nilly; it was built on fact, on production and on what the farmers produce in this country. It does not matter if it is poultry or whatever it is. I ask the Government to get real on this. I know the Government is not opposing this motion tonight but we have had many motions passed in here where nothing has happened. As we also have had all-party agreements on certain matters where we can push through, there is political will.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I want to touch briefly on how farmers have lost faith in the quality pricing system. My information is that the uptake for producer organisations in the beef sector has resulted in zero registrations with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine since the legal basis was given to producer organisations in 2016. That is not a very positive outlook. Farmers have been losing faith and we do not want them to lose faith again. This time they are probably losing faith in the Government and I ask the Government not to let them down and to do the right thing here because as I said, there are massive implications, not only within the beef sector but within the farming sector as a whole. A Member opposite mentioned rural communities a while ago. Let us be honest, where there is an action there is an instant reaction. If we start losing families and rural farms, and this is not anti-rural, the knock-on effect of that is that local businesses are affected, schools are affected and it goes on and on. I appeal to the Government to state it is in support of the motion. I call on the Government to get behind it. Let us all do the right thing and support the farmers of this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">We are sharing in the interest of social solidarity. First, I welcome everyone here. Some people have travelled some distance so they are all very welcome tonight. The Labour Party will be supporting this motion and I am glad the Government is not opposing it because we absolutely need to do everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> I live in a quite rural constituency but I also come from a dairy farm and I live in a large farming area. To protect the rural economy we need to address what is put down in this motion. On top of that, we obviously have the whole shenanigans that are ongoing with Brexit, which is changing as we stand and sit here tonight. The consequences could be potentially disastrous for one of our most important industries, with the UK Government indicating in its published draft that protectionist tariffs would remain for beef and dairy products, even if the British widely apply zero tariffs in other areas. We have to think of how we will address this issue. As there is no doubt that any restriction for beef exports to the British market will cause huge, immediate and intense difficulties, every effort needs to be made to look at alternative markets and to put in place measures to assist all of the farmers and exporters to open up to new markets and increase market share in markets where we already have a foothold. However, even if the UK does crash out with no deal, it is highly likely that they will have to return to negotiate a trade deal with the EU and deal with the issues we are talking about tonight almost immediately, which we also need to prepare for as a contingency. We will have to see what happens after this week and the coming weeks to deal with all the issues that have been outlined by me and by others in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I want to deal with the fact that we have been saying to the Government for months that it will have to put supports in place to save jobs and businesses that are at risk in these worst-case scenarios. On what we know is going on around the country, I meet farmers all the time who are at their wits' end with their financial situation. There have been many public meetings and we really need to look at the pricing model and to create a sustainable, consistent pricing model for farmers inasmuch as that is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">There is no doubt that the cost of production means we have farmers selling below cost at present and that cannot be allowed continue. I agree with those who have spoken about the business model of beef processing, how it is structured and its whole cartel nature. I spent three summers working in meat factories in order to go to college. I know what they are like. I know where they have come from and where they are going, and it is not nice and cannot continue. As a country and an industry, we need to stand up to that and to do so pretty quickly because of everything else that is going on. I support those who are trying to mobilise and deal with this issue because what is going on is not sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> In the limited time I have, I will deal with some of the issues in the motion before us. I absolutely agree with the suggestion in the motion that the Government should look at relaxing the EU state aid limits in this period of uncertainty and crisis. This is something I have spoken about at length before. We need to use the leverage we have to change the state aid limits in respect of this sector. It was done before and can be done again. In addition, the Government should ensure that the EU's European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is available to support food industries. I was an MEP for two years and as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was used for a number of other sectors and industries, I cannot see why it could not be used for these sectors as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The contingency that most worries me is the risk that the UK will engage in a cheap food policy whereby it would let in food from outside the EU that might not meet our quality standards. There has been a lot of mention of chlorinated chicken in the media but what about hormone-treated beef from the United States or cheap beef from Brazil or Argentina? I note that the motion calls for no increase in beef access in any trade deal between the EU and South American countries in Mercosur, presumably for precisely this reason. However, if the UK is outside the EU and opens the floodgates, there is a risk that we could permanently lose market share for beef in the UK which, over a period of time, despite the best will in the world of any new trade agreement, will be difficult to replace. I want to know that the Government is engaging in serious planning around all these scenarios and to date I do not have confidence that it is all happening. We need to look strategically at how we will deal with these competing threats based on different scenario outcomes over the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> There are other suggestions in the motion that I also support, such as securing additional funding under the CAP for suckler cow payments. This is absolutely necessary. These farmers are totally dependent. We need to leverage our position to get additional funding. We also need to look at transposing the EU directive on unfair trading practices into Irish law in order to support farmers. There undoubtedly are other measures like this that need to be supported. There is no doubt but that there is pressure on the sustainability of livestock farming in this country. As the son of a dairy farmer, I have to say that the Taoiseach's flippant remarks about eating less beef were extremely badly received, not alone in my constituency but across the country in respect of an industry that is obviously struggling. </p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Other issues I do not have time to deal with include the staging of production and production limits and how we can manage that better into the future, as well as the other incentives we can put in place for farmers; agricultural emissions; finding other sources of income for farmers to make a decent living; and ensuring we can mitigate against costs that could be coming down the line because farmers cannot take more shocks. They are completely caught without the ability to be flexible enough to deal with the shocks that are hitting the sector. We have to create a far more sustainable situation with Government support and flexibility from the EU in order that they can deal with issues that are hitting them.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">I thank Deputy Kelly for sharing his time with me. I join others in welcoming the IFA, the ICSA and the Beef Plan Movement to the Gallery for this important debate. It is striking that the Gallery is full. In my years in this House we have seen many debates on agriculture for which the Chamber was full yet it is striking that there is such poor attendance by many Deputies this evening, although farming is the backbone of rural Ireland beyond the Pale. We need to set that in context. The Minister knows that farming is a very precarious occupation and there is great uncertainty. It behoves him, the Government and all of us to ensure that this uncertainty is mitigated as much as possible. Unfortunately we have not seen enough action from the Minister or the Government to mitigate that uncertainty or reassure our farm families. There are 4,500 farm families across Limerick engaged in various forms of farming such as dairy, beef etc., and they are very worried, particularly with the backdrop of Brexit. On the beef issue, which we are primarily discussing today, how can any farmer or farm family be expected to survive when, although prime beef is retailing on the shelf at €22 per kilogram, the farmer is getting €3.70 for it? He or she is selling it below cost. We cannot continue to stand over a situation where we are engaged in below-cost selling. It is just not sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> In the context of Brexit, I have heard the Minister and the Taoiseach say on many an occasion that they, the Government and the European Union stand ready, willing and able to step in to support our farming sector and our farm families. However, they have not given us any detail. They have not told us what kind of money or funding is available. We have detailed 14 actions in our Private Members' motion, which the Government is accepting. I urge the Government to give the farm families of Limerick and Ireland some detail as to how much money it will have at its disposal to help them once Brexit kicks in.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">I welcome the opportunity to address this issue. I compliment Deputy McConalogue and the agricultural team on putting down this motion because we have been in a real crisis in agriculture over the past 12 or 18 months. Many people are saying it was the inclement weather during 2018 but the factors that have led to the crisis in agriculture today are much greater than that. We are at a crossroads. I am a small suckler farmer myself. I have seen the challenges at first hand right across the beef sector and they are creeping into the dairy sector as well. Fundamentally, the challenges have manifested themselves in terms of the calves this spring. In many parts of the country, we have seen the demise of the mountain sheep farmer. I predict that unless something very serious is done, we will see the wipe-out of the suckler farmer and the beef farmer. There will be whole swathes of countryside, particularly marginal land, where we will see land abandonment. We see it already in some of the most marginal parts of the country. In the Sliabh Luachra area and right across the Cork, Kerry and Limerick borders there is significant potential for land abandonment. Over the past six or eight months, there have been massive meetings in marts and elsewhere by the Beef Plan Movement and that has manifested itself in terms of the crisis that they see at the farm gate and the challenges they see. We really have to make sure we stand up to the crisis. Farmers are under mental health stress and beset by financial challenges. They have a whole variety of challenges and they do not see any markets for their product. They are proud people. We have built up a massive industry under regulation after regulation over the last 25 or 30 years. We have the best product on the international market but we are not doing enough to make sure we give them the lifeline. On the markets, particularly for the dairy calves this year, there is no attempt made to get the calves to the market as fast as possible. There are great challenges. There is a raft of changes that are looked for under the beef plan and elsewhere. It has to be implemented and we have to challenge the <i>status quo</i>.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">The seanfhocal "Mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhaidh tú féar" or for those not too familiar with it "Live, horse, and you'll get grass" reminds me of the Government's attitude particularly since the onset of Brexit. The farming community is not seeking a handout; it is seeking the Minister's hand at the tiller supporting them, encouraging them and seeking the necessary measures to make it viable. No farmers here want a handout; they want a hand up.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> The crisis in our beef industry has been severely compounded by stock numbers and the uncertainty of Brexit. In 2018 we had the highest kill in 15 years, with 1.8 million cattle killed, 80,000 more than in 2017. Over a five-year period, the increases ranged from 40,000 to 120,000. Obviously those increased numbers have had an impact on both supply and demand. The perfect storm has been brewing and the Minister has known about it for a long time, right from the onset of the mushroom crisis when Brexit was announced, and coupled with this, the increased production I have mentioned has tipped the supply balance on the scales.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Farmers say that meat factories are making money and there is no doubt that they are. However, they are also struggling to sell prime cuts that have reduced from €8 per kilogram to €5 per kilogram. Many will claim there is a silver bullet with China or the wider Asian market, but we all know that they are mainly looking for the cheap cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> From a farmer's perspective, a poultry farmer in Poland can fix his price 12 months in advance. A grain farmer in Ireland can forward sell his grain. The relative success of the milk production in Ireland in the past five years has been based on farmers knowing well in advance the price per litre. I firmly believe it is time for the beef manufacturers and the beef producers to become friends and deliver what is needed for this industry, which is forward pricing.</p>

          <p eId="para_807">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue and I welcome the those with a farming interest who are in the Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Irrespective of whether we have a hard Brexit, soft Brexit or indeed no Brexit, the beef industry is in crisis and action needs to be taken. Along with my colleagues in Kerry, I have attended various meetings of the Beef Plan Movement. We have attended lobbying events by the IFA. The issue has been creeping up over recent years. If an industry was in such a crisis with the potential loss of €1 billion to the Irish economy, task forces would be set up, state aid would be provided and all sorts of interventions would be made, but unfortunately we are pulling and dragging through this crisis. We need action now.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> As my colleagues have pointed out, the quality payments system is no longer fit for purpose. New markets, such as the Chinese market, are not coming on stream. Licences are still pending and not being done quickly enough. Issues such as the four-movement rule, the 70-day retention and the age limits of 30 months for steers and heifers and 16 months for bulls are all contributing to the crisis and yet not enough action is being taken. Other practices and regulations requiring review are the nomad rule, the 125 km category 1 waste transport rule, factory-owned and controlled feedlots, and beef processors having access to farmer data. There is still no payment for the fifth quarter, which is worth approximately €200 to the processors, and yet the producer is not getting a cent of it. We need to tackle all those issues now to address the crisis that is on top of us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_810">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the motion. It is not just now that the beef sector is on its knees; it has been on its knees for a few years. An animal killed in England two or three years ago was making €150 to €200 more because of a cartel in existence here. The Minister needs to tackle the feedlots. In the past few months, 70% of cattle were wheeled out to ensure that the cattle the farmer was bringing to the factory were held at bay. Some 10,000 more cattle were killed last year for the same weights. Unless we put manners on the factory feedlot system, we are going nowhere. Once we go over a kill of 30,000 a week, the farmer's trousers are basically pulled down because the factories will use him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Other Deputies spoke about the 70-day rule. If cattle come from a Bord Bia-approved farm and go to another one, the 70-day rule should not apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> We have no say on Mercosur but we have to boycott extra beef trying to come into the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> On beef genomics, we are now breeding cattle that are not the same frame and we are losing some live exports. Bord Bia needs to get involved with the live exporters. There is a major opportunity there. The Government also needs to get involved in lairage facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The Government also needs to do something about this vegan advertising campaign in cities - whoever is funding it - trying to put people off beef when the best medical evidence is that people should eat a certain amount of it. In my opinion what the Taoiseach came out with in this regard is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> We need to put a foot under the family farms. Every day we see more small farmers going. If the new CAP does not front-load the payments for the small farmer, if the family farm is not protected, which the Minister does not seem to be worried about, we can say goodbye to 300,000 jobs in the country. Does the Minister want what the Brits are trying to do at the moment? Does he want landlordism back in Ireland and drive the people into the cities or does he want to get up and work with people to ensure they get the opportunity to live and work in the areas they come from and, above all, to be able to make a living from the farm as they could down through the years? They are leaving farming day by day. The statistics show what is going on. The reason is that the Government is making sure the big guy is looked after while the small fellow is kicked around the place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_816">I also welcome the motion and the debate is needed. As the Minister and many people in the Gallery will know, I have been perceived to be anti-farmer at times, which I vehemently deny. I have been very critical of Government policy, which has led to many problems for farmers. I believe we are overproducing. I believe the emissions from the dairy and beef herd are an issue. Increasing the dairy herd by close to 50% has, of course, had a knock-on effect on the beef cattle numbers. Too many cattle need to be killed every week and there is an oversupply. There is no control on it; there is no measure. The Government could play an active role in putting a measure on it. Farmers can pay big money in a mart for a six or seven-month old calf from a suckler cow, but they have no idea how much they will get for it at the end. There is very little measure of what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> Farming is probably our only indigenous industry and it is really important to protect it. Protecting it means changing the direction in which we have been going. We need to diversify more. Some Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke about the suckler herd, which is the bread and butter of farming in Ireland. I know many small farmers in my area who depend on it for their livelihood. However, people seem to be driven out of it and towards the dairy side. We know that efficient finishers, the ones who convert feed into meat weight, are not the ones coming from the dairy calves, but from the suckler cows. Our industry was built on it. The Government is ignoring the suckler cow farmers, who are generally the smaller farmers and the ones getting the most help are the ones who least need it, namely, the big dairy farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> I do not understand why there has not been more thought as to the direction we are taking. The Fianna Fáil motion also deals with the additional imports from South America. At a European level it would be crazy for Ireland to allow South American or US meat to come into Europe, to come into Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I was told by a Munster wholesale meat supplier about some of it being brought in illegally on a boat into Cork 18 months ago with the identities of the meat being cut off, which is something about which we should be very worried. There is no comparison between meat produced here and meat produced in South America and in the US. I would be wary that such meat would get into Europe eventually, which would be a disaster not only for our farming sector but for our health. </p>
          <p eId="para_820"> I know many reasonably small farmers who have gone into the dairy sector. The banks have pushed money on them but when problems arise the same banks will quickly look for that money back or for the land security. Many small farmers have gone into the dairy sector or expanded their dairy herds and gone into great debt, and it has not been a wise decision. The Government has a much more positive role to play in this area. There must be some control over it. We cannot keep over-producing. We must have some control over exactly what we produce. There must be more protection and more Government interest in the suckler herd end of farming. It is obvious the number of small farmers has been declining for many years. Government policy can change that. If it does not do anything about it, the number of small farmers will further decline.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_821">I, too, welcome this discussion. We have a crisis in agriculture. It is real in terms of the impact on the environment and on the farmers' livelihoods and for the reason outlined by Deputy Niall Collins. He made an interesting observation in pointing out that years ago, a discussion on farming would have seen the Chamber full but there are very few Deputies present for this debate. The reason is that many of our small farmers have been driven to the wall. Farming families have had to pack up in essence because the big guy dominates and the numbers are down. We need to address this crisis and to put measures in place. In that sense, I very much welcome this discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> As Deputy Wallace said, there are many problems. One of them is a crisis of over-production. What is happening is ridiculous. We have so much stock piling up that the meat processors have said cold storage capacity in Ireland is critically short. As other Deputies have said, if there is a hard Brexit, or any Brexit for that matter, our beef surplus will increase. It is crazy that we are talking about an industry with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of beef and nowhere for it to go. That is wrong on so many levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> There are a couple of solutions to it. The first is to produce less beef. Such an approach is not anti-farmer, rather it is pro-humanity and pro-farmer. It is not saying we would lead the farmers into the wilderness, rather it is saying we must put alternatives in place to allow them secure their livelihood in a more sustainable way. I have no problem with the Taoiseach's remarks about eating less beef. I am a vegetarian. My daughter is a vegan and I am seriously considering being a vegan. There are many agricultural products that come from plants. That approach is not anti-farmer. We have to develop a better way of looking at things. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> It is a fact that agriculture accounts for a staggering one third of Ireland's national greenhouse gas emissions. They are going up when they should be going down. Contrary to the Minister's statements, we are not the most carbon-efficient dairy producer in Europe. From statistics published last year, we are one of the most carbon-intensive beef producers and the third most intensive diary producer. As the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, has said, this could end up costing all of us €5.5 billion in fines by 2030 if the Government does not take serious action. It is in everybody's interest that we address this problem to support the livelihood of farmers. </p>
          <p eId="para_825"> Another way in which the Minister could deal with the over-production is to assist farmers in opening up new markets. We had this discussion yesterday with respect to the problems being experienced with a lucrative market in Iran that is crying out for Irish beef because of all of the faults with Iranian beef. The Minister told us yesterday that the market is open but he seemed to imply that the problem did not lie with the Government but with the farmers. He said the market is open but it has to be more rewarding. Obviously selling to Iran, which is a very developed market, is much more rewarding than some of the carry-on that is going on here but there are other factors at play here. If the Government was serious in assisting farmers in this respect, it knows what the Iranians want - which is what they have from every other European country that is selling massive amounts of its agricultural products to the benefit of its farmers - which is an embassy on the ground because it allows us to be much more in touch with what is going on there. It is ludicrous that the Minister would suggest that it is somehow the farmers' fault that the market is not open enough when the problems with that market have been readily addressed in other areas and farmers in other states are benefitting very well from that. We should go the extra mile to ensure that our farmers are able to trade in that market. To me, the onus is much more on the Government than on the farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I welcome this motion introduced by Fianna Fáil. Beef farmers face an uncertain future and nowhere more than in west Clare do we realise that. In many parts of rural Ireland small beef farmers are under severe threat, receiving low prices for their beef cattle at the factory and at the mart. Even a negotiated Brexit will result in many beef farmers' livelihoods becoming unsustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> In an effort to maintain sustainability, a new movement, Beef Plan, has been developed. It is a growing movement offering an alternative to the existing meat factory proposing better prices and more control over the industry. Many farmers sell their cattle at prices well below the cost of production and Brexit will drive many farmers out of business. The Beef Plan meetings that have been held around the country have attracted up to 400 farmers demanding a changed percentage that they get for their product. Many farmers get only 20% of what the consumer pays for their product, with 50% going to supermarkets and 30% going to the meat factories. That is unsustainable. </p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Beef Plan proposes a minimum basic price for beef which covers production plus a sustainability margin. It organises farmers into groups which can represent themselves and, most important, it proposes to create a fair trade brand to allow customers to know that the product they are buying is from a producer who has been treated fairly and has been paid a fair price. This is a ground-up movement. Without this, farmer viability is not sustainable and the industry will collapse.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I thank Deputy McConalogue for bringing this motion before the Dáil. I welcome everybody who has come here this evening. This is a most important issue. Farmers across the country are on their knees. The suckler herd is under threat. Farmers' incomes are perilously low. It is unfair to think that farmers are in a position where they will literally give away calves. What is happening is sinful. Dairy farmers are selling calves for €10 or €20 and in many cases they are giving them away for nothing. On the other hand, when a person produces a calf into beef and goes to the mart or to the factory, I am talking about people who are relying on this income, all they are left with is a big bill in the local co-operative to try to play for their ration. It is a crying shame what is happening them. The Minister knows this in his heart and soul.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> I thank the people who organised the Beef Plan meetings. People such as Mr. Eamon Corley and our own Mr. Dermot O'Brien from Firies were instrumental with other people in organising those meetings. I thank the farmers for going to those meetings. This is not a case of one organisation working against the Irish Farmers Association, rather it is a number of organisations which are all united in trying to help farmers to get a fair price. If they do not get a fair price, the farming unit, as we know it, will collapse because they will not be able to continue. All we want is fair play and a fair income for our farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">The beef farmer has increasingly been squeezed out of business in recent years. The very mention of Brexit a few years ago gave the perfect excuse for the factories to cut their prices which are down from 25 cent to 40 cent per kilogram or approximately €150 per head.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">This is a serious concern. Beef farmers are losing money and many of them will not be able to survive and stay in business. The price cuts have happened before Brexit has even hit us. There are over 170,000 people employed directly in the agrifood industry, while 250,000 are employed indirectly in the wider rural area. The impact of Brexit will be felt across rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I am shocked and appalled at the lack of urgency and concern the Government has shown to the beef farmers of Ireland. What they have gone through and continue to go through as they try to provide an income on their family farms is a scandal. I have called for the opening of an embassy in Tehran. Why has no effort been made to do so? When I mentioned it to the Taoiseach two weeks ago, he mentioned everywhere in the world, but he never mentioned where we would be able to sell our beef and perhaps do something for farmers. Why will the Government not agree to have a stand-alone Minister for agriculture? It needs to support farmers by ensuring a meaningful support package from the European Union will be put in place. There is no question but that the Mercosur trade deal must be suspended. We need to see live exports being supported with more lairage facilities and an increase in ferry capacity. The Government needs to acquire further markets for live cattle exports. In addition, it is vital that the suckler cow grant be €200 per cow, not the mean €40 the Government gave.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">I thank Fianna Fáil for bringing forward this timely and important motion. I welcome all those in the Visitors Gallery. It shows the concern people around the country have. There is the same concern in County Kerry where there have been savage attendances at Beef Plan meetings. We thank the people involved for organising and attending the meetings. They are putting their shoulder to the wheel and saying enough is enough and that they are not going to take any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The Minister is not doing enough for live exports or to provide adequate lairage facilities in Cherbourg for calf exporters. He is not doing enough for the suckler cow men. There was a farmers' meeting in Sneem the other night and everyone in attendance was over 75 years. That is what is happening. Young people are falling away from farms and that trend is going to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> I appeal to the Minister and the Government. Deputy Creed is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The Government will be remembered for what it does and what it will not do. This is its time. Farmers are on their knees and their heads are down. It is up to the Minister and the Government to do something to create more live exports. The rules the factories are using are keeping down prices for farmers. They include the four movements rule, the 24-month rule, the 30-month rule and the 70-day retention period. It is the Minister who must talk to the factories and bring them to task and ensure they are not using their monopoly against the farmers. He must take off his coat and go out. Charles Haughey went to Libya and into a tent with Colonel Gaddafi. Surely the Minister is as good and can do something like that and make a name for himself. This is the time to do it because farmers are on the ground. In the last couple of weeks there has been a small market for bulls in Turkey and already it is making a difference in places such as Castleisland in County Kerry.</p>

          <p eId="para_843">Last night the Minister informed me that since 2014, 38 beef grading machines had been found in unannounced inspections by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials to be outside the legal tolerance limit of a mere 60% accuracy. To put it in plain English, on 38 occasions the grading machines were getting the grades wrong for more than four out of every ten animals that were being graded. The mechanical grading machines in use in beef plants across the country today were first trialled and tested over 20 years ago. The fact is that technology has come a long way since. At the time the machines were first tested, if we wanted to look something up, we had to look at an encyclopaedia. We do not need one today. The incorrect grading is having a significant impact on the payments received by farmers. The Minister must justify why Northern Ireland rules for the exact same grading machines require them to be checked every day but for grading machines in the Republic of Ireland reports are only produced on a weekly basis. Why is it that grading machines have only to be 60% accurate when they could easily be more than 90% accurate? There is a need for new grading machines and we need new rules to operate them that will be enforced by departmental officials to ensure they will not be exploited and that farmers will also not be exploited.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">I am very proud to be a member of the party that has brought forward the motion. Fianna Fáil does not just talk the talk, it walks the walk. I am very glad that the Government will not be opposing it and that we are receiving support from across the House. I welcome all of the people in the Visitors Gallery, particularly from the farm organisations. I urge them to work together. We are all in this together and it is important that everyone sing from the same hymn sheet. If we even left with that much tonight - with everyone working together - it would be fantastic.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> Without doubt, the beef sector is in crisis. Farmers across Cork South-West are literally on their knees and desperate. With respect, the Minister has been asleep at the wheel and continues to be. Last August or September was the time he should have made sure live exports would be run more smoothly. That was the time to make sure lairage and other export facilities would be up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> I welcome the loan scheme, even though it was very late in coming, having been announced 18 months ago. It was probably the thought of me going out onto the Plinth this morning that made the Minister make sure it would be introduced today. Therefore, I will go out onto it more often. However, although I welcome the scheme, it is a loan. I would have preferred if it was a grants system. While the Minister is constrained by the amount of cash available, a loan must be paid back and farmers are already struggling. In all of this, I urge the Minister not to forget fishermen in Cork South-West. Especially with Brexit coming, he needs to engage more with the fishermen of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">Beef farmers are under phenomenal pressure. My colleagues and I have raised this issue with the Minister repeatedly and it is well known across the country. Average incomes are between €12,000 and €13,000, which is just not sustainable. Farmers are producing beef for about €4 a kilogram, while they are getting €3.75 to €3.85 a kilogram in return. That cannot last. They do not believe their needs are being addressed by the Minister. They are under phenomenal pressure and although they are reaching out looking for support, the Government does not seem to be delivering for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> There is a move away from suckler cows. We have seen this in my area, for example, in Macroom, where some 1,100 suckler cows have left the mart area in the last while. The reason is that farmers believe they cannot make money on them. They are even under pressure if they try to expand and make ground against the milk farmer. When people are pushed out of beef farming, it means that there is less money circulating locally. Every euro the Minister or other Ministers provided in support generated €4 in the rural economy, but that money is going to be pushed out if support is not provided for farmers. We have highlighted the figure of €200 repeatedly, but all they are getting is about €40. I say "about €40" because the figure can change, depending on the number of cattle in the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme. It needs to be much more substantial. The Minister needs to work towards that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> On the issue of lairage, it should have been foreseen well back last year that there would be a bottleneck.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">It should have been addressed much more quickly so that it did not become a bottleneck. Tá fíorbhrú ar fheirmeoirí mairteola agus caithfear an beart a dhéanamh ar a shon. Mar sin, iarraim ar an Aire gníomh ar son fheirmeoirí mairteola go tapaidh.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">I hope the Government's acceptance of this motion this evening is not a political response aimed at deflecting criticism and giving the Minister cover as he proceeds. The motion tabled by Deputy McConalogue contains 14 proposals that the Government is now signing up to but what we have not seen so far is any sense of urgency or even a belief that there is a crisis here. The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, spoke about a lot of things that are in the distance, including the next CAP programme but there are many in the Gallery this evening and around the country who will not survive the current CAP programme because of the Government's lack of urgency. I contrast the lack of urgency in dealing with the beef situation with the fact that we are sitting tomorrow evening to deal with emergency legislation on sea-fisheries. The Government has put a considerable amount of work into resolving that issue and we need to see the same sense of urgency directed at the beef sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> We have a broken beef market and the people paying the price for that are not the beef barons but farmers and particularly the small farmers of this country. We have a broken market in which the Government refuses to ask the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to intervene. The Minister is dilly-dallying, along with his colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. They do not seem to understand the need for intervention. Why are farmers here getting so much less than what consumers are paying for beef? Why is Irish beef being sold at a price that is so much lower than that being paid in the UK and across Europe? We need answers to these questions from the independent authorities equipped to provide them.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Like Deputy Niall Collins, I am also struck by the paucity of the attendance in the Chamber this evening. If any other organisation had mobilised tens of thousands of people in the way that the IFA and the Beef Plan movement have done, it would be headline news and there would be a full Chamber this evening. It seems that we are determined to take our farmers for granted and to leave them behind. We do not need words from the Minister and we do not need him accepting motions for the sake of it. We need action.</p>

          <p eId="para_854">I hope the Minister will take heed of the comments made in the Chamber tonight. Beef prices are unsustainably low and farmers cannot live on an annual income of €13,000 or less. Money is being made somewhere. Somebody is making money but it is not the farmer, the producer of the beef. In terms of the threat to our beef industry posed by Brexit, the Minister is well aware that 50% of our beef is exported to the UK and market diversification will not save us in the short run. Brexit poses one of the biggest threats to suckler farmers and to jobs in the agrifood sector and the Minister knows, as do I, that a no-deal Brexit would be utterly catastrophic. Our farmers are looking over their shoulders at Brazil and Argentina and to the potential for a cheap food policy being pursued by the UK. We do not know what is going to come down the tracks.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> We must also consider the CAP and what the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, will mean for our farmers. Many farmers in this country, particularly small farmers, are relying on direct payments under CAP. We are looking at a reduction of at least 5% in the next CAP budget and that hole will have to be plugged somehow. Many farmers will not be able to take a hit. It is really important for rural communities that the small family farm is protected. It is not just about making profits. Money earned by small farmers is spent locally. It is used to put children through college and is spent in the local economy. Farmers look after their land and protect the environment. They make a huge contribution to the local economy. If we lose those farmers they will not be replaced. Young people who might consider farming as a career are looking at incomes of €13,000 or less and are walking away. There is a huge body of work to be done there.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> In the context of the potential impact of Brexit, we must set up a mitigation fund. Funding must be provided to protect farmers. My concern is that we have no details yet as to what that fund might look like, how it will be accessed and what amounts will be made available. We cannot have the Government scrambling around in the days after Brexit looking for that money.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_857">We are at a crossroads in terms of the agricultural sector. On the one hand, we have Food Wise 2025, which followed on from Harvest 2020, while on the other hand, we have climate action groups and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Tonight we are here to ensure that rural Ireland does not lose out. That means fighting for support for family farms, especially those in the beef sector. I welcome the Beef Plan representatives in the Gallery this evening, supported by the IFA. Their presence shows the level of concern among farmers about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> I join my party's spokesman, Deputy McConalogue and many other contributors in urging the Minister to implement the 14 policy actions contained in the motion that has been accepted by the Government to ensure the continued viability of the beef sector. The Minister should not do what his predecessor, Deputy Coveney, did when the tillage sector was in crisis. He suggested then that tillage farmers should convert to other farming practices. Farmers do not call for subsidies every year. They only look for intervention every so often. The tillage sector has shown clearly that prices go up and down and that the market is volatile. We must acknowledge that volatility in every sector of agricultural practice. </p>
          <p eId="para_859"> The Minister is good at going abroad as part of trade delegations and coming back with deals. The next time he goes abroad on such a trade delegation he should take some containers with him. We seem to be only selling the samples and there is very little follow up. I am open to being corrected but it seems to me that some of the agreements reached with countries in the Far East have yet to come to fruition. We need more and faster practical action. I also ask the Minister to make export credit insurance more viable in the context of north African countries so that live animal exports to that region can be increased.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Michael Creed)<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_860">I would like to make some general observations before dealing with some of the specific issues raised in the motion and the debate. I fully acknowledge that while the Irish beef sector has a global reputation for excellence and is considered a world leader in terms of quality, food safety, traceability, welfare, genomics and sustainability, there are serious challenges. We must strategically and collectively tackle issues such as Brexit, low margins, sustainability and efficiency, dairy to beef challenges, as well as relationships and relative strength in the supply chain if we are to sustain the sector for the long term. None of these issues is new and none can be resolved easily. We have a collective interest in working together to think strategically about what measures should be taken to support the beef sector to deal with these challenges. It is not as simple as talking about price margins. No Minister or Government can dictate the price of beef, milk or a loaf of bread but what we can do is try to direct supports strategically in a way that builds efficiency and profitability at farm level.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> I will now turn to a few specific issues raised in the course of the debate this evening. Deputy O'Keeffe alluded to Department’s presence in overseas markets. It is worth noting that we have had eight successive years of volume and value growth. I recently announced eight new agricultural attaché posts in a number of embassies, including in Mexico City, Tokyo, Seoul and Berlin, all identified by my Department as priority locations. We will also take on local hires in certain locations to provide local knowledge and specialist expertise in supporting our market access and trade development work. There are currently eight agricultural attaché posts in embassies in the European Union and across the world, including in Beijing and Washington DC. Last year, I also increased Bord Bia’s staffing allocation by 32, located both in Ireland and abroad. This will help to drive growth in our food and drink exports as a key response to Brexit. </p>
          <p eId="para_862"> An enhanced programme of agrifood trade missions will continue this year with plans for trade missions, informed primarily by consultations with the industry and following in particular, trade negotiations concluded by the EU in places like Canada, Japan and Korea, which I will be visiting. I will also be visiting Algeria and Egypt, which will be of interest to Deputy O'Keeffe in the context of his references to north Africa and its potential in the context of live exports. </p>
          <p eId="para_863"> The EU-Mercosur negotiations have not progressed to the point where any agreement is likely to be concluded in the short term. There are well known sensitivities <i>vis-à-vis </i>Mercosur beef access to the EU market and Ireland has continued to express its strong concerns, both directly to Commissioners Malmström and Hogan and through ongoing collaboration with like-minded member states. There undoubtedly is a need for continued vigilance in respect of the conduct of all future trade negotiations and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately and in a manner that safeguards our interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Exports of live cattle increased by over 30% in 2018, and this growth trend continued into 2019. I have always acknowledged that live exports are a critical part of Ireland’s livestock industry. They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers, underpinned by the highest standards of animal welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has provided details of the additional lairage capacity anticipated in Cherbourg. Based on current ferry sailing schedules this provides increased capacity of some 1,200 animals per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> With regard to flexibility on state aid ceilings, the European Commission recently announced that the maximum threshold limits under the agriculture <i>de minimis </i>regulation will increase from €15,000 up to €25,000. This will allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, notably in times of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> My Department, working with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland has also received approval from the EU Commission for an Irish state aid application, allowing an Irish food company to receive state aid funding for the diversification of its activities. The potential for this approval to act as a template for assistance to the broader agrifood sector within state aid rules is currently being explored.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> As for access to finance, a €300 million Brexit loan scheme is available to SMEs, including agrifood businesses, to provide working capital support to enable eligible Irish businesses to implement the necessary changes to address the challenges posed by Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> This morning, together with my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, I launched the €300 million future growth loan scheme, which has been developed by our Departments together with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the European Investment Fund. I acknowledge that it is later than I would have liked. It was complex. We worked with strategic partners, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the European Investment Fund, and it required primary legislation in this House. It is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers who often do not have the leverage in the marketplace that others do. I believe the scheme will provide an important opportunity for a particular cohort of farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> On bonus payments by factories, a quality payment system, QPS, providing for differentiated payments in respect of certain grades of cattle at slaughter plants was put in place in 2009. This payment system is a commercial matter, negotiated by meat processors with farming organisations. I am generally supportive of the proposition that the grid system should reward beef farmers for quality production and I have offered technical support from Teagasc if the parties involved wish to revisit the design of the quality payment system. I must emphasise, however, that the grid system is not a State property. The payment system is informed by where the cattle land on the grid, which is negotiated between processors and farm organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> Reference was made by a number of speakers to movements and residency with regard to the additional bonus payments. The conditions required to obtain the bonus payments are determined by processors - in consultation with the demands of the marketplace - to incentivise or reward production meeting the specifications of retail customers. They are not conditions determined by law or by my Department and we have no role in their operation or implementation. I believe that quality payment systems are important as they reward farmers for compliance with those regulations as demanded by the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> With regard to my Department’s role in carcass classification and presentation, as raised by my colleague Deputy Denis Naughten, controls in slaughter plants are carried out by a dedicated team of specialist staff in the beef carcass classification section within my Department. They take their work very seriously indeed. In 2018, almost 550 inspections were conducted. Since January 2019, controls have been supplemented by additional monitoring by the Department’s veterinary public health inspection staff in the factories. It is important to make it clear that the controls applied by this dedicated team of people in my Department are significantly in excess of those required under EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> I stress that one of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025. It is crucial that we all continue to work together. At the last beef round table, I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their interdependency and to work to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain. A collaborative approach could, I believe, significantly progress a number of important issues including: the development of beef producer organisations; exploration of new bioeconomy value streams; the development of geographical indication, GI, status for Irish beef; and initiatives to improve price transparency, building on existing measures such as my Department’s Beef Pricewatch app and the EU Meat Market Observatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Every effort is being made to improve the sustainability of beef farming in Ireland, economically, socially and environmentally. The sector faces a significant challenge in the form of a no-deal Brexit, but the Government is working hard to ensure that, if that worst-case scenario occurs, the right supports are in place to mitigate the impact on beef farm incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> In the brief time left to me I would like to acknowledge all of the people, including representatives from the farm organisations, who have travelled long distances to be in the Public Gallery this evening. I will respond in some detail to some of the issues that were raised by Members in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> Deputy Niamh Smyth seemed to imply that we were, for some reason, ignoring the Dutch and the Spanish markets. That is quite simply not the case. Almost one third of our exports go to mainland EU and European markets. The Netherlands is one of the most significant markets within that.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Breathnach on forward pricing, producer organisations, negotiated contracts and strengthening the position of farmers in the supply chain. In discussion on these matters with farmers invariably I am confronted with the fact that we are price takers. While it is not the panacea for all the ills, if we can organise it can strengthen the relative position of farmers in the supply chain and in this regard we have approved a number of organisations to act as facilitators for producer organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> The motion refers to €200 per suckler cow. I believe that we need to have an honest debate around this. It seems to imply a coupled payment: if one was paying on every cow, then the more cows a farmer has the more he or she would get paid. This would run contrary to the direction of travel we have been going in, which is to reward quality and not make payments contingent upon having numbers, so farmers can adapt their holdings to reflect market realities. I have an issue with this but I am open to a discussion around it. I am certainly committed, in the context of the broader CAP negotiations, to get the best possible deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> I cannot let Deputy Clare Daly's point go with regard to climate. If we could move the Irish beef industry lock, stock and barrel to any mainland European country that also has an industrial heritage history, our emissions profile would be insignificant. We have an emissions profile as high as it is because Ireland never had the industrial revolution industries here. This is not to claim that the beef industry needs a free pass. It will do more and it has to do more. Last week we were confronted by kids protesting. They are informing consumer decisions around the globe, not just here. Ireland is an international player in those markets so we have to do more to drive down our carbon efficiency. We start, however, from a very good point.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">I will share time with Deputies O'Loughlin and McConalogue. Deputy Scanlon may not make it to contribute due to being delayed at an earlier meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important Private Members' motion, put forward by my colleagues. The motion contains 14 detailed measures. They are realistic and essential proposals, which need to be implemented at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> Last night Deputies McConalogue and Breathnach, Senator Wilson and I met the farming community in Carlingford, County Louth: farmers from counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath. They were at their wits' end, especially people from the beef sector, the livestock sector and the suckler herd owners. They outlined very clearly to us that they are not making an income and that returns are below the costs of production. They question how long they will remain in the sector. It is very worrying when one hears of good farmers, who have invested heavily in building up their herd and on-farm facilities, questioning their future.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> All of us in the House, and those people in the Public Gallery this evening, know that food production is unlike the production of other commodities in that food production cannot be switched on and off. It cannot be switched on at the farm or at the processing or manufacturing sector. If confidence is undermined it is a very negative message for the future. If good people are exiting the sector it is a huge loss to the national economy and to the overall agrifood sector. These people are not making a living currently. These are hard-working farmers who have invested very heavily and have reared stock to the highest standards. This is even before Brexit. We are all aware of the concerns around the adverse impacts Brexit will have regardless of the type of withdrawal Britain will achieve in leaving the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">It is essential that the Minister implement measures to ensure the issues outlined in this Private Members' motion will be addressed. In his opening remarks the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, spoke about the significant growth in the value and quantity of food and drink exports since 2009. The Minister also referenced it. While that is very welcome, the Minister of State also referred to the fact that we sold to so many markets because of the high reputation of the products leaving the island. We all know that there has been a huge cost to individual farmers and the State in achieving those high standards. There must, therefore, be a return to the primary producer who is a critical link in the food production chain. We cannot allow farmers to continue to fail to derive the income they need in producing the top quality product this country is very proud to export to so many other countries around the world. I refer again to the CAP. Any reduction in overall CAP funding would be detrimental not only to the rural economy but also to the national economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_885">I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the chairman of Kildare IFA, Mr. Brian Rush, and the Kildare delegation. Farming and the agrifood industry are incredibly important to my county, Kildare, which has 2,618 farms and more than 21,000 beef cattle. Agriculture supports many thousands of jobs directly and indirectly in local shops and communities in County Kildare. The value of the agriculture industry is hugely significant to the economy of rural Kildare. According to the Teagasc data for 2018, average incomes on cattle rearing farms are just over €10,000 per annum. On mixed farms, incomes are just over €15,000. How is any family expected to live on that income, develop their farm, send children to school and college and meet basic household expenditure which we all must meet? Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of sterling have already impacted very negatively on cattle prices and the IFA estimates that a hard Brexit would cost the beef sector up to €800 million annually. We cannot stand idly by while the beef sector is at its wits' end.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> Despite assurances from the Minister, I believe firmly not enough is being done. I am proud to stand with my party, in particular Deputies McConalogue and Cahill who have brought forward this Private Members' motion to highlight the urgent need to take action to safeguard the livelihoods of farmers in the beef sector at this time of crisis. We have outlined 14 policy measures that need to be actioned immediately by the Government to meet the severe challenges faced in the sector. The Government must take swift action to safeguard the sector and the rural economy. However, its delivery record to date has been suspect. The Fine Gael-led Government is losing touch with people in rural Ireland and the daily challenges they face. Regrettably, the Government's sense of urgency to date has been sluggish, as demonstrated by the hands-off approach it has taken to enhancing capacity at Cherbourg Port to increase calf exports to the Continent. It is unbelievable the Brexit loan scheme promised for farmers in October 2017, almost a year and a half ago, has yet to open mere days from a hard Brexit.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_887">I thank all of the Members who have spoken to and supported the motion. I hope they have contributed to getting the message across to the Minister on the need for action and to follow through on the 14 policy proposals included in the motion. I again thank the ICSA, the Beef Plan movement, the IFA and, in particular, the tremendous delegation from around the country that travelled with them to be here. It is crucial that we see action from the Minister as a result of the motion. As Deputy O'Loughlin mentioned, in the past few years and under the Taoiseach and during the Minister's stewardship of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we have seen a Government that has been out of touch with rural Ireland and the difficulties facing farmers. In fairness, when we passed the tillage and fodder motions in the Dáil, the Minister acted on them. I bet, however, that in those cases he had no choice but to do so. We have had other motions on which he has failed to follow through. In the beef sector, in particular, we need to see action on the part of the Minister and an understanding of the massive pressure farmers are under.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> In his contribution the Minister outlined how the figure in respect of <i>de minimis</i> permissions in a state aid context had increased from €15,000 to €25,000 a few weeks ago. However, that is just in respect of permissions. The Government must recognise that Brexit is already happening and having an impact on the beef sector and the agrifood sector generally. That recognition must come in the form of real assistance and funding to help farmers in their time of real need. The Minister must use the permissions under state aid rules to come up with a proposal to facilitate and assist farmers in their time of need and address the pressures they have experienced in the past few months. He must provide clarity on the supports that will be available if there is a hard Brexit. Of course, our overriding objective must be to ensure we avoid that scenario. We must also see more action on the part of the Minister to assist the live export trade. Unfortunately, however, the ships have been sailing on this issue, but without the numbers of calves aboard that might have been the case had the Minister acted earlier. There is still capacity, even at this late stage, for the Minister to help to address that issue. It is a major failure of his that such help has not been provided. We also need to see a continued effort to ensure the CAP is prioritised and that funding will be maintained. It is a key Fianna Fáil policy that there should be a maximum payment of €60,000 in that regard. As we have outlined in the motion, it is essential to ensure there will be a €200 suckler cow contribution to underpin the suckler cow herd.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> We are telling the Minister that the Government must wake up to the fact that the farming sector is under pressure. He must be clear and upfront on his proposals for the sector and deliver immediately to relieve some of the pressure farmers are under. He must ensure they will no longer be left to fend for themselves without the support the Government could provide if there was a willingness to provide it.</p>

          <p eId="para_891">I move amendment No. 86:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_892">In page 45, line 23, after “failures,” to insert “including the imposition of financial penalties”.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">The Labour Party has tabled similar amendments in this category. We are dealing with matters such as compliance reports whereby the competent authority can come up with proposals to avoid or reduce failures. This relates to giving the competent authority the power to impose financial penalties on those who avoid or fail to implement noise mitigation, operating restriction measures and so forth. The Bill allows the competent authority to bring forward a compliance report regarding what work it has done on the measures and it also provides that the competent authority can bring forward proposals to avoid or reduce failures referred to in the sections. What we are seeking to do here is give the competent authority the ability to levy a financial penalty as part of trying to reduce or avoid the failures of compliance. The reason is that the carrot does not go very far and unless one has the ability to financially penalise the airport operator, airline or whomever, the incentive is massively reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I tabled a different amendment in this regard on Committee Stage. It was more cumbersome and prescriptive, which was probably beyond what should be in primary legislation, but we must have a reference to it here that does not tie hands and is not too prescriptive. Other jurisdictions have this principle in place. The night noise policy in Manchester Airport is an example. The strategy is based on six different categories and noise penalties are a substantial part of that. Manchester operates a system whereby night movements cannot exceed 7% of the airport's total movements. That is first. Then it looks at developing a quota count, QC, budget for summer and winter seasons and a points system. Basically, points are graded based on the noisiness of the aircraft. Old aircraft would have a high quota count while new aircraft would have a low quota count. The policy then involves the putting in place of measures. For example, it states, "A modern quiet [aircraft] ... may be classified as QC0.25 on arrival and QC0.5 on departure, whilst older aircraft ... may be classified as QC4 on arrival and QC8 on departure." It is a way of allowing the airport operators to manage the noise but when they do not do it, and there are many measures restricting the number of noisier aircraft, particularly at night, there is the ability to impose a financial penalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> It is encouraging pilots to take steps to reduce the noise and to fly aircraft in the quietest way possible. It also tries to encourage the airlines to introduce the quietest aeroplanes. However, it has a grading in terms of decibels and anything over that would bring a minimum penalty. It is €750 for the first decibel at which the noise level is exceeded and a further €150 for each decibel beyond that. The principle is there and it works. It is a little bit of carrot and a little bit of stick. In the same way engine testing would not be permitted within certain timeframes or the airport would agree on a certain number. In Manchester, 20 engine tests per year are permitted and they would generally be prohibited between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> We are seeking to get a genuinely balanced approach for the implementation of noise mitigation measures and the implementation of operating restrictions. Encouraging good activity is one way of doing it by generating a positive list of recommendations for pilots, such as to avoid the use of reverse thrust and so forth. There is all that good stuff but having the ability to impose a financial penalty is a key part of that as well. The amendment I propose to insert overcomes some of the more prescriptive attributes of the amendment I proposed on Committee Stage and gets over some of the concerns the Minister had then that there might be a constitutional impediment or some other legal argument as to why we cannot put measures in the Bill. I do not accept that. The generality of this amendment, which establishes the ability to set a financial penalty, overcomes that point. I propose my two amendments in that regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_897">I strongly support amendment No. 86. The International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, has a famous guidance on the balanced approach, the ICAO document 9829. Its four principles are: reduction of noise at source; land use planning and management; noise abatement operational procedures; and operating restrictions on aircraft. Over the past 40 years, many of the organisation's efforts have gone towards addressing airport noise. It has been addressing noise at source in the performance of the different aeroplane models, the processes for take-off, landing and so forth. For example, the ICAO states, "The first generation of jet-powered aeroplanes was not covered by Annex 16 and these are consequently referred to as non-noise certificated (NNC) aeroplanes (e.g. Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8)." It is clear that, even in the balanced approach, there is a prescription for how operators such as the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and companies can operate their businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> A noise database, NoisedB, was developed in 2006 by the French Government under the aegis of the ICAO. The database is a general source of information to the public on the certification noise levels for each type of aircraft as provided by certification authorities. It involved a move to set medium and long-term nitrogen oxides, NOx, reduction goals and, when this had been done, there was a further move to noise reduction technologies. One of the difficulties is that we do not have directly specified levels of noise. We know what the levels are that would enable most people to have a night's sleep or to be able to carry on their business during the day if they live quite close to the flight path, but they are nowhere specified in the balanced approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I would go further than Deputy Daly's original amendment in Committee to being very prescriptive. The point about financial sanctions, and other sanctions, is that there is a need to prescribe the levels of sanctions that might be applied. However, I am supportive of the amendment in that it is a basic attempt to give power to the regulator to ensure that, at least, the basic principles I mentioned of the balanced approach, particularly in regard to noise, would be adhered to.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_900">I am supportive of amendments Nos. 86 and 93 which provide for financial penalties. My amendment No. 89 is slightly more focused. It is designed specifically to encourage the use of quieter aircraft and to give the competent authority the power to direct the DAA to fix charges based on noise in respect of a particular aircraft or class of aircraft. Obviously, some older aircraft are noisier than the new ones. Noisier aircraft should be penalised. The objective is to control the level of noise at take-off and on landing and to promote compliance with noise regulations and noise requirements. These penalties, if applied, should be additional to any regular charges for use of airports. These penalties would be specifically related to noise issues and would be in addition to standard airport charges. As provided for in the amendment, these would be fixed following consultation with stakeholders and with a view to reducing inconvenience from aircraft noise.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> I hope these amendments will be accepted but even if they are I will still have serious concerns about the independence of the competent authority. If it is the case that some of us in the Opposition are right and the competent authority proposed by the Minister turns out to be not as independent as designed we will face serious issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I wish to return to the importance of the letter from AnnMarie Farrelly to the Department on this matter. She states that currently Fingal County Council has an extensive remit in both shaping and determining the strategic direction of Dublin Airport. Towards the end of the second page, she says that in light of the existing complex and varied role that Fingal County Council plays, as outlined above, it is considered that the council may not be best placed to act as the competent authority for the purposes of the implementation of regulation 598/2014. In saying that, she makes particular reference to clause 13 of regulation 598/2014 and picks out the language in it which she and the local authority believe works against the council being the competent authority. She refers specifically to clause 13, as have many of us the Opposition side. She goes on to say in the second last paragraph of the letter that in the context of clause 13, which we are trying to incorporate into Irish law, competent authority may be a role for other independent bodies which do not hold conflicting responsibilities. She is clearly stating that it is her view that the council holds conflicting responsibilities which indicate that it should not be the competent authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I raise this issue again because we are edging towards the end of this debate and it is probably the final opportunity I will have to raise it. I am asking the Minister, even at this late stage, to reflect on this issue between now and the Bill's return to this House from the Seanad.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">I support amendments Nos. 86 and 93. Financial penalties will definitely strengthen this particular legislation. They will act as a deterrent and ensure compliance with the regulation. This is a good proposal, which I do not believe the Minister should have a problem accepting. It is a swift and easy method of reprimanding those who do break noise regulations. I hope the Minister will accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">I too support Deputy Daly's amendments Nos. 86 and 93. For the foregoing reasons, we have to have penalties for misdemeanours or breaches of guidelines. There is a plethora of question marks around this regulation and the competent authority and the independence of same. Competence is not only an issue in this area. In my county, the county council is the planning regulatory authority but issues have arisen in regard to the location of a shooting range close to the homes of a number of families and it will not deal with them. It is playing around and Joe public is left with no redress. People should not be deprived of their sleep, which they will be if noisy aircraft are permitted. Airlines should be compelled to operate aircraft with low noise emissions. There should be strict standards in this regard and an independent arbitrator to adjudicate on breaches of noise regulations. This requirement will need to monitored and enforced. As in the case of many similar issues in the past there were rigorous planning processes, oral hearings and legislation introduced and debated here but people were left with diddly-squat in terms of being able to make a complaint or get satisfaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> I cannot believe the Minister, Deputy Ross, is opposed to financial penalties. Maybe he is not: maybe he has changed. He was well able to incorporate financial penalties into other legislation, including in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, to penalise ordinary families. That Act provides for punitive penalties on young people who want to learn how to drive but do not want their cars seized or their parents fined. It is a case of to Hell or to Connacht with those people in the country and in some cases in the city. In this area, we are dealing with big business and large aircraft companies and the Minister is reluctant to provide for any meaningful penalties on them in respect of breaches of the regulation. As I said, there are a lot of question marks about whether Fingal County Council should be the competent authority. I do not know the answer to that question but I have concerns given the manner in which the Minister, Deputy Ross, has addressed other issues and the hames he made of them. There is nobody on the Government benches tonight to support the Minister on this legislation. There is nobody here from the Independent Alliance or Fine Gael. Last night, when the soccer match was on, many Deputies went missing and the Minister could only muster 29 Deputies to support him. Fianna Fáil, as usual, sat on its hands but the Minister still could not get sufficient support to pass his amendments. The Minister needs to consider if he is capable of enacting legislation and if there is anybody in the Cabinet who supports him or has any respect for his legislative measures.</p>

I have said before that it is all supply and no confidence. That was clear last night when only a small number could be mustered for the votes.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> People have concerns about this because they live beside the airport. I live a long way from it, although I use the airport occasionally. However, I have been in houses in Finglas and other such places and I know that the noise is intrusive. We cannot just keep heaping it on. Other airports in the country could be developed instead of forcing all airplanes into Dublin. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, should consider the regions. These amendments do not deal with them, but other amendments do. Everything is Dublin-orientated, and the people of Dublin are entitled to a modicum of rest. They should be able to perform their duties in the morning, whether they be nurses, doctors or anything else, after a night's sleep. Sleep deprivation is a war crime in times of war, so it must be respected. </p>

          <p eId="para_930">It is very important that we agree things in this House sometimes. There is no shame in the Government being defeated sometimes. In fact, it is a good thing if the Government loses various amendments, if that is the wish of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> These amendments will not be accepted for the same reasons I set out on Committee Stage. I may be defeated on that, but if that is the wish of the House so be it. I am as anxious as everyone else to ensure that there is full and timely compliance with all decisions of the noise regulator. However, financial penalties, such as those proposed here, are unlikely to be effective. The ability to quickly bring court proceedings to bear simply works better. This is a matter of opinion. Some Members of this House genuinely believe that the threat of financial penalties to the DAA or other airport authorities will work. Others feel that such an approach will be less effective. I am not sure that those who have said that big business responds to fines are correct. Big businesses, particularly State monopolies, are not paying out with their own money. If State monopolies were fined it would, in effect, fall to the taxpayer to pay those fines. We should think about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> In the event that there is non-compliance with noise mitigation measures, section 23 of the Bill gives the noise regulator the power to direct the airport authority or an airport user, using an enforcement notice to undertake actions in order to comply with a noise mitigation measure or an operating restriction. This might be in response to a complaint made to the regulator from a local resident, for example. In circumstances of non-compliance with such an enforcement notice, the noise regulator then has direct recourse to the High Court. Indeed, section 25 of the Bill, as it stands, provides that such a hearing can be expedited. </p>
          <p eId="para_933"> The issue of fines was considered by my officials, by myself and others in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, and the very strong consensus was that what is currently provided for in this Bill is the most effective form of enforcement. It is considered that the direct path to the courts is the most effective means of enforcement of this Bill, and in particular it is in practice more effective and faster than administrative sanctions which themselves could be challenged all the way to the court. In reality, an administrative fine system, such as this, serves to delay enforcement because fines are issued, disputed and end up before the courts. The approach I am setting out bypasses this potential delaying tactic.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> On amendment No. 89, referred to by Deputy Brendan Ryan, I do not propose to set out in primary legislation the requirement for the noise regulator to direct the airport authority to fix its airport charges in respect of noisier aircraft. This may well be a measure required by the noise regulator because it is part of the so-called balanced approach under regulation 598/2014. However, that is a matter for the independent regulator to determine, having regard to the cause of noise and the best way to tackle it. For the regulator to be truly independent, it must be able to come to its own unencumbered decision as to what is required to mitigate noise created by aircraft at Dublin Airport. In line with regulation 598/2014, independence must mean that the regulator is not directed to take a specific course of action. </p>
          <p eId="para_935"> Deputy Clare Daly referred to the Manchester scheme. I understand that is a voluntary agreement between the airport and the local authority. We are dealing with primary legislation, and a statutory administrative fine scheme is not something I am willing to support, based on the legal advice I have referred to on the effectiveness and suitability of such a scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_936"> Deputy Brendan Ryan has referred many times to the Fingal letter. That letter dates from November 2017. All the issues have been addressed. Fingal has gone on record, specifically in October last year, saying that it is now satisfied of its own independence. The Attorney General has done likewise.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">The matters in the letter have not been addressed, but luckily there will be other opportunities later on. I will return to some of Deputy Brendan Ryan's points; he is totally correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> The Minister has made no argument whatsoever, legal or otherwise, as to why these amendments cannot be agreed. Nobody is arguing for the deletion of the court action remedy. It still stands. If the competent authority wants to bring someone to court, we will not stop it. This simply provides the competent authority with another string to its bow by giving it the ability to issue a fine as a potential deterrent. There is no complication there. The idea that access to the High Court is being put forward as some sort of quick fix will be a sad irony for many people, including those sitting in the Gallery. Access to the courts is incredibly slow, and some of the people here tonight have been pauperised after having to go through the higher courts in order to deal with issues such as this with the DAA. </p>
          <p eId="para_939">It is not a level playing field and, therefore, the suggestion that the courts system offers an easier route adds insult to injury for many people who are already suffering because of the airport. The Minister's point that if we issued fines, they would be disputed and delayed is a nonsense argument because the breach will have already occurred when the fine is imposed. The fine is not put forward as a deterrent to the action which has taken place and for which it was issued. Rather, it is a deterrent to future breaches. We do not consider it a panacea but instead it is one avenue the authority could use. Based on the Minister's response, I am satisfied that there is no legal impediment to us putting the amendment forward. It is not prescriptive and it does not specify the financial penalty. That the agreement might be voluntary in Manchester is neither here nor there. The amendment will simply allow the authority to have the power to impose a penalty.</p>

          <p eId="para_940">The Minister stated a fine is unlikely to be effective, that the courts system would be quicker and that, in any event, if there were penalties, the taxpayer would pay. They are not solid reasons for rejecting the three amendments in question. The amendments seek to give powers to apply financial penalties. In respect of my amendments, the Minister stated he would not direct the competent authority to impose financial penalties. If one reads the amendment, however, one will see that it does not provide for such direction. It provides for consultation with the stakeholders and gives the authority a toolbox that it may use - the word "may" is used specifically - if it so chooses. It will give the authority the power to take that route if it is appropriate. Why would one decide not to give the competent authority an appropriate set of tools that it may wish to use? I do not accept the Minister's response to those amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> The Minister stated the letter was written in 2017 and that, therefore, it has been addressed. It has not been addressed because it refers specifically to clause 13, which has not changed since 2017. If the issue relates to clause 13, which remains in the directive, how could time change that? Clause 13 remains in the directive to be brought into Irish law. For this reason, I reject the Minister's suggestion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_942">The arguments Deputy Clare Daly made about fines possibly being more effective than court proceedings are perfectly reasonable but I happen not to believe them. I do not believe that fining a State monopoly is an effective way of deterring it from doing things that I hope it will not do. The threat of High Court proceedings is likely to be more effective in deterring it from doing what has been outlined. The regulator and the DAA could, if they so wish, agree a fine system based on the Manchester model. I do not need to mandate that. This is a matter of judgment and opinion, not of great ideological or practical significance, on which the Deputy, along with other Deputies on her side of the House, and I disagree. I believe that the prospect of proceedings in the High Court will make the authority think twice about taking an action which we want to discourage, and that the threat of a fine will not deter it.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> Deputy Brendan Ryan asked why fines were not appropriate. The reason is that we do not believe they would be effective. I acknowledge he is persistent about the letter but I cannot say much more about it than I have said, except that these issues have been addressed. Fingal County Council is happy that it is independent, as are all the other bodies which others have judged not to be independent. We believe that at this stage it is time to move on and that the council's independence has been established.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_507">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_944">The Minister has a fundamental misunderstanding of some of the measures that the competent authority will employ. It is not just a case of fines or High Court action against the DAA. That could be the case for a large, fundamental breach but some of the breaches we are speaking about might be one-off occasions where the body responsible for the breach might not be the DAA but rather, say, Aer Lingus. For example, a pilot's behaviour could result in the decibel soundings being breached in an area. If a rule was in place to the effect that if the noise of the aircraft exceeded the limit by 1 dB, the fine could be the equivalent of £750, as is the case in the Manchester model, and that could be invested in a community fund in the area. In that instance, the authority would not bring Aer Lingus to court over that one breach. When the fine is flagged, however, will Aer Lingus not approach Clare Daly, the pilot, and tell her it has been levied with a fine of €3,000 because she had used the reverse thrust far too much? It could say she had been told to bring in measures to fly the aircraft more quietly.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> Pilot behaviour has an impact. While the type of aircraft also has an impact, fines would not be as suitable in that regard and, therefore, the intention of the fine is to correct behaviour. The Minister's response shows that it is not an either-or matter and we do not seek to remove anything from the Bill. The three amendments in question can, and should, be incorporated into the legislation because all we are doing is giving the authority the power to impose a financial penalty. As the Minister has correctly stated, the DAA and the stakeholders could sit down with the competent authority and agree a voluntary scheme, which nothing in our amendments prohibits. In fact, they will give such a measure a firmer statutory footing whereby it could be done properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> I wish to make other points about the letter but I will do so when speaking on some of the subsequent amendments. Over the course of the debate, I have become more convinced that we need to incorporate the three amendments, which are complementary rather than contradictory. I hope, therefore, that we will pass them.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">The Minister responded by stating the threat of High Court action is better than a fine. Like Deputy Clare Daly, I do not believe it is a question of one or the other. Rather, the amendment will add a further tool to the toolbox. There may be occasions where the competent authority will decide the matter does not need to be heard in the High Court, given that the court may take a long time to reach a conclusion. It might be appropriate to give the competent authority something in its toolbox which can provide a quick and sharp result that might not be as costly as going to the High Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_1045">I move amendment No. 87:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1046">In page 45, to delete lines 38 and 39, and in page 46, to delete lines 1 to 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Amendment No. 87 deletes section 20, which includes the noise insulation scheme inserted into the Bill on Committee Stage by means of an amendment tabled by Deputy Troy with the support of Deputy Darragh O'Brien. I fully understand and share the very good intentions behind it, which I accepted on Committee Stage but which, as we discussed at the time, needed to be reworked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> Amendment No. 99 inserts a new section, section 31, to replace section 20. This new section provides that the existing noise insulation schemes which are currently available to residents around Dublin Airport will be treated as if they were noise mitigation measures introduced by the noise regulator. This new section is a far more workable provision that better secures and safeguards the current insulation schemes available to residents. I am putting this forward as a more legally sound and workable proposal to address the concerns of Deputies Troy and Darragh O'Brien regarding the status of insulation schemes. These amendments achieve just that and have been cleared through the Office of the Attorney General. What I propose in amendment No. 99 is that the DAA's existing noise insulation schemes will be deemed to be noise mitigation measures introduced by the noise regulator in order that the rights embodied in this Bill shall apply in respect of them. This means that the insulation schemes will be monitored by the noise regulator and that it has powers of enforcement as if it had included these schemes in its own regulatory decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> Furthermore, by virtue of amendment No. 91, once these schemes are deemed to be noise mitigation measures, any person will have the ability to write to the noise regulator and request it to review their effectiveness. This amendment achieves what Deputies Troy and Darragh O'Brien set out to do in this regard. It ensures that the existing insulation schemes are protected and that they are monitored and enforced by the new noise regulator. As I have explained on several occasions this Bill is technically complicated and its interaction with EU regulations, and directives, and with national planning and development law is finely balanced. That is why we have had to be very careful and deliberate in our drafting and it is why we have had to rely heavily on the drafting expertise in the Office of the Attorney General. I say this because the language contained in the Committee Stage amendment is much more straightforward and easier to read. However, it does not work and that will be to the disadvantage of local residents which is not what is intended. If we are to progress good, implementable legislation and if we are to include in it additional protections and entitlements relating to insulation, I ask the House to support my amendments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1050">I welcome the Minister's clarification of the existing insulation scheme, that between 180 and 200 houses qualify under the voluntary scheme and also under the scheme prescribed as a condition of a previous planning application. We are still concerned to ensure that houses that will be affected by the operation of the new runway will be able to avail of the same home insulation schemes as the existing 180 to 200 houses. That is why we brought forward our amendment on Committee Stage. We accepted on Committee Stage the advice of the Minister's officials that our amendment was very broad and left the potential for people in places far from the airport to make applications to be included in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">That is not what our intention was. Our intention was that for people who would be within the flight contours, the existing scheme would be taken out of the control of the DAA and put in the place of the responsible authority, and I accept that is done, and that future noise mitigation measures could be recommended by the independent competent authority to expand that scheme more widely from the existing 180 to 200 houses. The amendment the Minister is proposing does not quite clearly get that and we have a concern on that.</p>

        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_512">
          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1052">I want to back up my colleague, Deputy Troy. I thank the Minister's officials as well because we have discussed this at length and we have discussed it on Committee Stage also. If one looks at the section within the Bill from page 45 to page 46, as Deputy Troy said, this would be giving the oversight to the competent authority, which is the right thing to do so that the DAA would not be the arbiter and the final decision maker on who is in the scheme or not. However, as Deputy Troy has said, it specifically relates to not just the existing scheme and the voluntary scheme but to those who may be affected by the new runway when that opens and we are aware of that. That is why we tried to improve the drafting of amendment No. 88, which we are discussing in this block and which was passed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> The amendment states: "Expand the existent noise insulation scheme to all homes affected by any and all flight paths into the airport, including those created by any future developments at the airport." I understand why that would be too broad and there could be someone in An Clochán or in Waterford or somewhere on the approach to Dublin actually applying to the scheme based on that language and that would reduce the capacity to allow more people in the affected areas into the scheme. That is why our amendment states: "In page 46, lines 1 and 2, to delete “affected by any and all flight paths into the airport” and substitute “located within relevant noise contours”." There are specifically published noise contour maps that we have that are very distinct but it would still allow the competent authority to decide whether a person was in or not. We are allowing the competent authority to do its job and we are removing that function from the DAA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> That is probably something that the DAA would welcome but my concern is for the residents and is the reason for the amendment we passed on Committee Stage and the reason for this change. It is for people who are not opposing development of the airport, who understand the economic importance of the 20,000 jobs and the 114,000 indirect jobs that are supported there and the livelihoods which result. They deserve, on the basis of the balanced approach, that their lives are not impinged upon any further by this so this is a very reasonable amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> In section 2 of the amendment that we put forward, which was worthwhile, we stated that: "The competent authority shall be responsible for evaluating the design and implementation of the airport authority’s noise insulation scheme, with a view to ensuring maximum benefit for local residents." That is important. The Minister's amendment No. 99 is basically bringing in the existing scheme. That is fine; it cannot just be left out there and the Minister is responding to the request that Fianna Fáil made on Committee Stage to bring in the existing scheme. I get that and that is welcome so that means those people are there. Then we are saying that it would be responsible for the evaluation, design and implementation of the airport authority's noise insulation scheme based on the new runway as well. In the Minister's amendment, I respectfully say that it does not allude to that and we need to be prescriptive on that element of it to give comfort to residents so that they know that it is not just the existing scheme and that the scheme can be expanded. I know that in the explanatory notes the Minister and his officials have explained that the Minister's amendment would permit that and that the competent authority could expand it. However, I believe that we need to be prescriptive and it is no harm to have that in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> We are also saying that: "The competent authority must publish an evaluation immediately following the design of a new noise insulation scheme, and no later than 1 year following the commencement of the new scheme." There are pieces such as that which we put in around what the evaluation would consider. That may be too prescriptive. It is not necessarily for us to say to experts there that they need to do A, B, C, D, E, F, G. For the second part of it, if further work is required then that could be done in the Seanad. However, it would be crucially important for buy in from people for this process that it is clear in the legislation that the insulation scheme can and will be expanded, as decided by the noise regulator, along the lines of the other aspects of the Bill that we have managed to get through, such as the World Health Organization noise guidelines and all of those matters that have been an improvement to the legislation that was published in the first instance. This is crucially important for those communities which are beside the existing runway and in the flight path but which will be in the flight path of the new runway as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> It needs a bit of additional work and we have tried to do that with amendment No. 88, which was tabled in the spirit of co-operation from lengthy discussions that were had with the Department to try to find a way forward on this. By deleting "affected by any and all flight paths into the airport" and substituting that with "located within relevant noise contours" we have reduced the numbers who may potentially get into the scheme. We are only talking about those who are within those parameters. I say respectfully that Deputy Troy has tabled a very relevant and helpful amendment that will improve the situation. If something needs to be done further down the line and if we are being too prescriptive on what we want the competent authority to do then that is something that could be looked at in the Seanad. It is crucially important that we are prescriptive and descriptive on the noise insulation scheme because people need confidence that this scheme can and will be expanded on the basis of how communities are affected by the expansion of the airport.</p>

          <p eId="para_1058">I will not say much. I will be interested to hear what the Minister's response is because the points have been very well made. This was put forward coming out of the spirit of a good amendment that was passed on Committee Stage but in the hope of making it better and to give the added security, as Deputy Darragh O'Brien said, which is demanded by residents because we are talking about mitigating the impact of aircraft noise. One of the key areas of this is the whole issue of insulation. Some people are saying that if we do that no aircraft will be able to fly and we will shut down Dublin Airport. That is nonsense. What it does mean is that more homes will have to be insulated and it is a key area of the balanced approach. Hopefully the Minister will see reason because the points have been well made. However, if he thinks it needs further tweaking we should pass this now and that can be looked at in the Seanad.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. I fully appreciate what they are saying and I hope they fully appreciate the fact that the Government has agreed with a lot of what they have said. That is in our amendment and that is in response to what the Deputies have produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> What I am proposing with these amendments is that the insulation schemes would be deemed to be a noise mitigation measure introduced by the regulator and the provisions of this Bill shall fully apply to it when it is enacted. The regulator will have the full powers of enforcement as if it had required the schemes itself. Furthermore, by virtue of amendment No. 91, which I spoke to earlier, once the schemes are deemed to be noise mitigation measures, any person has the ability to write to the noise regulator and request it to review the effectiveness of the scheme. This amendment achieves what Deputies Troy and Darragh O'Brien have set out to do here, namely, to ensure that this scheme progresses and is monitored and enforced by the regulator. There is absolutely no question in my mind but that what I am providing here is what the Deputies are looking for. Future schemes and expanded schemes will be within the power of the regulator. Nevertheless, I understand the Deputies' apprehension about that and it is only fair to say that we should pass this tonight but I am prepared to look at going even further down the direction the Deputies are talking about and giving them the reassurance they are seeking in an amendment which we will bring to the Seanad.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I think it is a great improvement but the Deputies are going to have to accept a certain amount of goodwill here, which is absolute. I am proposing that my amendment goes through because it goes 90% of the way to what the Deputies want. I think it goes 100% of the way but they obviously do not feel so. If my amendment goes through, because it is a great improvement, I propose that we devise an amendment in a spirit of co-operation and goodwill that gives the Deputies the reassurance they want in the Seanad.

          <p eId="para_1063">I appreciate what the Minister is saying. However, his amendment would remove the section we put in on Committee Stage. It was debated in great detail and in a decent spirt, I might add: the Minister was there. His amendment No. 87 would remove that in its entirety. By bringing in amendment No. 99, effectively he is bringing in the existing scheme. He is saying that someone could review the effectiveness of the existing scheme. We are not talking about extent or expansion. That is not something that could be accepted. I mean this respectfully. We need to see that it is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> We could certainly work on things. I am not saying that everything is perfect. In amendment No. 88 we have tried to improve the scope and I think it does that. By leaving the section in, if the Minister wanted to propose an amendment in the Seanad, subject to discussions we would have, to improve that section, that would be absolutely fine. However, what he is asking us to do here this evening is to remove a very important section that was passed on Committee Stage. I grant the Minster that it is imperfect. Passing amendment No. 88 will improve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> I propose that the Minister withdraws his amendment and lets our one go through, and we will then work to agree on an amendment to that section in the Seanad that either he or we would bring forward. I cannot remove that as it would be taking the whole thing out. We could agree on a shared amendment in the Seanad to improve part (2) of the section in particular. That was a really important part of the committee meeting. We would be removing it in its entirety. I propose that we give a commitment on the public record for the Minister to withdraw his amendment, to let that section stand, pass amendment No. 88 to improve it and to work together on an agreed change to it in the Seanad. If we accept the Minister's amendment this evening, all we are doing is saying the existing scheme is in and that is pretty much it. I know that would be a problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">I am not going to make a big deal out of this but I find this an utterly mad section and I would really like some clarity on it. I am looking just to remove it. What we are talking about here is a scenario in which the competent authority has issued an enforcement notice against a company, meaning they have gone through all the steps, a noise mitigation measure has been suggested, any appeal process has been gone through, all of that is finished and it has been agreed that the work will commence and the suggested measure will be implemented. The organisation against which the order was made has not bothered implementing it so the competent authority has had to issue an enforcement notice. The DAA or an airline has gone all that length of the way. What we are putting in here is a section that gives the offender, the body that has breached the enforcement order, fast-track access to the courts to appeal the enforcement order. This body will never be a local resident, this is about the big players.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> I think that is the maddest thing I have ever heard. It is not necessary at all and in fact it is giving life to the appalling vista to which the Minister referred in his previous answer when we were trying to deal with the fines issue. This is giving <i>carte blanche</i> to a big semi-State organisation to use the courts at the taxpayer's expense. As the Minister said earlier, they are not footing the bill on this so we are giving them a specific mandate to breach regulations and go through the whole process, ignore an enforcement order and then go to the courts. They will say to themselves that they are not going to comply with that enforcement order because they can go to the courts and the courts have a laxity in terms of where the costs are going to be. We do not need this provision at all. The Bill gives adequate protection and I cannot understand it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">I will not be accepting these amendments for reasons explained already on Committee Stage. As I set out on Committee Stage, this is a standard provision to allow a recipient of an enforcement notice to apply to the High Court to have that notice issued by the noise regulator cancelled. The fact is that the noise regulator can apply to the High Court for an order requiring a person to comply with an enforcement notice. Again I reiterate that it is only right and balanced that the recipient of such a notice is afforded the opportunity to question that enforcement notice. Simply put, it gives the right to the DAA, to which the Deputy referred, to have recourse to the courts if it considers that the noise regulator has not acted properly in issuing an enforcement notice against it. It gives the same right to any other person who has received an enforcement notice from the noise regulator.</p>

          <p eId="para_1101">It does not do that. If the competent authority goes to the court to seek an enforcement order, as in any court case where something is sought against somebody, that person has the right to defend himself or herself. That is in place. They can of course argue against what the competent authority is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">This provides that when the competent authority has done that, it can go to the courts and object. It is nonsense; we do not need to specify that here.</p>

          <p eId="para_1104">I know it is the 11th hour, but I think this is an affront to the residents and to the stakeholders in this process. The Minister stated that everybody has access to the courts. In theory, that is obviously the case. However, it is not the case in reality. An individual is not a big semi-State organisation and has to fund a challenge himself or herself. The legislation gives the big organisation fast-track access to the courts for which, as the Minister indicated, the taxpayer will end up paying. Meanwhile, the little person or the resident has no such authority or favourable access to the courts. He or she can do so, of course, but my argument to the Minister is that the DAA or another organisation can go to the courts in any event and they do not need us to include that in legislation. Why, therefore, are we doing what is proposed? The argument in this regard does not stack up. I do not think that having it in or having it out makes a fundamental difference. However, what is proposed is indicative of an unbalanced approach. That is regrettable, particularly in the context of legislation which is supposed to deliver a balanced approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1111">These are pretty interesting amendments. We had a very interesting discussion about the intent behind them on Committee Stage. When I moved them, I indicated that I was not sure if I was barking up the right tree. It turned out that I was, which made the amendments even more important. These two clauses in the legislation give the DAA the ability to seek to have the existing An Bord Pleanála restrictions on night flights overturned. As has been rightly pointed out on a number of occasions, this is separate from the legislation providing for a competent authority in the future but, ironically, it is one of the reasons this Bill has been pushed. The intention of the DAA has been abundantly clear. Once the competent authority is in place, its first mission will be to use the structure we will set up here to get those two conditions overturned. That is an incredibly worrying scenario for the residents, many of whom are workers at Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> Let us deal with some of the issues. Nobody wants to shut down Dublin Airport. I worked there. Most of my friends still work there. My constituents work there and we all live close to it. It has been a very important economic driver for all of us and we want that to continue. However, just like the discussion we had on farming earlier, the aviation business has to be seen in the context of climate change, sustainability and the damage done to people's health and the environment. That is not just my objective; it is EU law that we must have this in place. Ten years ago, when we did not know as much about the negative health impacts of aircraft noise as we do now, An Bord Pleanála saw fit to put measures in place to restrict night-time activity. To offset that, it got off lightly in terms of, for example, noise insulation on the understanding that these restrictions would be put in place at night. It does not mean the airport will shut. We have seen the statement from the DAA suggesting that if we bring this in, it would lead to something like a 40% reduction. Air traffic at Dublin Airport will increase when this runway opens. It is good that some of the night-time activity will be more curtailed than previously, but it does not mean that there will be fewer aircraft. It also does not mean that the airport will close or that airlines will locate in other airports. It means it will cost them a bit more money, which is just tough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> The enormous increase in air traffic between 2008 and 2018 has come from the non-business sector. Non-business tourist travellers do not need to get up in the middle of the night in order to fly out of Dublin Airport at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. to go to Fuengirola on their holidays. If they live in Waterford and need to go at 5 a.m., it means having to get up at 1 a.m. in order to drive to Dublin Airport. They are absolutely knackered and the first two days of their holidays are ruined. It does not suit them, but they do it because the airline operators schedule it so they can get the aircraft out and back more than once and increase their revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> Making airlines adhere to a night-time restriction means some of their aircraft will not go out and back, but they can still do their scheduling. There are hundreds of people employed in aircraft scheduling who match the airport operators' aircraft with their routes and carry out the planning in that regard. What they would do then, because we are not getting rid of all the aircraft, is that they prioritise the business routes. When airlines want somebody out early and want the businessman or businesswoman to return that night and have a range of flights to facilitate this, their aircraft scheduling allows them to do so without impacting on their sleep. This makes perfect sense. Nobody suffers. I accept that it might mean they have to employ a few more personnel to schedule the flights because they might have to add in more computations and permutations into the arrangements, but it is doable. How do we know it is doable? It is because it is done everywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> This is a quality-of-life issue. The key reason we need this is that mentioned by Deputy Brendan Ryan earlier. The legislation is not complete; it is very imperfect. We cannot have a competent authority, which is also the planning authority, regulating these matters. It is utterly insane to have these two clauses allowing Fingal County Council to overturn the decision it made on planning permission in the first instance. The Minister stated, when Deputy Brendan Ryan asked the question earlier, that the issue of the letter has been dealt with. It has not been dealt with. Fingal County Council is on record as stating it has problems with that. In January 2018, the Government made a decision to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority. On the previous occasion, we read into the record correspondence subsequent to that decision from senior officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to Fingal County Council in which they were seeking to discover what was the rate base. This shows that the conflict of interest points had not been explored prior to the decision being made. This actually teed up a pretty strong legal action and led to the EU writing to the Minister informing him that the independence of the authority must be sacrosanct.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> Subsequently, the residents, by means of freedom of information requests, obtained an outline of all the contact between the Department and Fingal County Council including details from the Minister's diary. There are no records anywhere of the meetings that supposedly took place. The Minister told Deputy Brendan Ryan that it was all right and that Fingal County Council knows it is sorted now. Where are the records? Fingal County Council was supposed to deliver information under freedom of information yesterday and then it postponed doing so until today. As a result, we have not seen any evidence. Where is the paper trail to show that the council changed its mind? Allowing these two clauses to remain will open up a legal nightmare in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1117">As the Deputy would expect, I will not be accepting these amendments for the same reason I gave on Committee Stage. I set out the purposes of these provisions on Committee Stage and I will briefly reiterate these now. These sections provide clarity that any existing noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, whether in effect or not, will come under the remit of a noise regulation and the full provisions of this Bill and regulation 598 will apply to them. This includes the noise insulation scheme, about which we have just spoken, and any measures attached as conditions to an existing planning consent, including the current operating restrictions which have not yet been activated. Simply put, all legacy measures related to noise management will transfer to the remit of a new noise regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> It is vital that the noise regulator is empowered to take a full view of all existing and potential future noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions at the airport. This is in order to apply the balanced approach properly now and through each future regulatory cycle. To be able to regulate, monitor and manage noise at the airport now and into the future, the noise regulator has to be able to review and consider how well existing measures are working, whenever they were introduced. Technology and noise management solutions are bound to change and simply because something is effective at offsetting noise today does not mean it will be effective forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> I know there is a deep suspicion that these sections are about undoing the operating restrictions that are attached to the new second runway at Dublin Airport. They are not. However, they allow the noise regulator to review these restrictions and other measures, if it has cause to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120"> It is no secret that the DAA's position is that the operating restrictions attached as conditions to the planning permission for the new runway mean that the new runway is unworkable. The company has explained that the effect of the restrictions will be to halve the number of night time flights from current levels. It claims that this will have serious implications for connectivity, passenger choice and future growth at the airport. I do not know the extent to which that view is correct and I do not know if the operating restrictions are the right solution to managing the noise impact of the new runway. I suggest that nobody in this House knows that either. However, I know it is perfectly sensible to allow the new noise regulator to review them, if it has cause to do so. If it decides to do so, that review will have to be done under the balanced approach, as set out in regulation 598 and reinforced by this Bill. There will have to be extensive technical assessment and public consultation. Should this take place and should there be a decision at the end of it, that decision will ultimately be appealable to An Bord Pleanála. That approach is open, transparent, fair and balanced. There is no pre-determined outcome to any such review of existing measures. It would be entirely nonsensical to prevent the new independent noise regulator - operating in accordance with EU and national law - from examining, in the course of its comprehensive regulatory review, the impact and continued effectiveness of legacy noise management measures. As a point of principle, the noise regulator has to have the legal powers to review, revise or replace noise mitigation measures from time to time as new technology comes on board or as better options come to light.</p>

          <p eId="para_1121">I support Deputy Clare Daly’s amendments with respect to the deletions. This is extraordinary. To go back to what I said on Second Stage, in his earlier career the Minister would have found it unbelievable that a conflicted body would be appointed as a regulator. The papers released by the Department recently under a freedom of information request and reported in the <i>journal.ie</i> show that Minister was briefed that many regulated bodies are funded by the regulated entity in the form of a levy or charge on that entity. That is precisely what he would have railed against in the financial sector over the years. We know what happened in the financial sector when a regulator who was a hostage was not able to deliver independent judgments. The Minister is saying there is clarity. The point about this Bill is that it is a total failure. There is no clarity and there is no question that we will return to this legislation to appoint an independent regulator in the next Dáil. The Minister had the opportunity to address this matter and I believe his Department told him that. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, did not have the organisational capacity but one of the functions of the EPA under the European legislation is to be the regulator of noise in this country. This is provided for in legislation introduced in 2006. The EPA asked the four local authorities to work together to prepare an agglomeration of noise maps across our county and city region. That was the job given to the local authorities but, again, people refused to allow the noise map of the airport to be included in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122"> We are dealing with a very flawed process. We do not have noise limits in this country. The Minister can search through all the road traffic legislation. He will know this issue comes under a series of Acts covering noise, be it from barking dogs to machinery in factories and right across the area of production of noise. We know what the World Health Organization has codified as desirable low sound levels, namely, under 50 dB at night and under 55 dB in the daytime, with undesirable high sound levels defined as being above 55 dB at night and above 70 dB in daytime. The absolute values the WHO was aiming at were a little lower than that. As I understand it, we have not provided for these thresholds in any legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> In a previous Dáil, as the Minister might remember from his time in the Seanad, the former Deputy Ciarán Cuffe of the Green Party brought forward a noise abatement Bill to take account of noise across the board, including aircraft, commercial activity, major events or neighbours playing loud music or practising playing the drums, lead guitar or bass guitar. It was all-encompassing noise legislation, which we still have not enacted. I agreed with colleagues that it would have been better to appoint the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, as the regulator, but we did not do that either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> The last thing the Minister has given us is clarity on this matter. We do not have clarity and we do not know what will happen. The Minister has refused to create some form of reasonable regime, which an independent regulator could operate. It is reminiscent of other legislation in which he has been involved. </p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> A number of Members referred to the famous letter from 2017 which was sent by Fingal County Council's distinguished director of services, Ms AnnMarie Farrelly, in which she stated: "Fingal County Council does not have the requisite competencies available within the Council in areas of aviation operations, noise (including contour mapping) and economic feasibility assessments for the purpose of determining the cost-effectiveness of solutions within the context of the 'Balanced Approach' as set out in the Regulation." That statement could not be clearer. Regardless of whether complaints go to An Board Pleanála or into the courts system, we will regret that we had an opportunity in the Dáil - there is still an opportunity in the Oireachtas - to have a truly independent regulator but the Minister did not take it. He is leaving us with a bit of a mess because he is not prepared to deal with one of the important sources of noise, certainly for the area in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">I asked the Minister about the noise impact maps the last day. One of the things we know about the airport is that the serious noise impact map is growing across south Fingal, the north of my constituency and north west across to parts of County Meath. That is why so many of us were interested in this Bill in the first place. The basic point is that we wanted to give our constituents some kind of confidence that there is a system in place as the north runway commences operations and as the DAA intends moving from a 30 million passenger cap to 40 million or maybe 50 million - another Gatwick, another hub airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> Through the years, we have supported the development of the airport in a sustainable way because of the 100,000 jobs in the airport zone, to which the Minister referred on Second Stage. Nonetheless, we need a very clear regime in regard to aircraft noise and airport noise and we need systems of management, such as Deputy Daly outlined, in regard to managing the different cohorts of passengers, given the numbers are heading for 750,000 or 1 million a week. That is something the Minister has signally failed to do. He has not given us clarity. We have a real problem with this Bill. Unfortunately, we will be returning to this early in the next Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_1128">This is a serious situation. The Minister basically said he does not have a clue about the allegations in regard to the DAA or what the impact of those is going to be. That is not very comforting because what we have got a clue about, and what we know very clearly, is the health impact of exposure to noise, particularly exposure to noise at night-time. It was in deference to that, albeit at a period of time when we did not even understand as much about this, that these restrictions were put in to curtail night traffic. The Minister's opposition to my amendments was that we cannot tie the hands of the authority and it has to have the right to review things that have happened before now. However, it does have the right to review things that happened before now and that is inherent in the Bill. There are two methods whereby people can be brought before this organisation, one being new planning permissions and the other the impact of noise under the existing day-to-day life of the airport, which is already provided for. Something which was given at the time of the planning permission may not arise initially but then kicks in once the airport becomes operational, and the Bill covers that anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> We are not tying the hands of the authority in anything other than diminishing the protection of residents. The clauses that are there now are there. There is nothing to stop the competent authority from improving that situation by removing the two clauses that I want to remove in these amendments. It can still seek to improve the measures. All we are doing is stopping it from diminishing them. If it wants to outlaw more aircraft at night, that is brilliant, and it can do that. If it wants to put in more restricted conditions at night, it can do that. However, what it cannot do is make the protection less, which is incredibly important because it is already the case that noise insulation has to go well beyond the remit of this Bill. We have already provided for that in the legislation so the Minister's argument is irrelevant in that sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> We have discussed this for a long time and it is getting late. However, it is a very clear issue as far as I am concerned. I will be pressing the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1131">The focus of this legislation is to bring EU Regulation 598/2014 into Irish law. On Committee Stage, on a range of issues, the Minister responded to proposed amendments on the basis of WHO guidelines by saying that cannot be done because there is quite a specific purpose in this legislation. When we sought to change the definition of a balanced approach, the Minister came up with a similar response and said he had been advised by his legal advisers that this is quite specific and cannot be done. Yet, in this section, it appears miscellaneous matters are okay provided they are designed to achieve a particular objective, which has been clearly defined by the DAA in terms of its intent. It would be unfortunate if the starting point for this legislation was to assist the DAA in rowing back on what has been hard fought for and hard won at An Bord Pleanála on behalf of the residents. It was always open to the DAA to go back under the old legislation to An Bord Pleanála to seek to have these matters reversed. It is unfortunate that the Minister is facilitating this in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1132">I do not wish to be repetitive in any way because some of the statements being made are somewhat repetitive, although I understand the strength of feeling behind them. I want to address the issues which have been brought up once again. If anyone reads the regulation, they will see that its objectives are very much in line with the sentiments which are expressed by Members of this House. This is not my document. This is not a Fine Gael or Independent Alliance document. We are implementing a directive from Europe with some discretion about how we do it, admittedly, but with objectives which I hope everybody in this House would share.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> We are continuously getting the voice of the residents coming from the floor of this House, which we hope that we reflect. This directive constantly lays out that its objective is to take into account the views of local residents. I do not wish to read it to the Deputies. However, the issues which have been raised by the Deputies today and yesterday - of health, of local residents and of independence - are all prerequisites of what is in this document from Europe which we have in front of us. To suggest that we are somehow running counter to the care of the environment, to the interests of health and to the interests of local residents is just not a fair interpretation of what this Bill is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> The Bill is appointing, in accordance with the directive, an independent noise regulator to take into account, in a balanced approach, the views of residents, the needs of health and the requirements of the environment. That is what we are doing. There may be disputes and differences about who it should be, and we have been through that several times here today. However, what we have done is put it to tests of independence. The best tests we can put it to are legal tests, the Attorney General's tests, and a discussion with Fingal County Council itself. Although I do not know if the council needed much persuasion, it came around to the view, after a long discussion to which the Deputy was referring when referring to the letter, that it believes it is independent. The Attorney General has that view. I am not a position to challenge the view of the Attorney General on that or anything else, particularly as it is already decided. It had a contrary view in terms of the IAA, which many Deputies here would like to see as the independent regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> What we are doing here is producing, in difficult circumstances, a measure which will take into account everything in EU Regulation 598/2014 and take into account the balanced approach. It is a genuine and sincere effort to accommodate those conflicting interests in a very fair way. That is what we hope the regulator will be doing. It is wrong for anybody here to prejudge any decision by the regulator.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2019-03-27T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1137">The Minister said that Fingal County Council came round to the view and that it did not really need much persuading but we do not know whether it needed any persuading at all because the record does not show evidence of any meetings whatsoever. There are no minutes or records of contact but what the record does show is that subsequent to the Minister's decision to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority, his senior officials wrote to the council and asked some very basic questions around conflict of interest. After the decision was made and the Attorney General's view was sought, we know that departmental officials were in contact with the local authority looking for more information. This means that they did not have that information when the decision was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> To return to the point made by Deputy Broughan, the Minister is setting himself up for an absolute hiding in terms of this legislation because of the conflict of interest. It is a conflict of interest that he was warned about by senior officials in the European Parliament in terms of how this should be advanced. I repeat that we are the only member state that has chosen to appoint a local authority as the competent authority in this way. This is a very serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> In terms of the amendments that we are currently considering, the Minister is absolutely right that the competent authority is being brought in and this regulation is to improve the lives of residents in dealing with noise impact. If current measures which are in place in that regard are not sufficiently protecting residents, then the competent authority is being lawfully authorised in this legislation to order improvements. Taking out these two clauses is not going to prohibit, for example, the competent authority from looking at the operation of the new runway and deciding that 66 flights per night is too much and that it is going to cut the number down to zero, or whatever the case may be. That will not be impacted upon by these amendments. The only reason these two clauses are in the legislation is to allow the competent authority to reduce the protections that are already in place for residents. That is all they do and that is going against the spirit of this Bill and against everything we are supposed to be here to deliver. It is a betrayal of the residents who fought long and hard against that planning application in the first place. The route is still open to the DAA to apply for a new planning condition. It can come in at any time and submit a new planning application and have the issues evaluated. If my two amendments are passed, that will not change. The only thing my amendments will do is stop the DAA from going in immediately and undermining the existing conditions. It is absolutely true to say that I do not know if the competent authority will actually approve it or not. I do not know that but given that under this legislation Fingal County Council is the competent authority, it does not bode well. We would be better off fulfilling our responsibility and taking these two clauses out.</p>
