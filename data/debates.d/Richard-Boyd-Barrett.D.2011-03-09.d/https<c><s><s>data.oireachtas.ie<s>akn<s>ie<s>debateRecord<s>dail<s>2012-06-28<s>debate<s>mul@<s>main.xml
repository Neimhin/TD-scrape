          <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The House will agree that the flooding that occurred overnight was devastating and traumatic, especially in Cork and Belfast.  It has caused villages and towns, including Clonakilty and Douglas, to shut down and to deal with the damage this morning.  The local authorities should be commended on acting on the early warning system notice received yesterday to minimise the damage and to prevent lives being lost.  The Government should ensure that all possible assistance is given to the people affected in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Flash flooding is becoming more prevalent and it is crucial that as much preparation as possible is carried out to limit damage to homes and businesses.  Unfortunately, flooding in the Shannon basin has been a regular occurrence over the decades and little is done to prevent damage.  There appears to be confusion about acting on early warning systems.  Currently the OPW, Waterways Ireland and the ESB are charged with monitoring the Shannon.  No single agency is accountable or in charge of taking action when early warning signs are put in place.  The Government should put in place a protocol urgently to ensure that actions are streamlined and implemented.  Water levels should be reviewed urgently and a protocol should be put in place for the opening of gates down river when there is heavy rainfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Farmers along the Shannon maintain that summer flooding is becoming more frequent and severe.  We know that this June has been the wettest on record.  This is seriously affecting farmers and their ability to manage grazing and access to fodder.  Farmers in the region are genuinely concerned about costs and about being able to provide for their families.  Will the Government confirm today that a protocol will be put in place for early warning systems on the River Shannon and that one agency will be given overall responsibility?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I enjoin the Deputy in expressing concern, support and solidarity with the households and businesses that have witnessed devastating flooding overnight.  I enjoin him also in commending not only the local authorities but all the emergency services which have been working since yesterday evening on dealing with this emergency in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I wish to bring the House up to date on what is taking place.  The national co-ordination group for emergency management is meeting at present to assess the situation nationally and to work out any supports that may be needed at local level.  The group includes the OPW, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Defence, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the fire services and Met Éireann.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will provide an update on the situation and the response following the conclusion of the meeting under way at the moment.  A protocol is in place for when heavy rain is forecast.  Met Éireann contacts each relevant local authority likely to be affected.  They put in place their risk management processes, which are already worked out.  All local authorities are asked to send flood situation reports, if any, to the national co-ordination group.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">Following overnight flooding parts of Cork appear be the worst affected.  Our first concern is for the safety and well-being of citizens, households, businesses and for all those directly affected.  The Cork county and city crisis management teams convened this morning to co-ordinate the response to the flooding.  Cork County Council activated its flood response plan at 4 a.m. due to the severe flooding affecting parts of the county.  Approximately 50 millimetres of rain fell between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. and there have been reports of up to 70 millimetres of rain in some parts of the county.  Saturated ground due to the wettest June on record has exacerbated the situation.  The towns worst affected include areas of Douglas, Bandon, Mallow, Glanmire, Togher and Rathcormac and severe flooding has also affected Clonakilty.  Road blockages have been reported on the N71 road at Clonakilty, rendering it impassible at some locations and access to and from Douglas is severely limited.  Several roads in County Cork are also affected.  Electricity supplies have already been restored by the ESB in 8,000 of the 10,000 homes affected during the night in areas of Clonakilty and parts of some Cork City suburbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Some €44.5 million has been allocated to flood risk management schemes nationally, including the Mallow south and Mallow west schemes, the Fermoy, Bandon and Skibbereen schemes and the Ballymakeera scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Deputy Troy raised a specific point about co-ordination.  There is an ongoing situation in respect of the Shannon Callows area.  I am familiar with the problem and I will ensure that the national co-ordination group is mindful of it, although it is not among the areas most seriously affected in this bout of flooding.  I realise there is ongoing flooding there and that it has affected lands for many years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
          <p eId="para_9">I welcome that the national co-ordination group is meeting and look forward to receiving an update on the matter.  Can the Minister confirm that resources will not be an issue in tackling the flooding problems in the areas mentioned?  These areas have been badly affected by the rain that fell overnight and county councils and emergency services throughout the country are understaffed.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Unfortunately the issues arising in the River Shannon basin are very serious.  Hundreds of farmers and thousands of acres have been affected by flooding for the last several weeks and I can only imagine the problems were exasperated by last night's rainfall.  I ask that a protocol be put in place between the three agencies that monitor the river and that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine engage with the farming community with a view to providing assistance to affected areas.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_11">In regard to the supports available for flood management schemes, I was anxious to protect this vital area in the context of last year's adjustments to the public capital programme.  Climate change is affecting our weather patterns.  We are experiencing wetter summers, as was predicted, and we have just come through the wettest June on record.  For this reason, the allocation through the OPW for flood amelioration schemes is €44.5 million this year.  Even though money was much more plentiful during the boom time, €23 million was allocated in 2007 and €24 million was allocated in 2008.  We have significantly increased the quantum of money as well as getting better value for our expenditure due to reduced construction prices.  I can provide Deputy Troy with an indication of the specific works that are ongoing but this matter is subject to constant review by the OPW in order to ensure we provide the best possible protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">During the boom time construction was allowed on flood plains because of bad planning, which should never have been tolerated.  This is another legacy of the Celtic tiger which we are left to address.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_13">This week two of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues from Fine Gael called on the Government to breach its commitments under the Croke Park agreement.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, called for the suspension of pay increments in the same week as the Government yet again breached its own salary cap for the new chief executive of the VHI.  The Tánaiste responded to the soundings from his Fine Gael colleagues by asking Ministers not to get out of bed expressing views on Croke Park or the budget every Monday morning.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, knows better than anyone that any attempt by the Government to withdraw increments will disproportionately hit low paid public servants and new entrants.  I will set out the facts for him and, more important, his Fine Gael colleagues.  Higher grades in the public service have a single pay point and increments do not apply.  By contrast, a clerical officer on a starting salary of just over €20,000 would take 17 years and 13 increments to reach the maximum salary of €33,000.  The Secretary General, however, enjoys a single pay point of €200,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Can the Minister clarify to the Dáil whether the payment of increments to public sector workers are covered and protected by the Croke Park agreement and guarantee that the Government will not breach its commitments and will protect the earning power and living standards of low and medium paid public servants?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_15">Go on Minister, yes or no.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_7" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_16">Deputy McDonald will be fully aware that I am a strong supporter of the Croke Park agreement.  I have published and commented on the two reviews that have been carried out on the agreement to date and I am strongly of the view that it has delivered significant savings to the State, including payroll costs of €1.5 billion and non-payroll costs to supplement that.  Equally important is that the Croke Park infrastructure has afforded a mechanism for significant reform, which has not been fully recognised by some of the commentariat.  We have moved people, delivered services differently and downsized.  In the first two months of 2012 more than 8,000 people left the public service.  Chaos was predicted as result but the ability to redeploy, change rosters and move things - an infrastructure that many of my colleagues in Europe envy - allowed us to make fundamental changes in the way services were delivered in an atmosphere of industrial peace.  This is extremely important in terms of the perception of Ireland and our attractiveness to inward investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I am aware that in advance of the Croke Park agreement elements of increments were regarded as core pay.  That has been adjudicated by the Labour Court.  I have already expressed my view on addressing the quantum of pay.  We have imposed a cap on civil servants for the first time so that no civil servant is paid more than €200,000.  We also imposed a cap on pay in semi-States.  Deputy McDonald spoke about breaching that cap.  I will explain the pay scale in detail on another occasion when I have more time but, as the Deputy will be aware, it is an indicative scale of relativities.  We need to be honest in recognising that getting people with the skills required for some of the jobs that need to be done in the public interest and the public service requires a degree of flexibility.  I have indicated that but I have appointed nobody and have authorised no payment in excess of the cap of €250,000 that I announced in respect of the semi-State sector.  When one considers that only 18 months ago some individuals were in receipt of salaries that were multiples of that cap, one gets a sense of how far we have come.  We need to achieve a balance between what is right in terms of driving State industries to be productive and deliver on jobs, which is the No. 1 priority for this State, while at the same ensuring solidarity in both the private and public sector in this time of difficulty.  One can also see the revolution that is taking place in the private sector in regard to exorbitantly high pay rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I am anxious to negotiate and interact with the trade union movement, as I do all the time, to get the best value.  As long as the unions that are signed up to the Croke Park agreement deliver their side of the bargain, the Government is committed to delivering its side.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I am sure the irony is not lost on people when the Minister speaks about solidarity and pats himself on the back for pay caps of €200,000 and €250,000.  He cannot confirm to the Dáil or the people that low paid public servants will not be attacked again and that their increments are safe.  I asked him a straightforward question.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">He spoke about pay ceilings.  He breached them repeatedly in respect of his own special advisers and we are now presented with the scandalous situation of a salary of €238,727 for the new man coming into the VHI.  In that context, I think the Minister can be clear with us and I will put the question to him in a straightforward way.  I do not want to hear about elements or parts.  I want him to tell the Dáil that the increments for low paid public workers are secure and that the Government will honour its commitments on pay to people who are already struggling.  Are their increments secure, yes or no?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">Today, the annual general meeting of AIB is being held.  The Taoiseach is heading to Brussels to talk about debt relief.  AIB is a Government-owned bank in a pivotal and important position.  The Government has backed all resolutions for debate and passage at the AIB annual general meeting.  The Government has accepted highly questionable accounts and has voted through and accepted all of the directors, including the publicly appointed directors, for re-election.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Most dangerous of all, the Government has agreed to the reappointment of the auditors, KPMG, which has been in charge of auditing AIB for ten years.  That ten-year period included a period of gross under-provisioning during the property frenzy and the collapse because property was overvalued on the balance sheet.  The audit fees extracted by KPMG during that period amount to more than €50 million.  The company is obviously not giving value for money.  Why is it also granted the audit for Irish Life &amp; Permanent and other banking basketcases owned by the Government?  Is the Minister satisfied that there has been no tender in ten years and that the company is still auditing the accounts?  Is the company providing value for money?  The Government could surely save money by cutting audit fees and capping audit fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The Deputy mentioned that the Taoiseach is on his way to Brussels with the Tánaiste for a very important European summit.  The agenda item we have sought for the best part of a year, to refocus the EU commitment to growth and jobs, will be crystallised today with concrete measures to the value of €130 million.  That will have an impact on our requirement to stimulate the economy.  I will bring specific proposals on that to the Government shortly.  The Minister for Finance and I will meet the president of the European Investment Bank to deal with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Deputy Ross also makes mention of a large issue of great focus over the next coming days.  We need a resolution to the ongoing banking crisis in order for the domestic economy to recover.  We need a solution to the eurozone crisis and we have brought proposals to the table in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">The Deputy specifically mentioned AIB.  I do not intend to make good, bad or indifferent comments about specific audit firms but we are fundamentally examining the way we procure any service.  AIB is not a State company but is largely owned by the State.  The State has invested a huge volume of taxpayers' money.  I assure the Deputy we are driving new procurement arrangements to ensure all services, whether audit or legal services, are properly tendered.  I am not familiar with the specifics because it is not in my direct area of responsibility but I will pass on Deputy Ross's views to the Minister for Finance.</p>

It disappoints me that the Government, as full owner, is continuing to allow this racket to continue.  There is an opportunity for the Minister to say to the House that it will not continue, that auditing will be put out to tender for all State-owned banks and that he will insist the fees are lower.  Fees amount to €50 million over a number of years and €4 million for KPMG last year.

We want to ensure there is a sustainable path to pay debt.  The Deputy asked whether we have factored in the impact of debt write-off in terms of the recapitalisation of banks.  That was part of the assessment by the BlackRock group and others last year.  They determined the volume of money required to recapitalise fully the banks to meet any contingency that might realistically arise.  That included the mortgage impairment they foresaw.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_96">In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_97">"(2) In this Act "Act of 1999" means the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999.".</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The Minister of State will be aware that SMEs are not compelled - and are exempt from the requirements - to have an audit if they have a turnover of €8.8 million per annum or less, and if they are employing fewer than 50 employees.  Unfortunately, this situation does not apply to brokers because they are covered by different legislation, albeit perhaps for good reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Brokers are compelled to have an audit regardless of turnover, which has created great unfairness in this business.  Brokering is largely an advice-based business.  Generally speaking, brokers do not handle clients' money or premiums except in specified limited circumstances where the relevant insurer is anyway responsible for the moneys.  Therefore the risk of insolvency is extremely limited.  In so far as consumers have money with brokers, they are also protected through ICCL and professional indemnity insurance.  A broker who might only have a turnover of €100,000 or less is compelled to have an audit.  Brokers in my own home city of Limerick say that an auditor will not conduct an audit for less than €5,000.  However, another type of business with 100 times that turnover is not compelled to have an audit.  This is blatantly unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">I will cite a case study from my own area.  In the wider Limerick region there are 52 brokerage firms, which are responsible for several hundred jobs.  This amendment seeks to reduce the cost on those small businesses so that they can maintain the jobs.  Limerick city and the Limerick region generally has been ravaged by unemployment.  The mid-west was reliant to an extraordinary, above-average degree on low-skilled manufacturing, tourism and related businesses that have been especially affected by the recession.  We have lost a number of white-collar jobs in the brokerage business, but I am trying to hold on to what we have left.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Due to a combination of bad planning, poor decisions by local authorities and the recession, Limerick city centre is physically scarred by unemployment.  There are run-down and derelict buildings as well as closed shops.  Every time I walk down the main street, I see another shop closed.  I often take a walk around the city centre at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. at night and it reminds me of Goldsmith's "Deserted Village".  We must get activity back into the city centre therefore.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Many of the white-collar brokerage jobs are based in the city centre, while others are based in retail parks and shopping centres that have sprung up outside the city.  They tell me, however, that if there was sufficient activity back in the city centre they would relocate there.  It is not a matter of helping people to make extra profits, or catering for one particular business sector; it is a question of correcting a glaring anomaly in so far as the requirement for audit is concerned.  As I have explained, somebody with a turnover of €100,000 or less, and is making no profits, is compelled to pay €5,000 for an audit, whereas somebody with a turnover of €10 million is exempt from that requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">This amendment is about protecting jobs.  Brokers throughout the country, not just in Limerick, are responsible for providing thousands of jobs within the economy as a whole.  Nonetheless they are under severe pressure and have been badly squeezed by the recession.  I am seeking to assist them to retain jobs by reducing costs on them.  In my view, this is an unnecessary cost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
          <p eId="para_104">I too have spoken to industry representatives about this issue.  This industry, which employs thousands of people across the State, is under great pressure.  Many of the companies involved are small.  For a small business to have to meet the cost of a €5,000 audit on a regular basis is an imposition.  Also, this cost is generally passed on to customers.  One of the major elements in terms of competitiveness in this State and, at the times, the lack thereof is the high cost of insurance.  The State should be doing everything possible to reduce costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">I do not support regulation for regulation sake.  I do, however, support regulation where it safeguards the public and businesses.  The Central Bank has communicated the opinion that it does not see any reason this change could not be made.  This is important.  I do not believe we should jettison regulation easily but the Minister needs to come up with good reasons for the imposition of this particular cost on brokers.</p>

I also raised the issue of charitable organisations, many of which are involved in communities throughout the country, who are required to have their books audited despite that their turnovers are relatively small.  I am involved in a charitable organisation, the biggest expense of which every year is audit fees in respect of which we fund raise in the community, although we would rather funds raised in that way were spent for the benefit of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">I hope the Minister of State will take on board some of the views expressed today and that his response in that regard, including on the suggestion I made, will be positive.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p eId="para_108">I thank Deputies O'Dea, Tóibín and Lawlor for their comments thus far in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The purpose of the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Dea is to provide for the removal of the prohibition contained in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 on insurance intermediaries incorporated as limited companies availing of the exemption provided for at section 32 of that Act from the requirement to have their accounts audited.  Insurance intermediaries are regulated by the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, as amended.  This is because of the nature of the activities in question.  The prohibition on availing of the audit exemption in the company law measure to which I have just referred is on prudential grounds and at the behest of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to vary or remove this prohibition in company law unless expressly requested to do so by the Central Bank and Department of Finance, or with their agreement.  No such request or agreement has been made or given by either regarding the making of a proposed audit exemption at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The cohort of insurance intermediaries prohibited from availing of the audit exemption under company law represent not the totality of insurance intermediaries but those incorporated as limited liability private companies.  All entities outside that category are and will continue to be subject to the obligation to have an audit under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, as amended.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has consulted with the Department of Finance and Central Bank on the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Dea.  The Central Bank responded to the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, PIBA, stating that the financial regulator had noted its proposal, to which it was sympathetic, but cannot exempt its members from a statutory requirement.  There is a legal obligation on investment business firms, including insurance intermediaries, to submit audited annual accounts as provided for in the statutory provisions contained in the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, IIA.  Those provisions apply to all investment business firms, subject to the IIA and are not applied on a case by case basis.  Insurance intermediaries will fall for regulation under the supervisory framework set out in the Insurance Mediation Regulations, IMR, 2005, which transpose the insurance mediation directive into Irish law only when the IMRs have been revised to ensure proper transposition of that directive.  One fully transposed, insurance intermediaries that do not provide investment services would no longer be subject to the legislative and supervisory requirements applying under the IIA.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">The Central Bank would not object to insurance intermediaries being removed from the IIA in circumstances where they are covered by final insurance mediation regulations which have been transposed into law.  Removing the requirement for insurance intermediaries to be audited under the Companies Act would conflict with the requirements set out under the IIA.  Likewise, removal of insurance intermediaries from the IIA without suitable supporting regulations or legislation would result in these entities falling outside the scope of regulation, which is not a situation with which the Central Bank would be comfortable.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The Department of Finance states that further necessary detailed work on this matter requires to be undertaken by it.  Consequently, it is unable to give its approval to the proposed amendment.  Given the position of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, based on prudential considerations, I cannot accept these amendments, which have no connection with the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The proposed amendments relate to audit exemptions while the Bill specifically focuses on US generally accepted accounting principles.  The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2012 is an urgent measure, which needs to be enacted with delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">On the specific points raised, the following information may be helpful to the Deputies concerned.  The companies in question are subject to requirements and supervision which are outside the company law policy remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Obligations and requirements of a prudential supervisor, such as a Central Bank, are in place to provide the protections to safeguard the integrity of the systems in question and to protect the public.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has a public duty, in so far as the legislation for which it has responsibility is concerned, to uphold and maintain safeguards of which it is the custodian, in this case, the restriction applying to audit exemptions.  Only when clearance to change the eligibility criteria has been received from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank can the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation consider amending this legislation.  In the event that the position of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in regard to audit exemptions for insurance intermediaries changes, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would be prepared to consider making amendment to those provisions in a manner acceptable to the prudential supervisors.  Such amendments will be considered in the context of an appropriate company law Bill.  I hope that information is helpful to the Deputies concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I think it was Oscar Wilde who once said that when trying to make excuses for not doing something one excuse is more believable than several.  The Minister of State has given several excuses for not accepting these amendments, the first of which is that this is the wrong legislation in which to make this change, which is nonsense.  The Investment Intermediaries Act is not before the House.  We are dealing with company law legislation, which is the appropriate legislation to make the amendment if the will existed.  The Minister of State has told us that the Department of Finance and Central Bank are not in agreement with this proposed change.  I would like to put on record the information available to me in this regard.  I challenge the Minister of State to deny this.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Some three years ago in 2009 the then Minister for Finance, who was acting on the advice of the Department, promised that this legislation would be changed to accommodate the type of situation I am seeking to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">In a letter to PIBA dated 9 May 2012, the Central Bank confirmed the issue was considered by the Department of Finance during 2009 but was not finalised.  The letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_119">The proposed amendments included removing insurance intermediaries from the scope of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.  I confirm that the Central Bank had no objections to this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Could anything be clearer than this?  We are now told the Department of Finance and the Central Bank have not made up their minds.  They both had their minds made up three years ago.  Has the situation changed in any material way since?  Has a different decision been made?  Have they reconsidered their position since 2009 and, if so, why?</p>

          <p eId="para_122">The position of investment intermediaries has worsened considerably.  Many of these white collar jobs have been lost since 2009 and people are under greater pressure now than they were then.  The Department of Finance and the Central Bank were willing to change in 2009 but the Minister of State expects us to believe this is no longer the case.  We are also expected to swallow the canard that this is the wrong legislation.  This is pretty pathetic.  I would have imagined the Government could have come up with a more substantial excuse than this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
          <p eId="para_123">I take the view of the Central Bank with regard to this issue but from the response it seems everybody involved realises there is an onerous burden on the industry, particularly on the smaller players.  If these individuals were allowed to operate without the current auditing procedure, the Central Bank would not feel directly confident, but I believe the Central Bank looks sympathetically at the idea that something needs to be done.  The Minister of State has said this will be done when an appropriate companies Bill comes before the House.  When will this happen?  How long more must these businesses struggle under the weight of this burden which almost everybody agrees is unfair?</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The Minister of State was asked a question with regard to the various outputs of the accountancy codes.  If we have two codes, the likelihood is they will not give exactly the same answers.  I would like the views of the Minister of State on this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_125">I welcome the points made by the Deputies and I am happy to clarify the issues.  With regard to the letter referred to by Deputy O'Dea, it contains other paragraphs which I will read into the record.  I do not know whether the Deputy has a copy of it.  Deputy O'Dea's quote from the letter was: "The proposed amendments included removing insurance intermediaries from the scope of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.  I confirm that the Central Bank had no objections to this proposal."  This is not the full context of the letter as it also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_126">The Financial Regulator has noted your proposal and does look on this matter sympathetically.  However, it cannot exempt your members from a statutory requirement.  The position remains that the legal obligation on investment business firms (including insurance intermediaries) to submit audited annual accounts derives from the statutory provisions contained in the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Those provisions apply to all investment business firms subject to the IIA and are not applied on a case by case basis.  Insurance intermediaries will fall for regulation under the supervisory framework set out in the Insurance Mediation Regulations of 2005, which transposed the Insurances Mediation Directive into Irish Law only when the IMRs have been revised to ensure proper transposition of the Directive.  Once fully transposed, insurance intermediaries that do not provide investment services would no longer [be] subject to the legislative and supervisory requirements applying under the IIA.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_127">The Central Bank would not object to insurance intermediaries being removed from the IIA in circumstances where they are covered by final Insurance Mediation Regulations which have been transposed into law.  Removing the requirement for Insurance Intermediaries to be audited under the Companies Act would conflict with the requirements set out in the IIA.  Likewise, removal of Insurance Intermediaries from the IIA without suitable supporting Regulations or Legislation would result in these entities falling outside the scope of regulation which is not a situation the Central Bank would be comfortable with at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">With regard to the issue raised by Deputy Tóibín, more than likely the companies Bill, which the Department hopes to publish towards the end of the year, will be the appropriate vehicle or context in which to consider these amendments.  The Department has a clear intention to take on board all of the issues raised and, if appropriate, to place them in legislation to be published by the end of the year so the Central Bank, the regulators and the Department of Finance are all happy with what we are doing.  This is pretty quick considering the legislation before us and our commitment to having an appropriate vehicle for the regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">The Minister of State stated that it will be appropriate to deal with this in the next companies Bill.  This is a companies Bill but it is not appropriate to deal with it in this legislation.  In the meantime these businesses are under pressure and jobs are being threatened and lost.  However, we must wait for the next companies Bill, whenever that will be, and I do not see the logic in this quite frankly.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The Minister of State quoted from the full letter from the Central Bank in 2009.  If I understood what he said, the letter indicated it would not be appropriate until the relevant regulations were in place.  This was three years ago.  We are now being told the relevant regulations will be in place by the time of the next companies Bill, whenever that will be.  When will the relevant regulations be in place?  People were sympathetic in 2009 and all that had to be done was to put in place these regulations.  Three years later we are still sympathetic but there is no sign of the regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">In my Second Stage speech, I welcomed the Bill and outlined why my party strongly supported it.  It is about foreign direct investment and keeping the country as attractive as possible for such investment on which my region, in particular, is heavily dependent.  From that point of view, I support the general purpose of this Bill.  I regret that the Government did not take the opportunity to make the amendment I suggested but I strongly support the general thrust of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
          <p eId="para_357">I welcome this important Bill.  It is important that we give foreign direct investment all the support we can, but it also important that we make sure that foreign direct investment does not operate as an enclave in this State, which it does in many ways.  Some 80% to 90% of the inputs into chemical and pharmaceutical industries, which make up 60% of our exports, are brought into this State and serious work needs to be done to create the necessary links between the domestic economy and foreign direct investment.  While we do good work in attracting foreign direct investment, the domestic economy is sick and has fallen off a cliff, so to speak.  Until that is dealt with, the jobs issue will not be addressed.  That is why it is important the Government lives up to the promise it has made today in regard to the insurance brokers association to develop a Bill before the end of this year that will include a proviso to reduce the regulation burden on its members shoulders and the cost to them of audits.  It should bring in the insurance brokers to discuss with them what is necessary to drive their industry forward.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p eId="para_358">I am pleased to stand in for my colleague, the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, for the taking of Report and Final Stages of this Bill, which is compact and focused in nature and proposes a small number of changes to an existing company law measure.  It is proposed in the interest of maintaining a dynamic and flexible operating environment for the commercial enterprises in question.  I thank the Deputies for their support for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">This proposal can be viewed as an element of the Government's policy of stimulation and facilitation of foreign direct investment.  Those companies with a presence in Ireland and availing of the US GAAP facility under the 2009 Act provide significant employment here which the current measure should help to consolidate with the possibility of future jobs being created particularly in the event of a pick up in the economic situation in export markets over the coming period.  It is a facilitative measure which exemplifies the Government's practical and active approach to industrial promotion and stimulation of foreign direct investment.  The extension of the timelines both in the US GAAP provision and in the scope to designate other internationally recognised accounting standards is a facilitative measure which tangibly illustrates the Government's practical and active approach to industrial promotion and the stimulation of foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I express appreciation for the contributions of Deputies to the debate and for their manifest support for this proposal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_363">Yes.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Before I talk about the substance of the Bill, the direction of which I agree and welcome, I wish to make a point about the procedure for dealing with the Bill this week.  We did not get access to Bill and its digest until earlier this week and I understand the debate is to be guillotined today.  This is important legislation, and it is extremely important for small and medium enterprises around the country.  It is difficult for me and other Deputies to make any meaningful input given those timelines and I wanted to bring that to the Minister of State's attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The focus of the Government and its predecessor, and of the media much of the time, is on foreign direct investment and multinationals.  We hear a good deal about that.  The multinationals are very welcome and they bring many jobs, money and expertise, but we do not hear much about a focus on the SME sector.  We know that 55% of jobs in Ireland come from the SME sector.  Interestingly, in the UK it is around 60% and in Germany it is around 70%, which suggests not only do more than half of Irish workers work in the SME sector, but there is huge potential to grow this sector.  Therefore, I welcome the Government's focus on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">There is an issue around not only focusing on the SME sector, but ensuring that the resources of the State do not only focus on exports.  Many Deputies would have heard similar stories to the ones I have heard.  Many business people in Wicklow have come to me and said they had a great idea, they have gone to country enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland but their idea is not export oriented and would not generate export oriented jobs.  The county enterprise boards and the Enterprise Ireland have said, "Sorry, it is not within our terms of reference and we are not about to help you".  From an economic perspective, anything that addresses import substitution is just as important as anything that is exported based.  An example would be if a person could set up a company in Wicklow or somewhere else that manufactures a product that we can buy domestically rather than something we have to buy in from abroad, as in the case of bio-fuels using rapeseed oil and so forth.  Import substitution from an economic perspective in terms of balancing our trade balance is just as important as exports but for some reason - it is a legacy one in that it is something the Government did not bring in but it seems to have continued from previous Governments - we have State agencies that will explicitly say to people if they are involved in import substitution rather than exports that the conversation is over.  I could not see in the Bill's digest anything that addressed this point.  I urge the Government to examine this and make sure that these loans are not just ring-fenced for high-tech export oriented companies.  Economically, there is a good deal of benefit derived from import substitution as well</p>
          <p eId="para_367">SMEs are struggling.  We know that the council rates are not falling.  There are one or two noticeable exceptions but, by and large, in a time of economic crisis the council rates are not falling.  The councils give good reasons for that.  The Government is pulling away central funding and the councils still need to provide services, but the people who are being made to pay for them are SMEs.  It is very difficult in the current economic climate and trading environment.  The cost of energy prices, transport and other factor imports have not fallen all that much, but the markets into which they selling, domestically and abroad, are in a great deal of trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">There is also a major issue for SMEs in Ireland with regard to the UK.  From memory, the competitive advantage that UK firms have had over Irish firms, be they selling into each other's markets, is about 30% just because sterling has devalued and the euro stayed strong because the ECB and the European powers were not willing to engage in quantitative easing and the kind of macroeconomic measures that would have devalued the euro.  The UK is our second biggest trading partner.  A 30% price disadvantage has been incurred by our SMEs in the past number of years just on the currency factor.  Many of those in SMEs have come to me and said they have cut their costs, they are as lean as they can possibly be and they are paying themselves the minimum wage.  They are trying to keep people at work but they are competing with people across the Border and in Britain who, during the past few years, are 30% more competitive than they are for doing nothing.  There is no way they can compete with that.  The SME sector in Ireland is struggling in a hugely difficult trading and currency environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I really welcome the principle of this Bill.  There are mixed messages coming from the banks, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the SME sector as to whether sufficient lending is happening.  We have had recent research from the Central Bank of Ireland which suggests that there is a market failure and that Irish firms are not being lent money by the banks, consciously or subconsciously, when it is reasonable, correct and prudent to lend to them.  We are also hearing other things.  We addressed this matter with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform some time ago.  He referred us to the Credit Review Office and the fact that only 44 claims had been made by companies that said the banks were not treating them fairly.  He used this as evidence that there was not this great unmet demand and that they were not being treated unfairly.  I have taken a look at the evidence on both sides.  It seems, particularly backed up by the recent Central Bank research, that there is prejudice and that many viable SMEs in Ireland are not - some of them are - getting money and that the counter-argument of the Credit Review Office that it has only had 44 claims does not stack up.  I do not know why the office has not received more claims.  Perhaps many small and medium enterprises are not familiar with it.  On balance, it seems there has been a market failure and in which case, this type of microenterprise fund makes a lot of sense and I welcome the principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">However, the fund is entirely inadequate.  I have examined the numbers.  It seems to be like trying to inflate a large bouncy castle with a bicycle pump.  The original fund will be €10 million with the aim of borrowing another €25 million and, over a ten-year period the objective is to lend €9 million a year, amounting to €90 million over the ten years.  This should be seen in the perspective of what happened this week when we have paid €1.1 billion to unguaranteed, unsecured bondholders.  The interest on that payment in perpetuity will amount to approximately €40 million a year.  On the one hand a fund is being created for struggling small and medium enterprises which are vital to the economic and social recovery of this country and this fund will lend €90 million over ten years.  In the same week and covering the same period we have taken an action which will incur a €400 million cost and this is just to service the interest on €1.1 billion.  I understand the Minister would like to be putting ten times this amount into the fund.  I urge him to make these comparisons to his Cabinet colleagues and explain to them that the market failure cannot be solved with €90 million because it is completely inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I suggest a range of policy issues for the Government's consideration.  I ask that import substitution be considered, not just for this fund but in the terms of reference for the county enterprise boards and for Enterprise Ireland.  We are missing a very great opportunity.  In fairness to Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards, their terms of reference do not permit them.  I suggest that a very simple change could be made in a number of weeks and which would aid economic growth, a stimulation of new ideas and encouraging entrepreneurs to think about new areas other than exports.  The small and medium enterprise sector needs an infrastructure such as innovation hubs, mentoring and training.  I acknowledge that the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland do some of this work but more is needed.  There are opportunities in towns around the country to set up innovation hubs and to bring, say, 30 entrepreneurs together to use shared facilities and to exchange ideas.  This works very well in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The fund itself will need ten times or 20 times the money.  I appreciate we live in very difficult financial times.  However, does it make sense to incur €400 million in interest payments on money which we do not owe but which we are paying while just €90 million is being allocated to try to deal with the market failure which is the lack of lending to entrepreneurs?  It seems our priorities are wrong and it might be better if it were the other way around.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Small and medium enterprises need relief on corporate rates, which are killing them.  They are hit immediately from the local authority with a very large bill which they cannot pay.  I ask the Minister and the Government to consider some form of council rate relief for this sector when enterprises are being set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I ask the Minister to consider another issue.  Viable businesses all over the country may have invested in property during the property bubble.  That single investment is killing the small and medium enterprise and is putting people out of business.  It should be possible to create a legislative mechanism and financing structure which would allow for the separation of these two debts.  If a viable business in a town is employing between two and ten people and is therefore within the remit of the fund but a mortgage on an apartment will put those ten people out of work, it should be allowed to separate that debt from the company in order to protect the jobs and the enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Small Firms Association welcomes this Bill.  The association also advocates proper social welfare protection for the self-employed.  Potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to take risks in order to create jobs and they are helped with a small level of funding.  However, if things go wrong, they get nothing.  The social welfare payments for the self-employed who lose their jobs are means-tested.  However, mortgage payments are not taken into account when assessing income.  If the household is paying €1,500 on a mortgage out of an income of €2,000, in real terms this is an income of €500 a month and they will need the assistance of a social welfare payment but the means test does not take the mortgage payment into account.  I would like the Minister to consider these five or six issues.  These provisions in this Bill are a start but we need to do much more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_376">I am pleased the Minister is here this morning to listen to what we have to say.  I agree with the previous speaker that the delay in publishing this Bill and the use of the guillotine is a very unfair way to do business.  I know the Minister and the Department are very busy and under pressure but this issue stands out like a sore thumb.  Small businesses are not being looked after.  They are the backbone of our communities and I include the small shopkeepers, small farmers, farriers and many other service industries which are often family businesses for generations.  Such businesses have been good employers in their community and they are struggling.  They have been good and compliant taxpayers.  However they must also deal with a plethora of regulations on health and safety and insurance and they are being strangled.  To cap it all, the banks have abandoned them.  I am not a member of the finance committee but Deputy Donnelly referred to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, saying that only 44 people had applied to Mr. John Trethowen of the Credit Review Office.  He has only three staff.  I heard him say about three weeks ago that the banks were not living up to their promises.  The two main banks promised the late Minister, Brian Lenihan - God rest him - that they would provide the funding for the sector.  I know for a fact they are not providing funding to small businesses.  Many of these businesses have a small overdraft earned with their sweat and blood over the years and the overdraft may amount to €25,000.  The banks are calling in those overdrafts.  Businesses cannot buy stock because cash payment in advance is required as a result of wholesalers being caught out.  They cannot pay cash without an overdraft facility and they cannot pay for a delivery of fuel or goods.  Agricultural contractors are unable to pay for plastic and diesel.  The banks call in their clients to inform them they are removing overdraft facilities but they offer a term loan instead.  I wonder why they cannot be stopped and this practice exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I can explain why Mr. Trethowen and the Credit Review Office have only received 44 claims.  I have been in business for 30 years since last February.  I have a good relationship with my bank which may be fraught from time to time but the bank knows me.  I know that nobody will want to report a bank to the Credit Review Office because they are conscious of the reputation of the informer in past times.  They will not complain about a bank because they do not want their relationship with a bank to turn sour overnight and then they would be up the river without a canoe.  It is not the case that people do not want to go to the Credit Review Office but we must understand why they do not complain.  In any case, business people do not have time to make a complaint.  They are trying with might and main to stay in business and they do not want to spend time filling in forms and more important, they do not wish to get a black mark against their name in the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">There is also the issue of rates.  We all know rates are crippling people.  I was a member of the county council and I know why rates must be levied, but people are getting no value for the rates.  The county councils are stretched, as we have seen today.  They do not have local workers on the ground any more.  As I said recently about my local council, it is all chiefs and no Indians.  They do not have workmen carrying out maintenance to stop places being flooded.  Again, we are getting bad value for money in that area.  This must be examined.  We must deal with rates and review the rates system.  Currently, one must appeal to the body that assesses the rates in the first instance, which will cost €250 or €300 for the privilege, and it takes six or eight months to complete the process.  It is totally unwieldy and absurd.  We must also re-examine the legislation on upward only rent reviews, which are crippling bigger towns and cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I do not know why a new group must be set up for this fund.  The county enterprise boards were doing a tremendous job for the sole trader and businesses with up to five or six employees.  They are ready, willing and able to do this job, so they should be used.  Enterprise Ireland does good work too, but the business must have 200 employees.  There was nothing for the businesses in between.  That is where the money is needed.  I welcome the €6 million and the €10 million.  It is a start.  Tosach maith, leath na hoibre.  However, it is only a drop in the ocean, although I understand the economic climate in which we are living.  I am delighted with the shift in thinking in the Department and I congratulate the Minister on that.  Department officials need to get out, get down and dirty and understand what makes small business tick.  If the 400,000 businesses in the country employ a single extra person each, consider the impact that would have on the dole queues.  They could do it, instead of being driven out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">There is another big issue which I consider to be totally unfair.  It has affected many self-employed people since the crash took place.  They paid all their taxes, PRSI and so forth, and rightly so.  That is as it should be.  They were under a great deal of pressure to pay but they did so.  They wanted to be good, law abiding and tax compliant citizens, with honour, respect and dignity, unlike the cowboys that surfaced during the Celtic tiger economy who went off and left everybody unpaid.  They had no intention of paying anybody.  They wanted to get rich fast so they could go off in their yachts and whatever else.  The self-employed people, unfortunately, had to let their employees go.  It broke their hearts to let their employees go because they were good employees with whom they had a good relationship for years.  However, at least the employees got social welfare, despite how bad the situation was.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The employer, however, who drove the business and who will help this country to recover, got nothing.  They were left penniless, with just bills from the Revenue Commissioners.  Now, they have the sheriff knocking at their doors.  It is happening in my county in a village near Tipperary.  A man rang me last Sunday because the sheriff was due to come to his house again this week.  It is despicable.  The sheriff's charges and the Revenue Commissioners' interest are piling up, but one cannot get blood from a stone.  This person does not have enough to eat.  I appeal to the Minister to call off the hounds.  The use of sheriffs is an outdated practice but they are terrorising ordinary people.  These are people who were in business, gave employment, spent money and invested, housed themselves and looked after their families.  Now they are penniless and hungry.  The community welfare service will not help them because they have so-called assets.  In fact, they have no assets because they are worthless.  The last thing they need is a sheriff threatening and intimidating them.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">There is a sheriff for Tipperary and part of Offaly who should be retired or otherwise dealt with.  I will not name a person, but the system of a sheriff coming to somebody's door is like something one would read in an outdated book.  It must be changed.  There must be an understanding of the difficulties of self-employed people.  They are proud people who did not ask for anything from anybody.  They worked hard and now they are destroyed.  Their energy and any future investment and ideas will be buried with them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AineCollins" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Deputy Áine Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_383">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The Bill is another step by the Government to put in place initiatives to sustain small and struggling businesses so they can survive and return to growth.  It will also encourage people to set up much needed new businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have continued to identify the lack of finance from our banks as a core problem, which the Government continues to monitor.  However, the problem is broader than that.  Confidence in the economy is a huge factor in deterring business people from starting up and expanding businesses.  The establishment of a microenterprise loan fund is one of the many initiatives the Government has introduced to provide them with support.  We must ensure finance is available for small and new businesses.  These initiatives will create the atmosphere of confidence which will benefit the economy as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It is important to ensure, as the Irish Banking Federation suggests, that this scheme is up and running by the autumn.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide loans to businesses which banks are not in a position to provide because of the risk associated with small and new business.  The fund will be managed under the Social Finance Foundation, SFF, on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It will be established as a subsidiary of the Social Finance Foundation and, as the press release states, the intention is that under the guidance of the SFF the subsidiary will be equipped with the necessary levels of finance systems and skills and supported by the European Investment Fund, EIF, guarantee scheme to ensure a high level of efficiency, relevant expertise and strong corporate governance.  A single lender will, in the first instance, minimise the costs which are traditionally high with micro finance, as well as ensure a clear financial and management information reporting structure.  This will enhance the possibility of EIF assistance and allow for the clear identification of the costs involved in operating the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">This all sounds very good but we must remember at whom the scheme is targeted, small businesses with fewer than ten employees.  The owners of these businesses find the existing services through enterprise boards and local development companies very confusing and extremely bureaucratic.  It is one of the reasons that many small businesses shy away from seeking support.  Two years ago in Cork the economic development department of Cork County Council set up a fund of €1 million per year to perform a similar function to this fund.  It identified gaps in existing programmes where the enterprise boards, the local development authorities and banks fell short of providing the necessary finance for a project.  The council was able to help to provide the final piece of assistance which made the business proposition work.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I hope this proposed scheme does not add further to the concerns of small business owners by adding another layer of bureaucracy.  The terminology used and the national structure could be off-putting for small enterprises.  For that reason I welcome the Minister's suggestion that the fund will operate in conjunction with the enterprise boards.  I believe it should also be expanded into local development companies.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that.  The fact that the enterprise boards will soon be part of the local authorities will facilitate this process and perhaps in the overall reform of local government, local development companies will also become more integrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">In Cork, the council's economic development fund works through the enterprise boards and the local development companies under the auspices of the county development board to ensure there no duplication of services.  It also works very closely with third level institutions to create the spirit of enterprise.  This new fund could be assimilated into this process and in that way would be more accessible to local and small businesses.  It would not be as daunting as dealing with one agency after another, which is what we are trying to avoid.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">This Government is doing everything possible to encourage businesses and create jobs.  If the Government's initiatives are to be successful when dealing with smaller businesses, in particular, they must be fully integrated and administered locally with the minimum amount of red tape.  A new entrepreneur must have the confidence that they can easily access support.  These are the businesses that will make a huge contribution to creating jobs.  In fact, 70% of new jobs will come from new businesses, many of which will be supported by these initiatives.  A multiplicity of agencies and complicated procedures will slow down the process, if not stop it.  For that reason it is crucial that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the one-stop-shop approach, as is indicated in the jobs initiative, are implemented as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Finally, I ask the Minister to consider, as part of the process of being granted a loan, requiring that a business would also have to benefit from mentoring for a specified period of time, ideally for 12 months.  Business mentoring support can make the difference between success and failure for small enterprises and new businesses.  I have worked in this area for many years and I have seen the difference mentoring can make to a business and to the development of the individual business person, as well as the leadership skills from which they can benefit.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon</from>
          <p eId="para_391">The Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill gives us the opportunity to discuss the importance of small business to the Irish economy.  Compared with the multinationals and the headline news when big job announcements are made, small businesses and microenterprises might not appear as sexy and do not grab the headlines but I believe they are more important to, and have a far bigger impact on, our economy.  They are of equal importance, at the very least.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I have huge regard and respect for those who display entrepreneurial spirit and take a chance with a business idea.  In a way, they take on the system and confront all the challenges.  When one employs somebody, Friday tends to come around very quickly when one must have the person's wages.  Whether one has two, three or ten staff, it is a huge and constant pressure.  The point is that the Government must encourage these people and give them every support.  The phrase often used is that this Government, and governments in general, do not create jobs but the environment in which jobs can be created.  That is what we are examining here.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Leaving aside the Bill briefly, there are other points it is crucial for us to address for business and the way business operates.  One of those challenges is the PRSI system.  We need a review to examine how those who are self-employed can be given a mechanism that would allow them contribute more to PRSI in good times and therefore claim social welfare benefits in the event of their company folding.  In terms of somebody who took a chance, set up a business and employed people and that business goes to the wall, it is an unfair system that they are not entitled to social welfare yet the people they employed, who took the weekly wage job and did not take the same level of risk, are entitled to social welfare.  That discourages people from taking a chance, and it needs urgent review.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Rates is another issue.  When I was a councillor in my county of Kildare we examined the possibility of trying to get a reduction in rates.  In real terms we got a 1% reduction but it made no difference to the small business, the person who employed a few people.  The hairdresser, the shopkeeper or the publican did not notice the difference yet to the big industries in Kildare, the multinational companies - we are lucky to have them - a 1% reduction meant a huge decrease in the amount of income Kildare County Council was getting from them.  We must examine introducing a mechanism whereby those rates can be separated to make bigger reductions for smaller companies which will have a real impact and help them free up some of their funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">On the issue of redundancy, I understand the need for the changes recently to the redundancy measures under the Minister, Deputy Burton.  However, we cannot have a system that encourages a company like TalkTalk in Waterford, for example, to up sticks and close overnight when we are paying 60% of the redundancy payments.  It could be argued that is almost an encouragement for it to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The knock-on implications of the change in the redundancy measures down to 15% has been colossal for the small enterprises that employ just a few people.  I am aware of business people at home who inherited the business from their parents or started it themselves who have one or two members of staff who have been with them 15 or 20 years.  The business is struggling and they are terrified of the implications of having to pay 85% of the redundancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The other impact is not on the company that goes to the wall and loses all ten staff but the company with 15 staff which must lose five to keep safe the other ten jobs.  They need that level of support.  I have raised that issue with the Minister, Deputy Burton.  The<i> status quo</i> in terms of the old system of redundancy should be retained for small businesses with a turnover of between €800,000 to €1 million.  Those businesses are not employing people currently because of fear of the redundancy knock-on implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">On the loan fund, I am concerned that the money is not sufficient but the system is crucial.  If we get the system right the rest will fall into place.  Every person who is taken off the social welfare system and gets back to work benefits the State to the tune of €20,000.  A total of €9 million a year is small money but if we get the system right and the model is proven to work, which I believe will be the case, it will strengthen the Minister's hand in Cabinet to seek more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Cash is king, and the lack of credit is a major issue for businesses.  It has been proven by the Central Bank, ISME and the CRO that the banks are not lending in the way they should do.  Start-up companies and small businesses are always viewed as slightly risky by the banks, and in the recession it appears they are not lending in those circumstances.  That is the reason this Bill is badly needed.  The figures by the European Central Bank that Irish firms are 15% to 18% more likely to be rejected for credit than comparable eurozone small and medium enterprises speak volumes.  I welcome the publication of the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_400">I too welcome the Bill.  As part of the Government's ongoing strategy on an action plan for jobs, it fits in with the other initiatives including the credit guarantee scheme, the innovation fund and the development capital scheme, all of which target different scales of operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Jobs are the key to economic and social stability in any nation and in this State.  Job creation must be the key objective of the Government.  Multinational companies, small and medium business and larger indigenous businesses are located in different sectors and all of them must be encouraged and supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">This fund targets the microbusinesses that are starting up or already established who employ ten or fewer people.  That is an important sector.  A piece of work done some years ago by a Mr. Ahern in Teagasc in Cork found that there were 52 local economies in the countries which are centred around provincial towns with a hinterland of agriculture and a mix of small, medium and very large businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">In terms of small businesses, four issues have been addressed in the debate which must be considered.  The first issue is the lack of finance, which inhibits small businesses establishing, continuing or surviving.  The second issue, which was mentioned by Deputy Heydon and others, is rates.  That was raised earlier by another contributor who decried it.  Yet, when we try to spread the cost of running local authorities to a broader base there is an outcry.  We must be honest about the way we will fund local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The third issue is the problem of not having a safety net if one starts one's own business.  Deputy McGrath and Deputy Heydon mentioned that people are afraid to start their own business and establish an asset.  I know of one individual who had paid €3 million in taxes including PAYE, PRSI, his own income tax and VAT in a plant hire business that went out of business.  When all of his staff were let go they got jobseeker's benefit immediately but because he had some listed properties, which were his only option in terms of a pension, he was not entitled to anything.  While he could start his own business and claim back some of the PAYE he paid in recent years, which is a welcome initiative, when that traumatic event took place he was left high and dry.  He employed fewer than ten people.  He had a big turnover and a big tax bill.  He paid huge costs by way of extra revenue taxes on fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The issue of redundancy was mentioned.  That issue can be resolved but unless we support small businesses in a co-ordinated fashion and people with a good idea we will never rebuild local economies.  Like farm revenue, local small businesses spend 70% or 80% of their income locally.  That creates local jobs, and we must concentrate on nurturing those small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I welcome the efforts to streamline the mentoring system, be it through the county enterprise boards and the local enterprise offices.  Those are the initiatives that must be taken.  Putting the funding in place is welcome but that funding is for people who have been refused previously because they did not fit the banks' strict lending criteria.  They must be helped.  The people who will work with those people must recognise a good idea that is viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">This scheme will only be as good as the people who are mentoring, and I appeal to those involved to ensure that the people who are mentoring, and the people who come to them, understand the concept of doing business and creating a job or ten jobs.  I commend the Bill for what it is intended to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_408">When I first entered politics only a few years ago I spoke to a publisher I know in the United Kingdom and asked him what he wanted from politics and politicians.  He replied that what he wanted was for the Government to get out of his way.  He was talking about making it easier for businesses to set up and making it cheaper to employ people so that he could go about creating jobs and creating wealth, which would naturally be distributed throughout the economy and bring the stability in our society and in our lives about which Deputy Doyle spoke.  I found that very interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Before the general election our party discussed the role of government when it came to job creation and how it was not the role of government to create jobs directly but to create the environment in which jobs could be created, as referred to by Deputy Martin Heydon.  That is an important point.  It is not the role of the Government to create jobs directly, nor is it the role of the Government to lend money.  These are exceptional times and the Government is doing a host of things currently that it should not normally have to do.  While the circumstances are not welcome, the solutions from the Minister are.  It is for that reason this Bill is so welcome and important.  This fund will do some good.  It is important we move quickly with the legislation and get the fund up and running.  With regard to the fund itself, it is vital that Deputies cannot be lobbied on it.  Some people will take the view that because the agency is being set up, Deputies will have some influence and if those people do not get the funding they want, they expect we will be able to interfere.  It is vital that any potential linkage is broken and that it is made clear that Deputies will have no role in it.  We would not want political interference in what we hope will be a very good enterprise scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">With regard to small businesses, this fund is for companies of fewer than ten people looking to create jobs.  Yesterday, I met Seán O'Sullivan from Open Ireland and we discussed a technology visa and talked in general about how Dublin and Ireland could be made the Silicon Valley of Europe.  This is something in which I have been interested since my first days in politics.  We are aware we have underemployment in the IT sector.  The figures we have for this are approximately 2,200.  However, when one speaks to anyone working in the sector, one hears the figures are quite a bit higher.  The multinationals are starved of talent, but new start-up businesses setting up in Dublin cannot get talent either.  There is huge competition for the developers and engineers we have, and as a result they are very expensive to employ.  Consequently, small start-up businesses in the technology sector find it very difficult to get the right talent.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">We have a start-up entrepreneur visa scheme and an investor visa scheme, both good measures we would like to see get off the ground.  However, it is not just enough to invite an entrepreneur to come here and start a business.  That person needs to be able to bring people with him to work in that business.  That is the reason the proposed technology visa is so important.  It would be a specific visa for people working in the technology sector, with certain criteria that would allow people come in to work in these new Irish companies or to fill vacancies in indigenous companies.  Some 5,000 technology visas would create 20,000 jobs.  Studies done indicate that for every one job created in the IT sector, a further four jobs are created.  This is significant.  Often, when people talk about the technology sector and technology jobs, they say it is specific and only applies to a certain category of people.  However, it is the knock-on jobs created from those technology jobs being here that are significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The Taoiseach has talked repeatedly about his vision for Ireland and expects that by 2016 we will be the best small country in the world in which to do business.  Those of us interested in technology and the high-tech sector, as is the Minister, are talking about making Ireland the Silicon Valley of Europe by 2012 and the best place in the world in which to start a technology business.  This is an important goal and one to which we should aspire.  It is for that reason the technology visa is so important.  I know it is not particular to this Bill, but as we are talking about ways in which the Government can help create an environment to help businesses set up, get going and employ people, it is relevant to today's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I know the Minister has been briefed on the technology visa, but I urge him to take part in any conversation or discussion he can with the Minister for Justice and Equality on this front to see that we can move to such a scheme.  This would be a welcome part of the many measures the Minister is introducing in these exceptional circumstances to help tackle the unemployment crisis.  This is important for all of us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_414">As far as it goes, this Bill is welcome.  Anything done to provide extra finance to small and medium enterprises and any effort made to stimulate the domestic economy should be welcomed and supported.  There is nothing to oppose in the Bill, as it is an effort to give some support to the small and medium enterprise sector and to the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">However, if the aim of the Bill is to address the enormous crisis facing the small and medium enterprise sector, the massive unemployment crisis of 438,000 people unemployed, the collapse in the domestic economy we have witnessed over the past four years or the credit crunch associated with that, the Bill is tantamount to whistling in the wind.  It reminds me a little of the story of Peter and the dyke.  People may be familiar with the story of Peter and the dyke.  Peter noticed a hole in the dyke and stuck his finger into it to stop the water coming through.  However, cracks and new holes kept appearing all over the dyke making it an impossible situation to resolve.  This is not a bad analogy for this Bill in the context of what is happening to the economy and the scale of the crisis we face in terms of unemployment, the collapse of demand in the economy and the collapse of investment in our economy over the past number of years.  This Bill is only a small drop in the ocean, covering up the much bigger crisis and will not address in a substantial way that crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The lending capacity of the fund provided for in this Bill is €90 million.  For the small and medium enterprises that get loans from this fund, any amount will be welcome.  However, we should look at this €90 million in the context of a situation where we have removed more than €20 billion from the economy since 2008.  Under the terms of the EU-IMF programme, we will remove another €8 billion in the next few years.  Under the terms of the fiscal treaty recently passed, we will have to remove approximately another €5 billion or €6 billion in order to meet the deficit targets.  In addition, we may have to remove €3 billion or €4 billion per annum for the first few years when the treaty comes into force to meet the debt targets.  When we consider all of this, we get a sense of how microscopic this initiative is faced with the enormous withdrawal of resources and investment from the economy.  I do not see how we can address that problem in any serious way.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The issue of the banks lies at the centre of all of this and this infinitesimal initiative is trying to compensate for the massive banking problem we face.  We have got a fund that can lend €90 million, but we have put more than €60 billion into our banks.  We suffered enormous pain to do that and huge austerity has been imposed on ordinary people.  The justification put forward for imposing this crippling austerity on ordinary people in order to bail out the banks was that the banks would lend and invest in the economy; that the banks would provide support for small and medium enterprises and stimulate the economy more generally.  This has not happened.  One must ask why we are now setting up a small micro-enterprise fund, when the banks into which we pumped €60 billion should be doing this job.  However, they are not doing the job.  I do not understand the thinking behind the Government's failure to force the banks to lend and invest in the economy, particularly now that we own those banks.  What is the point?  Why are we allowing this to happen?  Government Deputies and Ministers are rightly bemoaning the failure of the banks to do the job they are supposed to do, but they remain at arms length from them.  If we own the banks why can we not tell them what to do, especially since it is glaringly obvious what they should do?  They should give a break to the tens of thousands of distressed mortgage holders who, because of their mortgage distress, are not spending money in the economy and consequently depressing demand on a vast scale.  The Government should tell these banks to start lending and investing again.  I do not understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">When set against this problem, the €90 million, as helpful as it may be for the 5,500 enterprises that will benefit from it, is simply a drop in the ocean.  I cannot understand why the Government will not address this central problem.  I can only imagine it is something to do with being ideologically blinkered and this ideological blinkering appears to be shared throughout Europe.  The policy of bailing out private banks is being implemented throughout Europe and we have helped to do this but it is not working anywhere.  Trillions of euro have been put into the banks throughout Europe but we still have a credit crunch, no money and no investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Gross capital formation in the State has dropped by 70% since 2008, a vast reduction.  There can be no recovery with such a fall-off in the level of investment.  Those with the resources to make investments are those in the banks because we put all the people's money into them and we have taken on a vast debt burden to further recapitalise them and other European banks as well.  Despite this we cannot tell them what to do or what they are supposed to do.  I do not understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Is it because of an ideological belief that it is not the Government's job to tell the banks what to do?  This appears to be the case.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy stated that it is not the job of Government to lend money to enterprises.  If not, whose job is it given that we now own the banks and they are not doing it?  Who else will do it?  No one.  That the Government has been forced to set up this fund is an acknowledgement of that fact.  The fund is minuscule, however, compared to the scale of the problem.  If the Government has recognised that it has a responsibility to stimulate the economy on this small scale and to put money into the domestic economy, why does it not realise that it should do the same on a greater scale and that no one else will do it?  I do not understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">People have raised other valid issues and I will refer to them for the record.  These include the fact that rates are crippling many small businesses.  Some 70 businesses in Dún Laoghaire have gone in recent years and Dún Laoghaire is beginning to resemble a ghost town.  The excessive level of rates is a major factor crippling small businesses.  Many others are hanging on by the skin of their teeth.  The high levels of rent which the Government has failed to address is an issue as well.  We could throw into the mix the issue of parking charges, which have been especially damaging.  I am unsure of the position elsewhere in the country but in Dún Laoghaire parking charges imposed by the council have done considerable damage to small and medium enterprises.  Small businesses in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere have been kicking up about these issues and they are right to do so but we all know the reason why local authorities will not budge.  Most county managers recognise the problem but they cannot reduce rates or parking charges because they have become a revenue stream for local authorities, which are chronically underfunded.  This all comes back to the austerity and the cuts that have been imposed on the funding of local government and, more generally, on the incomes of ordinary people.  The cuts affecting ordinary people are sucking demand out of the economy and the cuts being imposed on funding to local governments are essentially limiting their room for manoeuvre in terms of doing something about rates or parking charges.  All of this is being done to bail out our banks and European banks and to impose austerity.  I cannot understand how we can achieve the objective of the Bill if we do not address this much greater problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The problem appears to come back to an ideological viewpoint.  I have heard those in the Government state many times that it is not the job of the State to create jobs but to create the conditions for jobs to be created.  This sounds like a good slogan but what does it mean?  In what sense is the Government creating the conditions for jobs to be created by others?  Clearly, it is not doing so.  In fact, the Government is doing the opposite.  For jobs to be created by anyone there must be demand in the economy but there will be no demand in the economy if tens of thousands of people are saddled with unsustainable mortgage debt and if hundreds of thousands of people have had their incomes slashed.  As a consequence, they will not have money to spend in shops and businesses which, we hope, will be the drivers to chart our way out of the economic depression.  What is the alternative?  I do not believe there is an alternative unless we deal with the debt problem and unless we end the suicidal policy of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Let us put aside what has been done in the past and the €20 billion that has been taken out already.  The plan to take out a further €8 billion to meet the 3% deficit target will only further cripple our economy.  Set against this figure of €8 billion, a fund of €90 million goes nowhere; it is a drop in the ocean.  Why has the Government set itself against the idea of the State intervening in this situation on a grand scale?  The banks will not do so and the private sector is not doing so either because it has no wish to take the risk or, in the case of small and medium enterprises, it does not have the finance.  Why does the State not intervene and create the conditions for employment by identifying strategic areas where we have the resources and the people to develop enterprises and invest in them?</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I do not accept the view that it is not the role of the State to do this.  The State effectively moved from being a Third World country to a modern state as a direct result of the creation of large public enterprises, including the ESB, Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis and Aer Lingus.  That was how we moved from being a colonial backwater to a modern state, through the creation of state enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Employing tens of thousands of people in strategic industries will stimulate the rest of the economy but if the State does not step up to the plate in the way it has done in the past nobody else will do the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The theory that the Government and the political mainstream in Europe has promoted for the last five years simply is not working.  Regardless of how much money is shovelled into the banks, they are not reinvesting it in the economy.  Is it because of dishonesty or a lack of understanding that we bemoan the fact that the banks do not lend without asking why this is the case?  Is it just because they are run by mean and miserable people who do not understand how desperate we are?</p>

          <p eId="para_430">I am trying to put a serious argument to a Government which is failing to address the unemployment crisis.  I would be amazed if Deputy Humphreys did not believe the domestic economy is on the floor or that we have a real problem with our banks.  If the banks do not start lending this €90 million fund will not even begin to address the problem.  How many businesses are likely to succeed, even with the best intentions in the world, on the finance this fund can provide while demand continues to contract?  Demand is guaranteed to collapse further if we introduce further cuts and taxes on the incomes of ordinary people in coming budgets.  It does not add up.  I support this Bill but let us not pretend it will have a significant impact against a background of a depressed domestic economy and collapsing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Even though we now own the banks, they are refusing to lend because they know it is too risky to do so in the absence of demand.  If a business goes to a bank to request credit, the bank will point out that with the economy on the floor there is little demand for business products or services.  Until we address that issue, we are wasting our time.  It is time that the Government breaks with its ideological aversion to intervening directly in the economy through major public enterprise and public work schemes directed at strategic areas in order to put tens of thousands of people back to work and get demand into the economy.  By refloating the economy in this way, small and medium enterprises will begin to thrive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_432">I welcome the opportunity to contribute this Bill.  It is being introduced by the Government alongside other measures aimed at stimulating enterprise and creating jobs.  Nobody is suggesting this Bill will solve our economic problems or do everything for small businesses but it is a building block and it has to be welcomed in that context.  The small business sector supports 800,000 jobs and plays an important part in the economy.  The announcement by major multinationals over the past six months, such as PayPal, Apple and Allergan in my own constituency, are welcome but we should not forget the impact of the crisis and small and medium enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">This Bill will give a welcome stimulus to growth in small enterprises that provide three or four jobs.  These enterprises do not receive the headlines given to multinationals when they open or close their operations here but they operate under the radar to provide jobs and confidence in the economy.  The jobs they create foster vibrant communities, whether in towns, villages or rural areas.  The president of the chamber of commerce in Claremorris stated recently that 72 businesses have closed in Claremorris and Ballinrobe over the past four or five years.  That is an incredible figure for two small towns with populations of 3,000 each.  Previous speakers raised issues in regard to rates and parking charges.  The life of rural constituencies and small towns is been sucked away and some sort of remission from rates needs to given to small businesses in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">This Bill can be a catalyst for regenerating the economy and providing a financial impetus to entrepreneurs who feel hamstrung by their inability to access credit.  These businesses have been forgotten.  I have met business owners who have good ideas but have grown frustrated by the lack of finance.  One would could compare their plight to the university graduates who cannot find work because they lack experience.  Five years ago the banks were throwing money at people and a business which sought a loan of €50,000 would be offered €100,000.  Now the same business cannot get anything.  Many business owners are leaving the country while others who stay have to be supported by the social welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Whatever help this Bill offers must be welcomed.  If it works it will pay for itself because it will take people off social welfare.  Everyone would like the fund to be bigger but no single measure will solve the economy's problems.  It is the total package that counts.  I am familiar with a number of people who have experienced frustration at the inability to get credit.  This Bill will at least give them some hope.  I am glad to note that organisations representing small and medium enterprises in Ireland have welcomed the Bill because they understand the difficulties their members are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Bill recognises that businesses cannot engage in profitable opportunities when they are refused finance by the banks.  This in turn means that they cannot increase employment and in some cases they must make existing employees redundant.  The Bill's potential impact on economic growth is clear.  It will also have an impact on social welfare expenditure.  We welcome the large multinationals and all that goes with them but it is vital to recognise the role of small businesses, which is what the Bill does.  In many rural communities, there is no multinational or large employer but there are pockets of small firms keeping the communities alive and employing local people.  There is growing evidence of vibrancy.  Everyone is at their wits end but they have ideas.  Sometimes people's character is shown when their backs are to the wall.  Real leadership comes out, which is happening throughout the country with small business ideas.  The farmers' markets or country markets are an example.  These stalls are little businesses employing a couple of family members seeking to exploit a niche in the market.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill provides people with an opportunity and a leg up to use their resources to provide a few jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Many speakers referred to the plight of self-employed people, who are not entitled to social welfare payments.  As representatives, we all have experience of this.  People in the Celtic tiger construction boom employed people and paid their taxes and, I would like to add, paid their VAT.  Then they fell on bad times and, while their employees were entitled to social welfare, employers were entitled to nothing.  I welcome the recent commitment by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  We all talk about how social welfare must be reformed.  One badly needed reform is to consider the plight and entitlements of self-employed people.  I support the Minister in any restructuring that needs to take place in that mission.  I welcome the Bill, which provides some hope to those who have not had it up to now.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_438">I am pleased to speak on this particularly important legislation.  It is important because it represents a positive intervention at a critical juncture.  Every intervention from here on must be positive in encouraging the economy to move in the right direction.  We are not living in a bubble or in isolation.  John Donne's comment that no man is an island was never more true.  We cannot isolate ourselves from being affected by the outside world, the European economy and the global economy.  We can make a positive contribution.  Contrary to what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, this may be small in the context of what is required at the present time but it is a step in the right direction.  That is what we need because we need to generate enthusiasm, interest, stability and confidence.  Confidence cannot be quantified and nothing encourages the economy like confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">There is a major flaw in the economic thesis of Deputy Boyd Barrett.  In the 1970s, we did what he proposes as the resolution for our economy.  I am not making a political point about what happened in 1977; it is there for all to see.  There was regeneration of consumer spending and footfall and it broke the country.  We have not yet repaid it.  I do not understand why people still go on with that kind of nonsense.  Everyone who was around at the time, reads the newspapers or knows recent history knows that one cannot inflate the economy as suggested by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  It does not work.  We must generate enthusiasm and confidence from the ground up.  We must use the private sector to invest money.  Deputy Boyd Barrett defeated the purpose of his argument by saying the banks are afraid to lend because of the risk.  Where else do we go?</p>
          <p eId="para_440">This Bill will not solve our economic problems but it is one of a series of strategic measures that will ultimately lead to regeneration of growth and restoration of economic stability.  Today's newspaper makes the point that this is the most difficult time in history since the Great Depression.  I am amazed economists did not come up with that before now.  They have been looking at this for the past four or five years and have now realised that it is comparable to the Great Depression.  Did we not know that all the time?  What happened that means people did not recognise it?  In the Great Depression, a series of positive interventions were made by the United States Government over a ten-year period.  None of them was sufficient to regenerate the massive growth required for recovery but all made a contribution towards it.  The cynics will say the war was the cause of the recovery but that is not the case because the war was a massive cost in terms of money and people's lives.  That is a signal to us that we should not go in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Deputy Boyd Barrett also mentioned the misery of the huge number of people unemployed.  We have been here before.  In the 1980s we had 17% and 18% unemployment but we got out of it eventually.  At the same time, we had interest rates of 17% and 18% and it looked impossible.  One or two Members exploit the misery factor, which is hugely depressing to people who are unemployed and those who have difficulty keeping businesses afloat, creating new business and employing people.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">A number of people mentioned the issues that hit small businesses in towns and villages.  Parking is one example.  People complain to us that if they come in to shop, they have no place to park because of all the regulations that have built up over the years.  If they park and stay two minutes over their time, they are clamped and towed away.  They do not go back.  At local authority level, there is a need to consider this matter in a more sympathetic fashion and to try to work out how, in our present circumstances, we encourage people into towns and villages to encourage footfall, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The lack of credit is applicable everywhere because of the difficulties in which the banks find themselves.  I do not agree with the previous speaker, who said we should order the banks to lend.  The reason the banks are in their current situation is because they do not have money to lend.  The same applies to European and world banks.  I cannot understand how someone at Government level can turn a key and money will pour out of the banks, making us all happy.  That does not stand up and it has never worked.  It does not happen and it only makes a bad situation worse.  Where do we go from there?  We need to encourage the banks to be more positive in lending to accommodate job-creating enterprises and to retain those in existence.  It is self-defeating if banks do not allow sufficient credit to enable businesses to remain afloat or to enable people to set up new businesses.  It will fall to someone else to look after that part of the market.  It does not require major change in the amount of credit but in the amount of encouragement from the lending institutions to those in a position to provide employment through small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Upward only rent reviews have been rightly criticised.  It is an appalling concept.  The Opposition has criticised the Government parties for saying, before the election, that upward only rent reviews would be abolished.  Now, it transpires they cannot be abolished.  My view on the matter is that it is the upward-only rent clauses themselves which are unconstitutional.  I cannot understand how they were ever permitted, because to allow such a practice to be pursued on a large scale can only serve to undermine the entire retail sector in any country, and to a far greater extent in a smaller country.  We all understand why people would wish to retain an advantage to which they are long accustomed.  The reality, however, is that this arrangement is having a huge negative impact on small businesses and must be addressed.  It may be the case that somebody in a position to take action on this matter has a notion that if we simply hold our breath for a few years, property prices will return to former levels and we will be back on the hobby horse.  That is not going to happen and any inclination to operate on that assumption will leave us in an even worse situation than we are currently facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I have spoken to the Minister about the issue of foreign workers who no longer qualify for work permits.  My theory is that these are often people who, as students, were engaged on a part-time basis by a particular employer who invested in their training over several years.  Such people have remained with the same employer during their entire educational career and are now an important asset to the small enterprises that wish to retain them.  I understand that such workers are competing with local people who are available for employment or training, but the fact remains that where small businesses have invested in a particular employee - in some cases training him or her for up to seven years - that person may well become fundamental to the operation of the enterprise for the next three or four years.  There is a balance to be struck here.  Perhaps an arrangement could be made that in such cases, where the foreign person's work permit is being renewed, a suitable local person who is available for work would be taken on as a trainee.  I ask the Minister to examine the potential benefits of such a scheme in terms of job creation and all that goes with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Any small business owner or owner of a small farm will report that many lending institutions have either withdrawn or significantly reduced overdraft facilities or demanded that credit be taken in the form of a term loan rather than an overdraft.  This is an old trick familiar to anybody who has been in business for a substantial length of time.  Overdrafts are much more flexible and useful than term loans, providing a more regulated flow of funding and greater stability for borrowers and, on a larger scale, for the economy.  In addition, it should not simply follow as a matter of course in any economic downturn that lending institutions which gave a business owner access to a credit line of €100,000 in the good times should reduce it by 50% or more.  That will be of no benefit to the borrower or the economy and ultimately of no benefit to the lending institution itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I welcome this Bill as one of a range of measures that are required to be taken in this area.  It represents a positive contribution at a difficult but crucial juncture in our economic history and I look forward to more of the same from the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues.  In the situation in which we find ourselves, it is incumbent on every Department, every Minister and Minister of State, and every Member of this House, in whatever way he or she can, to encourage development, growth and employment creation.  If we think and act positively and commit to putting our shoulder to the wheel, we can achieve an outcome that is much more dramatic and achieved much sooner than we might expect.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this extremely important issue.  I cannot proceed without first expressing my frustration at some of the points made by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.  He chose not to finish the story about the little boy with his finger in the dyke, but most of us know that, in the end, he kept his finger in so long that he was the saviour of Holland.  The Deputy did not refer to that outcome and he is not in the Chamber now to hear what other Members made of his contribution.  He repeatedly referred to the Bill as a mere drop in the ocean and of very little significance.  I am not sure how good he was at science in school, but he surely knows that the ocean is made up of many millions of drops.  This legislation represents an extremely important step forward but it is only one of a range of measures which, taken together, will lead to real progress.  The Deputy went for so long about how it is such a small step that he seemed effectively to be saying that we should all sit on our hands and do absolutely nothing.  With apologies for employing another cliché, I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett knows as well as I that every long journey begins with the smallest step.  I could say a great deal more in response to the Deputy but will try to refrain from doing so.  I will point out, however, in response to his comments regarding rates that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, indicated in the House this morning that he will introduce the Valuation Act 2001(amendment) Bill later this year.  The debate on that legislation will provide an opportunity to discuss the effect of rates on business.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I agree with a great many of the points raised by colleagues in today's debate.  In particular, I support the call by Deputy Martin Heydon for a scheme to allow self-employed people whose businesses have failed to access social welfare supports.  It became very clear to me during last year's election campaign that there are many such former business owners who made substantial profits in the boom but, unfortunately, did not pay into any scheme or support mechanism.  We must consider developing a scheme into which business owners could contribute in the good times in order to avoid any repeat of the horror stories that have emerged in the recession.  I am aware of a particular business that was established before the Famine, went on to survive two world wars, the violence of the years up to 1922 and all the other major upheavals that have occurred in this country.  It could not, however, survive the Celtic tiger.  That says a great deal about how this country has been brought to its knees.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I reject the notion that this Bill represents an insignificant step in seeking to address the difficulties facing small business.  In the current climate, survival is the real success for small and medium-sized businesses.  SMEs often lack collateral, which renders them unattractive to creditors.  A lack of credit, in turn, inhibits those companies from investing in staff and new products or methodologies.  In other words, they cannot build for the future.  This forward-looking Bill will provide vital support to many small companies, the type of support which was noticeably lacking in the past.  Access to credit is a fundamental requirement for the conduct of any business enterprise and these measures should lead to new job creation opportunities.  Small and medium-sized businesses are accustomed to dealing with small amounts of money.  In fact, it is a sign of their resilience that they can turn a small sum into something very significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I take this opportunity to remind the Minister of the report by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the SME sector.  There is a need for continuity and stability in Government initiatives targeting SMEs.  Information on support schemes is not always communicated adequately to businesses by Departments.  Perhaps the Minister can take on board the fact that SMEs understand what we are trying to do, but they want the relevant information to be easily accessible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DominicHannigan" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</from>
          <p eId="para_454">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  We are all aware of the importance of accessing credit to enable businesses to start up and grow.  I started my own business 17 years ago and accessing credit was essential to its success.  It meant there was money for cash flow and expansion.  At that time, however, because I had no credit history, it was difficult to get cash, but family members helped out.  The problem for many businesses starting up today, however, is that they do not have family members with money due to these recessionary times.  That is why it is so important to have access to a microfinance scheme such as this one.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">In the past week, I have been contacted by a company in south Meath which is having terrible difficulty in obtaining credit from a bank.  It is a microenterprise that was set up after the owner's original business failed.  He does not want to sit out this recession because he has new ideas which he thinks will work out.  That business has a particular niche market and got approval from a bank to provide finance, but the bank had a change of heart.  As a result, the business now finds itself without access to credit.  That is exactly the type of business that will be able to apply to the new microfinance loan fund for expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Irish people understand the importance of small businesses.  In my own area of County Meath, small businesses make up 71% of the enterprise sector, which means that the majority of people there work in the small firms sector.  I am sure that is probably also the case throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">At the moment, Ireland is the hardest place in the eurozone for small businesses to obtain funding.  If we are going to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business we will have to rectify that situation.  We must make it much easier to get credit.  That is precisely why the Government has introduced a range of measures, including the action plan for jobs, which features 256 points on how to make Ireland an easier location in which to do business.  This microfinance scheme is one part of that plan.  Its aim is to help approximately 10,000 companies to expand while in the process generating in the order of 10,000 jobs.  Therefore, 10,000 families will benefit as a direct result of introducing this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I have always been committed to making access to microfinance easier.  I know how pleased micro-business owners and other entrepreneurs will be when this scheme is eventually signed into law.  I will focus on ensuring that happens as soon as possible.  This side of the House will continue to support any efforts the Minister makes to facilitate doing business in this country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_459">I welcome the introduction of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill, which is a key part of the action plan on jobs.  It shows that the Government is delivering on promises made in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I welcome Deputy Boyd Barrett's conversion on the issue of rates.  I spent many years on the city council where his colleagues continuously voted against a reduction in rates for small and medium-sized businesses.  How quickly they forgot that when they arrived here.  I was reminded recently that the Deputy's colleagues voted against funding to keep three swimming pools open in areas of Dublin that badly needed such facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I thank the Minister and his Department for having brought forward this measure quickly, along with the recent Credit Guarantee Bill.  The Bill before us is another small step in the right direction to deliver sustainable growth in the economy.  It will restore confidence to the SME sector, which can be an engine for growth, helping to create and sustain domestic jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Some 1.8 million people are employed in Ireland, of which one third or 650,000 are in small businesses.  We therefore need a strong mix of measures that targets growth and supports where they are needed.  A statutory micro-credit scheme is something that has been missing from our basket of policy measures for too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Approximately 200,000 small businesses are providing jobs in parishes, villages and towns across the country.  Deputy Durkan mentioned earlier how important the small business sector is, particularly in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">When somebody creates a job through their own business, it has the potential to create even more jobs.  I applaud the courage of those who start up small businesses.  Access to credit is important in this regard.  Many such businesses use bank overdrafts as their working capital.  However, I have heard examples of where this lifeline for many SMEs has been closed or withdrawn from existing businesses.  As a result, it is almost impossible for new start-ups to access credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I recall a recent story about a small restaurant in Dublin that was funded by its owner's credit card, but that is not sustainable funding.  The model we are bringing forward through this Bill will allow more small businesses to open.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">There are many commercially viable proposals, yet banks will not lend them money.  This Bill commits €90 million over ten years, but I am cautious as to whether this will be enough in the start-up stages.  Consequently, I welcome the two-year review provided for in the legislation.  It is important to recall other Government projects, including the credit guarantee scheme and the strategic investment fund, as well as many other business supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Once these are fully operational, the Minister should seriously consider combining these measures into a proper strategic investment bank.  It would be a help to bring such measures under one management structure.  I would urge the Minister to be mindful of the time factor involved.  Applicants have already been refused funding from banks after a lengthy application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I also wish to seek assurances that the terms of the loans are not onerous.  These are already difficult times and we must make it as easy as possible to set up small companies.  I am concerned that the proposed limit of €25,000 may be too low, so it should be reviewed after two years.  The Minister should consider setting the limit at €50,000 which would be better.  In addition, I am concerned that the interest rate should not be set too high.  Let us give the Bill time, however, to see how it works.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I am confident that this Bill will address some of the existing concerns.  I also welcome the proposals in the Bill whereby audited accounts can be discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts.  Oversight is very important so I am glad to see that that provision is contained in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I ask the Minister to clarify the number of directors he intends to put in and how they will be appointed.  I believe in evidence-based decisions, so I welcome the impact assessment provision.  I note that the regulatory impact assessment estimated that, over ten years, the fund will benefit the Exchequer by €92.4 million at a cost of €20 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Previous Administrations used to throw large volumes of money at projects without any evidence base on its return.  I therefore welcome the Minister's measured approach to this scheme, which will eventually benefit the State, taxpayers and those who set up businesses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_472">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important piece of legislation which is contained in the programme for Government.  It is somewhat unfortunate that some people bemoan the amount of money involved as being very small.  Those familiar with the small business sector, however, will know that many small firms are currently being operated on a shoestring.  The sums referred to in the legislation, in or around €15,000 or €16,000, are not insignificant to many small businesses.  For those of us who were not educated in private, fee-paying schools in leafy suburbs, it is a significant amount of money which will, in many cases, keep businesses open.  It is a little disingenuous of those people, whom I would refer to as caviar socialists who put profit before people rather than people before profit, to be attacking the Government for introducing a measure which is being sought by everyone in the small and medium enterprise sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">That this legislation is being introduced is an admission that our banking system is operating in a quasi-dysfunctional manner.  That the Government is in the process of establishing a microenterprise loan fund to assist companies who have been refused credit by the banks, which are being kept open courtesy of the taxpayer, to sustain jobs is a scandal.  However, as stated by a previous speaker, we are where we are.  The commercial banking sector needs to be reminded again of who is keeping it going, namely, the Irish taxpayers.  Despite this, we are now putting in place another loan facility to keep our economy ticking over, which is regrettable but necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">While the foreign direct investment and agri-food sectors are doing well our domestic economy is as flat as a pancake.  As such, anything that can be done by way of this €90 million fund, which is not as some would claim an insignificant amount, to support 5,500 enterprises over ten years is to be welcomed.  That we may also be able to access a similar fund from Europe, if the charitable status of that fund can be addressed, indicates further growth in this area into the future.  I welcome that the Bill provides that the annual accounts in terms of this fund will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, I am concerned about day-to-day operation of the fund.  It is important people believe it is worth their while applying for money from this fund, which will be the last chance saloon for many businesses.  We must ensure that those making the decisions in terms of the release of these funds have a business acumen and can understand and appreciate the risks, business plans and business models put before them.  This is important if jobs are to be sustained.  I am sure that other Deputies are, like me, also being visited at their clinics by business people who are at their wits end by virtue of their treatment by the commercial banking sector, which is, by and large, owned by the Irish taxpayer.  We have a duty to assist these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">It was on the back of the small and medium enterprise sector that much of the property bubble was built, in respect of which they or at least most of them paid huge amounts of income tax and VAT and other related taxes.  Many of these people have fallen on hard times and are not eligible for social welfare benefits.  Many self employed people literally do not have money to put bread on the table and have no access to a credible social welfare fund because they were never asked to pay the appropriate stamp.  This issue needs to be addressed by the Government as a matter or urgency.  While I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Bruton, is looking into it there is an urgent need to assist self employed people who, ultimately, are the backbone of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I welcome the establishment of the fund.  It is regrettable we have had to introduce it but the banks have failed us despite that we were there when they needed us.  I believe this is a step in the right direction and is part of the overall jigsaw of getting Ireland back to work.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his staff for their work on it during the past number of months.  I compliment the Minister on his visit last Monday morning to Wexford where he hosted a conference on the Action Plan for Jobs, which provided local businesses with an opportunity to engage directly with him.  I welcome also his announcement at that time of Danone's €20 million investment in County Wexford, which will result in the creation of an additional 45 jobs.  Business people from County Wexford were encouraged by the Minister's visit and by his making himself available to them.  While previous Governments did not have an open door policy, this Government does, as evidenced by the Minister's visit last Monday morning to County Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">There are many examples countrywide of enterprising people who are willing to put their necks on the line to start up a business but who have been refused capital to do so by local banks for a number of reasons, including, perhaps, that they may have no money of their own to put into the business, they have high bad debt levels, high administrative overheads and the time and investment requirement in terms of loan assessment.  I believe the microenterprise loan fund will assist many small and medium enterprises in this country.  As stated by Deputy O'Donovan, while €90 million might appear an insignificant amount in this regard, it is huge in terms of the number of people it will assist in starting up a business.  All people want is some assistance to get up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">During his visit to Wexford last Monday, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, met with representatives of 14 start-up companies.  These are the type of people we need if we are to recover and create jobs.  The Government must be seen to assist them.  I was disappointed to hear some people say that €16,000 is a small amount of money.  I believe it is a huge amount, in particular, for example, to a husband and wife who have some savings but have been refused additional finance by the banks.  That amount of money could assist in the creation of a number of jobs over a number of years.  Our domestic economy is on the ground, which is evident from the number of businesses closing in our towns and cities owing to a lack of credit from the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I recently launched enterprise week in Bank of Ireland, Enniscorthy, at which I met small business people who are employing, one, two, three or four employees.  These businesses are the backbone of our economy.  They are the people taking the risks every day in terms of keeping their businesses open, despite being under pressure in terms of rates, ESB, telephone and other charges.  The people must be complimented.  This fund provides a second chance for the many entrepreneurs who have been turned away by our banks.  I am sure all Members could give examples of reasons people have been turned away by the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I compliment the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the introduction of this initiative, which it is hoped it only the first of many to be introduced in this area.  All people need is a second chance.  For example, the man who brought bottled water to Ireland was refused finance by a bank for start-up of that business.  That industry is now worth more than €300 million per annum to our economy.  There are many more similar examples.  I again compliment the Minister and his staff for their work on this Bill.  It is hoped the fund will be a huge success.  I have no doubt it will be.  I know from speaking to people on the ground that they are looking forward to having this funding available.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_484">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012, which is a welcome measure.  I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will ensure it is innovative.  More than 6,000 people are employed in the SME sector in Ireland and they are the lifeblood of the economy.  It is great to see the multinational sector doing well but the SME sector is a huge driver of the economy.  What many of those in the sector have in common is that they are risk takers.  Many of those establishing small businesses have been successful and taking enormous risks is part and parcel of being in business.  At present, the banks are risk averse.  This is part of a suite of measures to help the SME sector.  The loan guarantee scheme was published by the Minister and I very much welcome it.  We now have the microenterprise loan fund through which microenterprises and start-ups employing no more than ten employees will be able to obtain loans of up to €25,000, which is a tremendous amount of money for businesses in the start-up phase.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will put €10 million into the fund and over time this can be increased to €25 million and I hope it will reach this level.  I also welcome section 9 of the Bill which states the fund will be able to accept gifts of money, the purpose of which is to the benefit of the fund, and upon such trusts or conditions as may be specified by the donor.  However, we must have transparency with regard to the source of the money and the purpose of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">This is a venture capital fund for newly established small and growing businesses.  Ireland is risk averse and does not reward risk-takers in the SME sector.  If people fail in business for whatever reason, it is seen as a black mark.  They should be seen as people who pick themselves up and move to another business.  Many entrepreneurs throughout the country failed in their first and perhaps second business.  However, risk-taking is part of their make up and they are willing to enter areas into which other people will not go.  Recently I met representatives of a US company which employs people who were self-employed and may have failed, because invariably they understand business.  One of our silver bullets will be the SME sector.  This proposal is geared towards providing funding for projects with a larger element of risk than the banks are willing to accept.  We need to support these enterprises and put this measure in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">I hope this will be up and running by early autumn.  The terms and conditions and the cost of the money should not be so onerous that it will be impossible to qualify.  This is a venture capital fund on behalf of the State to drive the SME sector in establishing businesses in high-technology areas, areas with potential for growth and, in particular, with potential for job growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">In his reform of the enterprise boards and the new business element in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister is considering the cohort of enterprises which employ between ten and 50 people.  Until now the enterprise boards have looked after companies which employ fewer than ten people while Enterprise Ireland has looked after those which employ more than 50 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Through this Bill the Government is entering an area which is exciting and cutting edge.  It will work hand in hand with business to create jobs, to foster those taking risks in business and, above all else, to drive Ireland towards full economic recovery in the years ahead.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_489">I thank Deputy O'Donnell and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, for sharing time.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House.  It is a good news story although some Deputies always want to talk down good news stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Small businesses are at the heart of every community with the local sole trader who provides the newspaper, the local butcher who provides the Sunday dinner and the local coffee shop where one can have a weekly catch up with the girls.  These business owners know their customers and they depend on them.  Many of them provide credit.  Most of these business owners are not out to become rich.  They want to be part of and serve the community.  In many cases they want to earn a living so they can rear their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Like every other Deputy I have been contacted by people with a great business idea who have been refused finance and business owners who wants to expand and have been refused credit even if it is a viable business.  Ireland is known for its entrepreneurial spirit and the Government must support entrepreneurs in establishing companies.  The Government must assist businesses to succeed and encourage business expansion.  Many of these businesses first start in a kitchen or garage.  This fund will be a lifeline for a small start-up company or an existing business trying to expand.  The Microfinance Fund Bill is part of a range of Government initiatives to support businesses of various sizes and in various circumstances.  The adoption of the personal insolvency Bill and the Credit Guarantee Bill will also provide assistance.  The Bill will assist 5,500 viable businesses to obtain credit.  These are businesses which would not have received credit otherwise.  A total of 7,700 jobs will be created, meaning 7,700 happier people and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The Government is serious about job creation.  The plan will improve support for businesses creating jobs and will remove barriers to employment creation throughout the economy.  We have made progress on the foreign direct investment front.  IDA Ireland success stories include a net 6,000 increase in jobs in supported companies.  Enterprise Ireland also has success stories with a 15% increase in the number of high potential start-ups in 2011.  However, we must also help small indigenous businesses and the domestic market and the Bill will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">We also have success stories in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  In a recent survey conducted by Dún Laoghaire enterprise board 56% of local businesses and companies stated they expect to expand in 2012.  I congratulate Dún Laoghaire enterprise board on the 2,000 jobs in existence as a result of its work over the past number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Sometimes it is easier to see the positives when one is on the outside looking in.  The 2012 IMD<i>World Competitiveness Yearbook</i> ranks Ireland’s overall competitiveness in 20th place which is up four places from 2011.  It ranks Ireland first in the world for investment incentives, the availability of skilled labour and the flexibility and adaptability of its people.  Many of my former students would be thrilled to know they came first in the class and this is what the country is trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I absolutely reject what Deputy Donnelly said last night about our young graduates.  He quoted but did not name some CEO who said that his company could not take on our graduates.  I have met many CEOs in Dún Laoghaire, in our county and around the country who are delighted to employ our young graduates.  If he walks around our universities, Deputy Donnelly will see many fine young people.  This Government is working to make Ireland the best country in the world in which to raise children, to grow old and to do business.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelLowry" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry</from>
          <p eId="para_496">I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on his initiative.  We are all aware of the huge pressure on businesses and enterprises across the country.  Time and again, we hear of businesses being forced to close their doors as they continue to be put under pressure due to the poor domestic economy.  We are faced with a litany of closed businesses and lost jobs and as the days pass, more of those businesses are being lost in rural towns and villages.  The boarded up and closed shops in town centres are a sight familiar to everyone.  These closures are not a reflection on the viability of the business, but rather a reflection on the impossibility of continuing to trade in this challenging environment.  A key factor in this is the lack of readily available credit to assist companies in these arduous times.  Any steps introduced that ease the burden on small and medium enterprises must be welcomed, and implemented as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The requirement for further assistance in supplying credit to smaller businesses cannot be doubted.  The need to protect, shelter and advance our domestic enterprises must be a priority.  Small and medium enterprises are the backbone of our economy.  The difficulty is that these businesses are floundering due to the limited availability of credit and the continued rejection of their loan applications from banks and other financial institutions.  Companies may be seeking financial assistance to establish and develop the business, or they may simply require short-term credit as working capital to tide them over while they are awaiting payments.  Many of these businesses find it impossible to meet the stringent requirements in place to access funds from financial institutions.  I frequently meet local business people, producers and entrepreneurs who have founded and developed microenterprises which have the capability to flourish to the benefit of the entire local economy.  I am told time and again that these business owners are urgently seeking access to credit from any available source, and often face a brick wall in accessing such.  I am told by people from nine out of ten businesses that the greatest hurdle they face is the impossibility of accessing finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">In its quarterly bank watch survey, ISME found that while demand remains steady at 37% of those surveyed, the refusal rate of the banks has now risen to 54%.  This is a deterioration on the success rate previously recorded.  Even more worrying is the statistic that 82% of businesses which applied for funding found that the banks were making it more difficult for them to access that funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">It is clear that the market has failed adequately to provide credit to viable microenterprises and so there is a clear need for intervention at Government level.  This Bill will not solve all the difficulties faced by companies, but it will go some way towards tackling this problem by providing a lifeline to start-up companies, sole traders and existing microenterprises which have faced a gruelling task in accessing finance.  Restricting credit to SMEs is not only damaging to the individual company affected, but also to the overall economy.  As businesses are starved of credit, they cannot invest.  They are prevented from further development and growth, and in many cases their hand is forced into closing the business or downsizing considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">All businesses need credit to stay afloat and to increase the size of their operations.  The ability of our smaller businesses to grow and develop underpins our future potential.  These small businesses can, if supported, make a real impact on the community and the economy at local level.  They may employ a few people locally, source supplies locally and spend money in the local economy.  Additionally, they provide a significant saving to the Exchequer in terms of employment sustained and created, the removal of employees from reliance on social welfare payments, and increased direct and indirect tax payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I welcome this Bill as a positive step forward in helping our small businesses in these testing times.  We must treasure those businesses which have the capacity to hold their own, and we must continue to bring forward legislation that seeks to assist our enterprises, ride out the storm and return to growth.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill and the initiatives within it, and I hope the Bill will have a positive impact on small businesses and start-up enterprises in particular.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_503">This is very welcome news.  It is the most significant development in job creation for a number of years.  It is anticipated that there is €90 million available for 5,500 microenterprises for over ten years, creating up to 8,000 jobs.  I think the figure could be doubled, because that kind of promotion and activity should generate even more jobs.  The vast majority of microfinance applicants are involved in the provision of local services and in small businesses.  This stimulus to small employers engaged in viable job growing potential businesses is long overdue.  Many small businesses were the backbone of their local communities until the economic downturn and the employment they provided, however small, was vital to the survival of their local communities.  The demise of many of these companies over the past few years has been a hammer blow to their existence.  It also impacted severely on the economic and social life of the communities in which they were located.  Many people had long-term full-time employment with these small and medium enterprises.  Their demise also contributed to emigration, while there was no lifeline for many of the redundant workers.  There was often a lack of opportunities for both employer and employees on age grounds, and they faced the bleak prospect of never getting back into the job space again.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">There are almost 200,000 small firms in Ireland, while 13,810 new enterprises started in 2009.  Small firms employ almost 544,000 people, accounting for 45.7% of the total employed in business in Ireland.  When we take into account the proprietors and family members directly engaged - they may not be drawing a salary as such, but would contribute to the business - more than 655,000 people are involved.  Over 90% of these small firms employ fewer than ten people, while 49% are sole owner entities.  They are involved in a wide range of activities, many of which are employment intensive including tourism, retail, construction and a host of other professional businesses and personal services.  Prior to the recession, over 172,000 net jobs were created in services between 2000 and 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">There is a mindset that in the last two to three years it is futile to seek finance from the banks.  That became part of the public consciousness and many just gave up after an initial inquiry, or did not appeal the initial refusal.  However, there is an anomaly in this microfinance scheme for small businesses.  They first have to go to the bank and be refused.  Ironically, the State is giving the guarantee to the receiver and is thereby taking the full risk, so there is no risk for the bank.  I do not know what has been happening in the banks in recent years, with all the different State guarantees of which this is another.  That is one of the few faults I find in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I believe this will be a significant stimulus and injection for all those engaged in small firms.  There is also production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, yet these are excluded from the scope of the scheme because of certain restrictions and rules.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to consider this point.  Where there is growth potential in these sectors perhaps they might look at this again and include them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanConlon" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Deputy Seán Conlan</from>
          <p eId="para_507">The Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012 is a further strand of the suite of finance packages being put in place by this Government, to support the SME sector in its efforts to survive the current recession and begin to move forward again and develop so that they can continue to play the crucial role they have played in the past in creating much needed employment.  This is ongoing proof of the Government's commitment and determination to deliver on its programme for Government by ensuring that avenues of funding are maintained to support viable SMEs, especially the more vulnerable ones that are currently experiencing difficulties in accessing the finance needed to develop new ideas, create employment and preserve existing jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, in finding innovative ways of kickstarting the economy in the current very difficult climate.  The funding in question is aimed at small enterprises with fewer than ten employees and with an annual turnover not exceeding €2 million, that are in the precarious position of having been denied access to bank funding through the normal channels.  It is vitally important that every effort is made to keep these small enterprises in the game in order that they, too, can play their part in the recovery that will come, despite all the negative reports to the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">There is unquestionable proof that banks are refusing loans to credit-worthy and viable SMEs.  There is evidence to this effect from such reputable institutions as the Central Bank, where researchers have verified such practices, from the Credit Review Office, which is in daily communication with and has first-hand experience of the sector, and from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association which deals with these problems every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">This scheme seeks to remedy a situation in which the Central Bank has found evidence that a moderate decline in credit applications is contrasted with a very large increase in credit rejection rates, that run at 15% to 18% ahead of comparable eurozone rejection rates.  The inability of many in this sector to secure so-called letters of credit, which do not involve any credit at all except in the case of default, is having serious implications for many as it renders it impossible for them to engage with direct suppliers abroad.  This has the unfortunate effect of making it necessary for those affected to buy their raw materials, or whatever, from third parties, adding a layer of expense they cannot afford to the transaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I am glad to see this funding programme is being delivered through Microfinance Ireland, which will be a subsidiary of the Social Finance Foundation, an organisation that has considerable expertise in the area of funding enterprises that are experiencing stress.  Its expertise and experience will stand the organisation in good stead in successfully undertaking this important task.  It certainly is an important task because the organisation will hold the fragile hopes and dreams of a nation in its hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The recovery in this sector is our ticket out of jail, especially in constituencies such as Cavan-Monaghan where SMEs are the only thing standing between our people and the dole queue or the aeroplane.  There are viable enterprises in the sector which will not survive without this crucial help.  It is incumbent on us, as a Government, to ensure the survival of these enterprises which, collectively, are responsible for the employment of hundreds of thousands of people throughout this country.  It is our responsibility in Government to get this legislation in place and ensure these small enterprises survive to take up their rightful place in carrying this country forward.  They are the rock on which the country was built, they can be relied on and they are constant.  They are not going anywhere because they are already at home.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">That is a very generous allocation.  First, I thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate, all 33 speakers.  That is one in five of all Members, if one deducts the Ceann Comhairle, and shows a good level of interest in the debate.  I am not surprised.  Everywhere I go - the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, reports the same - the issue that comes up repeatedly is access to finance.  It is the burning issue in people's minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The new Secretary General in the Department of Finance has taken an acute interest in this matter.  The work he has done with the Minister of State in touring the country and getting much closer to business, finding exactly where the shoe is pinching with the credit institutions, has brought in a great deal of extra information that we can put in front of people.  It allows the Government to hold banks more accountable.  It has been complemented by the work of consultants such as Mazars and the Central Bank, from whose reports many speakers quoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The truth is blunt.  It is there for the banks and everybody else to see.  Our credit system is not working as it should.  There are many reasons for that.  We know there is an enormous legacy of bad property debts, and so on.  In addition, however, the skills needed to lend to small business, especially business oriented towards the export sector, have been lost in the banking system and are having to be rebuilt.  Enterprise Ireland, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and small business interests of various kinds are helping the banks to rebuild.  This is an urgent and important role.  That is why Government has insisted that a €3.5 billion target would be set for each bank to deliver into the small business sector this year.  We want to see that delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">What we are doing here is not a substitute for that role.  The banks have to fix this problem; that is their duty and we will hold them to account for it.  We recognise, however, there are also real failures in the market.  Some speakers mentioned how small this scheme was but people need to look at the bigger picture, at what the Government is doing in the sphere of access to finance.  Yes, this is a fund of €40 million over the coming five years but look also at the loan guarantee scheme which has the potential to reach €450 million over the coming years.  There is the developing capital fund of up to €150 million in the same period.  There are the innovation funds which, cumulatively, will come close to €400 million on the commitments already made.  There is the Silicon Valley alliance, announced by the Minister for Finance during the week, another fund of €100.  There is Enterprise Ireland's seed capital fund, which, at €650 million, is the biggest fund managed in the seed area anywhere in Europe.  There is a quiet transformation going on - one might almost say revolution - in the way access to finance is being stimulated and force-fed into the system by Government.  It is not that the Government is standing back and allowing the problems in access to finance to fester.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Totted up, these schemes come to some €1.3 billion to €1.5 billion, across the board of different initiatives that are there to support industry to expand and grow.  A feature that characterises them, which fits into much of what Government is trying to do, is that it is not always the huge pots of State money that are needed.  The loan guarantee scheme is a relatively small amount of exposure to the State but it levers up these funds.  In every one of the schemes we will seek to get private sector money to join and complement what Government is able to put into it.  It is about thinking smart and being innovative and that is true of this scheme, too.  We are putting in €10 million in equity but we will be borrowing from the banks and will exploit the European Investment Fund as a partial guarantor.  It is a way of playing a little smarter in order to make up for weaknesses in our banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Many people will look enviously at the likes of Germany with its famous<i> Mittelstand</i> companies, where banks traditionally have been really strong in supporting the family-owned business.  The backbone of German industry, which has been such a success in recent years, has been built on a banking model that has been well suited to those sorts of smaller scale companies.  It allows them to grow and export.  We have not had such a banking system.  Even with the best work by the banks, we are in a difficulty.  They have difficulties in providing the sort of international stretch we need to build our companies.  As a result, we are now obliged to step in, as a State, and support that change.  I welcome the broad support for this, even among those who were critical.  There was nobody who said it was not worth supporting.  I acknowledge there has been difficulty.  I would say my officials have grey hairs they did not have 12 months ago because of the difficulty in getting this through the system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_521">They have done extremely well.  The truth is that this measure is different.  We have to examine how to legally protect the State's interest and the structures that will be put in place.  This involves the State taking on the risk.  As Deputy Eoghan Murphy said, the State does not normally get into this sort of risk business and that is true.  We need to get partners who are experienced in this area and we have used the Social Finance Foundation as that partner.  We have relied heavily on First-Step, which has been a small player in this scheme.  It has pioneered the work and it has been very valuable to us.  To build something that is robust takes time.  The work that has gone into to this make this initiative robust has been well worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Some Deputies asked about the board.  It will be appointed by the Social Finance Foundation.  We will lean on people with real experience in this area.  I can assure the House its members will not be political people and it will not allow any political interference in the decisions that will be made, which was a point raised by some Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Many Deputies emphasised the need for mentoring and advice.  It will be crucial that those applying under this scheme, either through the county enterprise boards, local enterprise offices or through financial advisers, put forward a credible proposal.  Obviously, this is about hard business, helping people with good business ideas to set up sustainable businesses that will be viable in the long term.  It is not about half-baked ideas.  It requires the work to be put in and the advice to be obtained in order that a good plan is put forward.  We recognise that these proposals will be higher risks.  We are building into this an expectation of a 20% failure.  That does not represent charity by the State but recognises that the start-up projects in this niche area are risky.  It is in the State's interest that people are given the courage to have a go.  We want to do that but we want to do it in full prudence in the knowledge that it is taxpayers' money with which we are dealing and we will require proper rules to be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">A number of Deputies said that the schemes that are in place are not well enough known.  I assure the House that I and the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry are putting in place a much stronger information campaign around many worthwhile schemes that are in place, of which Deputies may be aware but which they do not promote.  I do not want to take up the time of the House going through them but I will mention one or two.  The seed capital scheme, of which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will be aware, is one where a PAYE worker can reclaim his or her tax for the past six years and put it into a company that he or she sets up to start a business.  The take up of that scheme numbered only about 70 people last year, even though thousands of new businesses were formed.  We need to promote that scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Another scheme is the Revenue job assist scheme where an employer can get double wage tax relief for three years if he or she takes on a person who has been more than a year unemployed.  The take up of that scheme only numbered a few hundred last year.  A large cohort of people are leaving the live register and being taken into employment but the scheme is not being used.  There is a good case to promote these and we will take that up.  We need to get that information out and to use Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices, the Company Registration Office and chambers of commerce to spread the news.  Many start-up companies talk about going into the valley of death when one's start a new company.  It is challenging and there are many pitfalls but those starting up a business should use the props and the supports the State has put in place to help them find a secure passage through the process.  We will take up what a number of Deputies said.  Deputy Ann Phelan quoted a report from the interparliamentary group on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Some Deputies said they did not know about this scheme.  We are developing it and I invite people who are interested to arrange to talk to my Department and we can go through it.  Essentially, no sector will be excluded.  Deputy Fleming referred to the loan guarantee scheme which excludes certain sectors under state aid rules but no sectors will be excluded from the microfinance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Some Deputies asked about what the interest rate will be.  That depends on the money we get.  We will have to lever up our equity by lending from the banks.  We have to negotiate a keen deal with the banks.  We also have to negotiate with the European Investment Fund to get a guarantee.  I can assure Deputies that we will be trying to keep it as cheap as possible but we do not have a fixed price.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Some Deputies asked about the duration of the scheme and how long an applicant will be allowed to borrow, there is not a fixed duration.  We are not putting a termination period on it.  Obviously, it will hinge on the business plan that is put forward, the viability of the business and the length of time it is likely to need the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Deputy Ó Cuív raised the issue of<i>de minimis </i>rules on European state aid and if we are constrained by them.  We are not in this instance constrained by them but we are interested in seeking to get higher <i>de minimis </i> rules, which is a matter in which the Deputy is interested.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Some Deputies asked if we will let other intermediaries do this, whether it will just be a wholesale facility in which other intermediaries will play a part.  The microfinance institution that we will set up will be the provider and it will deal with advisers, whether they be local enterprise offices or other business advisers, but it will not have other partners delivering loans on its behalf.  The reason for that is that we want to get access to the European Investment Fund guarantee.  That requires that we can vouch for oversight and the due diligence in this respect.  We need to keep that tight and in-house.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">A number of Deputies, including Deputy Catherine Murphy, asked if this facility will be surrounded by bureaucracy.  That is not the culture we are seeking to develop.  Anyone who has experience of First Step will be aware that it has been very successful.  The company where we launched this initiative last week is an example of its success.  The couple who set up the company were refused a loan by the bands but they got one from First Step.  They started out at farmers' markets and now they are setting up their own café, Ducks &amp; Co., in Temple Bar which will open in July  and I encourage colleagues to go down there.  That company employes seven people on the back of a microfinance facility.  We hope 5,500 such little businesses will get up and running.  It is a very worthwhile scheme.  I do not pretend it is a solution to our economic challenge.  As Deputy Perry continually says, small business is at the core and heart of what will create employment.  There is a segment in the microenterprise sector to which must give a battling chance to create employment and surviving and that is what this is about.

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I want to recap some of the points I raised yesterday in regard to children in crisis, early intervention, the role of foster parents, the idea of having good social workers, good gardaí and good teachers and other examples of good practice.  I strongly welcome the legislation and I will be supporting the Bill.  This is a serious issue in regard to the protection of children and because of our history we must be extra vigilant.   We must learn from the bad mistakes of the past and early intervention must be a key part of the process.  Legislation is necessary but it is vital to intervene at an early stage to rescue children before they are hurt or damaged.  I praise and commend the foster parents on the excellent work they undertake and the great service they provide to the State, to families and to young children whom they have rescued.  In my previous contribution I also highlighted the vital role played in the rescue of children by a good Garda, special needs assistant, teacher or a good youth worker who may often save children from worse situations.  I commend those who have intervened and are excellent examples of good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Sadly, there are also examples of bad practice.  The professional workers in the health and education services may need to improve their efforts in the protection of children.  In the past 24 hours I have been contacted by a foster family about the lack of backup support and professionalism in services.  It is vital to provide stability for those children and it is not helpful to have a different social worker from one week to the next.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The out of hours service must be available in order to respond to crisis situations.  A young child or young person who is at risk in a negative situation late at night or at the weekend needs to have a service available out of hours.  I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, will deal with this issue and I am confident that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald is determined to deal with the issue.  I emphasise the importance of a quality out of hours service and I emphasise the need for early intervention.  As I said earlier in the debate, there is no point in rescuing children when they are 12 or 13 years of age because the damage will have been done at that stage and they are already on the way to being a drug addict or an alcoholic or ending up in Mountjoy Prison.  Intervention must be at a very early age.  I know this from personal experience of working with children for over 25 years.  It is essential that the legislation deals with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Bill establishes in Irish law an offence of withholding information in respect of specified offences committed against a child or vulnerable person.  The definition of "child" is any person under the age of 18 years.  We must focus on the child and the vulnerable person.  I refer to the non-intervention and silence regarding the support of children and adults with an intellectual disability who are often left out of the debate.  I note that they are included in the provisions of this legislation as a vulnerable person is described as a person suffering from a mental, intellectual or physical disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Many people who have been abused as children do not declare the abuse until well into adulthood because of the trauma they suffered in a family situation or in an institution or sports club.  They must be treated as victims and they must receive the maximum support.  Some victims of child abuse have major concerns about the trust fund for survivors of institutional abuse.  They want the arrangements to allow for victims to receive either a trust fund, a lump sum or a pension.  This pension scheme would be self-financing and could be run with the minimum administration costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The victims of child sexual abuse must be at the centre of the debate.  This legislation is very decent legislation and I will support it.  However, more than legislation is needed to prevent children being abused; it needs quality people in the service and responsible people and examples of good practice.  There are examples of good practice in many State institutions but we need to up our game to protect and safeguard children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanConlon" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Deputy Seán Conlan</from>
          <p eId="para_542">The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 is a piece of legislation which has been notable by its absence from the Statute Book.  This Bill, along with the Children First Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill is a very welcome piece of legislation to protect children and vulnerable adults which the Government is committed to introducing.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Previous Governments initiated several inquiries seeking to establish how institutions in the Catholic Church dealt with, or rather, failed to adequately deal with the occurrences of child sexual abuse within the church and institutions.  These inquiries were needed both by the victims of that abuse which was perpetrated against them while they were of an age not to be able to protect themselves, and also by the public, who needed to know the extent to which members of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, knew of these abuses yet failed to act, and in a number of cases, were even complicit in ensuring the perpetrators were protected.  These inquiries were also badly needed by the scores of decent members of the priesthood, who were being tarnished by the ongoing acts of those abusers among them who represented a very small fraction of the priesthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">While the public displayed an ability to comprehend the failure of the church in reporting child abuse and while some Members of this House pursued with vigour those responsible, the Legislature, for whatever reason, failed to do what was clearly wanted by the electorate, to introduce the mandatory reporting of these crimes.  A gaping hole was obvious for all to see and it went completely unattended.  This Government and this Minister is addressing as a priority many of the matters which ought to have been addressed in the past, in particular, the protection from sexual abuse of the most vulnerable of those among us.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">One area with which I have difficulty is the debate surrounding this Bill in the media and in the House and comments made about sacerdotal privilege or rather the lack of it as a defence.  Privilege will continue to exist to a large group of prescribed persons providing legal, medical care, counselling or therapy to victims.  I agree the church has major issues but I do not recall any incident where the confessional was viewed as being the source of these problems.  The hierarchy certainly was a problem.  The exposure of children to offending priests through school visits, altar serving, football training etc, were all problems, but in my view, the confessional was never a problem.  The sacerdotal privilege of the confessional is a fundamental plank in the fabric of Catholicism.  It is acknowledged as such in jurisdictions across the world.  In framing this legislation, we have not failed the media nor have we failed any of the professions who enjoy privilege in protecting their source of information.  However, we cannot seem to manage to veer outside of our existing legislation to accommodate the religious beliefs and practices of the many of our citizens and in doing so, avoid possible constitutional challenges which will follow in the tracks of this omission, with all the subsequent costs attached.  In my view, in a pluralist Republic we need where possible to be mindful and respectful of the strongly held beliefs of all our citizens.  Reason and religion have essential roles in determining public policy but I believe that the State has the right to put the good of children above all other considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It is vital that this legislation has the backing of those for whom we legislate in order that it is successful in delivering the protection so greatly needed by those affected by the heinous crime which is sexual abuse.  Let us, as legislators, do nothing to hinder that success.  Let us, as legislators, do nothing to alienate a great number of people from this process.  We legislate for an intelligent and informed people; let our legislation reflect these qualities, lest it be regarded as an inoperative irrelevance.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">While I agree with the provision of legislation to enhance these protections, I am mindful of concerns raised in relation to the defences which may be relied upon , as outlined in the Bill, and which are so wide a nature as to severely limit the capacity of the Bill to achieve its objectives.  The Bill provides get-out clauses through the concept of acting in the child's best interest when failing to report.  My concerns in this area are echoed by such reputable child protection agencies as Barnardos, the ISPCC and the Ombudsman for Children.  This is essential legislation which must be right.  When experts in child protection collectively voice their disagreement and concerns about an aspect of this legislation, it is prudent to ask why such agencies are of one mind.  These are people with far more experience in this field than politicians and while I accept that the Houses legislate for the people, I also respect that, on occasions, the greater good might conflict with the priorities of individual groups.  In this set of circumstances, I believe the train is leaving the station without some of its better informed passengers.  This worries me.  We are all of one mind and have one purpose and agenda, the protection of the innocent, so why can we not engage more with those who deal with this on a daily basis and improve on this aspect of the Bill before voting on it?</p>
          <p eId="para_548">This is essential legislation and I commend the Minister for bringing it to the House.  However, to achieve its objectives, it is more important that it is regarded as fair, is accepted and brings all the citizens of the State with it, than that it is implemented immediately.  There is much work needed on this Bill and we owe it to those who need protection to sit down with all involved and get it right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality  (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_549">I thank every Member who has contributed to this debate.   This is a hugely important issue.  It is about ensuring that the children of this country are protected and that where there are individuals who prey on children or sexually abuse them and where third parties know of these events, there is maximum co-operation with An Garda Síochána and all information available is furnished to the Garda.  It is about not only ensuring that those who have already perpetrated abuse are brought to justice but also protecting children to ensure that they are not the victims of abuse in circumstances in which it is already known there is an abuser within a community who has already perpetrated abuse on a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The Bill is about more than that.  It is about ensuring that where a serious offence takes place, such as those against children as detailed in Schedule 1 of the Bill or those relating to vulnerable adults as detailed Schedule 2, there is maximum co-operation with An Garda Síochána and, as the Bill puts it, an individual who knows or believes that an offence has been committed by another person against a child or a vulnerable adult and has information which he or she knows or believes may be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of that other person for that offence, does not fail to provide the information necessary to An Garda Síochána unless there is a reasonable excuse or a defence that is appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I wish to acknowledge the work of all Members of the House in facilitating this legislation.  We published the heads of the Bill in July last year.  The Oireachtas justice committee engaged in a very important process of seeking submissions and holding oral hearings.  A variety of organisations attended those hearings and made known their views and concerns about the heads of the Bill.  My colleague, Deputy Conlon, is not correct to say that many organisations are opposed to certain aspects of the Bill.  In the context of organisations that provide counselling assistance to young people who are the victims of abuse or adults who were victims of abuse when they were children there was a variety of views on some aspects of the legislation.  Ultimately, members of that committee made a valuable contribution to the report published by the committee.  Members have acknowledged and accept that it was right that we gave serious consideration to the views expressed in that report.  Indeed, we sought to accommodate those views, where appropriate, in the Bill.  We now have more detailed legislation than the heads of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">That is the benefit of this process.  It is a new process.  This is one of the first Bills to have come through this process and, hopefully, we will enact the measure within the next week or two.  It has enhanced the role Members of the Oireachtas can play and, very importantly, it has allowed non-governmental organisations to play a role in the legislative process inside the Oireachtas, as opposed to outside and being obliged to lobby on a particular issue.  As a consequence, we have a better and certainly a more complex Bill.  It is a measure designed to do two things.  The first is the one I just mentioned, to ensure that those who have crucial information provide it to An Garda Síochána.  The second is to protect children.  This Bill, overall, is a child protection measure and a measure to protect vulnerable adults.  I am conscious that the media tend to focus more on child abuse than vulnerable adults who are the victims of abuse.  However, that is part and parcel of the problems we have and which we must address.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The legislation has two roles.  The primary role is to ensure that where somebody perpetrates abuse on a child, the Garda has the maximum amount of information made available to the force as early as possible, and that individuals do not conceal information unless there is a reasonable excuse for not giving it or unless one of the defences comes into play.  It should be emphasised that these are defences for individuals who are prosecuted.  It is not always necessary for an individual to judge whether they have a defence but there is an interactivity or connectivity between the reasonable excuse and the defence issue.  If, for example, a child who is the victim of abuse communicates that they do not wish that information to be given to the gardaí at that time, clearly there is a specific defence here but the adult equally has a reasonable excuse for not communicating it.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The legislation is very important and I thank Members for the very interesting and considered contributions from all sides of the House.  I am conscious that because this is not just a measure about investigating crime but also about protecting children and vulnerable adults a substantial portion of the debate has dealt with child protection issues generally.  Much of that related to the manner in which the HSE has dealt with child protection issues in the past.  The debate ranged over the entire brief of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is doing an excellent job.  Reference was made to the legislation to give statutory effect to the Children First guidelines.  There is the closest co-operation between me and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in the development of this legislation and the Children First legislation.  The latter legislation is going through and is about to complete the same process in the Oireachtas health committee as this Bill went through in the Oireachtas justice committee.  We are anxious to ensure there is no inherent contradiction between the two measures, albeit they have different functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Some Members made interesting contributions on the heads of the Bill to implement the Children First guidelines.  The role of each measure is somewhat different.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill is about the gardaí having the maximum information available to them to investigate a crime committed against a child or vulnerable person.  The legislation on the Children First guidelines is to ensure children are provided with such care and assistance as is necessary and that such intervention takes place as is necessary where there is a concern that a child is a victim of abuse or neglect or there is a serious issue relating to the child's welfare.  Not all of the issues that would arise to be addressed under the Children First guidelines are issues that would result in the invocation of the criminal law.  It is about ensuring that individuals report concerns about children at risk.  The guidelines are about also ensuring that when those reports are received there is a coherent and organised response.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Members of this House will be well aware that not only in my capacity in the previous Dáil as Fine Gael Party spokesperson on children but as someone who practised in the area of family law for the best part of three decades, I expressed concern about the manner in which our child care systems operated.  I was concerned at the time when they were operated through the various health boards.  I also believed there was a serious dysfunction and incoherence, and when the Health Service Executive took over that function on 1 January 2005 it was clear to me that this incoherence and dysfunction, unfortunately and tragically, continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I am very conscious that the State has in some ways in the past failed our children.  That is the reason this Government has a separate Department for Children and Youth Affairs and, for the first time, a senior Minister in Cabinet who has sole responsibility for children.  In the context of what are now clearly recognised problems within the HSE, it is the reason this Government has a policy to establish a child and family support agency that will effectively deal with all of the necessary child protection issues in a very focused way.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">A great deal of work has been accomplished by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in this area in the past 15 to 16 months since her appointment.  The difficulties that have been with us for decades cannot be addressed and fully resolved within the period of 15 months.  I am very much looking forward to the new structure being put in place that I hope will ensure that the type of dysfunction shown in  disclosed in a myriad of reports going back to reports that previous Governments have not always been enthusiastic to publish to the most recent report of the child death review group can be fully and properly addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In that context it is worth noting that with regard to the excellent report produced by Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons, when that issue first arose in the previous Dáil the then Minister of State, Barry Andrews - I do not want to say anything too critical of someone who is no longer a Member of this House and who was, I presume, largely confined to the knowledge he was given by the HSE - was told that over the period that was inquired into, 21 children had died in care or very shortly after being in care at the ages of 18 or 19.  I was aware that the numbers were a great deal more, and a very serious battle had to be fought with the previous Government to get to the truth.  I greatly regret that it required my publishing an internal HSE report on the very tragic death of the young girl, Tracey Fay, a report that had been suppressed and not published.  Ultimately, that acted as the catalyst to the child death review group being created and Norah Gibbons and Geoffrey Shannon being asked to do that work, and we now know, unfortunately, that 196 children died.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">A number of those children were clearly failed at an early stage by our child protection services.  It has to be said, in fairness to the social workers who work in that area, that these were all troubled children.  Many of these children came from very difficult backgrounds, although only one or two Deputies referred to that in their thoughtful contributions.  Clearly, the problems of many of these children also derived directly from the family circumstances they experienced.  We need to be honest to acknowledge that.  These were not children leading perfect family lives.  In the context of many of them, the family background was seriously dysfunctional.  There was violence within the family.  There was drug abuse and alcoholism but when that occurs the job of child protection services is to provide protection to children and not to fail to provide that protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I read with a mixture of anger and sadness the child death review group report.  It was very important that report was done and that it saw the light of day, as equally important were other earlier reports detailing the level of difficulty within the child protection services.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and Gordon Jeyes, who now heads up that area within the HSE and who will head up the new child and family support agency, is doing everything they possibly can do to ensure that in the future we have a better system, that there is a coherence and consistency of approach, that those social workers who work very hard in this area receive the training and back-up they require, and that there is less fragmentation within the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">One of the areas that was a concern of mine for many years, and that again comes across when one reads some of the individual cases in the child death review group report, is that good social workers who were doing their best could not always provide to a child the services they knew the child needed because of the dysfunction within the HSE.  There is a need for greater coherence, for example, between the child care services and the mental health services.  That comes across very clearly in that review, which is of value.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">It is a great pity that the work now being done to put the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing was not done at least a decade ago.  Those guidelines have been in place since 1999.  They were in draft form shortly prior to that.  In circumstances where we clearly had difficulties it was blindingly obvious that there was a need to put them on a proper footing and ensure greater coherence and compliance with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The truth is that in different child care areas for too many years they were not properly followed and where they were followed, different practices were adopted in different parts of the country.  There was no coherence of information.  The fact that there was not a computerised information system where the Minister for children, whether it was former Deputy Barry Andrews when he was Minister of State or his predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan, or even the HSE had real-time information about individual children within the care system, including the care being provided for them, the detail of a care plan for each child, the extent to which it was being followed, and the name of the nominated social workers, was an enormous gap.  Far too many children did not have a nominated social worker and did not have a care plan.  That is an issue that has given rise to many of the tragedies that have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Deputies who spoke are right in saying that in dealing with the child care side of this it is important that resources are available.  The truth, as everyone knows, is that in the current climate there is not the unlimited resources that are necessary in the context of any area of Government.  It is worth recording, however, that the Government has made an additional budgeting provision of €90 million for child welfare and protection services for this year compared to the funding that was made available last year.  Taken together, a total of 262 extra social workers were recruited last year and the year before.  That was effectively a 25% increase in the number of social workers dealing with child care protection and welfare.  Some have retired in the context of the overall social work cohort but there is no moratorium on the recruitment for social work positions of those engaged in the child care area.  Gordon Jeyes has the authority to replace those positions in the context of the resources available to him but it is not simply about more social workers or about resources.  It is about the methodology of approach and not throwing recently qualified social workers into the coalface of dealing with the most difficult families and ensuring that they have the appropriate training and mentoring necessary to facilitate them dealing with what may be very difficult situations and to providing supports to children that are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">A range of issues that falls outside my brief has been discussed but it is understandable that these issues have been discussed in the context of this legislation.  Some Members mentioned the children's rights referendum and we are on line to hold that referendum in the autumn.  As the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has said, it is expected that legislation will be published in early September.  I hope the referendum will have the support of all Members and parties, including Independent Deputies and all of the Technical Group.  The referendum is about ensuring we do not simply talk about children's rights and welfare, but that we incorporate protection for their rights and welfare into our Constitution.  This is an important additional leg of the work necessary in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">To return to the child death review report, in the context of child care proceedings or child care interventions, this is not all about taking children into care or taking children away from families.  It is about vulnerable families where there are children in difficulty and about, where possible, providing that family with the supports necessary to avoid increased difficulties for those children and addressing issues relating to the children.  It is not about, to use the current phrase in the Constitution, the State supplying the place of parents.   It is also about the State supplementing the place of parents.  We have provision for this in our child care legislation going back to 1991, in the context of the supervision order mechanisms that the courts can make in circumstances where parents with difficulties dealing with their children do not voluntarily interact with social workers who are available to provide the necessary supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">One of the constitutional issues or difficulties with which I have been very familiar with over the years in the area of child care practice, jumps out at us from the child death review report.  This difficulty is that because of the current provisions in the Constitution, there has been an unnecessary hesitancy on the part of some of those engaged in child care protection work to sufficiently and vigorously intervene to provide family support, as opposed to taking care proceedings.  They have been reluctant even to intervene in the context of looking for supervision orders in the early stages of knowing there are difficulties within a family.  A number of situations were portrayed in the report where I would certainly have felt that if there had been greater intervention at an earlier stage, some of the tragedies that occurred might not have occurred, but that might be an unfair or inaccurate judgment.  However, it is important we recognise that parents are the primary people to take care of their children and that for most children, their welfare is consistent with being within the family and being cared for by their parents.  There are parents who are incapable of properly caring for their children, but who could do so with assistance and supports.  In other circumstances, it is necessary for the protection of children that they are taken into care.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I agree with the comments of Deputy McGrath, that often there are many children who are better off in foster care than within their own family.  Many foster parents do excellent work in this area.  What we must do, as emphasised in this report, and as is clear in a myriad of other reports, is a move away from a situation where children who are taken into care are moved around like furniture, from temporary foster parents to more temporary foster parents and eventually to permanent foster parents.  They are put in a position where they cannot maintain permanent attachments and are in great difficulty emotionally because of their incapacity to identify with a particular group of people as being the people parenting them.  They are emotionally damaged in the context of their capacity to have relationships of a meaningful nature - whether during childhood or adulthood - with anybody.  There is a need for greater insight into how we operate the system.  We must not just consider that taking a child out of difficult background is automatically better for that child.  It is not, unless that child is put in a place where he or she can feel secure and form emotional attachments, where the emotional attachments are returned and where that child is not simply seen as an object, but as a human being.  These issues are of enormous importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">I have strayed way beyond the area of a Minister for Justice and Equality, but it was important I responded to some of the contributions.  I will return now to one or two of the issues arising with regard to the Bill.  I hope Deputies will forgive me if I do not name them individually, but a number them raised similar issues.  The Bill as set out is essentially a criminal law measure with a child protection intent as part of its overall approach.  Of itself, the Bill does not give rise to an issue of resources.  However, the child care area, which is within the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, needs to be properly resourced.  Essentially, the Bill is about assisting the Garda Síochána by providing information to it so that it may investigate offences where they occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Some concern was expressed with regard to the potential for a huge surge of complaints to be made, be they to the Garda Síochána or the HSE.  For the best part of 25 years, we have had a debate on the issue of mandatory reporting.  I recall writing about the merits or demerits of mandatory reporting when wearing my family lawyer hat well over 20 years ago.  The issue was discussed as far back as the Kilkenny report and with regard to a series of other reports, such as the report into the tragic death of Kelly Fitzgerald.  The issue kept recurring.  People outside recommended mandatory reporting, but others did not like it.  The approach of successive governments was that it could not be done or the system would be swamped.  When one discovers one has a system that is not working, one should not carry on maintaining the same system.  From the point of view of criminal law, if we have a responsibility to children and if I or anyone else knows a child is being abused - even without legislation being in place -  we should consider ourselves as having an obligation to inform An Garda Síochána.  This legislation merely ensures that if one knows a child or vulnerable adult is the victim of abuse or of any of the other serious offences listed in the Schedule, that person is required to do what is already his or her moral obligation and duty, namely, to report this to the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">We do not have a police force that is incapable of dealing with reports that it receives of serious crime.  We should report to the Garda Síochána when a serious crime is committed.  Any of us with information that would assist them, should provide it to them.  What this legislation does is say that we will no longer tolerate individuals deliberately covering up the commission of serious crimes against children.  Unfortunately, within the Catholic Church, cover-ups have been endemic.  We have read the Ryan report, the Murphy report into Dublin and the Murphy report into Cloyne.  We know the reality has been to cover up when children have been sexually abused.  Not only has there been cover up, but serious paedophiles have been moved, not only from one parish to another, but from this country to other parts of the world.  Individuals within the church who have acted as predators on children in this State have been shipped out of this State to the United States and elsewhere and subsequently have committed serious crimes against children in foreign countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">We have a responsibility to ensure that where it is known an individual has sexually abused a child, no matter what our background or religion, that information is given to An Garda Síochána, except in the narrow, confined circumstances in which this legislation provides a defence or a reasonable excuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I regard this as of the utmost importance.  As I stated in my original speech and as other Members have stated, despite the appropriate media focus on the difficulties that have arisen in the church it is true that the majority of the abuse of children occurs within families and that the majority of abusers tend to be individuals who the child or the family know.  This is the case in the context of vulnerable adults as well.  It is wrong to regard this legislation as directed purely against any particular or religious group.  It is all embracing and covers all circumstances in which abuse or other crimes may have been committed against children or vulnerable adults and it requires those who have information to provide it to the Garda Síochána.  This point is of particular importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Deputy Calleary and others have, rightly, drawn attention to the importance of ensuring that when the legislation is enacted, knowledge of the details is given to the community in general.  We are considering a communications strategy in this regard such that people are aware of their obligations and are encouraged to meet them.  This is of particular importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Some Deputies raised issues about the defences in the Bill.  I re-emphasise the point I made at the beginning.  Some of these defences arose as a result of the constructive engagement conducted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality with groups and organisations.  Earlier, while preparing the Bill I met several groups and organisations.  One concern voiced repeatedly by these groups was that nothing we did should erect a barrier against, intimidate, prevent or inhibit an individual who was the victim of abuse from seeking counselling or help.  All the groups recognised the importance of abuse being communicated to the Garda and, where possible, for individual abusers to be properly identified and for the Garda to be given assistance.  There was, however, a concern to ensure that an individual who had been the victim of abuse and who was under considerable stress did not believe that if he or she sought counselling, he or she should immediately inform the Garda as well.  There was a recognition that people need some time or opportunity to reflect and to come to terms with the horrors of the predicament in which they found themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Naturally, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I urge anyone who knows of abuse or who has been the victim of abuse to report it to the Garda.  The Garda now has substantial training in this area.  There is a special Garda unit which deals with sexual offences and the force has the capacity to deal with these matters with great understanding and insight.  I hold a particular concern in respect of children who are abused and adults who are the victim of rape because there is still an inadequate level of reporting by victims of such crimes to the Garda Síochána.  I believe there could properly be more prosecutions bought in this area and more investigations could be made.  I fully understand that in many cases individuals do not wish to perpetuate the circumstances any longer than is necessary.  Many individuals try for several years to put to the back of their heads the circumstances and the attacks that have been perpetrated on them.  Ultimately, however, we must aim to ensure that those engaged in predatory activities in respect of children or those who sexually assault adults are brought to book.  If the victims of these assaults do not communicate what has occurred to the Garda Síochána, the sad and tragic reality is that other individuals in the community will become victims and it is important that this does not occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Some Deputies raised the issue of who has and does not have privilege.  I touched on this issue in my opening speech and I presume we will return to it on Committee Stage.  I do not intend to repeat, therefore, what I said in my opening speech other than to make the point again that this legislation expressly applies to everyone; it does not expressly provide any exemption for any individual who knows of any information relating to the abuse of children from furnishing that information to An Garda Síochána and to assist in any investigations.  It is of great importance that people provide this assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Another important point relates to the Children First guidelines.  There is a connectivity between the Garda Síochána and the HSE.  The HSE may provide to the Garda appropriate information relating to children who have been the victims of abuse.  Conversely, the Garda may provide to the HSE necessary information to ensure that victims of abuse obtain the supports they require and to ensure those in the HSE can deal appropriately with children, provide supports to children where necessary and provide supports to members of their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I hope I have covered substantially most of the issues raised by Members.  We will return to some of these issues again on Committee Stage.  I thank Members for some extraordinarily important and interesting contributions to the debate.  In particular I thank those who have expressed substantial support for the purpose of the Bill and its objectives.  It is my hope that this legislation will be enacted within the coming weeks and that it will be in force before we go on vacation at the end of July.  Further, it is my hope that as a consequence of the legislation being put in place it will provide some additional protection to children, some extra assistance to the Garda and that knowledge of what is contained in the Bill becomes clear to the wider community.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">This is part of a suite of legislation we are enacting, including the Bill dealing with the vetting bureau.  I have indicated previously that the vetting legislation is at an advanced stage.  It will be published by the middle of July, before we go on vacation.  That is important legislation as well.  Similarly, valuable work was done on that Bill by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  That is another leg in the protection we are putting in place to ensure that those who may work with children or vulnerable adults are adequately vetted and that neither children nor vulnerable adults are put at risk unnecessarily.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The tragic reality in this area is that those who act as predators of children have, in years gone by, managed to weasel their way into bodies and organisations that work with children.  I do not necessarily advert to the child protection area.  Individuals from swimming and boxing clubs and other sporting organisations have been convicted.  They would have been perceived as pillars of the community but in reality they viewed the provision of training to young children in these clubs as a vehicle that gave them access to children at a time when there were most vulnerable, in circumstances in which other decent members of these clubs were unaware of their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">There is no one single magic bullet in this area to solve our problems but it is important that we have a new modern structure of laws and a new legal framework or architecture which does as much as is possible.  It cannot be said that no child in the country will ever again be abused.  It cannot be said that every child at risk in the country will be provided with protection.  Unfortunately, there will always be some children who fall through the cracks.  There will always be bad people, intent on abusing there position or abusing children or vulnerable adults.  Such people have no consciousness or moral compass.  We can make it more difficult, however, for such people and provide a better child protection service.  We can also ensure that those who prey on children or vulnerable adults are brought to justice, where possible, and that the community fully and properly co-operates in this regard.  The latter objective can be contributed to greatly by the enactment of this legislation.</p>

          <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_142">
            <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
            <p eId="para_586">I ask for an update on the position of domiciliary care allowance and the way it is to be administered.  This is a monthly allowance which is paid to the parents or guardians of children under the age of 16 who have severe disabilities which require continuous care and attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">I recently met three women to learn about the plight of their children.  They also outlined to me the changes they would like to see in the way the domiciliary care allowance is administered and allocated.  These women represent families in my constituency and across the country who are caring for their children as best they can in the face of cutbacks in almost every area.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">Further consideration needs to be given to the way in which this allowance is administered, including the means by which children are assessed and the process through which decisions can be appealed.  I welcome that the Minister for Social Protection increased the time allowed for preparation of appeals from 21 to 60 days earlier this year.  I fear, however, that we may not be treating children who receive domiciliary care allowance in this country the same as children in other countries which operate similar allowance schemes.  Reviews should be conducted by those who are most knowledgeable about the area, have experience of working with these children and are able to make the appropriate decisions in order to make life easier for those concerned.  Any change to the system should be based the input of people on the ground, namely, the parents and guardians of these children, because they deal with the problems arising on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">Matters that we may consider trivial or meaningless can amount to major events for those who are forced to cope in these circumstances.  Domiciliary care allowance may not solve all these families' problems but at least it eases the burden of everyday life and allows them room to breathe.  It must be noted however, that the number of children accessing the scheme has increased by more than 3,000 over a three year period.  It is expected that expenditure this year would be in the region of €146 million.  Any review of the scheme would be welcome for these reasons.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_143">
            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_590">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise the issue of the domiciliary care allowance.  I welcome the review of the scheme because it is what parents and Deputies on all sides of this House have been seeking.  It is clear that the current system is not working for many families.  Officials can hide behind statistics but the parents who protest outside the gates or visit us in our clinics know that something has gone wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">It was politically courageous of the Minister, Deputy Burton, to heed the calls by parents and groups like the DCA Warriors by announcing a review.  However, I ask for more detail on what the review will entail.  It is vital that it starts from an acknowledgement that the current system needs to be overhauled rather than being seen as a box ticking exercise.  I note that the Minister will appoint three representatives from NGOs to the review body.  How are these representatives to be selected?  It is vital that parents are allowed to play a key role.  I draw Members' attention to the work of the DCA Warriors, the members of which are warriors for their children's rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">The Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection gave a commitment to the Committee on Public Accounts that no family would lose its domiciliary care allowance while the review is ongoing.  In other words, payments will not be ceased until the policy review is complete.  I ask for clarification on this commitment.  When will the process be concluded?  Yesterday the Minister referred to consultations with parents.  What mechanism will be used for the consultation process?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_144">
            <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_593">I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Burton, on a review of the domiciliary care allowance system.  I ask for clarification on the role to be played by the NGO representatives.  In the recent debate on this issue, speakers approved of the terms of reference for the review but stressed the importance of including parents' representatives.  These are the people who have everyday experience of raising children with disabilities.  The officials and the bureaucrats do not seem to understand the hidden problems that arise.  This is borne out by the type of questions asked not only during the paper review but also subsequently in oral hearings.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">In regard to the NGO representatives, who will they be, from what sectors will they be drawn and will they include parents of children who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance and have gone through the review process?  Such parents could share their real life experiences of what is wrong with the process, as well as provide examples of the amazing achievement of living relatively normal lives despite the huge stresses faced on a daily basis by virtue of having children who are on the autistic spectrum or have Asperger syndrome or Tourette syndrome.  When will the review commence, when will it end and how long will it take for the results to be announced?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_145">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_595">I am taking this topical issue on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, who conveys her apologies to the Deputies for not being here to respond in person.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that he or she requires care, attention and supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the requirements of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">The allowance is currently paid to over 24,000 parents and guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately €100 million in 2011, with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further €45 million.  Parents in receipt of domiciliary care allowance also qualify for carer's allowance and household benefits, subject to fulfilling certain criteria, and some 40% of those on the scheme receive these payments.  Those who receive the carer's allowance and household benefit package, in addition to domiciliary care allowance and respite care grant, each receive a total of almost €17,000 per annum from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">The review of the domiciliary care allowance announced by the Minister in May is due to commence in early July.  The working group to review the scheme will be chaired by Ms Sylvia Langford, retired director general in the former Office of the Minister for Children.  The working group will include representatives from the Departments of Social Protection, Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as from the National Disability Authority.  It will also include three representatives from key NGO organisations representing parents and guardians of children in receipt of the allowance along with other members with relevant expertise.  The review will examine and report on the policy objectives and legal provisions underpinning the domiciliary care allowance scheme.  It will review the current administrative, medical assessment and appeals processes underpinning the scheme, including an examination of the duration of review periods for the scheme based on the medical condition of the children involved and taking account of other priority demands on the medical resources of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The medical guidelines and the report of the expert medical group will be reviewed having regard to the three years operational experience since the scheme transferred to the Department.  As part of the review, a consultation process with parents and representative groups will be undertaken to ensure parents and their representatives have an opportunity to make their concerns known in respect of the administration of the scheme.  Reviews of individual claims are suspended while the review is ongoing.  A report and recommendations emerging from the review are to be submitted by the end of December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">In separate work, the availability of supports and services for children with disabilities will be mapped to see if there is an opportunity for greater linkage and consistency in the assessment for such support and services.  This work will be led by officials in the Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments and is expected to be completed in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">I am aware of the heroic efforts of parents to support their children and of the vital role played by the income supports paid by the Department in enabling people to live with dignity and to support their children.  It remains my primary concern to ensure that parents of children who continue to meet the qualifying conditions continue to receive the allowance.</p>

          <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_146">
            <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
            <p eId="para_602">I warmly welcome the response of the Minister of State and I warmly congratulate the Minister for Social Protection on her plans for this review.  One of the best things set to happen under the review is the fact that the new working group, which will be staffed by the most appropriate people, will meet parents and guardians of children.  Legislators may form the law in Leinster House but the ordinary people must live with it.  Quite often, legislators do not gauge people's feelings.  This review affords people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance the opportunity to have their wishes heard and to make their opinions known.  This is welcome.  I am sure the new review will be carried out with zeal by the working group.  I thank the Minister for Social Protection for the response.  It is great to see that she listened and went a long way to give the parents what they wanted.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_147">
            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_603">One of the key points I asked for was clarification that no current claims will be suspended during the review.  It is very important that the Minister of State has provided that commitment, on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  It will be welcomed by thousands of parents in receipt of domiciliary care allowance who are fearful of the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">I am still seeking an answer on the fact that three NGOs will be represented on the review group.  Above and beyond consultation, that ensures there will be representatives of parents groups sitting around the table.  I am eager to work out how they will be selected so they are real-life parents, as Deputy Regina Doherty suggested, who have been in receipt of domiciliary care allowance or are experiencing issues with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">I welcome the fact the review will be completed in the autumn.  The domiciliary care allowance is paid to children with extra care needs.  The issue with the current system is that it does not recognise extra care needs that become apparent behind closed doors.  When examining the application process and the application form, it is important to consider children with conditions such as autism spectrum disorder.</p>

            <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
            <p eId="para_606">I join with my colleagues in welcoming the response.  I do not want to be petulant but I will ask again about the three representatives bodies.  Who will they be and what criteria will be used to select them?  Given that a myriad of organisations represent some but not all parents of children with particular disabilities, we need to ensure the three NGOs chosen and the relevant people within the NGOs are representative of the people who have gone through the review process.  I will not name any of the NGOs and I hope I am making sense.  Otherwise, we will learn nothing except how it should be in a textbook.  The reality of what people live through and the current description of the review process are poles apart.  The merits of the review are marvellous.  I concur with Deputy Ann Phelan that the Minister for Social Protection is incredibly brave for doing this as a response to the issues raised over the past couple of months.  It is imperative that this is worthwhile and that, at the end of the process, people who walk the walk get to sit down and devise a new review process to make life easier for people in the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_607">Regarding Deputy Phelan's point on consultation, consultation with parents is important.  The Minister for Social Protection has a clear determination to listen to and co-operate with the people most affected, namely, the parents.  This will be a review with straight talking and action.  Hopefully we will end up with results.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">Deputy Harris's point, that no payments will be suspended, is correct.  Consultation and evaluation of children with extra care needs is important.  The Minister for Social Protection is determined to make a difference because this has been promised for quite a while.  The review is meaningful and will come up with a clear plan of action.  Deputy Regina Doherty referred to representative bodies.  The Minister is open to suggestions and recommendations.  She welcomes recommendations from each Deputy directly or via the Secretary General.  It is important we get the views of parents and Members representing their constituents.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">Deputy Regina Doherty referred to the parent representative bodies.  If she contacts the Minister directly with suggestions on bodies that should be represented, I am sure the Minister will take her views on board.</p>

          <heading>Rent Supplement Scheme</heading>
          <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_150">
            <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
            <p eId="para_610">The Minister is trying to reform the rent supplement scheme.  Some of the changes made in the budget proved to be problematic for people availing of rent supplement in Dublin South-East and across the country.  As part of the budget, new upper limits for the rent supplement scheme were published.  They make it extremely difficult for applicants to find suitable accommodation across the country and particularly in Dublin 2 and Dublin 4, where there is strong market demand.  The changes will also have a significant impact on those in my constituency who have found suitable accommodation that met the old criteria but which is no longer acceptable as it exceeds the new limits.  Exceptional market demand in my constituency means the price of one-bedroom flats ranges from €700 to over €1,000 per month.  This is far in excess of the rent supplement limit of €475 for all of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">The new limit represents a reduction of approximately 10% on the previous threshold and is well below the rental price of even a bed-sit or studio apartment in many areas of my constituency.  If these changes are implemented, they will force people in receipt of rent supplement out of certain areas in Dublin, even though they may contain numerous social housing units.  People will be driven from the areas in which they grew up and raised their own families and in which many of their loved ones still reside.  Others may be forced into illegal arrangements whereby they agree to top up their rent by way of under-the-table payments to their landlords.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Nevertheless, I welcome and accept the necessity of the Government's efforts to reform the rent supplement scheme.  It has grown into something far larger and more all-encompassing than was originally planned.  I also welcome the moves to place the scheme under the joint control of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities, which will allow it to operate in a far more effective manner.  Rent supplement should not function as a poverty trap and a disincentive to take up employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_624">The effect of the reduction in rent caps is that people are being threatened with eviction and driven into the homelessness services.  The Government claimed it would force landlords to reduce rents, but that is not happening.  Instead, landlords are giving tenants notice when the latter indicate that a reduction in rent is being sought in accordance with the reduced rent supplement thresholds.  People are being put in terrible situations.  In Dún Laoghaire, for example, those who present themselves to the council to declare themselves homeless are being told they will be put in a hotel in Drumcondra or in Rathdrum in County Wicklow.  Families are being separated, which is deplorable.  In other cases, people are being forced, as Deputy Kevin Humphreys observed, to make under-the-counter payments, with the landlord lying to the authorities about the actual rent being charged.  In addition, there are many anomalies in the system whereby foster children, for instance, are not recognised when assessing eligibility for rent supplement.  In addition, people who take up part-time work are losing their allowance, which acts as a disincentive to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">I call on the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to reverse the reductions in the rent caps.  She should concentrate on doing what should be done, namely, taking some of the tens of thousands of vacant properties throughout the State into local authority control in order to meet people's housing needs.  That is far preferable to forcing them into homelessness.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_626">I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who conveys her apologies to the Deputies for being unable to respond in person.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">There are approximately 93,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012.  New maximum rent limits were introduced from 1 January 2012, following analysis of the most up-to-date market data.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer, while also ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  In the case of each county, all major urban population centres were tested as part of the review to ensure rent supplement applicants would be able to access temporary housing arrangements while seeking employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The revised rent limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Latest figures show that approximately 23,000 claims have been awarded in 2012, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation within the revised limits.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country.  Rent supplement is not generally paid where the rent charged for the accommodation is above the relevant maximum rent limit.  However, departmental officials have flexibility to make payments above these limits where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances.  This would apply, for example, in the case of a person with a disability living in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons whose housing needs cannot be met within the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure their accommodation needs are met.  I assure the Deputies that there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I ask him to convey to the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, the need for greater flexibility.  In some of the areas I represent, which include Ringsend, Sandymount, Pearse Street, Ranelagh and Rathmines, the very high levels of unemployment mean there is exceptional demand for the rent supplement scheme.  Many of those seeking to rent homes in these areas grew up there and have family support nearby.  It is simply not possible, however, to secure accommodation with the maximum allowance.  Rent on a two-bedroom unit in parts of south-east Dublin ranges from €1,500 to €2,000 per month, which exceeds even the limit for two adults and three children under the scheme, which is €950.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">An effective reform would be to transfer control of the scheme to the local authorities, with a differential rent scheme whereby the council makes up the difference with the help of an allocation from central government.  Such an initiative would allow people to continue living within their own communities and also prevent rent supplement from serving as a poverty trap.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">If the Minister of State's response reflects the best that the Government is prepared to do, there will inevitably be protests by those affected by these changes.  The reality is that in many parts of Dublin - not just Dublin 2 and 4 but also Dún Laoghaire, much of south County Dublin and elsewhere - and in other cities such as Galway and Waterford, it is simply not possible to secure suitable accommodation within the new rent caps, particularly for families with two or more children.  Before I came into the Chamber for this debate, I checked<i>daft.ie</i> to see what was available in Dún Laoghaire for the maximum threshold of €950.  There is not a single three-bedroom house available for that price.  The caps must be raised if people are to secure accommodation that fits their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">Despite the Minister of State's claims to the contrary, people certainly are being forced into homelessness.  I brought a person to Leinster House last Thursday who is homeless as a result of the reduction in the rent allowance cap.  This person is now separated from two of her children and is sleeping on a sofa in her grandmother's house, in which an elderly and ill great-grandmother also resides.  People should not be forced into such desperately overcrowded conditions.  Other people are being told to go to hotels in Drumcondra even though their children go to school in Dún Laoghaire.  That is simply not acceptable.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Social Protection to raise the caps as a short-term measure in order to ensure people can find affordable accommodation?  In the longer term, some of the thousands of vacant properties throughout the country should be placed under the control of the local authorities and used to provide secure, affordable housing where people will not have the threat of eviction hanging over their heads.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">The new rent limits were introduced in January 2012 and are applicable to all new rent supplement applicants and to existing recipients upon review.  Rent limits were previously adjusted effective from June 2010.  The purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation and supplement tenancies, but not to provide rent supplements to tenants with access to housing in all areas.  Approximately 23,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded this year up to 15 June.  Those claims include new claims, change of address and change of landlord cases.  Where a claim is under review, which was Deputy Kevin Humphreys's point, and the rent is above the new maximum limit, the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates, departmental officials will discuss options open to the tenant, up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental guidelines to officers administering the rent supplement state that where negotiation with the landlord fails, the then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to 13 weeks at a higher rate.  However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected - it is important to put this on the record-----</p>

The Department's intention is to return rent supplement to its original purpose as a short-term income.  This will be achieved through the rental accommodation scheme and the Government's new housing policy.  Since 2005, local authorities have transferred a total of 39,910 rent supplement receipts to the rental accommodation scheme and other social housing offices.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_168">
            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_637">I wish to join with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and Deputy Troy who, during Leaders' Questions this morning, commended local authorities and the emergency services working on the flooding situation in Cork and other affected areas.  I understand that the national co-ordination group for emergency management has met and is working closely with local services in the affected areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">I sought to raise the issue earlier this week and in the meantime I have met with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, whose responsibilities include the Office of Public Works.  I also met with other TDs yesterday whose constituencies have been affected by flooding along the River Shannon, including parts of Offaly, Westmeath, Roscommon and east Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">Summer flooding along the Shannon has become more frequent in recent years, but never has it been more severe than in recent weeks.  The Shannon Callows traditionally flood between October and April, hence farmers rely heavily on dry summers for the production of silage and grazing ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">In the week beginning Monday, 11 June, Met Éireann issued a weather alert warning of severe rainfall and floods.  Continuous rain on Thursday and Friday resulted in flooding on lands traditionally used for grazing.  The deluge has meant that some silage-bearing ground is being used for grazing, resulting in a loss of winter feed, while some farmers are using winter feed for cattle which should be grazing.  Many farmers now fear that they may have to sell stock to compensate for this loss.  In some cases, individual farmers have up to 58 acres under water.  As a result of the flooding between Banagher and Athlone, thousands of acres have been destroyed and are under water.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Many people say that all this could have been avoided.  The bodies which have authority to agree to open sluice-gates include the ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW.  Yet in this instance, it was Saturday before the gates at Lusmagh and Meelick were opened.  The Minister of State's officials confirmed yesterday that no specific protocol is currently in place to oblige these authorities to open sluice-gates, despite the issuance of severe weather warnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Why must we wait for the damage to be done before acting in this regard?  It seems unbelievable that in this day and age such a catastrophe could be allowed to happen, considering the warnings that were put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to a meeting next Tuesday of all relevant stakeholders in an effort to resolve this issue.  However, the Minister of State should support the concept of an agreed protocol in consultation with the IFA, landowners and farming authorities.  Such a protocol should be put in place as soon as possible.  In that way, as soon as such a weather alert is received, the relevant authorities would have to act appropriately by opening sluice-gates, thus avoiding the decimation of family incomes and livelihoods as we have recently witnessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The Minister of State should also put in place a compensation package as was done two years ago.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine should ask his officials to ascertain and quantify the losses in conjunction with farming organisations.  A mechanism should then be agreed to replenish feed to an equivalent cost for farmers who have been affected.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance  (Deputy Brian Hayes)</from>
            <p eId="para_645">I thank the Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  I also thank Deputy Cowen for raising the issue.  At the outset, I agree with his remarks on the emergency services which did sterling work in parts of the country both last night and this morning to help citizens to deal with the appalling flooding events, particularly in the south west.  I agree with him that work needs to be recognised in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">This topic gives me the opportunity to address the problems with flooding on the Shannon Callows.  Having extensively toured the Callows area last year, accompanied by public representatives, IFA representatives and local residents, to see the situation for myself and to talk through the issues, I am conscious of the serious impact both on farming and the environment in the area due to flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">I recognise that the Shannon Callows is an important asset to the farming community.  Traditional farming practices are recognised as contributing to the economic and social management of this unique area.  I accept that the recent pattern of flooding to the Callows has caused extensive hardship to many members of the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">In general, this summer's flooding arises from the restricted capacity of the River Shannon at this location.  Flooding can occur as a result of large flows from either the River Suck, the upper Shannon from Lough Ree or a combination of both.  The inflow from the River Brosna also contributes to flooding in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">June has been a very wet month.  Although there are still two days left in the month, it is already the wettest June on record at most of the stations in the Shannon catchment.  Some of these stations also experienced their highest or second highest ever daily rainfall for June.  As a general indication, rainfall in this area has been between two and three times the long-term average for June.  We have therefore suffered a major problem this month because of the rainfall.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">Due to the bout of heavy and prolonged rainfall in early June water levels in the Shannon have risen, particularly in the Callows area.  I have reviewed an initial report on the impact of this flooding event and the photos provided have given me a graphic appreciation of the scope of lands affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">I have been proactively monitoring the situation.  As Deputy Cowen said, I took the opportunity of organising a meeting in Leinster House with local elected representatives in the affected constituencies along the Shannon basin.  Following that meeting, I have instructed that another meeting with local representatives be organised shortly with senior representatives of both Waterways Ireland and the ESB in attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">Waterways Ireland is one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement in 1999.  Waterways Ireland has responsibility for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">Operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is a matter for both Waterways Ireland and the ESB.  The Office of Public Works has no direct responsibility in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">I will examine this issue closely, as to whether or not statutory responsibility should reside within our Department.  It is precious little help to the Deputy and his constituency colleagues if we are the lead agency but cannot set water levels across the Shannon, which is currently the statutory position.  I recognise that is a contradiction and so I intend to examine it closely.</p>

            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_655">I thank the Minister of State for his response and I acknowledge his efforts in keeping public representatives from the Shannon area informed of the progress he envisages.  I seek a commitment from the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, that this process is being initiated with the stated objective of formulating a protocol which, in the event of a weather warning being issued by Met Éireann, will set in train a response which includes consultation with the farming community and, in turn, a release of the gates so as to negate the effect such torrential rainfall would have on these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">Will the Minister of State commit in this House, where as he stated it is appropriate to do so, to consult with his colleagues, in particular the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and request that he, in conjunction with his officials and the farming authorities, ascertain the losses incurred with a view to bringing forward a package which would compensate these farmers and their families in that regard?  For farmers to consider selling stock at this stage is incomprehensible in terms of the farm management process in any given year.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">Will the Minister of State commit to the establishment of a protocol to ensure this does not happen again?  I am not suggesting this only happened in recent weeks for the first time.  I acknowledge it has happened in the past.  It is incumbent on us to resolve this issue.  Also, will the Minister of State undertake to consult with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and request that he, in consultation with his officials, would seek to bring forward a package which would meet with the approval of the farming community?</p>

            <p eId="para_658">My understanding is that there is a protocol in place between Waterways Ireland and the ESB.  However, we need to quickly establish the veracity of that protocol.  The view locally is that it has not worked.  I have no difficulty with the OPW being part and parcel of that protocol, if necessary.  This is not rocket science.  It should be the case that farmers in the Callows area are alerted by text from the public authorities, be they local authorities, the ESB, Waterways Ireland or the OPW, to severe oncoming weather.  However, that has not happened.  As far as I am aware it has happened in places such as Gort, where a protocol was put in place between the OPW and Galway County Council.  If it can be done in Gort it can be done in respect of the Callows.  There is no reason this cannot be done through the social media.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that protocol is put in place and that it is robust in terms of getting information to farmers, in particular when severe weather is forecast.  I will take up that matter with the two other agencies involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">On compensation, I do not want to give hope to the Deputy that a compensation package could be put in place tomorrow.  It would be dishonest of me to do that.  However, I will take up the matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Deputy Cowen mentioned that a similar package was put in place two years ago.  I will investigate the extent of that package.  I acknowledge the severe economic difficulties which faces farmers along the Callows area as a result of this flooding.  While as stated by the Deputy this is a historic problem, the situation has worsened as a result of changing weather patterns in this country and climate change.  I will engage with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the potential of putting in place a compensation package.  In undertaking to engage with the Minister, I do not wish to give the Deputy false hope that a compensation will be put in place tomorrow.  It would be dishonest of me to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I can assure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, that there are no constituents of mine in the Visitors Gallery and as such I will not be playing to the gallery when speaking on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">I am concerned at the current housing situation in the city, in particular the local authority housing units which remain vacant owing to a lack of funding for maintenance crews.  I currently have 100 files on my desk, and many more in the filing cabinets in my office, in respect of people on the city council housing list, many of whom have medical or welfare priority but have remained on the housing list for years.  Many people with medical priority have been told it will be two years or more before they can be accommodated.  They have been told there are no units available, yet in Dublin South-Central, which I represent, there are currently 190 units-voids, 107 of which are in need of short term repair, 21 of which are new properties and 62 of which are voids requiring long-term repair.  There are 48 units in Kilmainham, where I live there, 85 in the south-west inner city, 26 in Crumlin and 30 in Ballyfermot.  There are plenty of units available.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">I welcome what is happening in St. Theresa's Gardens and Dolphin House in terms of regeneration and compliment the Minister of State in terms of her work on putting together a package to improve many of the units in Dolphin House, some of which are not habitable.  Many of the aforementioned units are empty because the city council's budget is limited and it does not have the manpower or funding necessary to carry out the repair work.  I am fully aware that city council maintenance crews are already stretched to the limit and that even carrying out day-to-day repair work has become troublesome for them.  It is impossible for the council to further stretch the small resources it has.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">In my view, this situation has reached crisis point.  It is shocking that some of these houses and flats have been lying empty for up to a year when there are so many people in my area in need of accommodation.  As I stated, some of my constituents are already on the housing list, others are homeless or are living with families in overcrowded conditions which are unsuitable to their needs and many others are in rented accommodation, much of which is in a poor state of repair.  I have been told by the Minister on many occasions there we have no money.  However, the State is paying rent supplement to private landlords.  As stated previously, 94,000 people in this country are in receipt of rent supplement, 4,000 of whom live in the Dublin 8, 10 and 12 regions.  Rent supplement will cost the Government €436 million this year.  I acknowledge that the figure in this regard was much higher last year and I credit the Minister, Deputy Burton, on the reduction achieved this year.  However, that amount of money would go a long way towards addressing our social housing needs. It is a massive amount to be handing over to private landlords when there are plenty of empty houses and apartments throughout my constituency and in Dublin, which are owned by the State.  We need to take a more sensible approach to this problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">There are many families who are living in poor accommodation and need to be rehoused.  Some of them only require transfer to larger accommodation.  There are many flat complexes in the constituency I represent, many of which are past their sell-by date owing to a lack of maintenance, which it is impossible to have addressed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_665">I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">In accordance with the provisions of the Housing Act 1966, the management and maintenance of the social housing stock, including the carrying out of planned maintenance programmes and pre-letting repairs, is the responsibility of the relevant housing authority, in this case, Dublin City Council.  Housing maintenance works, including pre-letting repairs, are funded directly by local authorities from their own resources, including from rental income and receipts from the disposal of properties and sales of houses to tenants.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to locally identified needs and available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">The Deputy will be aware that the adoption of the local authority annual budget is a reserved function.  That said, my Department provides substantial capital funding to local authorities to support a wide range of measures aimed at improving the overall quality and standard of social rented dwellings.  These measures include a regeneration measure for large social housing estates and flat complexes, an estate-wide remedial works scheme, a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses and grants for the provision of extensions or adaptations to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">Given the constraints on capital budgets for new stock, my Department is now placing greater emphasis on local authority social housing improvement works programmes and on the early return of vacant units to productive use.  This year, I allocated some €145 million to local authorities for works to improve the social housing stock, €90 million of which is being provided in respect of the national regeneration programme, a programme which is of particular importance for the physical and social regeneration of deprived areas in Dublin city.  A total of €27 million is being provided in respect of 45 estate-wide remedial works schemes in 26 local authorities with a further €10 million earmarked for extensions and adaptations to properties throughout all local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">It is now more important than ever to ensure the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need.  Beginning in 2011, the Department required local authorities to focus the retrofitting programme on bringing vacant stock back into productive use.  The 2012 programme will build on the achievements of 2011 when more than 2,600 vacant units were refurbished and made available for re-letting.  While local authorities may undertake work on tenanted properties, there is a continuing focus on making vacant properties available for re-letting as quickly as possible.  Grants of up to €15,000 per house are generally available for improving the fabric of the house with a further grant of up to €3,000 where additional essential works are needed.  Over the course of 2010 and 2011 a total of 4,492 houses were improved.  This year a total of €18 million is being provided for improving the quality and energy efficiency of older housing stock around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">In the case of Dublin city, I am making more than €62 million available this year to support the various housing programmes in the city council area.  This includes more than €40 million for regeneration projects.  This funding will meet ongoing commitments in respect of the planning and construction of projects in Ballymun and at a number of locations in the city referred to by Deputy Byrne, including St. Michael's Estate, St. Teresa's Gardens, Dolphin House, O'Devaney Gardens, Croke Villas and Dominick Street.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">In addition to the substantial allocation for regeneration works, I will also provide €6 million in 2012 for city council's remedial works programme.  This programme provides capital support for estate-wide works to improve the fabric of houses, improve layout and access, address issues such as anti-social behaviour and, where possible, address issues of social exclusion.  For example, Liberty House and Bunratty Road Maisonettes will benefit from this allocation.  I allocated a further €2.9 million to the city council for energy efficiency and retrofitting works designed to bring vacant stock back into productive use.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">I welcome the budget that has been allocated and with every bone in my body I believe the Minister of State's heart is in the right place.  However, properties in the Dublin City Council area are not being put back on the market quickly enough.  People contact me on a regular basis to say they are aware of houses on a particular road which are boarded up.  It is very frustrating for any public representative to think such houses are out there.  With my hand on my heart I can state a number of properties in my constituency have been vacant for more than a year and nothing has happened to them.  They need to be looked into.  The local authority needs to be challenged by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to ensure the budget which has been allocated is used immediately.  This morning I spoke to the housing manager in one of the offices who told me he cannot obtain the funding to put 27 houses in his area back on the market.  We are losing a huge amount of potential rent from people and we are giving out a huge amount in rent allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">I also have a question on the units in NAMA.  I come from the inner city and I am completely taken aback by the number of apartment blocks which remain vacant with nobody living in them.  I know from looking at many of them that little work needs to be done to put them on the market.  Does the Minister of State have any plans to work with NAMA to do something with these complexes and make them available to local authorities so we might be able to house some of those on the waiting list and get some people out of rented accommodation which is inadequate for their needs?</p>

            <p eId="para_674">To reply directly to Deputy Byrne on this issue, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I met NAMA recently and we are engaging with it on an ongoing basis.  Originally it committed to more than 2,000 units, some of which are suitable and some are not.  We will continue to engage with it until we have approximately this number of units for social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">I take the point that we must continuously examine ways to improve how we use the money we have.  In all honesty I cannot see us having extra money in the next year or two.  We must target and ensure efficiency in the money we have and ensure it is well spent.  Deputy Byrne has made some very good points and I will certainly take them on board.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_677">On 12 June 2012 , I published the planning review report assessing the application of planning legislation, policy and guidance within the development plan and development management systems at local level and to inform further policy development in this area.  Seven planning authorities, representing a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas as well as both large and small authorities, had been selected to assist in the review of policies and practices by reference to a number of cases raised with the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The report found that the allegations made, which served as the basis for the review, do not relate to systemic corruption in the planning system and no<i>prima facie</i>  evidence of malfeasance was found in any of the seven local authorities.  It has, nonetheless, raised serious matters ranging from maladministration to inconsistency in application of planning policy or non-adherence to forward plans such as development plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">The report contains 12 actions and I am committed to implementing all of these through legislative change and consolidation, revised non-statutory guidelines and improved management systems in planning authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">I have decided that all actions and recommendations and the full review on which they are based are to be considered by an independent planning expert.  This intended appointment is separate from the ongoing examination of the recommendations contained in the final report of the Mahon tribunal.  I expect the Government will consider a comprehensive analysis of these in the coming weeks, including the recommendation for the appointment of an independent planning regulator.</p>

            <p eId="para_681">The position being maintained by the Minister of State on our call for an independent inquiry into the seven named local authorities and County Waterford is completely untenable.  What we have heard from her and others has no credibility and this is a very serious issue.  Yesterday Judge Gerard Griffin sentenced former Fine Gael councillor, Fred Forsey, to six years following a guilty conviction on six counts of receiving corrupt payments.  It is entirely in the public interest that people know exactly what happened in Waterford.  How could members of Waterford County Council zone land while a Garda criminal investigation was in progress?  The Minister of State is not serving the public interest with the course of action she is pursuing, particularly with regard to Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">I remind the Minister and the Minister of State of Judge Griffin's comments.  Yesterday, he stated Mr. Forsey gravely breached the trust of the electorate, the crime was in the upper to mid range of the scale and political corruption undermines the specific nature of society.  He also stated it is very important that corruption should not be allowed into the fabric of society and that it causes inequality.</p>

The review is completely separate from the type of corruption pointed to in the Mahon report.  We will have a whole of Government response to the Mahon report in due course very shortly.  The issue in Waterford is entirely separate and shows the court system works.  Somebody was taken to court and found guilty and will now serve his sentence which is as it should be.  However, it is on a completely different scale to the issues that were selected by the former Minister John Gormley when the Deputy's party was in the last Government with him.  He selected those issues and they related to preplanning meetings, the height of buildings, local area plans and so on.  He intended to instigate reviews on these issues, which have nothing to do with the kind of corruption mentioned by the Deputy, so he should not try to misinform the public on such issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">I am chairing the national co-ordination committee on unfinished housing developments to oversee implementation of the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments, together with the Government's response to the recommendations.  The committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector and real progress is being made with the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.  The committee is meeting on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">Site resolution plans are a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership in a way that is in the best interests of residents.  As part of the work of the national co-ordination committee, my Department initiated a pilot project for the resolution of sites using the site resolution plan process, and issued a working template in order to establish best practice in this area.  I intend that the process, which is pivotal to the resolution of problem sites, will be used more extensively in the coming year.  Ultimately, the initiation of the SRP process in respect of a particular development is a matter for the local authority concerned.  However, progress by local authorities in ensuring that developers complete and resolve unfinished housing developments is continuing, as evidenced by regular reports to the national co-ordination committee.  The committee intends to publish a report on overall progress, including the numbers of sites resolved, by the end of July.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Under the public safety initiative, my Department has made allocations totalling €3.21 million to 21 local authorities from the funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues in 2011.  The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.  A provision of €2 million has been made for 2012 and my Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.  A total amount of €1.726 million has been drawn down by local authorities to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I would like to acknowledge that many of the ghost estates were a major problem and the Minister of State has secured their boundaries and the areas around them.  This was very important as a result of the tragedy that we had.  There were also other incidents.  Having the site resolution plans is a very important step, but it is not enough at the moment.  These plans need to be completed as a matter of urgency and brought to a positive conclusion.  The list of ghost estates compiled by the Department must be updated when necessary.  Having to wait for assessment and being put on the list just adds to the frustration of residents.  Many of them are stuck in these unfinished estates, often left in terrible condition, with kids and others getting into the properties.  It is just a disaster for residents, particularly those who took out mortgages and spent huge amounts of money.  The residents deserve better.  We need to compile an accurate list and try to complete the unfinished estates.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_730">I have no disagreement with the Deputy on this issue.  We have to continue to drive the process forward  Thus far, 782 developers have given us site resolution plans and 136 of those have been completed, while others are in process.  There are different kinds of works.  Some are in NAMA, which will then have responsibility for the issue, while receivers are in charge of others and some estates have multiple developers.  It is quite complex.  The committee meets fairly regularly.  We will publish a progress report very soon which will provide much detail on what has been achieved and what still has to be done.  We have to keep a focus on this to ensure we resolve it for local residents.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">I agree that the report of the advisory group is very important and we need to see that.  Up to 2,000 NAMA properties were supposed to come on stream before Christmas, but we ended up with around 800 that were suitable for housing, for different reasons.  I hope the other properties can be made available at some stage.  That commitment was given before Christmas and there is a huge social housing waiting list.  We need to find out why those houses did not become available.</p>

            <p eId="para_732">Apart from our meetings with NAMA officials on the issue of unfinished estates, we are also meeting them about the 2,000 properties.  They have also identified a further 1,000 properties, so we will pursue that issue to ensure that we get the promised amount of properties.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_735">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 5 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">The Government's broad policy approach in this area was set out in the programme for Government.  In line with this, I intend to bring proposals to the Government before the Dáil summer recess for an extensive programme of local government reform.  Subject to the Government's decisions, I propose to publish a comprehensive policy statement setting out a clear vision for the future of local government and proposals to achieve it, with particular focus on strengthening structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels, expanding the role of local government, maximising operational and organisational efficiency and improving governance, oversight, local political and executive leadership and citizen engagement.  The reform programme will also reflect other work on various aspects of local government, including local authority mergers, efficiency implementation, local government funding and alignment of local and community development with local government.  The statement will also outline implementation arrangements for the reform programme and certain issues which will be the subject of further policy development work.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Work on the development of policy proposals for the Government's consideration in this area is informed by the extensive analysis, consultation, deliberation and debate that has already taken place on local government reform over many years.  I have received submissions from, and held discussions with the local government representative associations, with individual local authorities and with other interested groups and individuals.  I also recently invited each individual councillor in the country to submit views to me on a number of issues relating to local government reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">Publication of the policy statement on local government will provide a further opportunity for public comment and input ahead of the development of legislation required to provide for reform measures.  The content of the local government reform legislation will be a matter for a decision by the Government in the first instance and will, of course, be the subject of Oireachtas scrutiny and debate in the normal way.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">I thank the Minister for his reply.  The Minister mentioned there would be an implementation plan after the policy statement is introduced.  Does he anticipate that many of the changes will be in place before the local elections, due to take place in 2014?  There is a real desire for reform in this area and it is difficult to see how there could be Oireachtas reform without having local government reform in conjunction.  There will be an acceptance of change and this is a unique opportunity.  Does the Minister propose to have mergers or does he intend to make changes to the town council structure?  Will there be fewer town councils, or more?  Will the county system still be regarded as the primary tier of local government or, in the event of mergers, will the Minister propose changes to that tier?</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_740">The county and city authorities will be the primary unit of local government.  I am not in a position to state anything further until my Government colleagues discuss the ultimate structures at county and sub-county level.  The policy paper will indicate the functions and structures of local government and how we can better deliver services at local level.  We will attempt to introduce new proposals whereby there can be greater devolution of function, and delivery of services as near as possible to the citizen.  In the context of the EU-IMF agreement, this gives us an opportunity to have a local source of funding.  All these issues will be part of the reform proposals and will form part of the statement on policy that must be agreed in the first instance by Government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
            <p eId="para_742">As the Minister is aware, Sinn Féin supports radical local government reform and seeks maximum power and decision-making to devolve to local authorities.  This means that local government should have increased powers over planning, waste management, housing policy, education and roads while retaining its powers over supply of water.  We also support having directly elected mayors in towns and cities.  I realise this does not sit well with some of the Minister's ideas on water, and where the related control will lie.  However, we look forward to the arrival of this debate.  I will watch very carefully what is to happen on the ground in the local authorities, in what ways they will be changed and whether some towns will lose councillors.  It is very important.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">I do not know whether that was a comment or a question.  We will have to wait and see the proposals before we can comment.  I believe that is what the Deputy indicated.  I hope we will be able to get a fair measure of agreement on the need for reform, that more functions should be devolved from central to local government and that there should be greater operational efficiency in how we deliver the services.  There is now also an opportunity to provide a source of funding and it will be interesting to see how seriously councillors will take their responsibility when it comes to providing the necessary funds for the provision of services at local level.</p>

It would be reasonable, however, to expect to know if some of the changes are expected to be in place in time for the local elections.  That should not be a secret or require Cabinet commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">I refer to town councils.  Will there be changes at that level?  It is not an unreasonable question.and one should expect a reply.  The Minister has not exactly been silent on the matter.  It would be useful to hear some indication.</p>

            <p eId="para_747">One of the areas of concern for me is the loss of functions in local authorities.  That is an important issue.  I will wait to see what are the Minister's plans in that area.  There are plans for the Road Safety Authority to take over the issuing of driving licences, there are other issues of monitoring and there are questions over Irish Water and what will be taken out of the hands of local authorities.  These are significant issues.  Only recently, within Dublin City Council there was a ballot on the different sections that concern water and the outcome was very negative in regard to the Minister's plans.  I look forward to seeing and debating the proposals.  This goes against the way things should be, namely, that the local authority should handle these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">As Deputy Ellis knows - or perhaps he does not wish to know - there will be a very strong relationship between Irish Water and local government in respect of the knowledge and expertise in the operational delivery of water.  There has been engagement with the unions about this and it is the intention of Government to ensure there is more capital investment in water and waster water, bringing further employment and more opportunity for people to be gainfully employed in the provision of water and waste water services.  The Deputy will now be able to put people at ease, arising from that statement.  There will be a continued and very strong involvement of local government with Irish Water.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, administers the household charge system on a shared service-agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 22 June 2012, a total of 967,816 properties had been registered for the household charge.  This represents 60% of the total number of households liable.  A total of 17,607 declarations have been received where a waiver from payment of the household charge has been claimed.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge.  As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">The communication and advertising campaign is a matter for the LGMA and the county and city councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Following the 31 March payment deadline, national and local radio advertisements were undertaken to remind persons of their obligations under the household charge legislation.  In particular, this campaign was aimed at reminding householders that late payment penalties applied after 31 March and that unpaid household charges and late payment penalties remain as a charge against the property concerned and will have to be discharged in the event of the transfer or sale of the property.  In addition, local authorities also took local initiatives to remind persons of their obligations under the legislation.  Further local and national communications and advertising will be undertaken by the LGMA and local authorities as considered appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">A range of options is available for persons to pay the household charge.  An online system,<i>www.householdcharge.ie</i> , is in place in the LGMA to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit or debit card and more than 60% of those who have paid to date have chosen to do so online.  In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order and credit or debit card by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March, 2012.  This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_766"/>
            <p eId="para_767">A bureau is in place to administer the charge on a shared service basis.  As an incentive to pay the self-assessed charge, late payment fees and late payment interest apply and any amounts due and unpaid remain as a charge against the property concerned.  I am keeping the income generated from the household charge under constant review.  The local authorities will be in touch with people who have not paid to date in the very near future and they will receive letters in the coming weeks indicating the need to pay the charge and the penalties and fees involved.<i> </i>

            <p eId="para_768">Apart from the previously aired issues regarding the household charge, namely, that it is unfair and inequitable and we have had examples quoted of the millionaire having to pay the same amount as the unemployed person in negative equity, has the Minister any plans to take it to the next level where local authorities which collect the charge in their areas would administer and spend it in their areas?  The current position does not sit well with people whereby they pay the money and it goes into a central fund in Dublin.  On many occasions the Minister has equated the payment of the household charge to the running of parks and so on in local authority areas but people do not see it like that.  It is a local tax and is locally collected.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_769">I agree with Deputy Collins that ideally we would like to have money raised at local level ring-fenced at local level but at present the way the system works is that there is a equalisation dimension to the local government fund for particular countries that do not have the necessary number of houses.  We would have a very low level of service in some parts of the country, particularly in rural Ireland, if we did not have the equalisation measure.  Those on the east coast are subsidising the west cost in regard to the matters and that has always been the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">Ideally, and this will be part of a local government reform policy statement, I would like to see opportunities, much wider than exist now, for local authority councillors to be in a position to raise money locally in order to retain that money locally.  That will be a fundamental change from the current system where almost 80% of all the various moneys they get through various funds have less discretionary opportunities for councillors than we would like.  I agree with the principle of what Deputy said.</p>

            <p eId="para_771">I am opposed to the household charge, the way it is being administered and that it does not take account of people's wealth and those who are very wealthy in society.  How does the Minister propose to collect the charge from those who have not paid it?  He has said that 60% of householders have complied and 40% have not.  It is one thing to talk about going to court and placing the burden of this charge on people in terms of the value of the house.  Even if the number who comply increases, a large percentage of householders will still not be paying the charge.  Therefore, there will be a huge deficit in the money that is needed and that will have to be got from somewhere.  From where does the Minister propose to get it?</p>
            <p eId="para_772">Can he clarify that the waiver in respect of the charge for senior citizens will only be in place this year?  It is very deceptive to say to people that they will have a waiver in respect of the charge when it will only be in place for a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">The Minister has been reported in the newspapers, and I go by what they say, as having said that he will not take any money out of people's wage packets or otherwise in this respect.  I want the Minister to clarify that because sometimes one does not know if what one reads in the newspaper is the truth.</p>

Also it is important for local authorities to get in this money, otherwise they could face cuts in services towards the end of year if they do not have it.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">The Deputy will be aware that this is part of the EU-IMF agreement.  I do not have the luxury of doing anything other than getting in this money.  The Minister for Finance does not have any more money in the form of a Supplementary Estimate to give the necessary resources to local authorities.  It is in everybody's interest to pay into this fund in order to ensure that the services continue to be provided and that employment in local government continues.  I expect the Deputy supports the principle of expecting people to pay through property tax for services.  There is a flat charge basis this year, which the Deputy has said is not the right way to go, but it will be different next year and in future years when the Government decides what form a property tax will take. Everybody will realise that there will be a much fairer and progressive system.  I have always accepted that the flat charge was not ideal but we were obliged to implement it because of the obligations to which we signed up under the EU-IMF agreement.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_784">In July 2011, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by the Department and the local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the building regulations.  In broad terms the measures will involve the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings that will confirm that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met and that there has been a lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the building regulations.  We will have more efficient pooling of building control staff across the local authorities sector to ensure that we have more effective oversight.  We will have a standardised approach and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions and better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">Draft building control (amendment) regulations providing for mandatory certification and the lodgement of drawings were recently released for public consultation, which concluded on 24 May 2012.  Some 500 submissions have been received and are currently being reviewed by my Department with a view to having a final set of regulations providing for mandatory certification and the lodgement of drawings, which I will sign into law in the coming months.  The sooner I can do so the better.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">I am determined, now that the public consultation process is out of the way, to follow through with the planned reforms which I believe will be capable of delivering the level of compliance with building regulations, and the standard of quality buildings, that members of the public so rightly expect and deserve.  I want to thank the people who made submissions.  Some people, including people in the Deputy's constituency, have had unfortunate experience of the lack of building controls during the recent period.  In keeping with the standard procedures in regard to these matters, I have asked the Department to continue to engage closely with key stakeholders to ensure that the new regulations, when finalised, are clearly understood and can work well on a practical level for the benefit of the citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_787">I was one of the 500 people who made a submission on this for reasons the Minister will know well, the ongoing disaster in regard Priory Hall and the incredible situation in terms of pyrite infestation of homes, estimates of which range up to 60,000 housing units.  When I got the draft building control (amendment) regulations that the Minister sent us, on which we have had a discussion in the Dáil - I did not get to speak on it - I thought that this was a cop out.  Essentially the Minister has left the disastrous system of flawed self-regulation<i>in situ</i>.  I am sure he will agree with me that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  At each stage of the planning, design and completion process, such as articles 8 and  10, professionals who have worked for developers will essentially be responsible for sending in these compliance certificates.  In Spain, a country that has had a massive building boom similar to ourselves, when an house or an apartment was built no services are provided unless the local authorities inspectors pass the building in question.  That is my understanding of the position there.  Why did the Minister cop out on this in respect of these regulations?  We were expecting big things from him and that he would take a grip of this industry so that when it hopefully restarts in the next few years regulations should be introduced, in the way they should be, by the public sector, by local authorities and ultimately by his Department.  It should not be the case that developers and their minions, architects and all the rest should decide for us.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">On the consultation process, how may buyers of deficient homes, bearing in mind that a home is the biggest investment a person will make in his or her lifetime, did the Minister talk to before he came up with these very poor draft regulations?</p>

            <p eId="para_802">The EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland contains a commitment to introduce a property tax for 2012.  The programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  It was considered that in light of the complex issues involved, a property tax would take time to introduce, considering no database of properties exists.  In order to meet the requirements in the EU-IMF programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012 as an interim measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">By international standards, the revenue base of local authorities in Ireland is relatively narrow, with local authorities being disproportionately dependent on central government funding.  The introduction in 2009 of the non-principal private residence charge represented an important step change in how local government is financed and was the first dedicated new source of funding for local authorities in some years.  It did not, however, go far enough in addressing the imbalance in the sector's financing.  A more effective broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved by the household charge this year in the fullness of time by the full property tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">In February 2012, an independently-chaired inter-departmental expert group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation-based full property tax.

Is it intended that this money will be retained in the areas in which it is collected?

Does the Minister intend to move to the property tax next year, ahead of schedule, as some reports would seem to indicate or is it his intention to keep it for two years and then move to a property tax?  He refers to a new source of funding in respect of the non-principal private residence and the household charge but, obviously, that is not the case as the funds collected here were offset against a reduction in central taxation.  How does he view the property tax in that regard along with talk of having that income deducted from people's earnings?  How does this fit with the idea of it being a new source of taxation if it were to be deducted at source?</p>

This will be merged with consideration of what we will do with regard to individual properties when the property tax is introduced in 2013 to 2014, as required under the EU-IMF agreement.  The Government has to make a decision about how this charge will be levied and whether it will be based on the market value or site valuation.  These issues are outlined in the report which must be considered.  The Government has to make a decision and this will happen in the context of the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">The database is being developed and it will be of major assistance as it will provide for the first time a comprehensive register of properties in the State.

My Department issued Circular PSSP 1/10 to all planning authorities and to An Bord Pleanála on 5 January 2010, which sets out the arrangements to apply for the assessment of on-site wastewater disposal systems for new single houses in light of the EPA code of practice regarding such systems.</p>

The risk-based inspection system for domestic wastewater treatment systems will be implemented in accordance with the national inspection plan which is to be drawn up by the EPA.

This is proposed to be a measure for dealing with pollution but the key part of a wastewater treatment system is the secondary treatment area which in this case is the percolation area.  The Minister's Department has stated that many septic tanks in Ireland do not have an appropriate percolation area and that many areas are not suitable for percolation.  Instead of addressing those measures as a pollution issue, the Minister has come up with a bogus scheme to try to get people to sort out this problem for themselves.  It is ludicrous.  For example, an area such as Gweedore in County Donegal has about 3,000 houses and the Minister is suggesting that individual householders should sort out this issue and pay for it themselves.  Those people have been promised a proper treatment plant for decades which would deal with the problems of effluent and pollution.  That is the reason I am asking this question.  The standards, which the Minister is a little coy about, would reveal that he is not really dealing with the pollution issue at all.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">It is a difficult issue that dates back to 2009 when there was a proposal to have universal inspection of all septic tanks and to have the EPA code of practice of 2009 implemented.  We negotiated with the European Commission.  It brought us to court and that is the reason the European Court of Justice judgment was handed down.  The Commission needed a comprehensive register of septic tanks in the country and it wanted to ensure that what was there was working.  We had the benefit of the Cavan experience.  Cavan was excluded from the court judgment because it was satisfied with the by-laws that were introduced in Cavan in 2004.  There have been 3,000 inspections in Cavan and we know from the Cavan experience the type of problems that might arise, the extent of those problems and that the vast majority of those inspections passed.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The Gweedore sewerage treatment plant is part of the water investment programme for Donegal County Council and I am sure it will happen in due course.

            <p eId="para_822">It is environmentally unsustainable and probably economic madness to expect people who have septic tanks in relatively densely populated areas to deal with the problem themselves.  A best practice environmental solution would be to connect those people to the public sewer.

            <p eId="para_826">The Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 gives legislative recognition to rental accommodation availability agreements as a form of social housing support.  Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.  In recognition that RAS tenants may have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued by my Department recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support.  It is my understanding that the members of many authorities have now included a provision of this type in their allocation schemes and that such tenants are included on transfer waiting lists.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">RAS tenants obtain significant benefits through being in receipt of social housing support compared to remaining on rent supplement.  In the first instance, this allows such tenants to take up full-time employment following their move to RAS.  Second, it makes the housing needs of the tenants the responsibility of the housing authority, with the added security that this implies.  Finally, it ensures that tenants do not have to apply for social housing and be assessed under the new housing needs assessment criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_828">It is disappointing that since last April people who are on RAS have been removed from the housing lists.  Many of these housing placements are not permanent housing, but contracts with the local authorities.  Some of them can be for up to four years.  I recently encountered a person whose landlord indicated that he wished to sell the house.  The person was only a year into the four year contract.  Under the RAS scheme the landlord can do this once he intends to sell the property.  It is very poor to have people excluded from the housing lists.  It is massaging the figures.  I have not yet heard of any special arrangements by the local authorities in regard to letting some of the people on RAS remain on the local authority housing list.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further on that.  The message does not appear to be getting to the local authorities that in some cases people on RAS can remain on the housing list.  It is a massaging of the real figures on the housing list.  Certainly, I do not consider people to be housed under RAS, especially when a contract can be pulled at such short notice.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">Yes.  In the housing circular 28/211 of 4 May 2011, which dealt with the social housing allocation regulations, it was recommended that a special transfer pathway be provided from RAS to other forms of social housing.  This was to be included within the allocation scheme that each authority had to adopt under section 22 of the 2009 Act, which replaced the old scheme of letting priorities.  Both the Act and the regulations provide that local authorities should have a system whereby people on RAS can have a transfer pathway so they can move into the regular social housing system.  That is part of the legislation and the regulations so it should be implemented by the local authorities.</p>

With regard to rent supplement, people can be six, seven or eight years on rent supplement or RAS.  There must be a cut-off point at some stage so they can avail of local authority and social housing.  It is not right.

            <p eId="para_835">The memorandum of understanding with the EU, IMF and ECB commits Ireland to introducing water charges for households during the programming period.  However, no decision has been taken by the Government on the exact date for the introduction of water charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector, which have been up to 30% in some cases.  Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord Gáis Éireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.</p>

Would he not consider it an integral part of local government reform, if we are to have real and meaningful engagement at local authority level from public representatives, that when elected they be accountable to the electorate for the setting and raising of local charges?  We might get people being more responsible in regard to it.  This is another example of it.  Ultimately, the Minister is sucking the function away from the local authorities and putting it into a stand alone entity.

            <p eId="para_839">It is far from my intention to suck away the local authority involvement in terms of knowledge or expertise.  There will be service level agreements between Irish Water and local authorities.  They will continue to be involved in the provision of water and wastewater facilities and the operation and maintenance of them at local level, as they are now.  What I am taking away is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in setting up this new entity as a stand alone entity within the Bord Gáis group to allow more investment in water and wastewater services from the private sector become part of the public capital programme.  We do not have the money and will not have it over the next two years to do what we need to do to generate the necessary infrastructure in water and wastewater services for economic development and job creation.  We have to find the money elsewhere, and there is some interest in the private sector becoming involved.  It will be part of the public utility company we have agreed to establish.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">I am interested in Deputy Collins's view about the way water charges can be levied locally to meet the requirements at local level.  Every area is different in regard to the provision of water and wastewater.  We must have the regulation of those matters at central level but we also need the assets and liabilities of local authorities to be available to Irish Water in the water and wastewater area to attract private investment into the sector.  That is the best way in which we can do so at the moment.</p>

The problem in my area is getting serious in terms of the number of houses being boarded up which could be used for social housing.  That would provide revenue to the local authorities.  We would get value for money.  There is no doubt the local authorities need to get extra help from somewhere in terms of funding and it is not correct to say that Dublin City Council and other local authorities can raise the funding.

I am aware there are grants for the local authorities but the problem is we are in a crisis, they are getting back more properties and they are unable to get those back on stream.

Obviously, different local authorities choose to do different things.  The initial response to Deputy Flanagan's question was around maintenance of the outside of the estate, using community employment schemes etc.  I am not sure but that may be a way of addressing problems that we may not have thought of in some of the other local authorities.

            <p eId="para_863">In terms of the delivery of social housing, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency.</p>

I am inclined to agree with her about the time on the list issue because we have seen the mess that happened in Dublin City Council, particularly with single males or single females being left on the housing list almost indefinitely, and people with smaller families being subjected to the points system.  I know cases can be prioritised, be it on medical or welfare grounds, but that should remain if we examine the idea of time on record.  I believe Dublin City Council is changing the time on record; Fingal County Council uses that system.  I understand that may change at the end of this year but it is long overdue because some people have been on the housing list for 15 years.  That does not make sense, and they are going nowhere.  It is appalling.  The problem of homelessness is being addressed separately but at one time there were huge queues on the homeless list in a similar way.  I do not know whether this is a recommendation from the Minister of State to the local authorities.

This is one area we will consider.  It is always a matter of figuring out how to allocate priority and different local authorities have different ways of doing it.  This is certainly one area under consideration.  We must leave some flexibility to each local authority in terms of how they allocate housing, but guidance will be provided at national level.  We are looking at the issue and are very aware of the number of people in need of social housing and the economic downturn has contributed greatly to this need.  We must find ways of addressing the issue.  I referred to the voluntary sector and believe there is capacity there to raise funding in a way the State cannot.

            <p eId="para_867">There is too much emphasis being placed on the voluntary housing sector now, rather than on delivery of social housing by the local authorities.  The way we are going, we are building large conglomerates in terms of the voluntary housing groups and they will end up with huge portfolios.  I disagree with that approach.  Social housing should be dealt with by the local authorities.  We should not hand it over to voluntary housing groups all the time.  There is a case to be made for the voluntary housing groups, but all social housing delivery seems to be heading in that direction and I am concerned about that trend.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">Not all of it, but we want to use the voluntary groups because they can leverage funding that the State cannot.  If we had to provide 100% funding for every new social housing scheme, we would not have the money to address the need.  Therefore, we must see if we can leverage funding in other ways.  However, we also intend to regulate the voluntary groups and that is important.</p>

The most recent reviews of local electoral areas were carried out in 1998 and 2008.

            <p eId="para_879">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 31 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">Since the announcement in December 2011 that NAMA would commit to providing up to 2,000 units for social housing by the end of 2012, my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA have been working together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards achieving this target.  The units being advanced through NAMA will in general be provided through the Social Housing Leasing Initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">To date over 2,000 units have been examined with a view to determining their suitability for social housing.  Of the original number, 701 have been deemed unsuitable by housing authorities.  Housing authorities assess the suitability of these properties with regard to location, local demand, the nature of the accommodation and sustainable community principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">A further 372 have been withdrawn, usually by property owners, as circumstances have changed.  In some cases the properties concerned have been let on the open market or sold and are no longer available as vacant units.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">At present demand has been confirmed for nearly 1,200 available units and these are currently being processed.  It is important to note that while demand has been confirmed in respect of practically all residential developments proposed by NAMA, the requirement to provide for an appropriate mix of tenures and to avoid undue segregation in housing means that local authorities will only ever deem a certain proportion of units within individual developments suitable for social housing.  Discussion and negotiation has commenced in respect of these properties involving approved housing bodies, local authorities, the property owners, financial institutions, receivers and other relevant parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">Of these 1,200 properties, contracts are signed in respect of 58 units, 405 of these units are at various stages of the approval process and 719 are being appraised.  It is  expected that units will be tenanted in the second half of the year.  NAMA continues to work with a view to identifying additional units suitable for inclusion in the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_886">Earlier this year I announced an allocation of €27.5 million to support ongoing physical and social regeneration in Limerick. In accordance with the original Establishment Orders of 2007, the five-year term of office of the Limerick Regeneration Agencies is now ending with responsibility for the management and administration of the regeneration programme transferring to the new Limerick Office for Regeneration. The focus in 2012 is on transitioning from the planning, preparatory relocation and demolition works within estates to construction of new houses and apartments and the refurbishment of existing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">Some 33 housing units are nearing completion at Clíona Park. Contracts have been agreed and construction will shortly commence on 29 new housing units at Vises Court and a further 35 units of sheltered housing at Southill. It is intended to acquire 10 almost-completed units and 10 sites at Wallers Well. Planning permission is awaited in respect of around 80 new housing units at Lord Edward Street. Once planning approval is secured, it is intended to commence the tender process as quickly as possible with a view to having a contract in place by end 2012. Small infill developments are being progressed through the planning stages for new houses at a number of locations around Kings Island.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_889">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/ or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) administers the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March 2012.  This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">Under section 5(1) of the Act, the owner of a residential property, who on a liability date, is liable to pay a household charge to a relevant local authority, or who is entitled to a waiver from payment of a household charge under section 4(4), must make and provide to the relevant local authority a declaration stating that he or she is so liable or so entitled, as the case may be.   Under section 5(2) of the Act, the declaration must, in the case of a person who is liable to pay a household charge, be accompanied by payment of the household charge in respect of the property concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">The Act further provides for offences where a person contravenes these statutory requirements.   In addition, late payment penalties apply where payment is not made by 31 March 2012 and household charges and late payment penalties are a charge against the property which will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">Section 12 of the Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities.  It is therefore a matter for each individual local authority to utilise the provisions of the legislation, including data sharing with the Electricity Supply Board, Private Residential Tenancies Board, Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, in the context of any undeclared properties that may be identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The legislation empowers local authorities to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under the Act and local authorities will pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings where it is considered appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_896">In advancing loans for house purchase by lower income borrowers it is of critical importance that local authorities make such funding available on the basis of sound lending criteria. My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the borrower can sustain the loan over the full term. Of equal importance, in view of recent developments in the domestic property market, is the imperative for a local authority to ensure that prudence and pragmatism are applied to all aspects of the management of its housing loans book. In a time of limited resources, deploying those resources in a focused and effective manner ensures the management of its loans portfolio can be achieved as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The current credit policy has been in effect since 2009. It was deemed appropriate at that time to update the elements associated with local authority lending and to have a homogenous regime in place that ensured best practice was followed across the sector. All applicants are now assessed according to the same criteria, and their applications subjected to the same independent scrutiny. It is desirable to make adequate lending provision available to local authority tenants who wish to avail of the tenant purchase schemes, while also adhering to prudent lending practices, and the current guidelines achieve equitable consideration of all applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">While it is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased it is also clear that the loans issued since the introduction of the revised credit policy are more likely to be fully performing. I am happy that the current mortgage loan model is fair, adequately meets the needs of prospective borrowers, and facilitates participation in housing acquisition initiatives such as the tenant purchase schemes.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_905">I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, 26, 35, 41 and 50 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from €1.535 billion in 2008 to just over €333.7m for 2012, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">Projected levels of activity in 2013 will be subject to the financial provision for housing, which will be determined in the context of the 2013 Estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p>
            <p eId="para_910">Some of the units provided under the leasing scheme will the sourced from NAMA.  Given the number of variables involved it is not possible at this stage to provide a reliable estimate of the number of units that will be fully transferred to social use by the end of 2012.  To date over 2,000 units have been examined with a view to determining their suitability for social housing.  Discussion and negotiation has commenced in respect of nearly 700 properties involving approved housing bodies, local authorities, the property owners, financial institutions, receivers and other relevant parties.  Of these 700 properties, contracts are signed in respect of 58 units and it is envisaged that these will be delivered later in the summer.  386 of these units are at various stages of the approval process and 254 are being appraised</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The relevant sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 dealing with social housing support and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, were commenced on 1 April 2011.  These set out the standard procedures for assessing applicants for social housing in every authority.  The implementation of these Regulations is currently under review by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">My Department does not hold information on the number of households on local authorities' waiting lists at any given time. This number inevitably continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department's website —<i>www.environ.ie</i> or on the Housing Agency’s website at <i>www.housing.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_922">In accordance with the provisions of the Waste Management Acts, the preparation and adoption of a waste management plan, including in respect of infrastructure provision, is the statutory responsibility of the local authority or authorities concerned, and under section 60(3) of the Act the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">I understand that the parties to the contract in respect of the Poolbeg facility are in a period of review.  As the project is being advanced by Dublin City Council, acting on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, questions concerning its status, and any issues relating to contractual matters, should be directed to the City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">Regardless of estimates of remaining landfill capacity, the Waste Framework Directive and a sustainable approach to the management of waste require that Ireland must end its overdependence on landfill. That process of infrastructural diversification must be guided by adherence to the waste hierarchy.  Accordingly, I have no plans to seek any derogation in respect of the compliance requirements of the Landfill Directive; I intend that Ireland should meet its obligations under the Directive, with the deployment of appropriate policies and measures, such as the landfill levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">The Programme for Government   commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_927">The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.   Following further evaluation, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, and these skills will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">Work is now focused on the finalisation of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail. The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, BGE and NewERA.  This strategy will provide the platform for dealing with a broad range of implementation issues during the transitional phase, including dealing with matters which cross the boundaries between Irish Water functions in relation to water services and those functions which will remain the responsibility of local authorities or other State bodies which impact on the water environment.  It is also envisaged that service level agreements will be put in place between Irish Water and local authorities to ensure continuity of service in relation to operations until 2017 at the earliest.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The implementation strategy will, therefore, provide a mechanism for clarifying in due course issues such as the use for recreational purposes of reservoirs which will become the responsibility of Irish Water in the future.  While Irish Water's primary purpose will be to ensure security of supply and compliance of drinking water with relevant standards, there are often synergies between these roles and opportunities to provide amenities for local and tourist use.  I expect that these issues and the experience of local authorities will be taken into consideration in the relation to future operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_938">In April 2012, I announced the provision of €2,150,000 in grant funding in 2012, to assist local authorities in their efforts to tackle the problem of litter through awareness raising, enforcement and the maintenance of key tourist areas across the country. €900,000 was made available under the Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme, €750,000 under a new Litter Enforcement Grant Scheme, and a further €500,000 under the Tourist Season Anti-Litter Grant Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The grants to local authorities under the Awareness Grant Scheme cover a broad range of measures to raise public awareness and promote anti-litter and anti-graffiti activity at local level. There is a particular focus on involving schools, young people and voluntary initiatives by community groups.  The new Litter Enforcement Grant Scheme is intended to support the enforcement activities of local authorities through measures such as the deployment of mobile CCTV equipment to catch fly tippers and illegal dumpers.  The €500,000 provided under the Tourist Season Scheme is intended to encourage local authorities to ensure that key tourist attractions are well presented during the peak summer season.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">My Department also continues to provide support to a number of other anti-litter initiatives, including the Tidy Towns Competition, in which there are two new Special Awards of particular interest this year — the Fáilte Ireland Tidy Tourism Town Award of €10,000 and the Gum Litter Task Force Award of €5,000.  Other initiatives of relevance include the National Spring Clean, the Irish Business against Litter (IBAL) Litter League, the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) project and the Green Schools Programme.  In addition, I will shortly be launching a national anti-litter awareness campaign targeting fly tipping and small scale illegal dumping.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Funding arrangements in respect of these grant schemes and anti-litter initiatives for 2013 have yet to be finalised, but will be considered in the context of available resources and the performance of existing schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">In addition, Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013, which is currently being implemented on my Department's behalf by 35 Local Action Groups, aims to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy. Over €300m in funding will be available through my Department for the delivery of the Programme over the current programming period. In the context of support for rural communities, funding can be provided for the upgrade, maintenance and development of community areas and amenities in eligible towns and villages.  A large number of Tidy-Towns initiatives have already received funding from the LEADER elements of the RDP since it commenced in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_946">My Department recently commenced collating data in respect of local authority mortgage arrears. Data to end December 2011 indicate that 6,363 of all local authority mortgages (including those drawn down for the purposes of purchasing houses under the various affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership and tenant purchase) are in arrears of more than 90 days. This represents 28% of the total number of loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Under the Shared Ownership scheme the rent charged on the local authority's equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority's share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">Local authority mortgage holders — including those who purchased under shared ownership — also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which generally run at around 0.5% lower than the best rates available in the market and currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market. This is a very substantial differential.  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_979">I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 to 55, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">I have already made clear on a number of occasions, including in this House, my own deep concern and that of the Irish Government and people regarding the general human rights situation in Bahrain.  As I have advised the House previously, it is my view that civilians should never be tried in military courts. In the course of the recent Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain by the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland recommended that all decisions of the National Security Courts should be subject to review in ordinary courts, and that laws should be enacted that would prohibit civilians being tried in military courts in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">My concerns about individual human rights cases have been formally communicated to the Bahraini authorities through diplomatic channels on numerous occasions.   In relation to the cases of the medics, and as I made clear in a statement issued on 15 June, I regard it as a welcome development that nine doctors were acquitted and that a further five had their sentences reduced to terms already served.  However, I am very concerned that prison sentences have been imposed on four doctors, including two Irish-trained doctors, arising from events at the Salmaniya Medical Complex in March 2011.  I have urged the Bahraini authorities to extend clemency in relation to the cases of these four doctors, given the great concerns and doubts which have surrounded their case from the start and in the wider interests of promoting urgently needed reconciliation within Bahrain<i>.  </i>Officials in my Department have received assurances from the Bahraini Ambassador in London that these doctors will not be re-arrested pending any appeal they may make to the Court of Cassation.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">I am also following closely the case of the leaders of the Bahrain Teachers Association, whose hearing has been postponed until 8 July.  This case has also been raised directly with the Bahraini Ambassador in London.  I believe that charges arising from the exercise of such basic rights as freedom of expression or association should be dropped against defendants if there is credible evidence suggesting mistreatment or torture in custody, as in the case of Mahdi Abu Deeb.  The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has not received any response to his request for information concerning allegations of Mr Deeb's torture in custody.  I would urge the Bahraini authorities to continue their engagement with the Special Rapporteur on Torture and to implement swiftly the recommendations made by the Bahraini Independent Commission of Inquiry in its report last November, particularly the call for effective investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">I am aware of, and commend, the work that the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti Violence Organisation is endeavouring to undertake in providing treatment and counselling for the victims of torture. Officials in my Department met with Dr Nada Dhaif, Chairwoman of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti Violence Organisation, during her recent visit to Ireland.  Ireland will continue to encourage Bahrain and all countries in the region to ease restrictions on civil society, as promotion of the role of civil society is fundamental to achieving greater respect for human rights across the region.  At Bahrain's Universal Periodic Review in May, Ireland recommended that Bahrain amend any articles of its Penal Code that can be used to prosecute individuals for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or association, and that it bring its law in line with international standards established by the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">I believe the Bahraini Government should adopt a more positive approach in allowing full access to observers from international human rights organisations who wish to visit Bahrain.  However, the key to genuine human rights reform lies with Bahrainis themselves, who should be facilitated in their efforts to develop national human rights organisations which can seek to hold the Government accountable.  I again urge swift action to implement in full the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry.  The Commission made a number of recommendations that would ensure better protection for human rights in Bahrain.  The early implementation of these recommendations would help re-build trust between the two communities in Bahrain as part of a process of national reconciliation.  I also share the concerns expressed by human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch about the inappropriate use of tear gas resulting in the deaths of protestors. This also underlines the requirement for follow-up to the report of Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry, particularly the need for an extensive programme of public order training for the public security forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The only viable path forward for Bahrain is reconciliation and dialogue.   A way must be found to chart a new and inclusive future for Bahrain.   I urge the Bahraini authorities and the opposition to engage genuinely and meaningfully in a national reconciliation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended (the Act).  Section 6A of the Act provides that persons born in the State on or after 1 January, 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or a British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for a passport) only where the parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three of the four years preceding their birth.  The person in question was born in the State on 27 October, 2005.  At the time of this person's birth, her mother was a Dutch national. Section 6B(2) of the Act makes particular provision for parents from EU Member States whereby such nationals may make a declaration in a prescribed form concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years immediately preceding the birth of their children. This declaration is supported by the submission of the parent's EU passport and by documentary evidence of that parent's residence in Ireland.  That parent will then be regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of  section 6A of the Act, unless the contrary is proved.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The person in question was issued a passport in January, 2007.  However, the Passport Service subsequently had cause to review the application for the issued passport and determined that the period of the mother's residence in Ireland was insufficient to entitle her daughter to Irish citizenship.  Therefore, as the person concerned was not an Irish citizen, the mother was informed that the issue of a passport to her daughter was an error.  In a replying letter from the mother's solicitor, dated 20 June, 2007, the Passport Service was advised that the mother had accepted that she did not have the required residence under the Act to demonstrate her daughter's entitlement to Irish citizenship.  The Department replied on 22 June, 2007 and advised that as the child was not an Irish citizen, the issued passport would be revoked and invalidated.  This was done on 24 July, 2007.  A request to return the passport went unheeded until a further passport application on behalf of the person concerned was received recently by the Passport Service.  The revoked passport was included with the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">The current application provides no evidence that would demonstrate a change in regard to the entitlement of the person concerned to Irish citizenship.  Accordingly, the Passport Service wrote to the parents on 15 June, 2012 indicating its intention to refuse a passport to their daughter under the terms of the Passports Act, 2008 and the grounds for this decision.  They have been given a date of 16 July, 2012 to submit additional information in regard to this proposed decision. To date no reply has been received directly from them in this matter.  If no reply is received by the deadline, the applicant will be refused a passport and her application will be cancelled.</p>

            <p eId="para_1035">The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the sick leave regulations and procedures that apply to civil servants.  The Deputy will also be aware that, under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 ("Croke Park Agreement"), the civil service is committed to achieving a substantial reduction in sick leave absences.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has adopted a proactive approach in this area, including through the following: sick leave and patterns of absence are routinely monitored; individual cases are regularly referred to the Chief Medical Officer for advice; uncertified sick leave limits are strictly adhered to: staff receive written warnings on each occasion where they have taken 5, 6 and 7 days uncertified sick leave in any calendar year and pay is deducted in respect of any uncertified sick leave above 7 days per annum; salary is reduced to 50% where cumulative sick leave absences exceed six months in any a calendar year; salary is discontinued, or paid at pension rate, where sick leave absences exceed twelve months in any period of four years; salary increments are delayed or withheld in full where staff have taken excessive sick leave; sick leave is taken into account in promotion competitions and in the selection of staff for posting abroad; return to work forms are required to be completed by the supervisor and counter-signed by the staff member in respect of all absences due to illness; supervisors are required to hold sick leave review meetings with staff in cases where sick leave is a regular occurrence; subsidised vaccinations against the flu virus are made available to headquarters staff every autumn and; subsidised general medical check-ups are offered to headquarters staff every second year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">Details of the sick leave taken by staff of my Department during 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 are set out in the following table.  As no additional staff were employed specifically to cover sick absences there was no actual extra cost involved.  However, based on a formula provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the notional cost is also indicated.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1053">The Public Service Agreement, 2010-2014 (the "Croke Park" Agreement) provides a framework for public service management and staff to work together to reduce the cost of delivery of public services while also maintaining or improving the quality of those services.  An Implementation Body was established to drive the implementation of the Agreement across all sectors and ensure that early, robust and verifiable reforms were secured that would in turn lead to verifiable and sustainable savings in the cost of public service delivery.  My Department's initial Action Plan under the Croke Park Agreement was submitted to the Implementation Body in October 2010, followed by a second iteration in early January 2011.  The initiatives in the Action Plan, which build on-going reforms in the Department's business processes, are kept under continuous review and have yielded significant savings in the administrative costs of running the Department.  These reforms are contributing to the effort to meet the challenge of maintaining the range, quality and geographic scope of the policy, programme management, promotional and frontline citizen services provided by the Department with the reduced resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">The Department regularly reports to the Implementation Body, most recently in early May, on progress being made in implementing the actions specified in our Action Plan as well as on savings being achieved.  These progress and savings reports are published on the Department's and the Implementation Body's websites.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Government recently noted the contents of the Implementation Body's second annual progress report, for Quarter One 2011 to Quarter One 2012, the key conclusions of which included:</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">that, during the period in question exchequer pay bill savings of €650m were achieved, driven by a reduction of 11,530 in staff numbers;</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">that the parties to the Agreement had continued to meet their commitments in terms of facilitating further reductions in staff numbers and in the cost of delivering public services as well as staff redeployments across functional boundaries and reconfiguration of organisations and services; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">that industrial peace had been maintained across the public service. Within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, substantial and ongoing savings have been achieved inter alia through overall staffing reductions of approximately 12%, Mission closures in the Holy See, Tehran and Dili, re-grading or suppression of diplomatic posts in various other Missions, negotiated rent reductions, cutbacks in premium overtime payments and increased use of video conferencing technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">My Department is fully cognisant of the extremely difficult economic and budgetary circumstances facing the State and of the need to introduce further reforms and achieve further savings. Under my direction, it remains fully committed to ensuring that its responsibilities are fulfilled and that the frontline services it provides to the public are delivered as cost-effectively as possible.

            <p eId="para_1060">The position is that a person can make a claim for Incapacitated Child Tax Credit in accordance with Section 465 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The Revenue Commissioners have published an information leaflet, IT18 that outlines the criteria for entitlement to the credit. This information leaflet is available on<i>www.revenue.ie</i>.   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an application for the credit has been received from the person concerned. However, some additional information is required to establish if the person in question has an entitlement to the credit. The Revenue Commissioners have written to the person concerned in this regard and, once the information is supplied, a decision will be made on the claim without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">Should the Revenue Commissioners consider that the application does not meet the conditions in accordance with Section 465 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 then the person in question may appeal the decision to the Appeal Commissioner.  This is done by giving notice in writing to the person's local Inspector of Taxes within 30 days of the date of the determination by Revenue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1063">VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The VAT Directive provides that the supply of goods and services by taxable persons is subject to VAT at rates specified in the VAT Directive.  Member States must apply a standard VAT rate of between 15% and 25% to the majority of economic activity.  In Ireland the standard rate is 23%, and under the VAT Directive any reduction in this rate would necessarily apply to all activity at that rate.  It is also possible for Member States to apply up to two reduced rates of between 5% and 15% on goods and services as specified in the VAT Directive.  Ireland applies two such reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%, however most of the activity at the 13.5% rate applies under a derogation of the VAT Directive that states they must apply at a rate of 12% or more.  While it is possible within these rules to reduce the VAT rates for periods of low consumption, such a move would be very costly to the Exchequer and impractical from an administrative point of view.</p>

The Central bank has advised me that they have been in contact with Ulster Bank at the highest level to press the bank to resolve the situation as quickly as possible and ensure that customers are treated fairly.  The Central Bank's concern is to ensure that all customers are supported and accommodated by the Bank until the system is fully operational again and the Bank has made this clear at a meeting with Ulster Bank senior management.  They have emphasised the importance of clear communication and support to consumers.  Ulster Bank reiterated its commitment to ensuring access to funds for customers through its branch network and where a customer is in hardship or requires funds they should contact Ulster Bank via the branch network or call centers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">The Central Bank has also advised me that Ulster Bank has committed to ensuring that no customer will be at a financial loss and will provide up-to-date and clear information to customers.  However the current focus is to get all transactions processed and following that they will commence the process of refunding customers for any interest or fees and charges that have occurred as a result of this incident.  Ulster Bank has also confirmed that it will work with the Irish Credit Bureau to ensure that customer ratings are not impacted.  Both the Bank and my officials are getting regular status updates and are closely monitoring the situation to ensure that the situation is resolved as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1072">S.I. No. 395 of 1992 requires every credit institution to have robust governance arrangements taking into account the technical criteria set out in Annex V to the Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 2006/48/EC).  Under Annex V, credit institutions are required to adopt policies and processes to evaluate and manage exposures to operational risk, including low-frequency high-severity events.  Contingency and business continuity plans are required to be put in place to ensure a credit institution's ability to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption.  The supervision of banks with regard to compliance with these requirements is a matter for the Central Bank.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 provides for further powers for the Central Bank to require procedures for identifying, monitoring, reporting on and managing risks as well as the procedures, systems and checks to be adopted for banks to meet their obligations to consumers.</p>

Ireland opposes enhanced co-operation in tax matters and will not be one of the enhanced co-operation countries.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1076">I am advised by NAMA that for a debtor to avail of bankruptcy in any given jurisdiction he/she must first of all establish that jurisdiction as his/her centre of main interest (COMI). The establishment of COMI is a matter for the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which bankruptcy is sought.  NAMA further advises that in its position as a secured creditor it is generally neutral on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings as long as location does not prejudice the Agency's potential recoveries from the bankruptee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">I am also advised by NAMA that the comparatively shorter duration of bankruptcy in the UK is not a consideration for NAMA as the bankrupt's assets remain in the control of the bankruptcy trustee long after the bankrupt may have been discharged from bankruptcy and any failure to make full disclosure may result in the period of bankruptcy being extended, in the case of the UK beyond the initial one year period.  NAMA advises that it is currently challenging the release from bankruptcy in Northern Ireland of one debtor, due to non-cooperation with the bankruptcy trustee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">NAMA advises that its position on the locus of bankruptcy proceedings is partially based on positive on-going engagement with several trustees in bankruptcy of NAMA debtors who have been adjudged bankrupt in the UK. The Agency points out that the bankruptcy regime in the UK is well established, sophisticated and that trustees in bankruptcy under the UK system possess extensive powers to compel production of legal and banking information, on a cross-border basis, from the bankrupt. These powers have been used in bankruptcy cases involving NAMA debtors to uncover significant undeclared assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The position of unsecured creditors is fundamentally different. Unsecured creditors, whose claims are subordinate to that of secured creditors, may seek to bolster their position by pursuing bankruptcy proceedings against a debtor.  It is worth noting that bankruptcy proceedings are rarely brought by secured creditors and usually in cases of non or lack of full disclosure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">As the Deputy is aware four senior, unsecured and unguaranteed bonds with a total value of €1.1bn fall due for redemption by IBRC this week. This senior debt, unsecured as it is, is an obligation of the bank and the bank will redeem the bonds as they fall due. Following the redemption of the four bonds this week IBRC will have approximately €160m in unsecured, unguaranteed bonds which are due to be redeemed between now and 2018.  The Government has always set out that we would like to see burden sharing on unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank. However, it has been clearly stated that Ireland would not act unilaterally and we would proceed only with the agreement of the European Central Bank and our EU partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">I set out in Committee last week that the Government has raised this issue with the ECB upon entering Government and I also had a formal meeting with former ECB President Trichet and Commissioner Rehn on 17th September last year to discuss this specific issue. Our European partners have expressed strong reservations about burden sharing for senior bond holders. The position of the ECB and Europe at political level has hardened since March 2011 and when private sector involvement (PSI) was agreed for Greece, the communiqué from the Heads of State and Government which accompanied the agreement stated Greece was unique and that PSI would not apply anywhere else.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The value of the support that we are receiving from our European partners now and in the future outweighs any short term gain from imposing burden sharing on senior bonds in the face of European opposition to such a move. You will also appreciate that there are serious implications for the bank and the State in the event that the bank defaults on repayment of debt.  That said however, we still have unfinished business with our partners to find the most cost effective way of resolving IBRC over the long term. The Government's aim is to ensure that the overall cost of resolving IBRC and the costs of resolving the difficulties in the banking sector generally are kept to a minimum. It is also essential that we break the negative feedback loop between banking debt and the sovereign and I will continue to pursue this approach.</p>

The information relating to the breakdown of employees by Revenue tax regions is based on income returns contained in Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing approximately 93% of all returns expected. These are lower than the total figures provided in the earlier part of this reply because the latter, in accordance with normal practice, are grossed-up at aggregate level to adjust for the perceived level of incompleteness.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">The management of sick leave is taken most seriously in my Department, and the procedures in place, and entitlements to sick leave (including the applicable limits), are as set out in my Department's Circular 09/2010 — Management of Sick Leave.   Sick leave absences and any patterns emerging are monitored and analysed through my Department's Human Resources Management System (HRMS), using standardised reporting tools that are utilised across the entire civil service.  As per the guidelines in Circular 09/2010, local managers are supported by Human Resources (HR) to hold regular sick leave review meetings with staff as required, as well as resumption of work meetings with staff following longer-term sick absence(s).  All long-term sick leave cases, i.e. absences greater than four weeks, are automatically referred to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for advice on how to proceed with the management of these cases.  The services of the newly re-organised Employee Assistance Service are also available to all staff of my Department to assist them with any medical (or related issues) for which they may require support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">Reports on the financial cost of sick leave are run bi-annually from my Department's HRMS, and in 2011, there were 2,030 sick days recorded, at a cost of  €362,701.  The relevant information for the first half of 2012 will be available shortly, and these figures will be forwarded directly to the Deputy by my Department, as soon as they are to hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_1155">This matter has been raised on a number of occasions.   The considered response of my Department and the State Examinations Commission is that this proposal would lead to an unsound educational experience for students.  The Ordinary Level syllabus and Higher Level syllabus are both designed to be covered over a two year period.   It would be a considerable challenge to encourage those who followed an Ordinary Level syllabus in the first year of the cycle to take Higher Level in the second year.   There is a strong risk they would not take Mathematics at all in the second year.  By the time these students reach further studies, they could have had an entire year without any Mathematics at all and would therefore be in a worse position than they had been a year earlier.</p>

            <p eId="para_1167">As the Deputy will be aware the government has taken a number of decisions relating to the appointment of members to State Boards.  One such decision is that individuals who are being proposed for appointment as chairpersons of State boards will be required to make themselves available to the relevant Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach they will take as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question.  My Department has provided the names of recently appointed chairpersons to the Joint Committee on Social Protection and Education in this respect.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1223">I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">NEPS in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">I have made enquiries in regard to the pupil mentioned in your question and can confirm that the School Principal is aware of the students situation, as is the NEPS psychologist assigned to the school. The child benefits currently from learning support provided in the school and has been and is the subject of an assessment of need under the Disability Act. I understand also that further action is being pursued with local HSE services in this regard and following resolution of these demands the question of the relevance or appropriateness of an educational psychological assessment can be consider by the school in conjunction with the parents and assigned NEPS psychologist.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">Should the parents of the child have any questions or concerns in this regard I would advise that they raise them with the School Principal in the first instance.  Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the assigned NEPS psychologist or relevant local NEPS Regional Director (in this instance NEPS Mullingar Office  Tel: 044-9337023) to discuss the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1232">All schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on<i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1274">Over the last number of years my Department has introduced various measures to both monitor and manage sick leave. Since 2010 when an officer returns to work from a period of sick leave a return to work form must be completed by their immediate line manager and where necessary a return to work meeting is held. These forms are returned to Personnel Section and held on the individuals personnel file. Personnel Section closely monitors the forms being returned and if a pattern persists further action is taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_1277">Absences of more than two days must be accompanied by a medical certificate and where appropriate the relevant Department of Social Protection certificates;</p>

            <p eId="para_1283">The Department of Finance circular 25/78 governs the conditions that apply to sick leave for officials within the Civil Service. Under these conditions an official can at most take 7 uncertified sick days with pay within a 12 month period. However, my Department has a policy that in the event an official incurs 5 days uncertified, that a letter issues to the person concerned and reminds them of the conditions governing sick leave and the implications it can have in relation to the award of salary increments and promotion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Since 2010, my Department makes a biannual sick leave return to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform outlining the sick leave taken by staff in the Department and the cost of same. The two returns for 2011 follow. However, the return for the six months to June 2012 has not yet been compiled. I will have the return forwarded to the Deputy once it is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1399">There is no direct link between the pay and duties of Special Advisers and that of members of the Oireachtas. Elected members of the Dáil are on a single rate of pay equivalent to the maximum point of the incremental scale applicable to the Principal Officer standard scale. The pay for Special Advisers is based on the Principal Officer standard scale of the civil service. This was deemed by the Government to be the appropriate pay level for Special Advisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">The Guidelines on the Staffing of Ministerial Offices recommend that appointment as Special Adviser be at the minimum of the scale (€80,051), but exceptions have been made where there has been evidence of higher earnings in the previous employment and where a business case was made to secure the appointment of an individual with particular skills and expertise. The Principal Officer standard scale is an incremental scale and the Guidelines provide that where a Special Adviser is placed on a salary point below the maximum of the scale he or she may be paid an annual increment until the maximum of that scale is reached.</p>

            <p eId="para_1403">Sick leave absences and any patterns emerging  are monitored and analysed through my Department's Human Resources Management System (HRMS), using standardised reporting tools that are utilised across the entire civil service. As per the guidelines in Circular 09/2010, local managers are supported by Human Resources (HR) to hold regular sick leave review meetings with staff as required as well as resumption of work meetings with staff following longer-term  sick absence(s). All long — term sick leave cases, i.e. absences greater than four weeks, are automatically referred to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for advice on how to proceed with the management of these cases. The services of the newly reorganised Employee Assistance Service are also available to all staff in my Department to assist them with any medical (or related issues) for which they may require support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">Reports on the financial cost of sick leave are run biannually from my Department's HRMS.

            <p eId="para_1417">Other salient developments in process include the intention to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, to establish a "one-stop-shop" for micro-enterprises through the dissolution of the existing City and County Enterprises Boards (CEB's) and the formation of Local Enterprise Offices (LEO's), the restructuring the State Airports and Shannon Development and the re-alignment of tourism and enterprise support functions in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1429">The application and treatment process under the Treatment Benefit scheme is as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">The customer, or the dentist/optician/audiologist on their behalf, contacts the Department to enquire about their entitlement to Treatment Benefit.  Once approval has been given, usually within 24 hours if the enquiry is by e-mail/fax or within minutes in the case of a phone enquiry, the customer is able to proceed with the treatment immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">When treatment is completed, the application form is sent to the Department for payment. Payments issue on a regular monthly basis to panellists, the dentist or optician.  Payment is not made to the customers themselves, unless in a very small number of cases were treatment is obtained outside the state.  Valid claims received by the Department in a calendar month are processed and paid during the following month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">In general the only cases that take longer to process are those for which further information is required, for example if customers has worked elsewhere in the EU and must have their employment contributions considered to allow them to qualify. However these represent a very small minority of cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_1831">As announced in February 2012 under the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government agreed to simplify and extend the Employer Job PRSI Incentive scheme for new recruitment to the end of 2012.  The duration of exemption, which previously applied for 12 months, has been increased to 18 months from 1 January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Under the scheme, if an employer employs an eligible employee who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, they are exempt from paying employers' PRSI for 18 months.  The job must be new and additional, be for at least 30 hours a week and last for at least six months.  Other changes introduced include, allowing time spent on the work placement programme and JobBridge (National Internship Scheme) to count towards the qualifying period for the scheme and allowing persons to undertake short FAS courses without impacting on their eligibility to qualify as an employee under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">The Employer Job PRSI Incentive scheme is administered centrally and it has been promoted extensively.  All the main employer bodies were contacted to ensure they were fully aware of the scheme and its enhancements in 2012, and to request that they ensure all their members are aware of it's existence and benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">The Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) Scheme is an administrative scheme and is not covered by legislation.  It was set up by Government decision in December 1986 and no recent changes have been made/announced in relation to it.  All relevant departmental staff are aware of the operational procedures of this scheme and it's eligibility criteria.  The PTJI is one of a number of schemes available to job seeking customers.  Such customers are advised of the availability of these schemes through information leaflets, direct contact with departmental staff and through the department's website<i>www.welfare.ie</i>.</p>

Qualification for the scheme is not based on the particular disability of the child but on the level of additional care required because of the disability.  An application for DCA in respect of a child with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome and all similar conditions is processed in exactly the same manner as an application for a child with any other disability.</p>

            <p eId="para_2053">The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 93,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2054">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  The general practice is that rent supplement is not paid where the rent is above the relevant limit.  However, rent supplement may be paid where the rent is above the relevant limit in the following circumstances:</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">Where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances (in particular, for example, a person with a disability in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons whose housing needs cannot be met within the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme etc.);</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">Where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.  "Sufficient income" in this context means the relevant basic supplementary welfare allowance rate less the prescribed minimum contribution to rent; and/or</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">Where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period.  For this purpose, a guideline period of no longer than 6 to 8 weeks is suggested but where there are exceptional circumstances, an extension up to a total of 12 weeks may be allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">The revised rent limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies and existing tenancies on review.  Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, Departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2064">Officers from my Department who are absent on sick leave are required to comply with civil service policies on the management of sick leave, as outlined in Department of Finance Circular 09/2010 and with the Department's Attendance Management Policy. Where a sick absence lasts more than two working days, a medical certificate must be submitted.  Repeated short term absences and sick leave absences of more than four weeks duration, which are regarded as long-term absences, are routinely referred by my Department's HR Division to the office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for review. The CMO will decide whether an appointment/confidential telephone consultation with the occupational health doctor or nurse is required, whether a confidential medical report from the treating doctor should be sought, or whether no further occupational health intervention is required due to a self-limiting medical condition.  Failure to comply with sick leave policies is regarded as serious misconduct which may warrant consideration of disciplinary action under the Civil Service Disciplinary Code.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">All officers are entitled to payment during sick leave absences in accordance with their terms and conditions of employment in the Civil Service.  Full pay during properly certified sick absence (provided there is no evidence of permanent disability for service) may be allowed up to a maximum of six months in one year and half pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of twelve months' sick leave in any period of four years or less.  Following on from this, payment can continue at a pension rate of pay, which is subject to the condition of a reasonable prospect of a resumption of duty, with an ability to render regular and effective service.  An Officer's level of sick leave is taken into account when consideration is being given to the award of an increment or when an officer is being considered for promotion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">The total working days available in my Department in 2011 were 1,138,631 of which 71,680 days (6.3%) were lost due to sick leave, at a cost of €9,169,057.  The most up to date figures for 2012, which are in respect of the period January to March 2012, show that there were 25,006 (6.8%) days lost due to sick leave absences from a total of 367,240 available working days, at a cost of €3,198,517.  The Deputy should note that the figures provided for 2011 include sick leave (for the final quarter) in respect of the approximately 1,100 additional staff integrated into my Department from the HSE with effect from the 1st October 2011.  Figures for 2012 include sick leave from these staff and also the additional 700 staff from FÁS who joined the Department with effect from 1st January 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2068">My Department's Action Plan, and those of the agencies under the aegis of my Department, namely the Citizens Information Board and the Pensions Board, were prepared in January 2010, having regard to the economic and budgetary environment at that time. My Department subsequently prepared a single integrated Action Plan in January 2012 which encompassed the actions to be taken forward by my Department as well as those key actions being proposed by each of the agencies under its remit and which took account of the Programme for Government, the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and Budget 2012 and the Public Service Reform Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">Three reviews of the implementation of the agreement, as requested by the Implementation Body, were undertaken by my Department and the agencies under its aegis, in respect of the progress and savings achieved for the periods January 2010 to March 2011, April 2011 to September 2011 and October 2011 to March 2012.  The following is a summary of the main outcomes identified in those exercises:</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">Organisational change and integration in my Department:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2071">Full transfer of 1,033 Community Welfare Staff on 1st   October 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_2074">Significant savings were achieved under the following initiatives:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2075">New administrative arrangements were introduced in 2011 for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme which had previously been administered by the Community Welfare Service. Administrative savings of approximately €1 million were achieved by having applications processed by a centralised unit in my Department's office in Letterkenny.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2076">Further savings of €2.43m were achieved by my Department, and the agencies under its aegis, between January 2010 and March 2012 through administrative efficiencies and process re-organisation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2077">Claim processing volumes increased by 13% in 2011 (2.35m claims cleared) while backlogs were reduced by 9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">Greater numbers of staff are being serviced by central support areas without proportional increases in staff numbers, following the transfers of functions outlined above. For example, the ratio of HR Management staff to overall staff has increased from 1:66 to 1:76 since 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">The Department now provides data matching services for up to 80 other agencies and, jointly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, provides life event notifications to over 50 agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">The phased introduction of the Public Services Card commenced October 3rd   2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Several new IT systems have been developed and implemented to cater for improved customer service with faster claim processing times, increased level of information provision and query handling processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The Department is committed to meeting the objectives of the Public Service Reform Plan published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 17th November 2011. A high level integrated reform delivery plan   has been developed, outlining the key Departmental milestones under the various reform programmes and containing a wide range of organisational specific reform commitments, as well as cross-cutting elements of reform. The integrated plan aligns key elements from the Programme for Government, the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">Full implementation of the Department's Action Plan requires major organisational change, involving changes in structures, business processes, administrative, operating and governance systems, practices and procedures, supported by significant human resource and ICT changes. All targets to the end of March 2012 have been met and all actions are on schedule for delivery in accordance with the specified timeframes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">The Citizens Information Board (CIB) has commenced a Single Point of Initial Telephone Contact project which aims to create a single point of telephone contact for the citizen for CIB and its delivery partners, namely the Citizens Information Services, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, and the National Advocacy Service.  CIB also implemented a new regional structure and introduced an advocacy service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The Pensions Board introduced a new on-line data portal for pension schemes which went live in February 2011. The system facilitates the payment of fees, processing of scheme amendments, scheme registrations, submission of annual scheme information returns and the annual renewal of Registered Administrators renewals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">I am satisfied that the Department is striving to provide an effective service to its customers in the most efficient manner that can reasonably be achieved and is fully committed to delivering on the Action Plan in order to secure service improvements and efficiencies.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2092">I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 to 138, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">In 1997, before the commencement of the designation process for Ireland's network of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), including its raised bog sites, my Department as then configured undertook an information campaign which involved issuing letters to some 230,000 rural households advising people in general terms of the forthcoming designation programme and where they could obtain further information of the proposed designations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">Subsequently, the Department issued some 1,457 letters and site specific information packs to individuals identified as being potentially affected by the proposed designations of those raised bog SACs nominated between 1997 and 1999, and a further 3,534 letters and site-packs to persons potentially affected by the  proposed designations in 2002 of the remaining raised bog sites. I am advised that these letters included maps of the sites, as well as details of restrictions to activities therein, compensation provisions and the manner in which an objection might be made to the proposed designation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">The Department has sourced its land-ownership information from a number of sources, including the Property Registration Authority, the Land Commission, the Land Parcel Identification System used by the Department of Agriculture, and the electoral register. It should be noted that the development of the Land Direct system by the Property Registration Authority in recent years has allowed much more comprehensive land-owner identification. This has improved the Department's ability to reach as many interested parties as possible.  While I understand that every reasonable step was taken over the years to identify landowners and notify them directly, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to guarantee that all such persons can be identified.  It is commonplace, particularly in bogs, that individuals' interests are not registered at all, or not in their own names. Turbary rights, in particular, are not always up to date or accurately reflect actual land use activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">I am advised that, to cater for this contingency, copies of maps of the proposed raised bog SACs and copies of the Government Notices relating to those sites were displayed in public access points such as Garda Síochána stations, local authority offices, local offices of the Department of Social Protection, local offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and offices of Teagasc located within or contiguous to the sites concerned.  Proposals to designate the raised bog sites as SACs were also advertised in the appropriate local newspapers and radio advertisements were also run on local stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">A free-phone number was also operated to facilitate the dissemination of information to those who had been alerted through these publicity measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">In total, some 610 individual objections were received in my Department against the inclusion of land within raised bog SAC sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">In 2011 my Department issued letters to some 6,700 landowners and users advising them of the cessation of turf cutting on the 53 raised bog sites and of the availability of a range of compensatory measures available. Some 4,000 of these had also been written to in 2010 advising them of the cessation of cutting on 31 raised bog SACs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">My Department is currently focused on making initial payments to turf cutters under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme and organising for the delivery of turf to their homes. In this regard, my officials are continuing to work closely with turf cutters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as successor of the Land Commission, Bord na Móna and the Property Registration Authority to improve the Department's data sets and to assist people in providing the necessary proof of legal interest with their applications under the scheme.</p>

The Broadcasting Act 2009 requires RTÉ to provide digital coverage to the same extent as analogue coverage, which stands at 98%.

RTÉ has introduced SAORSAT to provide a free to air TV service to the 2% of the population who cannot receive SAORVIEW.  With the launch of SAORSAT, Ireland has 100% coverage of RTÉ and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State and everyone can chose to migrate to a free to air Digital TV service either through SAORVIEW or SAORSAT.  In these circumstances there is no compulsion to acquire a pay TV option in order to access the free-to-air channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">Representatives from SAORVIEW attended the special digital switchover briefing session on June 21st for Oireachtas members.  At this briefing session practical and technical information on SAORSAT and SAORVIEW was provided.  According to SAORVIEW, equipment for both SAORVIEW and SAORSAT is readily available throughout Ireland.  SAORVIEW highlight that over 400 retailers nationwide stock SAORVIEW approved equipment.  SAORVIEW TV equipment costs from €50 whilst the SAORSAT set top box costs around €180.  More and cheaper SAORSAT equipment is anticipated including a SAORSAT TV set.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">While SAORVIEW provides the digital network, it is up to individual households to arrange for installation of the required equipment and SAORVIEW recommend households use the services of a local reputable installer.  Information on SAORSAT, approved SAORSAT equipment, technical specification and information on professional installation is also available on the SAORVIEW website,<i>www.saorview.ie</i> and also on the RTÉ Networks Limited (RTÉNL) website, <i>www.rtenl.ie</i>.  The SAORVIEW helpline is also available to assist people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">In relation to local information, I have been informed by SAORVIEW that they have organised a number of regional information events for the public and also for installers.  In addition, my Department has put in place an extensive and comprehensive national information campaign to ensure that everyone is fully aware of the move to digital TV.  I have also signed an agreement with national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme (Outreach Programme).  The aim of the Outreach Programme is to ensure vulnerable people receive one-to-one help in making the switch to digital and that everybody is made aware of the switchover so that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once the national analogue TV service switches off on October 24th 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2146">Last week, building on the June 2011 British Irish Council agreement on developing an all islands energy approach, I had the latest in a series of bilateral meetings with UK Energy Minister Charles Hendry on plans to develop renewable electricity trade between the two countries.  Both sides agreed to work towards concluding a Memorandum of Understanding by the end of the year. This will be a critical step in ensuring that cross-Border renewable trade can take place.  Officials from both Departments are examining a range of issues around the electricity market, regulatory and technical grid areas to underpin the creation of cross jurisdictional renewable electricity trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">Increased interconnection between the two islands offers Irish developers the prospect of being able to access a much larger electricity market.  The electricity market in GB is around ten times the scale of the electricity market in Ireland.  In the short term there are opportunities for on and off shore wind and biomass projects, but in the medium to longer term as technologies mature and become commercially deployable, there will also be opportunities for wave and tidal developers.  The volume of trade that could develop has the potential to become very significant over time.  Ireland has a renewable energy resource that is significantly in advance of this island's market scale.  The challenge for developers will be to come forward with projects of scale that are economically viable and environmentally acceptable.  There are several large developers already seriously examining projects and some of these proposals also involve developing pumped hydro storage options.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">There are clearly construction jobs while the projects are being built, but if projects of scale can be developed, then there will be an opportunity to capture some of the development value chain in Ireland as well as the job opportunities in the operations and maintenance areas.  Both Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are taking account of opportunities as part of their overall Cleantech market development and are actively engaged with companies in this promising economic sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2150">Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.  Bye-laws, Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 303, 2009 and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition On Issue Of Licences) Bye-law No. 858, 2009, were signed by the then Minister in 2009 prohibiting the capture of eels.  There was no provision for compensation for those who previously engaged in this fishery on a commercial basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland — IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context, I am sure you will appreciate that in the current economic climate there are no resources available to provide for compensation payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">The National EMP is currently being updated following the provision of three additional years of scientific research and monitoring of the status of eels stocks.  The latest independent Standing Scientific Committee report on eels is available on the IFI website and a link to this web page is also available on my Department's website.  IFI's three-year eel monitoring report is also available online.  Ireland's EMP Implementation report, which details progress on Ireland's 2009 EMP, is due to be submitted to the EU shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">In relation to the information contained in these reports and prior to consideration of the continuation of existing measures, a public consultation period has commenced.  The closing date for receipt of submissions to be considered as part of the review of eel plans for Ireland was set as Monday 2nd July 2012.  However, on foot of presentations made to stakeholders as part of the consultation, I have decided to extend the closing date to 11th July to facilitate the receipt of submissions from as many stakeholders as possible.  Submissions made during the public consultation period, which included a number of public meetings/seminars, will be considered in formulating proposals for the management of the eel fishery for the coming years.  Three public meetings on the EMPs have been held during the last week, in Clonmel, County Tipperary on 19th June, in Athlone, County Westmeath on 20th June and in Carrick on Shannon, County Leitrim on 21st June.  Copies of all relevant documents (EU Report, Scientific Report and Monitoring Report) were available at the public meetings and are also available on IFI's website (<i>www.fisheriesireland.ie</i>) or through the link on my Department’s website (<i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>).</p>

Following further consideration as to whether Irish Water should be established as a new entity or whether existing bodies in the semi-State sector could undertake the function, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent State-owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.  A detailed breakdown for the cost of establishing and running Irish Water is not at present available.  The Department is currently finalising the implementation strategy for the water sector reform process will focus on implementation and transformation issues and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2193">The move of water sector functions from local authorities to a semi-State company operating in a regulatory environment, and the new funding regime which will include the introduction of domestic water charges in due course is a major organisational change.  The setting of water charges, both domestic and non-domestic, will be a matter for the regulator within an overall policy and pricing framework which will be developed by the Government.  Irish Water will have the power to collect water charges which will provide an income stream to support third party funding through accessing funding on financial markets with a view to Irish Water becoming self funding over time.  The new funding model will also be influenced by ongoing capital requirements for investment; operational costs; efficiency gains arising from the new organisational form; levels of government funding; and the new utility's ability to access funds on financial markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">With regard to future funding requirements for Irish Water, this will be determined through engagement with the economic regulator on the level of charges, securing of operational efficiencies and the appropriate level of capital investment, and the extent to which Irish Water will be able to access financial markets to fund its investment programme.  The nature and duration of continuing Government funding will be determined as part of the budgetary and estimates process within this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_2202">I intend to bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks covering an extensive programme of local government reform and these will include proposals on enhanced alignment between local development and local government.  The latter will be based on the work undertaken by the high level Steering Group that I established to consider the best way forward regarding alignment of local government and local development.  The Group presented a broad range of recommendations with implications for both the local government and local development sectors and I have had the opportunity to consider these with a view to determining the future development structures and arrangements that will deliver the maximum benefit for communities and citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">Enhanced alignment of local government and local development will allow a better targeting of scarce resources, and better co-ordination of the activities of local government and local development, and will bring the resources of both sectors together in a constructive way to improve services to citizens.  This will be the key focus in the proposals I will shortly bring to Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">I understand that the Steering Group carried out extensive consultations with stakeholders during its deliberations, including local development companies, local authorities (elected representatives and city/county managers), Community and Voluntary Fora, Volunteer Centres and representative bodies for community and voluntary organisations.  Consultation will continue with these and other stakeholders as the Group's recommendations are being implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_2207">I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 166 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the €100 household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand from data provided by the LGMA that, as of 22 June 2012, a total number of 967,816 declarations have been made, equating to over €94.5 million.  Some 17,607 households had claimed a waiver.  It is estimated that some 1.6 million residential properties are liable for the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the household charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund.  This funding is provided to local authorities in general-purpose grants, making it possible for me to equalise distribution and ensuring that those local authorities with lower populations than others do not suffer unduly as a result.  General purpose grants are paid on a quarterly basis.  General Purpose Grants contribute to meeting the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants.  The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge.  General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are designed to bring about equalisation, over time, so that each authority will have sufficient resources, either from central grants or from its local income base, to provide a reasonable level of day to day services to its customers.  For the purposes of allocations, a range of factors is taken into account, including each local authority's expenditure on, and income from, its services, and the overall amount of funding available for distribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">The income generated from the household charge is kept under constant review.  However, it is up to individual local authorities to address any potential funding shortfalls arising from non-compliance with the legislation and to pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings, where it is considered appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2215">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislation underpinning the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  Section 1 of the Act provides a definition of "owner" for the purposes of the Act, which, in relation to a residential property, means—</p>

            <p eId="para_2221">A tenant holding a lease of less than 20 years' duration, whether in public or in private rented accommodation, is not an owner of the property in which he or she is living and is therefore not liable in respect of that property.  The charge is assessed on the basis of ownership of property, not on individuals personally.  The legislation governing tenancies generally is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

It is envisaged that some measures will not entail additional costs and I would highlight that some can actually lead to significant cost savings e.g. the use of eco-design, integrated pollution prevention and control, and green public procurement.  Other measures that entail initial costs in the short term can yield proportionately much greater cost savings over the longer term e.g. climate change adaptation measures.  In overall terms, however, where additional costs arise in regard to implementation, these will have to be met from within existing resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">The local government system is critical to the delivery of a wide range of important services that support sustainable development.  The implementation of the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group is critical in ensuring that resources are utilised efficiently in the discharge by local authorities of their functions, including those relating to sustainable development issues.  A policy statement on local government reform is also in preparation with the aim of making local government stronger and more coherent, efficient, effective and ultimately more responsive to the public.  The policy approach and recommendations in Our Sustainable Future   will be taken into account, where relevant, in finalising this statement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2246">Since 2001, local authorities have been responsible for the installation of water meters on supplies to non-domestic customers. Where properties had mixed commercial and domestic use, meters were installed and the customers were given an allowance for the domestic element of the water usage.  As the non-domestic metering programme was devolved to the local authorities my Department does not have information on the number of mixed commercial and domestic properties which have been metered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">The rural water programme, which is also devolved to the local authorities, funds,<i>inter alia,</i> the up-grading of group water supplies. In recent years, where some group supplies were being upgraded, meters were installed on all connections including households.  However, my Department does not have information on the number of households which have been metered in such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector. Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord Gáis Eireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2254">I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 169 and 171 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2255">Information on the number of households on local authority housing waiting lists or information in relation to the number of vacant houses available for social letting at any given time is not available in my Department.  The number of households on waiting lists continuously fluctuates according as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department's website<i>www.environ.ie</i> and on the Housing Agency’s website at <i>www.housing.ie</i>.  Local authorities provide information on the proportion of stock that is vacant at the end of each year and this information is collated and published as part of the annual Service Indicators in Local Authorities Report. Copies of the 2010 report are available from the Local Government Management Services Board and may be downloaded from their website (<i>www.lgmsb.ie</i>).</p>
            <p eId="para_2256">Under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock, including the regeneration of large social housing estates and flat complexes, estate wide remedial works schemes, a retrofitting measure to improve the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses and funding for extensions and adaptations to meet the needs of tenants with a disability etc.  Given the constraints on capital budgets for new stock, my Department has in recent years placed a greater emphasis on local authority social housing improvement works programmes and on the early return of vacant units to productive use.</p>
            <p eId="para_2257">A total of €18 million is being provided this year for improving the quality and energy efficiency of older housing stock. Beginning in 2011, my Department required local authorities to focus the energy retrofitting programme on bringing vacant stock back into productive use.  The 2012 programme will build on the achievements of 2011 when more than 2,600 vacant units were refurbished and made available for re-letting.  While local authorities may undertake work on tenanted properties, there is a continuing focus on making vacant properties available for re-letting as quickly as possible.  Grants of up to €15,000 per house are generally available for improving the fabric of the house with a further grant of up to €3,000 where additional essential works are needed.  Over the course of 2010 and 2011 a total of 4,492 houses were improved.  I intend to review the operation of the Social Housing Improvement Works Programme, including the energy efficiency measure, with a view to possible changes aimed at improving the targeting and overall effectiveness of the various measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2268">The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives.  The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over €800million in relation to water supply infrastructure.  This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">The development of the programme followed a comprehensive review of investment requirements initiated in 2009 involving an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services by each water services authority and taking account of reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality and an assessment by Forfás of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs.  There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure.   The Department is currently finalising work on the implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water.  This strategy will take account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition and that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_2274">My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013 places a high priority on water conservation.  Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.  In the year to end September 2011, some 200 kilometres of public water supply pipes were replaced or rehabilitated under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275">Since the national water conservation programme was implemented in 2003, over €208 million has been specifically invested in water conservation measures by my Department.  In addition, local authorities fund active leakage control, detection and repair from their own operational budgets.  Most of the effort to date has been focused on putting in place the water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation.  Most local authorities have now prepared watermains rehabilitation strategies, which set out the priority mains for replacement and repair and provide the platform for accelerated investment in this area over the coming years.  The primary objective of this programme of work is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted for water.</p>
            <p eId="para_2276">Over time, this investment coupled with ongoing active leakage control should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and improve service to customers.   Progress is monitored on an annual basis through the local authority service indicators and through the collection of data from local authorities.  The most recent published comparative figures for unaccounted for water in each county are set out in the report Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2010  which was published by the Local Government Management Services Board in December 2011, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_2277">The proposed water metering programme will complement the continuing programme of investment in water mains rehabilitation and replacement.  The installation of water meters will encourage households to conserve water, reduce consumption and will ensure that customer side leaks can be identified and fixed.  Metering will, therefore, achieve significant reductions in the volumes of water that are required to be produced and treated and will lead to savings in the operational costs of delivering water services and in deferred capital expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_2279">With regard to detection of air pollution, ambient air quality monitoring and assessment in Ireland is carried out in accordance with the requirements of Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, also known as the CAFE Directive.  The CAFE Directive consolidated and replaced the earlier Air Quality Framework Directive and the first three so-called "daughter" directives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">The CAFE Directive has been transposed into national legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011.  These regulations set limit values/target values for the following pollutants: Sulphur Dioxide; Nitrogen Dioxide and Oxides of Nitrogen; Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5); Lead; Benzene; Carbon Monoxide; and Ozone.  In addition, the Arsenic,Cadmium, Mercury, Nickel and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ambient Air Regulations 2009 transpose the fourth "daughter" Directive 2004/107/EC and specify target values and monitoring requirements for arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">The EPA publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report, Air Quality in Ireland 2010 — Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, published in September 2011.  This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2010 based on data from 28 monitoring stations.  The Report confirmed that air quality in Ireland is of a high standard and remains the best in Europe.  In 2010, measured values for the above mentioned pollutants were all below limit and target values set out in legislation.  However, levels of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide continue to remain of concern in some areas.  Trends over time and future outlook for individual pollutants are also noted in the Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">The EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute all monitor rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters plus groundwater quality under the Water Framework Directive on a three-year cycle.  This extensive monitoring programme provides a good overview of current water quality and trends as they develop.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">Water quality trends emerging in recent years include a notable decline in the incidence of serious pollution events from 39 sites in the 2004-2006 period, to 20 sites in the 2007-2009 period and currently down to 11 sites.  There has also been a stabilisation in the length of river channel regarded as unpolluted, at approximately 71% of the length surveyed.  However, the period has also been marked by a steady decline in the number of river sites at high ecological status.</p>

            <p eId="para_2290">The preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority — the city and county councils.  It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.  The publication of the draft register in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15th of February following allows for corrections to be made.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer. The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence.  Also, if a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration — for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address — the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.</p>

            <p eId="para_2294">The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 introduced a new approach to the sale of social housing whereby social housing tenants, including tenants of approved housing bodies, could acquire new local authority houses and existing apartments under the Incremental Purchase Scheme (IPS).  The details of this scheme are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2295">The IPS is intended to replace tenant purchase schemes provided for under Section 90 of Housing Act, 1966 (as amended).  The existing tenant purchase scheme, which has been in existence since 1995, is being wound down from the end of this year.  Arrangements for the termination of this scheme were communicated to housing authorities on 6th June, 2012 in Housing Circular 23/2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">It is my intention to replace the tenant purchase scheme with a new scheme based on the incremental purchase model for tenants of existing local authority housing.  Legislation is required to underpin the new model which it is hoped to introduce in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">While there is no provision at present for the purchase of individual houses by tenants in voluntary and co-operative housing schemes, my Department is currently in consultation with the voluntary housing sector regarding the development of an enabling regulatory framework that will support the expanded role for the sector, including options for purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">The IPS approach was evaluated as part of the preparatory work for the 2009 Act which showed that there were potential benefits to the State and to the local community in adopting the new approach.  While the sale of local authority dwellings does reduce the stock of social housing available for letting there are compensating social and economic benefits attaching to maintaining the option of selling dwellings to tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">The tenant purchase of local authority dwellings is also evaluated in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's thematic evaluation series paper entitled Social Housing Supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_2301">The Government's Housing Policy Statement, published in June 2011, identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing.  This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement.  However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options does present challenges for them.  As such, I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">I will develop this framework in consultation with the sector but I expect that it will:</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competences; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2307">The development of a regulatory framework will take time. In the meantime, I am engaging with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which, I would hope, most approved housing bodies will sign up to over time. This code, which I intend to circulate for wider consultation in the coming weeks, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the sector.  I expect that the code will set out,<i>inter alia,</i> key basic principles of good governance and financial management and will also set out the range of reporting obligations that currently apply to the sector.</p>

The constraints on the public capital programme will rule out a return to very large capital funded social housing construction programmes by local authorities in the medium term. Of the €390 million available under the SHIP for 2012, some €112 million is being provided for local authority social housing construction and acquisition programmes. A further €70 million is being provided for special needs housing provision by the voluntary housing sector under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). I intend to announce details shortly of a limited programme of investment in new social and voluntary housing under SHIP and CAS for the period to end 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_2317">The social housing capital budget has been reduced from €1.535 billion in 2008 to just over €333.7 million for 2012, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">Projected levels of activity in 2013 will be subject to the financial provision for housing, which will be determined in the context of the 2013 Estimates process.  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p>

            <p eId="para_2324">It is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981 to provide a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">Outside of the main cities which have full-time firefighters employed, fire services are provided by a retained staffing system.  Retained firefighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a full professional fire service for their communities.  They are equipped, supervised and operate to the same procedures as their full time colleagues.  At the end of December 2011, there were 2,077 retained firefighters employed by local authorities.  The retained services provide an excellent model of service delivery where, to a substantial degree, a contingent rather than a continuous capability is required.  I have no plans to change fundamentally what I regard as an excellent community service delivered by the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">There are very few voluntary fire service units countrywide.  Historically, Councils assisted these units through the provision of some equipment, training and funding.  However, Council responsibilities and liabilities under the health and safety at work legislation have seen some Councils withdraw from such support in recent years.  My Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has recently consulted with stakeholders in relation to its draft policy document Keeping Communities Safe, which sets the future directions for the Irish Fire Service.  The submissions received are currently being analysed.  The draft policy document sets out an integrated approach to efficient fire safety in Ireland through achieving an appropriate balance between prevention of fires, having appropriate fire protection facilities in place in buildings and through appropriate and effective fire brigade response.  It proposes guidance and standards for fire service delivery, underpinned by a risk categorisation approach, and examines service delivery structures.  When finalised, the policy document will be circulated to all fire authorities for appropriate implementation.

In 2011 prize money of €208,900 was disbursed to 235 winners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">My Department provides funding through the LA21 Environmental Partnership Fund to assist small scale, local, non-profit environmental projects aimed at increasing environmental awareness and developing sustainable communities. Community groups, including TidyTowns groups, can apply for funding for a variety of environmental projects.  Application for funding is made to the relevant local authority who matches the funding provided by my Department. A total of 517 projects were funded under the scheme in 2011.  My Department is providing funding of €337,000 for the scheme in 2012. An invitation to community groups to submit proposals for the 2012 scheme is currently open; submissions are to be returned to the relevant local authority by 11 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">In addition Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013, which is currently being implemented on my Department's behalf by 35 Local Action Groups, aims to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy. Over €300 million in funding will be available through my Department for the delivery of the Programme over the current programming period. The RDP is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation; improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">In the context of support for rural communities including those involved in TidyTowns initiatives, funding can be provided for the upgrade, maintenance and development of community areas and amenities in eligible towns and villages. A large number of TidyTowns initiatives have already received funding from the LEADER elements of the RDP since it commenced in 2009 and the level of funding commitment to these kinds of initiatives is significant. If any individual or community group wishes to find out more about these funding opportunities they should contact their Local Action Group (LEADER Company), the contact details can be found on my Department's website<i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2337">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  The guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in relation to entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  Inquiries in this regard should be directed to the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_2398">Measures that have been put in place in my Department to monitor and manage sick leave include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">On foot of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 09 of 2010, which provides for a general framework for the management of sick leave, my Department prepared and issued Sick Leave Guidelines to give clear guidelines to managers on effectively managing staff sick leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">Staff at HEO level and equivalent grades have recently completed Human Resources Training for line managers, which included practical examples and practical guidance on attendance management.  This training is now being extended to staff at Assistant Principal Officer level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">My Department has systems in place for the monitoring and recording of sick leave absences with a particular focus and appropriate follow-up action on uncertified/ certified sick leave thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">Staff that are absent for more than four weeks are routinely referred to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and  long term absentees must also receive CMO clearance to return to work.  My Department regularly liaises with the CMO on how best to manage difficult cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2403">My Department's Employee Assistance Officer is available to give support and advice on all matters including sick leave a confidential basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer who is available to assist staff with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">The total number of sick leave days taken by staff in my Department in 2011 was 7,304 and the cost of absenteeism was approximately €1.236 million in 2011. For 2012, the most up to date figures available are for the first quarter (January to March 2012).  Over this period the total number of sick leave days taken by staff was 1,623 days with a total cost of approximately €270,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_2410">The position is that Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements, including rights of way. Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, contained specific provisions in respect of easements acquired by prescription, i.e. acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned. It originally provided that such an easement would be acquired at law only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964 which simplify the procedures for acquiring easements based on prescription. They were drafted in consultation with the Law Society and the Property Registration Authority (PRA).</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">The amendments permit the PRA to register such an easement without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 where it is satisfied that there is an entitlement to it. Where the PRA is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, such as where there is disagreement between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 will continue to be required. This is similar to the procedure which applies in respect of applications for registration of title based on adverse possession of the land.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">The rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2011 (S.I. No. 559 of 2011) which are available on the PRA web site (ww.prai.ie).  The procedures to be followed are set out in a Practice Direction entitled ‘Registration of Easements and Profits a Prendre acquired by Prescription under Section 49A' which is also available on the website.</p>

An increase in the opening hours of Malin Garda station would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.</p>

            <p eId="para_2422">During the Second Stage debate on the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which concluded on 23rd February, I recalled to the House the decision taken in May 2011 not to proceed with the appointment of a Legal Services Ombudsman.  This is because the oversight model proposed in the Legal Services Ombudsman Act of 2009 does not meet this Government's policy commitment to greater independence in the regulation of the legal professions. The Legal Services Regulation Bill, therefore, sets out an alternative and more independent supervisory regime. These provisions are also part of our national EU/IMF/ECB undertakings in support of structural reform, greater competitiveness and early economic recovery. The new regulatory system to deal with the legal sector will take the form of an independently appointed and operated Legal Services Regulatory Authority; independent  procedures to deal with complaints of professional misconduct, and the establishment of an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. The Bill also provides for a more modern, consumer-friendly and transparent legal costs regime under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take-over the existing functions of the Office of the Taxing-Master. With the establishment of this alternative regulatory regime to meet current Government policy the Legal Services Ombudsman Act of 2009 will be repealed. Committee Stage of the Legal Services Regulation Bill is expected to take place after the summer recess.</p>

            <p eId="para_2521">The person concerned and her two children had their permission to remain in the State extended for a three year period, until 14 August 2013.  This decision was conveyed to the person concerned and her son, who is a minor,  by letter dated 4 August 2010. The daughter of the person concerned was also notified of leave to remain in a separate letter dated 4 August 2010.  This communication advised the person concerned and her daughter of the conditions attaching to their permission to remain and of the requirement that they attend at their local Garda Registration Office to have the registration process completed. One of these conditions is that the persons concerned must each be in possession of a valid passport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">The person concerned and her son registered with their local Garda Registration office and had their leave to remained renewed up to 14 August 2013. The daughter of the person concerned did not produce a valid passport and therefore could not register and was asked to return with a valid passport in order to register. It appears that she has not completed the registration process to date and it is recommended that she should attend her local Garda Registration Office with a valid passport, without further delay so that the registration process can be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2533">I am informed by the Garda authorities that when a fixed charge notice is issued to a motorist for an alleged speeding offence all necessary information is contained thereon.  The image of the offending vehicle's registration plate is included on the notice.

            <p eId="para_2534">As the Deputy will be aware, the relevant road traffic legislation, for which my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible, provides that the recipient of a fixed charge notice has the option of paying the fixed charge or allowing the matter to proceed to be dealt with by the courts, where, on conviction, a person may be liable to a fine and additional penalty points.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">I am also informed that excessive or inappropriate speeding continues to be a significant contributory factor in fatal and serious injury collisions. In that regard, safety cameras only operate on sections of road which have a history of collisions occurring where speed was a contributory factor. The locations of these speed enforcement zones are in the public domain and are available on the Garda website. Surveys are conducted on an ongoing basis to ensure the appropriate deployment of safety cameras on our roads.</p>

Full pay during properly certified sick absence may be allowed up to a maximum of six months in one year and half pay thereafter subject to a maximum of 12 months sick leave in any period of four years or less.  For the purposes of calculating the periods of sick leave on full and half pay, six months and 12 months are, where sick absence is not continuous, reckoned as 183 days and 365 days respectively, including Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays falling within a period of sick leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">Sick leave for single or two day absences, in total not exceeding seven days in any period of 12 months, may be granted without medical certificate.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_473">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_2542">The Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement is facilitating a major change and transformation programme across the Justice and Equality sector.  Overall, services have been maintained while the numbers employed across the Vote Group for which I am responsible have fallen from 24,768 at end 2009 to the current Employment Control Framework (ECF) target of 22,610.  In addition, the Agreement has, against the backdrop of substantial pay cuts in the public service, helped to maintain industrial peace in the Justice and Equality sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">The Implementation Body on the Public Service Agreement, in its recently published second Progress Report, confirmed that the following tangible results have been delivered across the Justice and Equality sector.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2544">An Garda Síochána:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2545">Operational services being  maintained while numbers of gardaí were reduced by 7.7% from 14,753 to 13,622 during the first two years of the Agreement. New roster arrangements, the first significant change in 40 years, were rolled out on a national basis from 30 April 2012. The new arrangements match the supply of Garda personnel to peak demand for services, particularly at weekends.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2546">A new performance management system has been developed for An Garda Síochána and piloting of the new system commenced in January 2012.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2547">Civilianisation initiatives were progressed to free up gardaí for front-line duties. These include the deployment of civilian staff to the Garda Communications Centre and the launch of a pilot project at Dublin Airport with civilian staff  from the Irish Naturalisation and  Immigration Service (INIS) deployed to Dublin Airport to  carry out certain immigration control functions.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2548">Non-pay savings of €24 million were achieved through changed working practices, outsourcing of repair and maintenance of the Garda fleet and other administrative efficiencies.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2549">Irish Prison Service:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2550">A joint task review of all institutions and services in the prison system has been substantially completed under the Agreement. The implementation of the findings of the reviews in each institution and service is ongoing and has facilitated the reduction in required staffing levels across the prison estate by 326 during the first two years of the agreement. This reduction in staff has taken place while service activity levels have been maintained, and improved in the case of prisoner regimes.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2551">The redeployment of almost 140 highly trained prison clerical and administration Officers into more front-line roles within the Prison Service is underway.  These Officers will be replaced in their clerical and administration duties by a new grade of Prison Administration and Support Officers, recruited from currently serving Civil Servants in other areas of the Civil Service at a significantly reduced cost.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2552">A reform of prison structures and management is currently taking place involving the merging of eight separate prisons into three Prison Campus structures in the Mountjoy Campus (Mountjoy Prison, St Patrick's Institution, the Dóchas Centre and the Training Unit), the West Dublin Campus (Cloverhill and Wheatfield prisons) and the Portlaoise Campus (Portlaoise and Midlands prisons). These structures will deliver significant savings in terms of reduced management structure and shared service delivery across a number of prisons. A review of the management structures across all other prisons is currently taking place to facilitate the identification of further efficiencies.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2553">Non-pay savings of €6.5 million were achieved by the Prison Service through the reconfiguration of canteen and cleaning services, the implementation of a new prisoner phone system and efficiencies in procurement.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2554">Courts Service:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2555">Front-line court sittings have been prioritised and maintained while implementing staffing reductions of 11% since 2009.  87% of Courts Service staff are now deployed to front-line roles.  In this context to date under the agreement combined court offices have been established in eight counties while three stand-alone offices have been closed.  The Courts Service Board has taken decisions to close 16 court venues over the past year.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2556">Digital Audio Recording is now being operated by staff in all court jurisdictions.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2557">Five County Registrars have been appointed as Vice chairs of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2558">Non pay savings of €0.9 million were achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2559">In addition, several cross-sectoral initiatives are achieving savings and producing efficiencies. These include: the production by the Probation Service of "same day" Community Service and pre-sanction reports; increased use of video-link between the Courts and Prisons reducing the need for the Gardaí and Prison Service to transport persons in custody to and from court and work has commenced on the introduction of a pre-trial procedure with a view to introduction on a pilot basis in two Circuits from this coming October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">The Department and agencies in the sector are also utilising technology, rationalising structures and re-organising work practices as part of their Implementation Plans. is yielded  non-pay savings of approximately €6.8 million including savings achieved by INIS of €2.4 million through changed work practices and other efficiencies and savings of €3.6 million in the direct provision system for asylum seekers through increased efficiencies and contract negotiation. At the same time, additional workloads associated with the introduction of new Citizenship ceremonies require flexibility from staff including weekend working when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">The Implementation Plans of the Department and of all the agencies in the sector together with progress reports are published on their websites. My Department has set up a Programme Office, centrally located in the Department, to co-ordinate these plans in order to drive reform in a cohesive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2562">Overall, considerable progress has been made and  I am satisfied with the pace of reform but I share the Implementation Body's conclusion that the pace of change must now be accelerated. My Department is increasingly focused on maximising interagency co-operation where that has the potential to achieve savings and ensuring that modern management practices and communications technologies are fully exploited to get the best return on expenditure not only from agencies themselves but from the system as a whole.  Later this year I intend to publish a White Paper on Crime which will incorporate a National Anti-Crime Strategy with a view to putting in place a policy direction and framework for tackling crime.  The Strategy will promote an integrated approach to criminal justice and will be focused on the transformation agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_2566">As with previous rounds of consolidation under the Defence Forces modernisation programme, barracks once vacated are being disposed of with the proceeds being used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.    Since the announcement of the Government decision on barrack closures my Department has written to each Government Department and various agencies and local authorities seeking expressions of interest in acquiring any of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2567">As a result I can confirm that agreement has been reached with Mayo County Council for the purchase of Mitchell Barracks Castlebar. The Council has already taken over the property under a caretaker agreement pending full completion of the necessary legal paperwork to complete the transfer of Title. There have also been discussions between officials from my Department and a number of other State agencies in relation to the sale of Kickham Barracks Clonmel, and Cavan however these discussions are still ongoing. Some discussion has also taken place in relation to Mullingar Barracks however no substantial progress has been made towards achieving a sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">The retaining of Mullingar Barracks by my Department, completing necessary works, administering multiple leases and fulfilling the many responsibilities of a landlord would put a significant administrative and financial burden on my Department. Given the current resources available and the need to provide investment funding for the development of the Defence Forces I do not feel that the multiple leasing arrangement proposed is feasible and does not meet the purpose of the lands disposal programme as outlined in the White Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">I can assure you that every effort will be made to dispose of the barracks so as to maximize the benefits to the local community.</p>

            <p eId="para_2571">The procedures for managing absences due to the ill health of staff are governed by a range of circulars issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in particular circular 9/10 on the Management of Sick Leave in the Civil Service.  Under the circular, line managers are required to play a proactive role in managing sick leave in their areas and in engaging with their staff on absences due to ill health.     All absences due to ill health are recorded on the HR database, HRMS, and are routinely monitored and managed as appropriate, in conjunction with the Office of the Chief Medical Officer.  Since the introduction of circular 9/10, the sick leave rates for the Department have fallen from 5.5% in 2010 to 4.2% in 2011.  The number of days lost to ill health and the related value is set out as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_2582">Under the<i>Public Service Agreement 2010-2014</i>, detailed action plans have been developed by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to underpin the change and reform process envisaged by the agreement.  The Action Plans were first developed in October 2010 and later iterations of the Action Plans reflect the outcomes of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review and the Government’s Public Service Reform Plan Action. The Action Plans are available on the Department’s website at <i>www.defence.ie</i>.   In accordance with Paragraph 1.16 of the Public Service Agreement, the Agreement’s Implementation Body conducted its Second Annual Review of the savings and progress being achieved on implementing the Action Plans in each sector.  The review period for this exercise was the 12 month period 1st April 2011 to 31 March 2012. </p>
            <p eId="para_2583">The Defence Sector Reports have now been published on the Implementation Body and Department websites. In this regard, a total of €16.4 million has been saved by a range of measures in year two of the Plan including a significant reorganisation and restructuring of the Defence Forces within the reduced numbers and funding; redeployment of over 1,250 military personnel across the organisation; the closure of four barracks leading to an estimated efficiency gain of €5 million, and additional annual savings of €1.3 million in respect of utilities, security duty allowance and maintenance; and the introduction of merit based systems of promotion at all levels. In addition to savings achieved in the Defence sector, the Department also achieved savings of €2.2million in year two on the civil side of the Department through reduction in civilian employee staffing numbers, restructuring and changes in work practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">The Department is fully committed at all levels to implementing the Croke Park agreement, both as part of the Civil Service sector and in relation to the Defence sector. I can confirm for the Deputy that all officials, representative associations and unions in the Defence Sector are fully apprised of the crucial importance of delivery of all actions in our Action Plans. A high priority has been accorded to driving and monitoring the implementation of required savings and efficiencies. Specific measures planned for 2012 include high level proposals such as the extensive reorganisation of the Defence Forces to reduce the number of Brigades from three to two, the completion of the process of barrack closures and redeployment of personnel, and the implementation of a Medical Review to deliver more efficient medical services. These reforms are an ongoing collective challenge in the period ahead and will continue to be monitored by reference to the Defence Sector Action Plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_2751">I have received strong representations from the dairy industry highlighting the possible effects that a ban on the advertising of cheese would have, and which some believe is based on a flawed nutrient profiling model.  I have written to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and outlined the issues involved from the point of view of the Irish agri-food sector.  However, I must point out that the BAI is an independent body and I have no function or role in its activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2753">The purpose of the changes announced to the 2012 Terms and Conditions of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is to achieve the required savings, prompted by the budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme being reduced to from €220 million to €190 million. However, in order to make these savings, it is proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria, rather than simply apply an across-the-board cut, either by reducing the maximum payable area, or reducing the rates of aid payable, or by a combination of both.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">Choosing to opt for the technical adjustments ensures that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community;</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">To maintain the countryside;</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2758">By virtue of the Scheme being part of our 2007/2013 Rural Development Programme, it was necessary that the proposed changes to the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme be formally submitted to the EU Commission for their approval. This process initially involves informal contact at official level, following which a formal written submission is made. On receipt of the submission, the Commission invites the views of the various relevant EU Directorates, who each must assess the proposals in so far as their specific remits are concerned. My officials, in a recent bi-lateral meeting with their EU Commission counter-parts, again outlined, in detail, the logic underpinning the proposals. As agreed at that meeting, a further detailed submission (which had formed the basis of the bi-lateral discussions) was then forwarded to the Commission Services. It is expected that the Commission response will be forthcoming within the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2804">The food and beverage sectors operate in a global marketplace where volatility has become more prevalent in recent years.  Over the last two years, the value of Irish food and drink exports has increased by €1.8 billion or 25%, according to Bord Bia, due to high global market prices and also increased demand both in previously existing and in new markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">Factors influencing exports from Ireland include currency exchange rates for the Euro against sterling and the US dollar, availability of credit and increases in supply or demand in key production regions.  Global prices have reduced in 2012 for some commodities, including milk powder and some cereals.  In addition, economic challenges in some of our key export markets may lead to reduced demand for Irish produce over the year as a whole.    However, beef is performing well, the dairy sector is actively pursuing new markets and the drinks sector is maintaining its previous success.  Overall, while recognising the challenging global market conditions,  I am hopeful that our agri-food exports in 2012 will once gain perform strongly.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_490">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2813">The structured framework provided by the Croke Park Action Plan has been instrumental in achieving significant saving in administrative expenditure by the Department while maintaining and improving service quality. These savings have centred on a reduction in staff numbers and overtime, local office reorganisation, improved work practices, centralisation of procurement, increased use of shared services, the promotion of on-line services and a reduction of inspection costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">In the past three years the Department's staff numbers have reduced by 550 or 14%. In the same period the Department's non-commercial state agencies saw a reduction in staff numbers of 224 or 12%. Overtime payments have reduced by some 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2815">Some of the major factors facilitating staff and administrative saving in the Department arise from the local office reorganisation project. This project involved the comprehensive restructuring of the Department's public office network, the closure of 42 offices and their replacement by 16 enhanced regional offices.  Saving arising from this initiative, as calculated and independently verified by Grant Thornton, amount to €79.6 million to end of March 2012 —€61.9 million of which is attributable since the beginning of the Croke Park Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2816">The Department conducted a detailed review of its procurement procedures, which was subsequently validated by Accenture. As a consequence of this review the Department established a Central Procurement Unit which will monitor and advise on procurement expenditure and ensure procurement throughout the Department is conducted in a co-ordinated and strategic manner and achieves optimum value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_2817">The Department is now providing a range of shared services facilities including: full ICT infrastructure support to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and different levels of ICT shared services to Teagasc, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency. The Department has also agreed to provide the Department of the Taoiseach with a new ICT service on a shared services basis and has carried out a range of inspections for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">The number of on-line Single Payment Scheme applications has increased from 43,465 in 2010 to 54, 372 in 2011, an increase of 25%. The Department has introduced on-line mapping into its 2012 iNet release — allowing farmers or their agents to submit maps on-line thereby giving immediate effect to amendments and dispensing with the need to submit papers maps.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">The Department has designated its Management Services Division to lead its response to public sector reform, specifically to monitor, drive and report on the Department's PSA Action Plan and to lead and co-ordinate the Department's response to, and participation in, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform led initiatives arising from the Public Sector Reform Plan. In addition, progress on the Departments PSA Action Plan is monitored on a quarterly basis by an internal implementation steering group chaired by the SG.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">The Department is committed to a process of ongoing reforms which include Teagasc rationalisation which, when completed, will see the number of its advisory offices reduce from 91 to 51, improved staff attendance patterns, further non-pay savings arising from procurement efficiencies and further efficiencies arising from a programme for increased staff flexibility, and a continued programme of internal reviews. To date such reviews have been instrumental in reducing staffing levels from 4,800 in 2005 to just over 3,500 currently — a reduction of 27% while the cost of running the Department has fallen by €60 million or approximately 20% since 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">Finally, the continuing development of on-line service is targeted at increasing AIM uptake among herd owners from 12,500 to 25,000 by 2014 and to increase SPS uptake among applicants by 25% in the same period.</p>

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_491">
            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_2826">I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 to 241, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">Since the commencement of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 all recognised schools are obliged to submit an Annual Attendance Report to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) on the levels of school attendance each year. An overall analysis and reportderived from this data is produced by the Education Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the NEWB.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">The Deputy may be aware that I launched the publication of the most recent data for the 2009/2010 school year on 7th June 2012. This is the sixth in a series of reports based on data collected by the NEWB on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools through the Annual Attendance Report. Data for the years 2003/04 through to 2008/09 are the focus of earlier reports which can be used to monitor the levels of attendance, expulsions and suspensions across all of the country's primary and post-primary schools. The latest report deals with data for the academic year 2009/10 and links to the data reported previously. These reports are available in full on the website of the NEWB at<i>www.newb.ie</i>  and will provide the Deputy with access to the information sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">I am advised by the Board that data is not collated in such a way as to allow all the breakdowns requested. Specifically, information is not published below county level as the Board is prohibited under the Education Act, 1998 from producing information that may identify individual schools and lead to the formulation of league tables.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">Combating the issues underlying poor attendance requires concerted action and close collaboration among schools, school support services and other stakeholders involved with children, young people and their families. The complex issue of school attendance has been the subject of significant policy attention in recent decades and was addressed systematically in the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. This Act established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) in 2002 — mandating it with supervising and implementing the provisions of the Act to effectively ensure that "<i>each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education”</i>. The legislation establishes a framework for promoting regular school attendance, participation and retention as well as tackling the manifold problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. In particular, the NEWB has a key role in responding to instances where children are not attending school regularly, or where there is concern about a child’s educational welfare. The Act also charges the NEWB with responsibility to maintain a register of children who are being educated outside of recognised schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">Since mid-2009 the Board has an expanded remit which includes responsibility for the Home School Community Liaison scheme and the School Completion Programme in addition to the Educational Welfare Service. Under the extended remit, the Board is obliged to devise and implement a single strategic approach to school attendance, participation and retention. The integration process has been firmly centred upon the requirement to build a unified education support service guided and informed by research evidence, policy and the experience of teachers, parents, students, service staff and communities. The Board is planning to commence implementation of an integrated practice framework and case management system based on the principle of "<i>One Child, One Team, One Plan</i>” for the coming academic year (September 2012). This integrated service model is designed to respond to the complexity of issues that impact on school attendance, participation and retention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">From the analysis of the most recent data available the Board reports a number of positive developments which reflect an enhanced focus on school attendance and retention:</p>
            <p eId="para_2833">There has been the highest annual attendance returns ever to the NEWB from schools in 2009/10:  97% from Primary and 96%   from Post Primary;</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">In 09-10 69,471 days less   than 08-09 have been lost through student absences (on a % comparison);</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">The numbers of student days lost in 09/10 (taking primary and post primary schools together) is running at 6.8% and is at the lower end for the five year period 2005 to 2010;</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">The percentage of students who sit the Leaving Certificate overall has risen by more than 6% to 87.7% in eight years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">The progress being achieved demonstrates an important return on the State's investment as we know that, for every child diverted from early school leaving and towards higher educational achievement there are considerable long-term social and economic benefits. Although absenteeism reduced in 2009/2010 the number of children who miss school each day remains a significant cause for concern and identifies the need for a sustained and focussed approach to supporting student attendance, participation and retention. Therefore, we must ensure that available resources continue to be effectively targeted at those most at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2838">The Deputy may also wish to note that the National Educational Welfare Board has initiated a National Attendance Awards programme this year which acknowledges the outstanding achievement of so many children who have excellent attendance in schools all around the country. It is also an endeavour to acknowledge the massive contribution of schools and parents in supporting children to make school a priority. In addition, the Board is working to produce Guidelines for Schools on the Development of Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. Formal guidance will provide clarity to schools in terms of responsibilities under the Act and practical support towards enabling children to maximise their attendance, participation and retention in schools. This is a significant piece of work which draws on the experience and knowledge of a range of expertise and will be available to schools in the next academic year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2840">The Independent Child Death Review Group has highlighted in its report what it considers to be the restrictive nature of the in camera rule and the fact that court proceedings relating to child welfare and protection cases are held in private.  The Review Group has called for a review of the operation of the rule.</p>
            <p eId="para_2841">I believe there is scope for more transparency in this area.  We need to put in place a mechanism which will ensure that the learning from such cases is shared across the system in order to improve services, while continuing to protect minor's interests and maintain anonymity.  This would also allow the public to gain some insight into how the child protection system operates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2842">With this in mind it is my intention to bring forward new regulations, following consultation with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Courts Service, to allow access to child welfare and protection proceedings for the purpose of reporting on such proceedings.

            <p eId="para_2844">A total of €1.7m has been allocated by my Department to support the provision of youth cafés, to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">The first tranche of funding was provided over 2010-11 under a dedicated competitive scheme operated for my Department by Pobal.  As a result of that scheme a total of €1.5m was allocated for a specific measure to support the provision of Youth Café facilities in Ireland and a total of 64 projects were approved for funding in two strands.  Strand 1 provided larger scale funding for the establishment of 16 brand new youth café facilities, which have been gradually coming on stream.  Strand 2 provided small-scale funding for upgrades to a further 48 existing youth cafés.  An additional €200,000 was made available by my Department in December 2011 to support a further 18 youth projects in providing or maintaining youth cafés facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2846">My Department estimates that between 75-100 youth café facilities now operate across the State.  These facilities are proving hugely beneficial to local communities in terms of broader engagement with young people.  In addition, my Department supports a range of youth services and volunteer-led youth groups which offer similar resources and spaces for young people locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2847">The distribution of the 2012 capital funding available for youth projects including youth cafés, is under consideration at present.  I expect to announce plans for the distribution of this funding in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2849">Two out-of-hours pilot projects, one in Donegal and the other in Cork, were commenced by the HSE in 2011.  The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin.  The outcome of this assessment process will inform further decisions in the coming months on progression to a national out-of-hours service model.  Clearly whatever model emerges will need to address the challenges of varying demographic demands in both rural and urban settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">What is important is that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24-hour social work assistance and this is what the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and I are working towards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">It should be noted that at present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2852">The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years.  The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow).  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours, i.e., gardaí, hospital and ambulance service personnel.  Outside the greater Dublin area, the HSE operates an Emergency Place of Safety Service whereby gardaí can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours.  This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  As part of this service gardaí have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2854">Procedures for the management of sick leave in my Department are in accordance with Department of Finance circulars, in particular Circulars 25/78 and 09/2010.  These arrangements recognise that staff may from time to time encounter challenges to their health and well-being and that management of sick leave must be done in a fair and consistent manner with the objective of addressing the cause of the sick leave and ensuring regular attendance.  Managers' responsibilities under these circulars include: Being clear on the subject of attendance expectations; Ensuring an efficient and effective workplace culture; Assisting in the maintenance of a motivational atmosphere; Maintaining supportive contact with officers on sick leave and conducting sick leave review meetings as appropriate on their return to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">Staff are obliged to provide regular and effective service and have a responsibility for their own sick leave and in particular adherence to the sick leave regulations. They must also: Comply with all office instructions regarding health and safety; Be familiar and comply with the sick leave regulations/policy; Maintain regular contact with the Department during periods of sick absence; Take all reasonable measures where possible to manage health and well-being with a view to returning to full health; and Co-operate fully with all rehabilitative measures to facilitate an early return to work.  In general, full pay during properly certified sick absence, provided there is no evidence of permanent disability for service, may be allowed up to a maximum of six months in one year and half pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of twelve month's sick leave in any period of four years or less.  Sick leave for single or two-day absences, in total not exceeding seven days in any period of twelve months, may be granted without medical certificate.  Management information systems are in place to to record, monitor and analyse patterns of sick leave.  Failure to comply with the sick leave regulations in considered as serious misconduct and the disciplinary code may be invoked.  Abuse of sick leave arrangements may lead to penalties including withholding salary increments, withdrawal of sick leave privileges and ultimately dismissal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">Repeated short term absences are carefully monitored and may be referred to the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service (CMO).  The CMO's office incorporates the Civil Service Occupational Health Department (CSOHD) and all long term absences, defined as an absence greater than four weeks duration, are also forwarded to the CSOHD for review.  This office provides advice on medical fitness for work as well as any work modifications or interventions that will facilitate an early return to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2857">During 2011, a total of 1,155 days were lost in my Department due to absence with an associated cost estimated at €0.188 million.  To date in 2012, 741 days have been lost due to absence at an estimated cost of €0.140 million.</p>

I note the participation of various organisations in the group and I support their objective of reducing anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">There are 52 clinics within the four Dublin Local Authority Areas of which only six are city centre based.  The city centre clinics cater for 1,082 people, which is less than a quarter of the overall Dublin figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">I fully support the development of services in local communities, particularly through GP involvement, but I would point out that 85% of those availing of services in the Dublin city centre clinics are from the local area.  Some concentration of services in the city centre is needed as some people wish to avail of services outside their local area.  This is the norm in other EU countries.  One of the city centre based services is the Drug Treatment Centre Board.  It fulfils a more national role in relation to drug treatment generally and also treats people with more complex problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">HSE clinics, as well as a number of voluntary service providers, have "good neighbour" policies and protocols in place and a strong focus on inter-agency working.  Some provide a range of outreach and drop-in services to encourage engagement with a view to moving more people into treatment.  CCTV is used at some centres to monitor movements and as an aid in deterring anti-social behaviour.  Drug treatment centres work closely with An Garda Síochána with the aim of minimising any potential problems.</p>

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies, mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a nine month maximum wait time for in-patient or day case surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2902">As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_2910">Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) GP Capitation Contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.</p>
            <p eId="para_2911">General Practitioners (GPs) who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2912">(a)  assist in the process of diagnosing a patient; or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2913">(b)  monitor a diagnosed condition;</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2915">At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in respect of services such as phlebotomy and advised them that charges should not be applied for such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2916">The HSE is encouraging eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2917">It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2918">The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and other such services will be considered as part of the new contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_2958">The Implementation Body for the Public Service Agreement (PSA) 2010-2014 recently published its second annual report outlining its assessment of progress in the second year of the Agreement.  This report is available on the Body's website,<i>www.implementationbody.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">The Report notes that the PSA has enabled health service delivery to be maintained against a backdrop of reduced budgets and staff numbers and in the face of accelerating demand for such services.  It also noted that there had been a net reduction of 2,855 staff (WTE) between April 2011 and March 2012, while in the acute hospitals improved procedures and productivity measures had enabled overall inpatient and day-case activity to be maintained at or above planned levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">I acknowledge and welcome the improvements in productivity being delivered by health service staff through the PSA in relation, for example, to staff redeployment, streamlining of management structures including clinical management roles, and changes in skill mix.  However, further progress must continue to be made.  The 2012 Health Sector Action Plan contains a concise and focused set of objectives aimed at meeting the commitments in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 and facilitating the implementation of the Government's reform plans for the health sector.  It requires an acceleration of changes to ensure that all essential services are protected.  It also includes priority changes for particular disciplines including Consultants, Nurses and Allied Health Professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">My own Department has made significant changes in how it does its business in order to continue to deliver its objectives with significantly reduced staff. Structures, reporting lines, and the distribution of responsibilities have been significantly adjusted to allow us to do more with less.  This is continuing on an ongoing basis as numbers continue to fall and demands increase.  We have also strengthened the management of staff performance and of absenteeism, and have reviewed arrangements for cross-stream reporting in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">The Integrated Progress Report on the Action Plan for the 12 month period to 31 March 2012 for my Department and its agencies is on my Department's website,<i>www.dohc.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">The Government's health reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing.  Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, substantial progress has been made and the programme is on schedule.</p>

            <p eId="para_2969">While I have responsibility for Road Traffic legislation, traffic management is a matter for the local authorities and An Garda Síochána.
